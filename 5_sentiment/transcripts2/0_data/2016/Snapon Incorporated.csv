As usual, I'll give you my perspective on the results and the environment, and on our progress. And after that, Aldo will move in to a more detailed review of the financials. 
The Snap-On fourth quarter. Organic sales up and profits well above last year. The period continues our positive trajectory of performance. Again, this quarter, we had opportunities and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities and we overcame the headwinds. Organic sales grew 3.1%. If we include the impacts of 33 -- $33.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, overall sales in the quarter were $851.7 million, a small decrease from last year. Our EPS was $2.22, up 12.7% from the $1.97 in 2014, and that rise reflects an operating opco operating margin of 19.1%, an increase of 220 basis points. Financial Service earnings of $45 million in the quarter were also up, leading to a consolidated margin, including both financial services and opco of 22.7%, an improvement of 230 basis points. 
The results were encouraging. Our markets, the automotive repair-related segments, they continue to be favorable, changing technologies and aging vehicles requiring new tools and more repairs. Our Tools Group and our Repair Systems and Information, or the RS&I group, took advantage of those opportunities and grew across our franchise network and with repair shop owners and managers. 
Now for our Commercial & Industrial Group, or our C&I group. Markets were mixed. Headwind's a bit more pronounced in the quarter, impacted by few down sectors and macro economically challenged geographies, leading to organic volume just under 2014. A couple of those difficult environments were natural resources in the U.S. Military, both substantially lower in the fourth quarter. 
Oil and gas. A market we've identified as a long-term strategic growth opportunity for us, and we continue to see it that way. But in the quarter, we experienced similarly to those businesses with more prominent exposure in that arena and we saw a deep decline. 
The military sales. Ongoing drawdowns and budget restraints led to a substantial year-over-year drop, but we continue to maintain our presence in that segment and we're poised to increase our position when the variability subsides. 
C&I's also the most international of businesses and was also challenged in the quarter by economic turbulence across the globe in some of the European markets and in parts of Asia Pacific. That said, C&I progressed through the quarterly headwinds, taking advantage of the opportunities and critical industries, like aviation and in national markets, like Japan and Germany and Mexico and emerging markets, like India and Indonesia. 
So overall, our businesses, I would characterize -- overall across our businesses, I would characterize our markets as mixed. We have tailwinds in automotive repair and we have pockets of turbulence in some afflicted critical industries and in challenged geographies. Having said that, we believe that our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the possibilities, opportunities that do exist along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding with Snap-On's presence, with repair shop owners and managers, extending into critical industry and building on emerging markets. These strategic initiatives we see as decisive for our future, and we'll continue to strengthen our position along those runways as we go forward. 
And looking ahead -- and also looking ahead, we also see clear runways for improvement. Snap-On Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, driving significant progress and our fourth quarter and our full year results confirm those ongoing improvement possibilities. 
Let's speak about the full year. Snap-On's EPS in 2015 was $8.10, an increase of 13.4%. Driving those earnings was an opco earnings margin of 17.7%, up 140 basis points for the full year. And when we include the income from Financial Services of $170.2 million, which rose $21.1 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation in the year was 21.3%, up 170 basis points. That performance came on sales for the year of $3.4 billion, reflecting a 7.1% organic increase, broad growth. Tools Group, up 10.9%. RS&I increasing 4.9%. C&I rising 5.8%. All performances in the year reflecting significant advances down our runways for growth and for improvement. 
Now let's move to the groupies and their fourth quarter results. 
C&I. Sales were down in the period 5.5% from 2014, impacted by 490 basis points of unfavorable currency. Organic sales were slightly lower than last year, with varied results across the group. Gains by SNA Europe, our Europe enhance tools business and the power tools operation, and decreases at the industrial division. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.9 billion -- $49.1 million, that represents an operating margin of 14.9%, a rise of 130 basis points. Encouragingly, SNA Europe posted a sales increase again in the midst of significant European headwinds. Continuing its progress now 9 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth, and the profit rising even higher. Now, up 11 straight quarters, reflecting RCI and Snap-On Value Creation, new products and new processes, positive trends in some difficult geographies. Also, in C&I, our power tools division advances in the period, bolstered by an array of new products. Innovations like our CD-R 8815, 18-volt lifting cordless  we have launched in the quarter. It's our latest in the line of cordless tools, an oversized variable speed trigger, less finger stress and more accurate torque cultural. A heavy duty gearbox reducing operating wobble in run out important for power tools. A precision single suite keyless with carbide, increasing gripping torque and enabling one-handed bit changes, a nice time saver professional. And all those features contained in a powerful to combat design. With the CD-R 8815, we believe we have a winner and the early results confirm it. 
Now the industrial division had weaker sales in the quarter, as we mentioned, and there were difficulties in military and oil and gas. That said, we've maintained our growth strategies of extending in critical industries, even during this turbulence. We remain committed to ongoing advancements made possible by Snap-On Value Creation, especially in customer connection and innovation, offering new products specifically aimed at customers facing critical challenges. 
One of those new products designed for the natural resource sector is the Snap-On gas meter range. Custom engineer for safer and more efficient service of gas meters, rugged and lightweight, with an aviation grade aluminum body, 5 interchangeable heads for maximum versatility and a 19-inch handle to more easily generate the full range of force required. Over 500,000 gas meters are replaced annually in New York City area alone and 20% to 30% of all injuries in the utility sector are attributed to the gas meter service. This innovative new Snap-On ranch was guided by customer connection, direct observation of the work and it includes  an improved ergonomic design for better grip and less hand stress and, of course, it incorporates our Snap-On flank driver wrenching system, eliminating slippage and requiring less force to complete the job. It's more versatile. It ends the need for a technician to carry a heavy bag of assorted pipe wrenches and it's safer and more effective. We believe the Snap-On gas meter wrench will be a big seller, a must-have for service technicians throughout the power generation industry. It's just another example, another example of customer connection and innovation strengthening the C&I position in critical industries. 
Now onto the Tools Group. An 8.7% rise on organic sales, an encouraging increase again this quarter. The operating earnings of $71.9 million represented a margin rate of 17.5%, up 100 basis points from last year. And that gain included a 70 basis impact from negative currency. 
We speak quite a bit about the runways for coherent growth. Strategic avenues of sales advancement and clearly, large among those opportunities is enhancing the franchise network. The Tools Group once again demonstrated significant progress along that runway. You can see it vividly in the financial numbers for the quarter and full the full year, and it's evident on the health metrics we monitor each period, whether its franchise profitability, turnover or delinquencies. The measures of franchise held are all trending upward and that speaks to the growing strength and to the widening advantage, the widening advantage of our band network in the robust vehicle repair arena. 
But beyond the numbers, this qualitative, but clearly observable, evidence of forward momentum. I can tell you that the franchisees at our fourth quarter national franchise advisory council and more recently, at the 2016 kickoff events held earlier last month, demonstrated enthusiasm and confirmed the optimism that has marked the Tools Group from route to route for some time now. 
And as more evidence, we continue to be recognized as the franchise of choice. Again, this year, Snap-On ranked among the top 25 on entrepreneur magazine's list of top 500 franchises. And the franchise business for you, which collects franchisees satisfaction feedback, listed Snap-On as a top 50 franchise in its latest ranking, marking the ninth consecutive year we received that award. It also goes without saying that the Tools Group's performance would not have been possible without the benefits of Snap-On Value Creation. Particularly, innovation and customer connection creating an assortment of exciting new products, born from our unique customer interactions. And for the sixth straight year, the Tools Group increased its number of hit products, million dollar sellers to develop from that direct customer observation, from our on-site experience in the workplace. Let's consider the -- our new SP BF series of striking prybar's. An upgrade in performance and durability and most importantly, in safety. These next-generation tools include a precision ground blade  with angled design for maximum lift. It also features a new grip material, which performs in extremely low temperatures, important place like Chicago today, and has greater resistance to common shop chemicals. And it's got a new -- or it features a new ergonomic handle that not only levers a more comfortable grip, but the flared design provides technician hands greatly improved protection from off-center hit. Not a small feature. It's an exceptional design made possible from customer connection and it represents progress, even in a long established product line. 
Finally, I'd be missing a huge contributor to our van channel and a major strategic advantage if I didn't mention Snap-On Credit. Financing the network's big ticket items. And as you would expect the credit operation was represented at our kickoff meetings -- at our recent kickoff meetings held in the first part of the year and they were working to increase the power of credit and making our franchise operations -- making our finance operations and even greater strategic contributor. Snap-On is wielding its tools network more effectively every day. And the support of our credit company is a major element in that progress. 
Moving to RS&I. Sales in the fourth quarter were $280.6 million, with organic gains of 2.2%, reflecting a rise in diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, a low single-digit increase to OEM dealerships and essentially flat sales of undercar equipment. Operating earnings of $72.1 million rose $6.9 million. And the OI margin, it was 25.7%, up 260 basis points from last year's 23.1%, with RCI paving the way. RS&I advanced in the quarter, expanding with repair shop owners and managers but particularly, with the independents. [indiscernible] offers independent shops, leading shop management software, innovative marketing services to gain more repair customers and the most comprehensive and capable repair information anywhere. And based on customer connection, it has thousands of customer contacts every year. Mitchell1 keeps improving its advantage, adding repair information for new vehicles, improving the ease of navigating its ProDemand system, building on the millions of actual repair already catalogs making its unique share track -- sure track, Big Data repair base even more powerful and customers, shop owners and managers is taking notice. The quarter saw a more fleet placements, more attention to industry shows like APEC and more penetration of shops across the country. 
From our diagnostics division. All fulfilling independents. Another solid quarter, including positive results from our newest handheld unit, the VERUS. I mentioned it last quarter, it was in a mist of its introduction, while the enthusiasm continues from our customers and from our franchisees. It's our most successful launch. Customer satisfaction is high and we regularly, we see testimonials when I go out and visit with franchisees and customers and technicians. We receive testimonials, like the VERUS Edge, it helps my shop fix cars faster and be more profitable. VERUS Edge is quite a product. Faster, easier, smarter. Technical service its hands, comprehensive diagnostics and the power of sure track big repair data. Simply the best handheld vehicle repair and it's another winner with independent shops. It's clear. 
And speaking of diagnostics, this time in the heavy truck area. We continue to expand our coverage. More engines, more powertrain combinations, the Prolink Ultra, already, the go to diagnostics in truck shops across the nation got stronger again. Finally, in the period, RS&I equipment division recorded essentially flat activity, impacted particularly by Eastern Europe. That said, we keep driving to expand our position in equipment with repair shops, with innovative new products like the B1200P wheel balancer system, designed for more sophisticated independent shops, with specialty or dealer like operation. A series of customer connection with those locations helped us highlight the need for features like fast run out measurement, automatic scanners and smart sonar, a pinpoint laser like for positioning the ease of weight on the wheel and a highly intuitive interactive touchscreen interface. The B1200, faster and more accurate. It's now available in European markets and the North American introduction is scheduled for later this year. So that's RS&I, using Snap-On Value Creation, offering innovative new products, capturing opportunities and securing an expanded presence with shop owners and managers. 
And that's our fourth quarter. Organic sales rising 3.1%. EPS, $2.22 in the quarter, up 12 points 7% against the 11th -- against the $0.11 of unfavorable currency. Progress along our runways for coherent growth and clearly, the advancements down our runways for improvement, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, driving a 19.1% operating margin, 220 basis points higher than last year. It was an encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo."

Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $851.7 million on the quarter were up 3.1% organically, reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, notably, the Snap-On Tools",1408,"Thanks, Nick. 
Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $851.7 million on the quarter were up 3.1% organically, reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, notably, the Snap-On Tools Group, as well as our diagnostics and repair information business, partially offset by some headwinds on our C&I segment. On a reported basis, net sales, which included $33.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased $5.7 million or 0.7% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-On has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency translations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q4 sales comparisons by 400 basis points. Consolidated gross margin of 48.4% in the quarter improved 40 basis points, primarily due to higher organic sales and the savings from our C&I initiatives, partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $250 million yielded an operating expense margin of 29.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 180 basis points from last year, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, as well as lower performance-based and stock-based compensation expenses. No restructuring costs were incurred in the quarter. We incurred $1.1 million of such costs in the fourth quarter of last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $162.3 million in the quarter, including $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.8% as compared to the prior year and as a percentage of sales, improved 220 basis points to 19.1%. Financial Services revenues of $63.1 million in the quarter increased 6.2% from 2014 levels and operating earnings of $45 million increased 6.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $207.3 million in the quarter, including $9.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.6% and the operating margin of 22.7% improved 230 basis points from 20.4% a year ago. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 31.1% compared to 32.1% last year. Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $131.4 million or $2.22 per diluted share increased $15.2 million or $0.25 per share from 2014 levels, representing a 12.7% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. 
Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I group, on Slide 7. Sales of $281.8 million in the quarter decreased 0.6% organically, primarily due to a high single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, largely reflecting deep declines in sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector. These organic sales declines were partially offset by a low single-digit gain in the segment's European-based Hand Tools business and a double-digit increase in the segment's power tool operations. Gross profit in the C&I group was $107.6 million in the quarter. The gross margin of 38.2% increased 20 basis points as savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs were partially offset by a shift in sales that included lower volumes of higher gross margin sales to customers in critical industries, and an increase in lower gross margin sales from the power tool operations. Operating expenses of $65.7 million in the quarter compared to $72.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 23.3% improved 110 basis points, primarily due to a 70 basis point gain from the sale of a former manufacturing facility, as well as benefits from the sales shift already mentioned. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.9 million, including $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 3.5% from 2014 levels and the operating margin of 14.9% improved 130 basis points. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Fourth quarter sales in the Snap-On Tools Group of $411.2 million increased 8.7% organically, reflecting continued strength in sales, both in the U.S. and internationally. Gross profit of $173.7 million in the quarter increased $7.3 million in 2014 levels. The gross margin of 42.2% decreased 70 basis points, primarily to unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $101.8 million in the quarter decreased slightly and the operating expense margin of 24.7% improved 170 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-On Tools Group of $71.9 million, including $4.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.5% and the operating margin of 17.5% improved 100 basis points from 16.5% last year. 
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I group, showed on Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales of $280.6 million increased 2.2% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, and a low single-digit increase in sales to OEM dealerships. Sales of undercar equipment were essentially flat year-over-year, with continued weakness in East European markets, including Russia. Gross margin of 46.7% improved 20 basis points from 46.5% last year. Operating expenses totaled $58.9 million in the quarter and the operating expense margin of 21% improved 240 basis points, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Fourth quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $72.1 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.6% from prior year levels. The operating margin of 25.7% improved 260 basis points from 23.1% last year. 
Now turning to Slide 10. The fourth quarter operating earnings from Financial Services of $45 million on revenue or $63.1 million compared with operating earnings of $42.2 million of revenue or $59.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables were 17.8% compared with 17.6% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $252 million in the quarter increased 8.5% from 2014 levels. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.6 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.4 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extending credit loans to technicians. In 2015, our worldwide Financial Services portfolio grew $206 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $144.4 million in the quarter increased $47.2 million from comparable 2014 levels, due in part to higher 2015 net earnings and lower growth in working investment as compared to the prior year. Net cash used by investing activities of $74.6 million included $66.8 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $16.1 million in the quarter compared with $17.3 million last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $80.4 million. 
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $22.3 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand in the auto repair sector and new product introductions, as well as the addition of inventories related to the acquisition of Ecotechnics. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.5 compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year-end. Over year-end cash position of $92.8 million decreased $40.1 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease includes the impacts of funding $844.2 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $127.9 million, a repurchase of 723,000 shares for $110.4 million, $80.4 million for capital expenditures and $11.8 million for the acquisition of Ecotechnics. These cash decreases were largely offset by $624.8 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $496.5 million of cash from operations. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 24.6% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $92.8 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. And our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access commercial paper markets. At 2015 year-end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. 
Now I'll briefly review a few outlook items for 2016. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2016 will be in the range of $80 million to $90 million. We also expect that our full year 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2015 full year rate of 31.7%. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Snap-On's fourth quarter. Encouraging period. Taking advantage of tailwinds, overcoming headwinds, growing organically, improving performance significantly again. 
There is turbulence. Deep decreases in the military and oil and gas and difficulties across the geographies, but there are tailwinds. The aging and changing of vehicles continues. Vehicle repair remains robust. In this environment, we keep driving down our strategic runway to our growth, launching innovative new products and advancing our position. And despite of the difficulties, we continued moving down our runways for improvement. Snap-On Value Creation, safety and quality. Customer connection and innovation, working better and better. We had more new hit products in 2015 than ever before, not just for the Tools Group, but for the corporation overall. Runways, growth and improvement, bolstered 3.1% organic growth in the quarter against the wind. EPS of $2.22, up 12.7% over last year's fourth quarter. Again, $0.11 of unfavorable currency, and a 19.1% opco operating margin, a rise of 220 basis points, all extending our ongoing upward trend that has continued for some time. And we believe that the strength of our business model, the power of our brand and the capabilities of our team position us well to continue that positive trend as we go forward.

In terms of the other businesses, of course, whether it can be a factor in undercar, and that might have been -- that you might be entitled to some of that in the fourth quarter and to some of that bad weather and then the other thing is, it was up quite -- our undercar business is a longer way business. It isn't just a quarter business. When we have a good quarter, like we had in the third quarter, sometimes, you'll have resources devoted to installation of those new products flowing into the next quarter, which will put a weight on the next quarter. So you'll see those 3 things rolling through it. I would expect, to your question about the longer term, I expect that undercar repair will follow along with the generally robust repair -- vehicle repair market in the U.S. and in Europe, as the cars get older. And by the way, if the cars get lighter and need more fuel economy, the position of balancing and alignment needs to be stronger.

When the vehicles change, that requires new tool loads, new electronics, new undercar equipment to deal with the changes. if you just take one, if you think about self driving vehicles and things like that, I mean, the more people rely on internal mechanisms inside the car, the more precise calibration has to be. And therefore, the more careful and more detailed the mechanical job is, the mechanics have to be. And so if it gets more electronic, there's opportunities for diagnostics. If it gets more attended to onboard computers to control the car, more equipment and more diagnostics. And ironically, during the time in which the cars have electrified, it's gone from -- in the '90s, it went from 50-60 engine codes for a car to now thousands of engine code. In that time, demand for hand tools has only increased because the repairability of the car so far down in terms of the design considerations that the car should become more and more difficult to physically repair, let alone diagnose, associated with electronics.

As usual, I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the environment and on our progress. And after that, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. 
The Snap-on fourth quarter. Organic sales up and profits well above last year. The period continues a positive trajectory of performance. Again, this quarter, we had opportunities and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities and we overcame the headwinds. Organic sales grew 3.1%. If we include the impacts of $33 million -- $33.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, overall sales in the quarter were $851.7 million, a small decrease from last year. Our EPS was $2.22, up 12.7% from the $1.97 in 2014, and that rise reflects an operating -- opco operating margin of 19.1%, an increase of 220 basis points. Financial Service earnings of $45 million in the quarter were also up, leading to a consolidated operating margin, including both Financial Services and opco, of 22.7%, an improvement of 230 basis points. 
The results were encouraging. Our markets, the automotive repair-related segments, they continue to be favorable, changing technologies in aging vehicles requiring new tools and more repairs. Our Tools Group and our Repair Systems & Information, or the RS&I group, took advantage of those opportunities and grew across our franchise network and with repair shop owners and managers. 
Now for our Commercial & Industrial Group, or our C&I group, markets were mixed. Headwinds a bit more pronounced in the quarter, impacted by a few down sectors and macroeconomically challenged geographies, leading to organic volume just under 2014. A couple of those difficult environments were natural resources in the U.S. Military, both substantially lower in the fourth quarter. 
Oil and gas. A market we've identified as a long-term strategic growth opportunity for us, and we continue to see it that way. But in the quarter, we experienced similarly to those businesses with more prominent exposure in that arena and we saw a deep decline. 
The military sales. Ongoing drawdowns and budget restraints led to a substantial year-over-year drop, but we continue to maintain our presence in that segment and we're poised to increase our position when the variability subsides. 
C&I is also the most international of businesses and was also challenged in the quarter by economic turbulence across the globe in some of the European markets and in parts of Asia Pacific. That said, C&I progressed through the quarterly headwinds, taking advantage of the opportunities in critical industries, like aviation, and in national markets, like Japan and Germany and Mexico, and emerging markets, like India and Indonesia. 
So overall, our businesses, I would characterize -- overall across our businesses, I would characterize our markets as mixed. We have tailwinds in automotive repair and we have pockets of turbulence in some afflicted critical industries and in challenged geographies. Having said that, we believe that our businesses are well positioned to capitalize on the possibilities, opportunities that do exist along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding with Snap-on's presence with repair shop owners and managers, extending into critical industries and building in emerging markets. These strategic initiatives we see as decisive for our future, and we'll continue to strengthen our position along those runways as we go forward. 
And looking ahead -- and also looking ahead, we also see clear runways for improvement. Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, driving significant progress, and our fourth quarter and our full year results confirm those ongoing improvement possibilities. 
Let's speak about the full year. Snap-on's EPS in 2015 was $8.10, an increase of 13.4%. Driving those earnings was an opco earnings margin of 17.7%, up 140 basis points for the full year. And when we include the income from Financial Services of $170.2 million, which rose $21.1 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation in the year was 21.3%, up 170 basis points. That performance came on sales for the year of $3.4 billion, reflecting a 7.1% organic increase, broad growth. Tools Group, up 10.9%. RS&I increasing 4.9%. C&I rising 5.8%. All performances in the year reflecting significant advances down our runways for growth and for improvement. 
Now let's move to the groups and their fourth quarter results. 
C&I. Sales were down in the period 5.5% from 2014, impacted by 490 basis points of unfavorable currency. Organic sales were slightly lower than last year, with varied results across the group: gains by SNA Europe, our European hand tools business and the power tools operation; and decreases at the industrial division. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.9 billion -- $41.9 million. That represents an operating margin of 14.9%, a rise of 130 basis points. Encouragingly, SNA Europe posted a sales increase again in the midst of significant European headwinds, continuing its progress now, 9 quarters in a row, of year-over-year growth and the profit rising even higher, now up 11 straight quarters, reflecting RCI and Snap-on Value Creation, new products and new processes, positive trends in some difficult geographies. 
Also, in C&I, our power tools division advanced in the period, bolstered by an array of new products. Innovations like our CDR8815, 18-volt lithium cordless drill, launched in the quarter. It's our latest in the successful line of cordless tools. An oversized variable speed trigger, less finger stress and more accurate torque control. A heavy-duty gearbox, reducing operating wobble in runout, important for power tools. A precision single-sleeve keyless chuck with carbide jaws, increasing gripping torque and enabling 1-handed bit changes, a nice time-saver for professionals. And all those features contained in a powerful but compact design. With the CDR8815, we believe we have a winner and the early results confirm it. 
Now the industrial division had weaker sales in the quarter, as we mentioned, and there were difficulties in military and oil and gas. That said, we've maintained our growth strategies of extending in critical industries, even during this turbulence. We remain committed to ongoing advancements made possible by Snap-on Value Creation, especially in customer connection and innovation, offering new products specifically aimed at customers facing critical challenges. 
One of those new products designed for the natural resource sector is the Snap-on gas meter wrench, custom-engineered for safer and more efficient service of gas meters, rugged and lightweight, with an aviation-grade aluminum body, 5 interchangeable heads for maximum versatility and a 19-inch handle to more easily generate the full range of force required. Over 500,000 gas meters are replaced annually in the New York City area alone, and 20% to 30% of all injuries in the utility sector are attributed to the gas meter service. This innovative new Snap-on wrench was guided by customer connection, direct observation of the work, and it includes an improved ergonomic design for better grip and less hand stress. And of course, it incorporates our Snap-on Flank Drive wrenching system, eliminating slippage and requiring less force to complete the job. It's more versatile. It ends the need for a technician to carry a heavy bag of assorted pipe wrenches, and it's safer and more effective. We believe the Snap-on gas meter wrench will be a big-seller, a must-have for service technicians throughout the power generation industry. It's just another example, another example of customer connection and innovation strengthening the C&I position in critical industries. 
Now on to the Tools Group. An 8.7% rise on organic sales, an encouraging increase again this quarter. The operating earnings of $71.9 million represented a margin rate of 17.5%, up 100 basis points from last year. And that gain included a 70 basis impact from negative currency. 
We speak quite a bit about the runways for coherent growth, strategic avenues of sales advancement and clearly large among those opportunities is enhancing the franchise network. The Tools Group once again demonstrated significant progress along that runway. You can see it vividly in the financial numbers for the quarter and for the full year, and it's evident in the health metrics we monitor each period, whether it's franchise profitability, turnover or delinquencies. The measures of franchise health are all trending upward, and that speaks to the growing strength and to the widening advantage, the widening advantage of our van network in the robust vehicle repair arena. 
But beyond the numbers, this qualitative but clearly observable evidence of forward momentum, I can tell you that the franchisees at our fourth quarter national franchise advisory council and more recently at the 2016 kickoff events held early last month, demonstrated the enthusiasm and confirmed the optimism that has marked the Tools Group from route to route for some time now. 
And as more evidence, we continue to be recognized as the franchise of choice. Again, this year, Snap-on ranked among the top 25 in Entrepreneur Magazine's list of top 500 franchises. And the Franchise Business Review, which collects franchisee satisfaction feedback, listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise in its latest ranking, marking the ninth consecutive year we received that award. It also goes without saying that the Tools Group's performance would not have been possible without the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation, particularly, innovation and customer connection, creating an assortment of exciting new products borne from our unique customer interactions. And for the sixth straight year, the Tools Group increased its number of hit products, million-dollar sellers developed from that direct customer observation from our on-site experience in the workplace. Let's consider the -- our new SPBS series of striking prybars, an upgrade in performance and durability and most importantly in safety. These next-generation tools include a precision ground blade with angled design for maximum lift. It also features a new grip material, which performs in extremely low temperatures, an important place like Chicago today, and has greater resistance to common shop chemicals. And it's got a new -- or it features a new ergonomic handle that not only levers a more comfortable grip, but the flared design provides technician hands greatly improved protection from off-center hits. Not a small feature. It's an exceptional design made possible from customer connection and it represents progress even in a long-established product line. 
Finally, I'd be missing a huge contributor to our van channel and a major strategic advantage if I didn't mention Snap-on Credit, financing the network's big ticket items. And as you would expect, the credit operation was well represented at our kickoff meetings -- at our recent kickoff meetings and held in the first part of the year, and they were working to increase the power of credit and making our franchise operations -- making our finance operations an even greater strategic contributor. Snap-on is wielding its tools network more effectively everyday. And the support of our credit company is a major element in that progress. 
Moving to RS&I. Sales in the fourth quarter were $280.6 million, with organic gains of 2.2%, reflecting a rise in diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, a low single-digit increase to OEM dealerships and essentially flat sales of undercar equipment. Operating earnings of $72.1 million rose $6.9 million. And the OI margin, it was 25.7%, up 260 basis points from last year's 23.1%, with RCI paving the way. RS&I advanced in the quarter, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, but particularly with the independents. Mitchell1 offers independent shops leading shop management software, innovative marketing services to gain more repair customers and the most comprehensive and capable repair information anywhere. And based on customer connection, it has thousands of customer contacts every year. Mitchell1 keeps improving its advantage, adding repair information for new vehicles, improving the ease of navigating its ProDemand system, building on the millions of actual repair events and already catalogs making its unique share track -- SureTrack big data repair base even more powerful, and customers, shop owners and managers have taken notice. The quarter saw more fleet placements, more attention to industry shows like AAPEX and more penetration of shops across the country. 
From our diagnostics division, all still selling to independents. Another solid quarter, including positive results from our newest handheld unit, the VERUS Edge. I mentioned it last quarter. It was in the midst of its introduction, while the enthusiasm continued from our customers and from our franchisees. It's our most successful launch. Customer satisfaction is high and we, regularly, we see testimonials when I go out and visit with franchisees and customers and technicians. We receive testimonials, like the VERUS Edge, it helps my shop fix cars faster and be more profitable. VERUS Edge is quite a product. Faster, easier, smarter. Technical service focus on hand, comprehensive diagnostics and the power of SureTrack big repair data. Simply the best handheld in vehicle repair, and it's another winner with independent shops. It's clear. 
And speaking of diagnostics, this time in the heavy truck area. We continue to expand our coverage. More engines, more powertrain combinations, the PRO-LINK Ultra, already the go-to diagnostics in truck shops across the nation, got stronger again. 
Finally, in the period, RS&I equipment division recorded essentially flat activity, impacted particularly by Eastern Europe. That said, we keep driving to expand our position in equipment with repair shops, with innovative new products like the B1200P wheel balancer system, designed for more sophisticated independent shops, with specialty or dealer-like operations. A series of customer connection with those locations helped us highlight the need for features like fast runout measurement, automatic data entry via scanners and smart sonar, a pinpoint laser light for positioning the ease of weights on the wheel and a highly intuitive interactive touchscreen interface. The B1200, faster and more accurate. It's now available in European markets and the North American introduction is scheduled for later this year. So that's RS&I, using Snap-on Value Creation, offering innovative new products, capturing opportunities and securing an expanded presence with shop owners and managers. 
And that's our fourth quarter: organic sales rising 3.1%. EPS, $2.22 in the quarter, up 12.7% against the 11th -- against $0.11 of unfavorable currency; progress along our runways for coherent growth; and clearly, the advancements down our runways for improvement, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement driving a 19.1% operating margin, 220 basis points higher than last year. It was an encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo."

Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $851.7 million in the quarter were up 3.1% organically, reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, notably, the Snap-on Tools Gr",1408,"Thanks, Nick. Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $851.7 million in the quarter were up 3.1% organically, reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, notably, the Snap-on Tools Group as well as our diagnostics and repair information business, partially offset by some headwinds in our C&I segment. On a reported basis, net sales, which included $33.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, decreased $5.7 million or 0.7% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q4 sales comparisons by 400 basis points. Consolidated gross margin of 48.4% in the quarter improved 40 basis points, primarily due to higher organic sales and savings from our C&I initiatives, partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $250 million yielded an operating expense margin of 29.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 180 basis points from last year, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives as well as lower performance-based and stock-based compensation expenses. No restructuring costs were incurred in the quarter. We incurred $1.1 million of such costs in the fourth quarter of last year. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $162.3 million in the quarter, including $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.8% as compared to the prior year and as a percentage of sales, improved 220 basis points to 19.1%. Financial Services revenues of $63.1 million in the quarter increased 6.2% from 2014 levels, and operating earnings of $45 million increased 6.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $207.3 million in the quarter, including $9.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.6%, and the operating margin of 22.7% improved 230 basis points from 20.4% a year ago. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 31.1% compared to 32.1% last year. 
Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $131.4 million or $2.22 per diluted share increased $15.2 million or $0.25 per share from 2014 levels, representing a 12.7% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. 
Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I group, on Slide 7. Sales of $281.8 million in the quarter decreased 0.6% organically, primarily due to a high single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, largely reflecting deep declines in sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector. These organic sales declines were partially offset by a low single-digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a double-digit increase in the segment's power tool operations. Gross profit in the C&I group was $107.6 million in the quarter. The gross margin of 38.2% increased 20 basis points as savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs were partially offset by a shift in sales that included lower volumes of higher gross margin sales to customers in critical industries and an increase in lower gross margin sales from the power tool operations. Operating expenses of $65.7 million in the quarter compared to $72.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 23.3% improved 110 basis points, primarily due to a 70 basis-point gain from the sale of a former manufacturing facility as well as benefits from the sales shift already mentioned. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.9 million, including $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 3.5% from 2014 levels, and the operating margin of 14.9% improved 130 basis points. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Fourth quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $411.2 million increased 8.7% organically, reflecting continued strength in sales, both in the U.S. and internationally. Gross profit of $173.7 million in the quarter increased $7.3 million from 2014 levels. The gross margin of 42.2% decreased 70 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $101.8 million in the quarter decreased slightly, and the operating expense margin of 24.7% improved 170 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $71.9 million, including $4.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.5%, and the operating margin of 17.5% improved 100 basis points from 16.5% last year. 
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I group, showed on Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales of $280.6 million increased 2.2% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and a low single-digit increase in sales to OEM dealerships. Sales of undercar equipment were essentially flat year-over-year, with continued weakness in East European markets, including Russia. Gross margin of 46.7% improved 20 basis points from 46.5% last year. Operating expenses totaled $58.9 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 21% improved 240 basis points, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Fourth quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $72.1 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.6% from prior year levels. So the operating margin of 25.7% improved 260 basis points from 23.1% last year. 
Now turning to Slide 10. The fourth quarter operating earnings from Financial Services of $45 million on revenue of $63.1 million compared with operating earnings of $42.2 million on revenue of $59.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables was 17.8% compared with 17.6% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $252 million in the quarter increased 8.5% from 2014 levels. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.6 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.4 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately, 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extending credit loans to technicians. In 2015, our worldwide Financial Services portfolio grew $206 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $144.4 million in the quarter increased $47.2 million from comparable 2014 levels, due in part to higher 2015 net earnings and lower growth in working investment as compared to the prior year. Net cash used by investing activities of $74.6 million included $66.8 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $16.1 million in the quarter compared with $17.3 million last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $80.4 million. 
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $22.3 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand in the auto repair sector and new product introductions as well as the addition of inventories related to the acquisition of Ecotechnics. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.5 compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year-end. Our year-end cash position of $92.8 million decreased $40.1 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease includes the impacts of funding $844.2 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $127.9 million, the repurchase of 723,000 shares for $110.4 million, $80.4 million for capital expenditures and $11.8 million for the acquisition of Ecotechnics. These cash decreases were largely offset by $624.8 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $496.5 million of cash from operations. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 24.6% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $92.8 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. And our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access commercial paper markets. At 2015 year-end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. Now I'll briefly review a few outlook items for 2016. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2016 will be in the range of $80 million to $90 million. We also expect that our full year 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2015 full year rate of 31.7%. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Snap-on's fourth quarter, an encouraging period, taking advantage of tailwinds, overcoming headwinds, growing organically, improving performance significantly again. 
There is turbulence, deep decreases in the military and oil and gas and difficulties across the geographies. But there are tailwinds. The aging and changing of vehicles continues. Vehicle repair remains robust. In this environment, we keep driving down our strategic runways for growth, launching innovative new products and advancing our position. And despite the difficulties, we continued moving down our runways for improvement. Snap-on Value Creation, safety and quality. Customer connection and innovation, working better and better. We had more new hit products in 2015 than ever before, not just for the Tools Group but for the corporation overall. Runways, growth in improvement, authored 3.1% organic growth in the quarter against the wind. EPS of $2.22, up 12.7% over last year's fourth quarter, again, $0.11 of unfavorable currency, and a 19.1% opco operating margin, a rise of 220 basis points, all extending our ongoing upward trend that has continued for some time.

We're talking multiple double-digit declines in the military again and in oil and gas in particular. If you're talking about the outlook, we've said for some time that military -- those 2 businesses are driving C&I in general. If you look at C&I beyond those businesses, it grew by about just over 5%. So you see how much they influence the situation. So you say to yourself, well, what's going to happen with those businesses? And we've said for the military, for a long time, that it's uncertain. And so you say to yourself, well, that uncertainty is dependent on the government situation. And so we're poised to take advantage and it could come back in the short-term or it could continue for a while. In terms of oil and gas, I think we're seeing a historic downturn. 70% decline in the business -- I mean, in the oil price just in the last -- in recent times. And we haven't -- we saw that at the big recession in 2009. We saw it at the Iran-Iraq wars. So it's kind of an unusual situation. When that comes back, I expect oil and gas to come back. On the other hand, as we said in our release, in our comments, aviation was pretty good for us in the quarter. So you see some goes ins and goes outs, but the dominant factor in those businesses are the oil and gas and the military."

But also, if you step back, last year, in the fourth quarter, we talked about the 50 -- there was a 53rd week. But a 53rd week, in general, was -- if I looked at it from the trajectory with the corporation, it was kind of not significant. It wasn't significant. It shouldn't change your view of where we're going. But if you start to look at it on account-by-account, it, of course, becomes an issue associated with the operating expenses because you have that extra week of operating expenses. You start to look at accounts. You had an extra week of sales, 1.7% of extra sales, but last year, so that wouldn't be in, in this year's. But if you step back and look at it, we don't think the 53rd week was significant in general or will change your view of the corporation. But if you look at it as an account, like operating expense, it really is a factor. And you have currency and operating expense as well. So you have those things rolling through, RCI, currency and things like the special events of last year."

This year, it was up again. I'm not -- I would be aiming to bring it up next year, but we're not -- it's not something we always report about.

That's what's driving the business for us. And it works in the Tools Group. And I -- we're confident it's going to work for critical industries, although there's turbulence, as you can see in critical industries, with oil and gas. I mean, oil and gas, I think -- oil and gas and military.

In terms of the other businesses, of course, weather can be a factor in undercar, and that might have been -- you might be entitled to some of that in the fourth quarter and to some of that bad weather. And then the other thing is, it was up quite -- our undercar business is a longer-way business. It isn't just a quarter business. When we have a good quarter, like we had in the third quarter, sometimes, you'll have resources devoted to installation of those new products flowing into the next quarter, which will put a weight on the next quarter. So you see those 3 things rolling through it. I would expect, to your question about the longer-term, I expect that undercar repair will follow along with the generally robust repair -- vehicle repair market in the U.S. and in Europe as the cars get older. And by the way, if the cars get lighter and need more fuel economy, the precision of balancing and alignment needs to be stronger. So we're very positive about the long-term future of that business, and we have a major share of it."

And so if it gets more electronic, there's opportunities for diagnostics. If it gets more tended to onboard computers to control the car, more equipment and more diagnostics. And ironically, during the time in which the cars have electrified, it's gone from -- in the '90s, it went from 50, 60 engine codes for a car to now thousands of engine codes. In that time, demand for hand tools has only increased because the repairability of the car is so far down in terms of the design considerations that the cars would become more and more difficult to physically repair, let alone diagnose, associated with electronics.

As usual, I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the environment and on our progress. And after that, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. 
The Snap-on fourth quarter. Organic sales up and profits well above last year. The period continues a positive trajectory of performance. Again, this quarter, we had opportunities and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities and we overcame the headwinds. Organic sales grew 3.1%. If we include the impacts of $33 million -- $33.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, overall sales in the quarter were $851.7 million, a small decrease from last year. Our EPS was $2.22, up 12.7% from the $1.97 in 2014. And that rise reflects an operating -- opco operating margin of 19.1%, an increase of 220 basis points. Financial Service earnings of $45 million in the quarter were also up, leading to a consolidated operating margin, including both Financial Services and opco, of 22.7%, an improvement of 230 basis points. 
The results were encouraging. Our markets, the automotive repair-related segments, they continue to be favorable, changing technologies in aging vehicles requiring new tools and more repairs. Our Tools Group and our Repair Systems & Information, or the RS&I group, took advantage of those opportunities and grew across our franchise network and with repair shop owners and managers. 
Now for our Commercial & Industrial Group, or our C&I group, markets were mixed. Headwinds a bit more pronounced in the quarter, impacted by a few down sectors and macro-economically challenged geographies, leading to organic volume just under 2014. A couple of those difficult environments were Natural Resources and the U.S. Military, both substantially lower in the fourth quarter. 
Oil and Gas. A market we've identified as a long-term strategic growth opportunity for us, and we continue to see it that way. But in the quarter, we experienced similar issues to those businesses with more prominent exposure in that arena and we saw a deep decline. 
Military sales. Ongoing drawdowns and budget restraints led to a substantial year-over-year drop, but we continue to maintain our presence in that segment and we're poised to increase our position when the variability subsides. 
C&I is also the most international of businesses and was also challenged in the quarter by economic turbulence across the globe in some of the European markets and in parts of Asia Pacific. That said, C&I progressed through the quarterly headwinds, taking advantage of the opportunities in critical industries, like aviation, and in national markets, like Japan and Germany and Mexico, and emerging markets, like India and Indonesia. 
So overall, our businesses, I would characterize -- overall across our businesses, I would characterize our markets as mixed. We have tailwinds in automotive repair and we have pockets of turbulence in some afflicted critical industries and in challenged geographies. Having said that, we believe that our businesses are well positioned to capitalize on the possibilities, opportunities that do exist along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding with Snap-on's presence with repair shop owners and managers, extending into critical industries and building in emerging markets. These strategic initiatives we see as decisive for our future, and we'll continue to strengthen our position along those runways as we go forward. 
And looking ahead -- and also looking ahead, we also see clear runways for improvement. Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, driving significant progress, and our fourth quarter and our full year results confirm those ongoing improvement possibilities. 
Let's speak about full year. Snap-on's EPS in 2015 was $8.10, an increase of 13.4%. Driving those earnings was an opco earnings margin of 17.7%, up 140 basis points for the full year. And when we include the income from Financial Services of $170.2 million, which rose $21.1 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation in the year was 21.3%, up 170 basis points. That performance came on sales for the year of $3.4 billion, reflecting a 7.1% organic increase, broad growth. Tools Group, up 10.9%. RS&I increasing 4.9%. C&I rising 5.8%. All performances in the year reflecting significant advances down our runways for growth and for improvement. 
Now let's move to the groups and their fourth quarter results. 
C&I. Sales were down in the period 5.5% from 2014, impacted by 490 basis points of unfavorable currency. Organic sales were slightly lower than last year, with varied results across the group: gains by SNA Europe, our European hand tools business and the power tools operation; and decreases at the industrial division. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.9 billion -- $41.9 million. That represents an operating margin of 14.9%, a rise of 130 basis points. Encouragingly, SNA Europe posted a sales increase again in the midst of significant European headwinds, continuing its progress now, 9 quarters in a row, of year-over-year growth and the profit rising even higher, now up 11 straight quarters, reflecting RCI and Snap-on Value Creation, new products and new processes, positive trends in some difficult geographies. 
Also, in C&I, our power tools division advanced in the period, bolstered by an array of new products. Innovations like our CDR8815, 18-volt lithium cordless drill. Launched in the quarter, it's our latest in the successful line of cordless tools. An oversized variable speed trigger, less finger stress and more accurate torque control. A heavy-duty gearbox, reducing operating wobble in runout, important for power tools. A precision single-sleeve keyless chuck with carbide jaws, increasing gripping torque and enabling 1-handed bit changes, a nice time-saver for professionals. And all those features contained in a powerful but compact design. With the CDR8815, we believe we have a winner and the early results confirm it. 
Now the industrial division had weaker sales in the quarter, as we mentioned, and there were difficulties in military and oil and gas. That said, we've maintained our growth strategies of extending in critical industries, even during this turbulence. We remain committed to ongoing advancements made possible by Snap-on Value Creation, especially in customer connection and innovation, offering new products specifically aimed at customers facing critical challenges. 
One of those new products designed for the natural resource sector is the Snap-on gas meter wrench, custom-engineered for safer and more efficient service of gas meters, rugged and lightweight, with an aviation-grade aluminum body, 5 interchangeable heads for maximum versatility and a 19-inch handle to more easily generate the full range of force required. Over 500,000 gas meters are replaced annually in the New York City area alone, and 20% to 30% of all injuries in the utility sector are attributed to the gas meter service. This innovative new Snap-on wrench was guided by customer connection, direct observation of the work, and it includes an improved ergonomic design for better grip and less hand stress. And of course, it incorporates our Snap-on Flank Drive wrenching system, eliminating slippage and requiring less force to complete the job. It's more versatile. It ends the need for a technician to carry a heavy bag of assorted pipe wrenches, and it's safer and more effective. We believe the Snap-on gas meter wrench will be a big-seller, a must-have for service technicians throughout the power generation industry. It's just another example, another example of customer connection and innovation strengthening the C&I position in critical industries. 
Now on to the Tools Group. An 8.7% rise on organic sales, an encouraging increase again this quarter. The operating earnings of $71.9 million represented a margin rate of 17.5%, up 100 basis points from last year. And that gain included a 70 basis impact from negative currency. 
We speak quite a bit about runways for coherent growth, strategic avenues of sales advancement and clearly large among those opportunities is enhancing the franchise network. The Tools Group once again demonstrated significant progress along that runway. You can see it vividly in the financial numbers for the quarter and for the full year, and it's evident in the health metrics we monitor each period, whether it's franchise profitability, turnover or delinquencies. The measures of franchise health are all trending upward, and that speaks to the growing strength and to the widening advantage, the widening advantage of our van network in the robust vehicle repair arena. 
But beyond the numbers there's qualitative, but clearly observable, evidence of forward momentum. I can tell you that the franchisees at our fourth quarter national franchise advisory council and more recently at the 2016 kickoff events held early last month, demonstrated the enthusiasm and confirmed the optimism that has marked the Tools Group from route to route for some time now. 
And as more evidence, we continue to be recognized as the franchise of choice. Again, this year, Snap-on ranked among the top 25 in Entrepreneur Magazine's list of top 500 franchises. And the Franchise Business Review, which collects franchisee satisfaction feedback, listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise in its latest ranking, marking the ninth consecutive year we received that award. It also goes without saying that the Tools Group's performance would not have been possible without the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation, particularly, innovation and customer connection, creating an assortment of exciting new products borne from our unique customer interactions. And for the sixth straight year, the Tools Group increased its number of hit products, million-dollar sellers developed from that direct customer observation from our on-site experience in the workplace. Let's consider the -- our new SPBS series of striking pry-bars, an upgrade in performance and durability, and most importantly, in safety. These next-generation tools include a precision ground blade with angled design for maximum lift. It also features a new grip material, which performs in extremely low temperatures, an important place like Chicago today, and has greater resistance to common shop chemicals. And it's got a new -- or it features a new ergonomic handle that not only levers a more comfortable grip, but the flared design provides technicians' hands greatly improved protection from off-center hits. Not a small feature. It's an exceptional design made possible from customer connection and it represents progress even in a long-established product line. 
Finally, I'd be missing a huge contributor to our van channel and a major strategic advantage if I didn't mention Snap-on Credit, financing the network's big ticket items. And as you would expect, the credit operation was well represented at our kickoff meetings -- at our recent kickoff meetings and held in the first part of the year, and they were working to increase the power of credit and making our franchise operations -- making our finance operations an even greater strategic contributor. Snap-on is wielding its tools network more effectively everyday. And the support of our credit company is a major element in that progress. 
Moving to RS&I. Sales in the fourth quarter were $280.6 million, with organic gains of 2.2%, reflecting a rise in diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, a low single-digit increase to OEM dealerships and essentially flat sales of undercar equipment. Operating earnings of $72.1 million rose $6.9 million. And the OI margin, it was 25.7%, up 260 basis points from last year's 23.1%, with RCI paving the way. RS&I advanced in the quarter, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, but particularly with the independents. Mitchell1 offers independent shops leading shop management software, innovative marketing services to gain more repair customers and the most comprehensive and capable repair information anywhere. And based on customer connection, it has thousands of customer contacts every year. Mitchell1 keeps improving its advantage, adding repair information for new vehicles, improving the ease of navigating its ProDemand system, building on the millions of actual repair events and already catalogs making its unique share track -- SureTrack, big data repair base, even more powerful, and customers, shop owners and managers have taken notice. The quarter saw more fleet placements, more attention to industry shows like AAPEX and more penetration of shops across the country. 
From our diagnostics division, all still selling to independents. Another solid quarter, including positive results from our newest handheld unit, the VERUS Edge. I mentioned it last quarter. It was in the midst of its introduction, while the enthusiasm continued from our customers and from our franchisees. It's our most successful launch. Customer satisfaction is high and we, regularly, we see testimonials when I go out and visit with franchisees and customers and technicians. We receive testimonials, like the VERUS Edge, it helps my shop fix cars faster and be more profitable. VERUS Edge is quite a product. Faster, easier, smarter. Technical service focus on hand, comprehensive diagnostics and the power of SureTrack big repair data. Simply the best handheld in vehicle repair, and it's another winner with independent shops. It's clear. 
And speaking of diagnostics, this time in the heavy truck area. We continue to expand our coverage. More engines, more powertrain combinations, the PRO-LINK Ultra, already the go-to diagnostics in truck shops across the nation, got stronger again. 
Finally, in the period, RS&I equipment division recorded essentially flat activity, impacted particularly by Eastern Europe. That said, we keep driving to expand our position in equipment with repair shops, with innovative new products like the B1200P wheel balancer system, designed for more sophisticated independent shops, with specialty or dealer-like operations. A series of customer connection with those locations helped us highlight the need for features like fast runout measurement, automatic data entry via scanners and smart sonar, a pinpoint laser light for positioning the ease of weights on the wheel and a highly intuitive interactive touchscreen interface. The B1200, faster and more accurate. It's now available in European markets and the North American introduction is scheduled for later this year. So that's RS&I, using Snap-on Value Creation, offering innovative new products, capturing opportunities and securing an expanded presence with shop owners and managers. 
And that's our fourth quarter: organic sales rising 3.1%; EPS, $2.22 in the quarter, up 12.7% against the 11th -- against $0.11 of unfavorable currency; progress along our runways for coherent growth; and clearly, the advancements down our runways for improvement, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement driving a 19.1% operating margin, 220 basis points higher than last year. It was an encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo."

Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $851.7 million in the quarter were up 3.1% organically, reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, notably, the Snap-on Tools Gr",1408,"Thanks, Nick. Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $851.7 million in the quarter were up 3.1% organically, reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, notably, the Snap-on Tools Group as well as our diagnostics and repair information business, partially offset by some headwinds in our C&I segment. On a reported basis, net sales, which included $33.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, decreased $5.7 million, or 0.7% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q4 sales comparisons by 400 basis points. Consolidated gross margin of 48.4% in the quarter improved 40 basis points, primarily due to higher organic sales and savings from our C&I initiatives, partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $250 million yielded an operating expense margin of 29.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 180 basis points from last year, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives as well as lower performance-based and stock-based compensation expenses. No restructuring costs were incurred in the quarter. We incurred $1.1 million of such costs in the fourth quarter of last year. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $162.3 million in the quarter, including $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.8% as compared to the prior year and as a percentage of sales, improved 220 basis points to 19.1%. Financial Services revenues of $63.1 million in the quarter increased 6.2% from 2014 levels, and operating earnings of $45 million increased 6.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $207.3 million in the quarter, including $9.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.6%; and the operating margin of 22.7% improved 230 basis points from 20.4% a year ago. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 31.1% compared to 32.1% last year. 
Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $131.4 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, increased $15.2 million, or $0.25 per share from 2014 levels, representing a 12.7% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. 
Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I group, on Slide 7. Sales of $281.8 million in the quarter decreased 0.6% organically, primarily due to a high single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, largely reflecting deep declines in sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector. These organic sales declines were partially offset by a low single-digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a double-digit increase in the segment's power tool operations. Gross profit in the C&I group was $107.6 million in the quarter. The gross margin of 38.2% increased 20 basis points as savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs were partially offset by a shift in sales that included lower volumes of higher gross margin sales to customers in critical industries and an increase in lower gross margin sales from the power tool operations. Operating expenses of $65.7 million in the quarter compared to $72.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 23.3% improved 110 basis points, primarily due to a 70 basis-point gain from the sale of a former manufacturing facility as well as benefits from the sales shift already mentioned. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.9 million, including $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 3.5% from 2014 levels, and the operating margin of 14.9% improved 130 basis points. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Fourth quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $411.2 million increased 8.7% organically, reflecting continued strength in sales, both in the U.S. and internationally. Gross profit of $173.7 million in the quarter increased $7.3 million from 2014 levels. The gross margin of 42.2% decreased 70 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $101.8 million in the quarter decreased slightly, and the operating expense margin of 24.7% improved 170 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $71.9 million, including $4.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.5%, and the operating margin of 17.5% improved 100 basis points from 16.5% last year. 
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I group, showed on Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales of $280.6 million increased 2.2% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and a low single-digit increase in sales to OEM dealerships. Sales of undercar equipment were essentially flat year-over-year, with continued weakness in East European markets, including Russia. Gross margin of 46.7% improved 20 basis points from 46.5% last year. Operating expenses totaled $58.9 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 21% improved 240 basis points, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Fourth quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $72.1 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.6% from prior year levels. So the operating margin of 25.7% improved 260 basis points from 23.1% last year. 
Now turning to Slide 10. The fourth quarter operating earnings from Financial Services of $45 million on revenue of $63.1 million compared with operating earnings of $42.2 million on revenue of $59.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables was 17.8% compared with 17.6% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $252 million in the quarter increased 8.5% from 2014 levels. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.6 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.4 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately, 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extending credit loans to technicians. In 2015, our worldwide Financial Services portfolio grew $206 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $144.4 million in the quarter increased $47.2 million from comparable 2014 levels, due in part to higher 2015 net earnings and lower growth in working investment as compared to the prior year. Net cash used by investing activities of $74.6 million included $66.8 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $16.1 million in the quarter compared with $17.3 million last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $80.4 million. 
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $22.3 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand in the auto repair sector and new product introductions, as well as the addition of inventories related to the acquisition of Ecotechnics. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.5 compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year-end. Our year-end cash position of $92.8 million decreased $40.1 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease includes the impacts of funding $844.2 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $127.9 million, the repurchase of 723,000 shares for $110.4 million, $80.4 million for capital expenditures and $11.8 million for the acquisition of Ecotechnics. These cash decreases were largely offset by $624.8 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $496.5 million of cash from operations. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 24.6% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $92.8 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. And our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access commercial paper markets. At 2015 year-end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. Now I'll briefly review a few outlook items for 2016. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2016 will be in the range of $80 million to $90 million. We also expect that our full year 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2015 full year rate of 31.7%. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Snap-on's fourth quarter, an encouraging period, taking advantage of tailwinds, overcoming headwinds, growing organically, improving performance significantly again. 
There is turbulence, deep decreases in the military and oil and gas, and difficulties across the geographies. But there are tailwinds. The aging and changing of vehicles continues. Vehicle repair remains robust. In this environment, we keep driving down our strategic runways for growth, launching innovative new products and advancing our position. And despite the difficulties, we continued moving down our runways for improvement. Snap-on Value Creation, safety and quality. Customer connection and innovation, working better and better. We had more new hit products in 2015 than ever before, not just for the Tools Group but for the corporation overall. Runways, growth in improvement, authored 3.1% organic growth in the quarter against the wind. EPS of $2.22, up 12.7% over last year's fourth quarter, again, $0.11 of unfavorable currency, and a 19.1% opco operating margin, a rise of 220 basis points, all extending our ongoing upward trend that has continued for some time. And we believe that the strength of our business model, the power of our brand and the capabilities of our team position us well to continue that positive trend as we go forward.

We're talking multiple double-digit declines in the military again and in oil and gas in particular. If you're talking about the outlook, we've said for some time that military -- those 2 businesses are driving C&I in general. If you look at C&I beyond those businesses, it grew by about just over 5%. So you see how much they influence the situation. So you say to yourself, well, what's going to happen with those businesses? And we've said for the military, for a long time, that it's uncertain. And so you say to yourself, well, that uncertainty is dependent on the government situation. And so we're poised to take advantage and it could come back in the short-term or it could continue for a while. In terms of oil and gas, I think we're seeing a historic downturn. 70% decline in the business -- I mean, in the oil price just in the last -- in recent times. And we haven't -- we saw that at the big recession in 2009. We saw it at the Iran-Iraq wars. So it's kind of an unusual situation. When that comes back, I expect oil and gas to come back. On the other hand, as we said in our release, in our comments, aviation was pretty good for us in the quarter. So you see some goes ins and goes outs, but the dominant factor in those businesses are the oil and gas and the military."

It shouldn't change your view of where we're going. But if you start to look at it on account-by-account, it, of course, becomes an issue associated with the operating expenses because you have that extra week of operating expenses. You start to look at accounts. You had an extra week of sales, 1.7% of extra sales, but last year, so that wouldn't be in, in this year's. But if you step back and look at it, we don't think the 53rd week was significant in general or will change your view of the corporation.

First and foremost, that flatness is impacted by Eastern Europe. Among all our businesses, the undercar equipment business had the strongest position in Eastern Europe and Russia. So the dips in those places impacted that business, that just squeezed down to a smaller place the most. That's number one. In terms of the other businesses, of course, weather can be a factor in undercar, and that might have been -- you might be entitled to some of that in the fourth quarter and to some of that bad weather. And then the other thing is, it was up quite -- our undercar business is a longer-way business. It isn't just a quarter business. When we have a good quarter, like we had in the third quarter, sometimes, you'll have resources devoted to installation of those new products flowing into the next quarter, which will put a weight on the next quarter. So you see those 3 things rolling through it. I would expect, to your question about the longer-term, I expect that undercar repair will follow along with the generally robust repair -- vehicle repair market in the U.S. and in Europe as the cars get older. And by the way, if the cars get lighter and need more fuel economy, the precision of balancing and alignment needs to be stronger. So we're very positive about the long-term future of that business, and we have a major share of it."

So I feel pretty good about that business. And in terms of the other businesses, I just think, we also feel good about our growing strength in the critical industries.

When the vehicles change, that requires new tool loads, new electronics, new undercar equipment to deal with the changes.

And so if it gets more electronic, there's opportunities for diagnostics. If it gets more tended to onboard computers to control the car, more equipment and more diagnostics. And ironically, during the time in which the cars have electrified, it's gone from -- in the '90s, it went from 50, 60 engine codes for a car to now thousands of engine codes. In that time, demand for hand tools has only increased because the repairability of the car is so far down in terms of the design considerations that the cars would become more and more difficult to physically repair, let alone diagnose, associated with electronics. So all of those things are good for us. We see a very positive future and trend. And that we're confident, that continues the trend that you see in our numbers.

As usual, I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the environment and on our progress. And after that, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. 
The Snap-on fourth quarter. Organic sales up and profits well above last year. The period continues a positive trajectory of performance. Again, this quarter, we had opportunities and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities and we overcame the headwinds. Organic sales grew 3.1%. If we include the impacts of $33 million -- $33.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, overall sales in the quarter were $851.7 million, a small decrease from last year. Our EPS was $2.22, up 12.7% from the $1.97 in 2014. And that rise reflects an operating -- opco operating margin of 19.1%, an increase of 220 basis points. Financial Service earnings of $45 million in the quarter were also up, leading to a consolidated operating margin, including both Financial Services and opco, of 22.7%, an improvement of 230 basis points. 
The results were encouraging. Our markets, the automotive repair-related segments, they continue to be favorable, changing technologies and aging vehicles are requiring new tools and more repairs. Our Tools Group and our Repair Systems & Information, or the RS&I group, took advantage of those opportunities and grew across our franchise network and with repair shop owners and managers. 
Now for our Commercial & Industrial Group, or our C&I group, markets were mixed. Headwinds a bit more pronounced in the quarter, impacted by a few down sectors and macro-economically challenged geographies, leading to organic volume just under 2014. A couple of those difficult environments were Natural Resources and the U.S. Military, both substantially lower in the fourth quarter. 
Oil and Gas. A market we've identified as a long-term strategic growth opportunity for us, and we continue to see it that way. But in the quarter, we experienced similar issues to those businesses with more prominent exposure in that arena and we saw a deep decline. 
Military sales. Ongoing troop drawdowns and budget restraints led to a substantial year-over-year drop, but we continue to maintain our presence in that segment and we're poised to increase our position when the variability subsides. 
C&I is also the most international of businesses and was also challenged in the quarter by economic turbulence across the globe in some of the European markets and in parts of Asia Pacific. That said, C&I progressed through the quarterly headwinds, taking advantage of the opportunities in critical industries, like aviation, and in national markets, like Japan and Germany and Mexico, and emerging markets, like India and Indonesia. 
So overall, our businesses, I would characterize -- overall across our businesses, I would characterize our markets as mixed. We have tailwinds in automotive repair and we have pockets of turbulence in some afflicted critical industries and in challenged geographies. Having said that, we believe that our businesses are well positioned to capitalize on the possibilities, opportunities that do exist along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding with Snap-on's presence with repair shop owners and managers, extending into critical industries and building in emerging markets. These strategic initiatives we see as decisive for our future, and we'll continue to strengthen our position along those runways as we go forward. 
And looking ahead -- and also looking ahead, we also see clear runways for improvement. Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, driving significant progress, and our fourth quarter and our full year results confirm those ongoing improvement possibilities. 
Let's speak about full year. Snap-on's EPS in 2015 was $8.10, an increase of 13.4%. Driving those earnings was an opco earnings margin of 17.7%, up 140 basis points for the full year. And when we include the income from Financial Services of $170.2 million, which rose $21.1 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation in the year was 21.3%, up 170 basis points. That performance came on sales for the year of $3.4 billion, reflecting a 7.1% organic increase, broad growth. Tools Group, up 10.9%. RS&I increasing 4.9%. C&I rising 5.8%. All performances in the year reflecting significant advances down our runways for growth and for improvement. 
Now let's move to the groups and their fourth quarter results. 
C&I. Sales were down in the period 5.5% from 2014, impacted by 490 basis points of unfavorable currency. Organic sales were slightly lower than last year, with varied results across the group: gains by SNA Europe, our European hand tools business and the power tools operation; and decreases at the industrial division. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.9 billion -- $41.9 million. That represents an operating margin of 14.9%, a rise of 130 basis points. Encouragingly, SNA Europe posted a sales increase again in the midst of significant European headwinds, continuing its progress now, 9 quarters in a row, of year-over-year growth and the profit rising even higher, now up 11 straight quarters, reflecting RCI and Snap-on Value Creation, new products and new processes, positive trends in some difficult geographies. 
Also, in C&I, our power tools division advanced in the period, bolstered by an array of new products. Innovations like our CDR8815, 18-volt lithium cordless drill. Launched in the quarter, it's our latest in the successful line of cordless tools. An oversized variable speed trigger, less finger stress and more accurate torque control. A heavy-duty gearbox, reducing operating wobble in runout, important for power tools. A precision single-sleeve keyless chuck with carbide jaws, increasing gripping torque and enabling 1-handed bit changes, a nice time-saver for professionals. And all those features contained in a powerful but compact design. With the CDR8815, we believe we have a winner and the early results confirm it. 
Now the industrial division had weaker sales in the quarter, as we mentioned, and there were difficulties in military and oil and gas. That said, we've maintained our growth strategies of extending in critical industries, even during this turbulence. We remain committed to ongoing advancements made possible by Snap-on Value Creation, especially in customer connection and innovation, offering new products specifically aimed at customers facing critical challenges. 
One of those new products designed for the natural resource sector is the Snap-on gas meter wrench, custom-engineered for safer and more efficient service of gas meters, rugged and lightweight, with an aviation-grade aluminum body, 5 interchangeable heads for maximum versatility and a 19-inch handle to more easily generate the full range of force required. Over 500,000 gas meters are replaced annually in the New York City area alone, and 20% to 30% of all injuries in the utility sector are attributed to the gas meter service. This innovative new Snap-on wrench was guided by customer connection, direct observation of the work, and it includes an improved ergonomic design for better grip and less hand stress. And of course, it incorporates our Snap-on Flank Drive wrenching system, eliminating slippage and requiring less force to complete the job. It's more versatile. It ends the need for a technician to carry a heavy bag of assorted pipe wrenches, and it's safer and more effective. We believe the Snap-on gas meter wrench will be a big-seller, a must-have for service technicians throughout the power generation industry. It's just another example, another example of customer connection and innovation strengthening the C&I position in critical industries. 
Now on to the Tools Group. An 8.7% rise on organic sales, an encouraging increase again this quarter. The operating earnings of $71.9 million represented a margin rate of 17.5%, up 100 basis points from last year. And that gain included a 70 basis impact from negative currency. 
We speak quite a bit about runways for coherent growth, strategic avenues of sales advancement and clearly large among those opportunities is enhancing the franchise network. The Tools Group once again demonstrated significant progress along that runway. You can see it vividly in the financial numbers for the quarter and for the full year, and it's evident in the health metrics we monitor each period, whether it's franchise profitability, turnover or delinquencies. The measures of franchise health are all trending upward, and that speaks to the growing strength and to the widening advantage, the widening advantage of our van network in the robust vehicle repair arena. 
But beyond the numbers there's qualitative, but clearly observable, evidence of forward momentum. I can tell you that the franchisees at our fourth quarter national franchise advisory council and more recently at the 2016 kickoff events held early last month, demonstrated the enthusiasm and confirmed the optimism that has marked the Tools Group from route to route for some time now. 
And as more evidence, we continue to be recognized as the franchise of choice. Again, this year, Snap-on ranked among the top 25 in Entrepreneur Magazine's list of top 500 franchises. And the Franchise Business Review, which collects franchisee satisfaction feedback, listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise in its latest ranking, marking the ninth consecutive year we received that award. It also goes without saying that the Tools Group's performance would not have been possible without the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation, particularly, innovation and customer connection, creating an assortment of exciting new products borne from our unique customer interactions. And for the sixth straight year, the Tools Group increased its number of hit products, million-dollar sellers developed from that direct customer observation from our on-site experience in the workplace. Let's consider the -- our new SPBS series of striking pry-bars, an upgrade in performance and durability, and most importantly, in safety. These next-generation tools include a precision ground blade with angled design for maximum lift. It also features a new grip material, which performs in extremely low temperatures, an important place like Chicago today, and has greater resistance to common shop chemicals. And it's got a new -- or it features a new ergonomic handle that not only offers a more comfortable grip, but the flared design provides technicians' hands greatly improved protection from off-center hits. Not a small feature. It's an exceptional design made possible from customer connection and it represents progress even in a long-established product line. 
Finally, I'd be missing a huge contributor to our van channel and a major strategic advantage if I didn't mention Snap-on Credit, financing the network's big ticket items. And as you would expect, the credit operation was well represented at our kickoff meetings -- at our recent kickoff meetings and held in the first part of the year, and they were working to increase the power of credit and making our franchise operations -- making our finance operations an even greater strategic contributor. Snap-on is wielding its tools network more effectively everyday. And the support of our credit company is a major element in that progress. 
Moving to RS&I. Sales in the fourth quarter were $280.6 million, with organic gains of 2.2%, reflecting a rise in diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, a low single-digit increase to OEM dealerships and essentially flat sales of undercar equipment. Operating earnings of $72.1 million rose $6.9 million. And the OI margin, it was 25.7%, up 260 basis points from last year's 23.1%, with RCI paving the way. RS&I advanced in the quarter, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, but particularly with the independents. Mitchell1 offers independent shops leading shop management software, innovative marketing services to gain more repair customers and the most comprehensive and capable repair information anywhere. And based on customer connection, it has thousands of customer contacts every year. Mitchell1 keeps improving its advantage, adding repair information for new vehicles, improving the ease of navigating its ProDemand system, building on the millions of actual repair events and already catalogs making its unique share track -- SureTrack, big data repair base, even more powerful, and customers, shop owners and managers have taken notice. The quarter saw more fleet placements, more attention to industry shows like AAPEX and more penetration of shops across the country. 
From our diagnostics division, all still selling to independents. Another solid quarter, including positive results from our newest handheld unit, the VERUS Edge. I mentioned it last quarter. It was in the midst of its introduction, while the enthusiasm continued from our customers and from our franchisees. It's our most successful launch. Customer satisfaction is high and we, regularly receive testimonials when I go out and visit with franchisees and customers and technicians. We receive testimonials, like the VERUS Edge, it helps my shop fix cars faster and be more profitable. VERUS Edge is quite a product. Faster, easier, smarter. Technical service focus on hand, comprehensive diagnostics and the power of SureTrack big repair data. Simply the best handheld in vehicle repair, and it's another winner with independent shops. It's clear. 
And speaking of diagnostics, this time in the heavy truck area. We continue to expand our coverage. More engines, more powertrain combinations, the PRO-LINK Ultra, already the go-to diagnostics in truck shops across the nation, got stronger again. 
Finally, in the period, RS&I equipment division recorded essentially flat activity, impacted particularly by Eastern Europe. That said, we keep driving to expand our position in equipment with repair shops, with innovative new products like the B1200P wheel balancer system, designed for more sophisticated independent shops, with specialty or dealer-like operations. A series of customer connection with those locations helped us highlight the need for features like fast runout measurement, automatic data entry via scanners and smart sonar, a pinpoint laser light for positioning the ease of weights on the wheel and a highly intuitive and rapid touchscreen interface. The B1200, faster and more accurate. It's now available in European markets and the North American introduction is scheduled for later this year. So that's RS&I, using Snap-on Value Creation, offering innovative new products, capturing opportunities and securing an expanded presence with shop owners and managers. 
And that's our fourth quarter: organic sales rising 3.1%; EPS, $2.22 in the quarter, up 12.7% against the 11th -- against $0.11 of unfavorable currency; progress along our runways for coherent growth; and clearly, the advancements down our runways for improvement, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement driving a 19.1% operating margin, 220 basis points higher than last year. It was an encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo."

Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $851.7 million in the quarter were up 3.1% organically, reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, notably, the Snap-on Tools Gr",1408,"Thanks, Nick. Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $851.7 million in the quarter were up 3.1% organically, reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, notably, the Snap-on Tools Group as well as our diagnostics and repair information business, partially offset by some headwinds in our C&I segment. On a reported basis, net sales, which included $33.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, decreased $5.7 million, or 0.7% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q4 sales comparisons by 400 basis points. Consolidated gross margin of 48.4% in the quarter improved 40 basis points, primarily due to higher organic sales and savings from our C&I initiatives, partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $250 million yielded an operating expense margin of 29.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 180 basis points from last year, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives as well as lower performance-based and stock-based compensation expenses. No restructuring costs were incurred in the quarter. We incurred $1.1 million of such costs in the fourth quarter of last year. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $162.3 million in the quarter, including $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.8% as compared to the prior year and as a percentage of sales, improved 220 basis points to 19.1%. Financial Services revenues of $63.1 million in the quarter increased 6.2% from 2014 levels, and operating earnings of $45 million increased 6.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $207.3 million in the quarter, including $9.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.6%; and the operating margin of 22.7% improved 230 basis points from 20.4% a year ago. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 31.1% compared to 32.1% last year. 
Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $131.4 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, increased $15.2 million, or $0.25 per share from 2014 levels, representing a 12.7% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. 
Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I group, on Slide 7. Sales of $281.8 million in the quarter decreased 0.6% organically, primarily due to a high single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, largely reflecting deep declines in sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector. These organic sales declines were partially offset by a low single-digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a double-digit increase in the segment's power tool operations. Gross profit in the C&I group was $107.6 million in the quarter. The gross margin of 38.2% increased 20 basis points as savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs were partially offset by a shift in sales that included lower volumes of higher gross margin sales to customers in critical industries and an increase in lower gross margin sales from the power tool operations. Operating expenses of $65.7 million in the quarter compared to $72.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 23.3% improved 110 basis points, primarily due to a 70 basis-point gain from the sale of a former manufacturing facility as well as benefits from the sales shift already mentioned. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.9 million, including $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 3.5% from 2014 levels, and the operating margin of 14.9% improved 130 basis points. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Fourth quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $411.2 million increased 8.7% organically, reflecting continued strength in sales, both in the U.S. and internationally. Gross profit of $173.7 million in the quarter increased $7.3 million from 2014 levels. The gross margin of 42.2% decreased 70 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $101.8 million in the quarter decreased slightly, and the operating expense margin of 24.7% improved 170 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $71.9 million, including $4.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.5%, and the operating margin of 17.5% improved 100 basis points from 16.5% last year. 
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I group, showed on Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales of $280.6 million increased 2.2% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and a low single-digit increase in sales to OEM dealerships. Sales of undercar equipment were essentially flat year-over-year, with continued weakness in East European markets, including Russia. Gross margin of 46.7% improved 20 basis points from 46.5% last year. Operating expenses totaled $58.9 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 21% improved 240 basis points, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Fourth quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $72.1 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.6% from prior year levels. So the operating margin of 25.7% improved 260 basis points from 23.1% last year. 
Now turning to Slide 10. The fourth quarter operating earnings from Financial Services of $45 million on revenue of $63.1 million compared with operating earnings of $42.2 million on revenue of $59.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables was 17.8% compared with 17.6% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $252 million in the quarter increased 8.5% from 2014 levels. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.6 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.4 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately, 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extending credit loans to technicians. In 2015, our worldwide Financial Services portfolio grew $206 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $144.4 million in the quarter increased $47.2 million from comparable 2014 levels, due in part to higher 2015 net earnings and lower growth in working investment as compared to the prior year. Net cash used by investing activities of $74.6 million included $66.8 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $16.1 million in the quarter compared with $17.3 million last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $80.4 million. 
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $22.3 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand in the auto repair sector and new product introductions, as well as the addition of inventories related to the acquisition of Ecotechnics. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.5 compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year-end. Our year-end cash position of $92.8 million decreased $40.1 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease includes the impacts of funding $844.2 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $127.9 million, the repurchase of 723,000 shares for $110.4 million, $80.4 million for capital expenditures and $11.8 million for the acquisition of Ecotechnics. These cash decreases were largely offset by $624.8 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $496.5 million of cash from operations. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 24.6% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $92.8 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. And our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access commercial paper markets. At 2015 year-end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. Now I'll briefly review a few outlook items for 2016. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2016 will be in the range of $80 million to $90 million. We also expect that our full year 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2015 full year rate of 31.7%. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Snap-on's fourth quarter, an encouraging period, taking advantage of tailwinds, overcoming headwinds, growing organically, improving performance significantly again. 
There is turbulence, deep decreases in the military and oil and gas, and difficulties across the geographies. But there are tailwinds. The aging and changing of vehicles continues. Vehicle repair remains robust. In this environment, we keep driving down our strategic runways for growth, launching innovative new products and advancing our position. And despite the difficulties, we continued moving down our runways for improvement. Snap-on Value Creation, safety and quality. Customer connection and innovation, working better and better. We had more new hit products in 2015 than ever before, not just for the Tools Group but for the corporation overall. Runways, growth in improvement, authored 3.1% organic growth in the quarter against the wind. EPS of $2.22, up 12.7% over last year's fourth quarter, again, $0.11 of unfavorable currency, and a 19.1% opco operating margin, a rise of 220 basis points, all extending our ongoing upward trend that has continued for some time. And we believe that the strength of our business model, the power of our brand and the capabilities of our team position us well to continue that positive trend as we go forward.

We're talking multiple double-digit declines in the military again and in oil and gas in particular. If you're talking about the outlook, we've said for some time that military -- those 2 businesses are driving C&I in general. If you look at C&I beyond those businesses, it grew by about just over 5%. So you see how much they influence the situation. So you say to yourself, well, what's going to happen with those businesses? And we've said for the military, for a long time, that it's uncertain. And so you say to yourself, well, that uncertainty is dependent on the government situation. And so we're poised to take advantage and it could come back in the short-term or it could continue for a while. In terms of oil and gas, I think we're seeing a historic downturn. 70% decline in the business -- I mean, in the oil price just in the last -- in recent times. And we haven't -- we saw that at the big recession in 2009. We saw it at the Iran-Iraq wars. So it's kind of an unusual situation. When that comes back, I expect oil and gas to come back. On the other hand, as we said in our release, in our comments, aviation was pretty good for us in the quarter. So you see some goes ins and goes outs, but the dominant factor in those businesses are the oil and gas and the military."

It shouldn't change your view of where we're going. But if you start to look at it on account-by-account, it, of course, becomes an issue associated with the operating expenses because you have that extra week of operating expenses. You start to look at accounts. You had an extra week of sales, 1.7% of extra sales, but last year, so that wouldn't be in, in this year's. But if you step back and look at it, we don't think the 53rd week was significant in general or will change your view of the corporation. But if you look at it as an account, like operating expense, it really is a factor. And you have currency and operating expense as well.

I'm trying not to do that, but that's our drive. I can tell you this. We're getting better and better at customer connection and innovation. And if you think about it, a complex product line of cars, 65,000-plus SKUs, is asymmetrically enabled by new technology, like 3D printing and finite element analysis and some of the other things like x-ray deflectometers, which is new to us, and electron microscopes and so on. So we're -- from a design point of view, we're getting better, so we don't have to put as much upfront into every product. And from a call-in-the-airstrikes point of view, in other words, reacting to customer connection, we're getting better. And that has authored the continual improvement of our hit products. This year, it was up again. I'm not -- I would be aiming to bring it up next year, but we're not -- it's not something we always report about. But I think every year, our new products become more impactful and more effective. I mean, just look at the VERUS Edge. The VERUS Edge is simply the best product available in diagnostics, and diagnostics is a rising category. It's faster, smarter, easier to use. And it gives you hand-held access to our -- our unique millions of records and -- database of millions of records that allows technicians to shortcut the repair process. This is revolutionary, and that's just one thing. There's -- we pointed out the prybar today in our -- now we took -- we use the prybar for a reason. The prybar is just -- it's a prybar, yet, customer connection and innovation showed us how to make that long-standing category so much better. That's what's happening in Snap-on. That's what's driving the business for us. And it works in the Tools Group. And I -- we're confident it's going to work for critical industries, although there's turbulence, as you can see in critical industries, with oil and gas. I mean, oil and gas, I think -- oil and gas and military. We never -- we always said that we -- our penetration was low and we wouldn't see an impact, but we didn't contemplate going from $115 oil to $30 oil, which is cataclysmic."

In terms of the other businesses, of course, weather can be a factor in undercar, and that might have been -- you might be entitled to some of that in the fourth quarter and to some of that bad weather. And then the other thing is, it was up quite -- our undercar business is a longer-way business. It isn't just a quarter business. When we have a good quarter, like we had in the third quarter, sometimes, you'll have resources devoted to installation of those new products flowing into the next quarter, which will put a weight on the next quarter. So you see those 3 things rolling through it. I would expect, to your question about the longer-term, I expect that undercar repair will follow along with the generally robust repair -- vehicle repair market in the U.S. and in Europe as the cars get older. And by the way, if the cars get lighter and need more fuel economy, the precision of balancing and alignment needs to be stronger. So we're very positive about the long-term future of that business, and we have a major share of it."

And so what happened in this quarter is we had a strong -- another strong quarter of diagnostics and Mitchell, the business to independents, which are high-margin business, and a reduction of the hardware business, which is equipment. So that generated that 70 or so basis points of help from business mix. So that's what you're seeing. RCI and business mix."

And the fact that we -- our new product portfolios, our innovative new products are solving more problems than ever, those are the kinds of things, and that hasn't abated. So I feel pretty good about that business. And in terms of the other businesses, I just think, we also feel good about our growing strength in the critical industries. It's just that you see some very big headwinds in some of those critical industries. And I can't predict where those are going to go. On the other hand, I will just offer that we've seen up and down before and we've been able to grow profitability against the winds, not every quarter necessarily but in terms of a trend. We view this -- we view our situation as a trend. If you go back and you look at our numbers from 2006 onwards, sales and profits, the trend continued.

When the vehicles change, that requires new tool loads, new electronics, new undercar equipment to deal with the changes.

And so if it gets more electronic, there's opportunities for diagnostics. If it gets more tended to onboard computers to control the car, more equipment and more diagnostics. And ironically, during the time in which the cars have electrified, it's gone from -- in the '90s, it went from 50, 60 engine codes for a car to now thousands of engine codes. In that time, demand for hand tools has only increased because the repairability of the car is so far down in terms of the design considerations that the cars would become more and more difficult to physically repair, let alone diagnose, associated with electronics.

As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter, and along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, on our markets, on the progress we made and on what we believe it all me",2411,"Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter, and along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, on our markets, on the progress we made and on what we believe it all means. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.
We believe that our first quarter provided confirmation of Snap-on's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, overcoming headwinds, advancing along our runways for growth and improvement. Our EPS in the quarter was $2.16, up from last year's $1.87. That rise includes an opco operating margin of 18.6%, an increase of 190 basis points. 
When you combine those opco gains with earnings of $47 million from Financial Services, it brings Snap-on's consolidated operating margin to 22.5%, up from the 20.1% in 2015. And that EPS, $2.16, it represents an increase of 15.5% over last year. That improvement came on organic sales growth of 2.5% and the continuing contributions from our Snap-on Value Creation Processes. The suite of principles we use everyday around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI. Once again, you can see it in the results. Those processes contributed strongly to the earnings climb. 
Our reported sales in the quarter of $834.2 million were up 80 basis points, and that gain included 200 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Now currency has been a headwind for some time both to sales and to profit, but we've been able to overcome with the help of Snap-on Value Creation, especially with innovation and with RCI. 
Innovation, taking practical insight and matching it with the latest technology, generating product excitement while making work easier for professionals with an array of new products, you see that's been part of our DNA from the very beginning in 1920, and we're only getting better at doing it. There are more new products than ever before. 
RCI, ongoing improvements, finding operating efficiency and achieving cost reduction up and down and across the corporation. Innovation and RCI overcoming the challenges, extending the trend rising profits again. 
Now let's consider the markets, the markets we serve. The first quarter once again highlighted the extensive opportunities of the auto repair segment. More solutions to service the growing complexities of new vehicles, requiring advanced solutions. And an aging fleet, driving more repairs. Both factors in play not only in the United States but worldwide. And the numbers of our quarter reflect those tailwinds. They show -- and they not only reflect tailwinds, they show our ability to take advantage to progress down our runways for growth. 
Consider the Tools Group. Organic sales up 8.1%, clearly enhancing the Van channel, providing innovative new tools to engage continually changing tests, making work easier for technicians and our franchise team more prosperous and more powerful.
And Repair Systems & Information or our RS&I Group, expanding Snap-on's present in the garage, capitalizing on a broader product line, growth across all the divisions but most notably in diagnostic and repair information businesses -- in the diagnostic and repair information businesses serving independent repair shop owners
C&I, well, it includes the businesses that serve critical industries and is the most international of our group. And in the quarter, the results showed the challenges of turbulent industrial sectors and the difficulties of a few troubled geographies. 
In critical industries, the headwinds from the fourth quarter continued and they were a bit more pronounced. Sales to the U.S. Military and to oil and gas customers were down significantly, with both segments showing the impact of ongoing measured spending and budget constraints. At the same time, we saw dips in some international markets, specifically the Middle East where aerospace project activity was down due in part to macro developments in that region. Pretty turbulent there.
That said -- all that said, C&I did demonstrate strength. SNA Europe delivered mid-single-digit growth, mid-single-digit growth in places like the U.K., Spain and the Nordic region while Asia Pacific registered double-digit increases in countries like India, Thailand and Indonesia. So overall, I'd scribe our C&I markets as mixed, turbulence and strength. 
These challenges but were also encourages -- encouraged by the advancements taking advantage of the opportunities that are available. And when coupled with a string of positive performances surrounding our auto repair-related businesses, on a whole, we believe there's clear progress along our runways for growth. 
Enhancing the Van network, expanding with repair shop owners and managers building in emerging markets and yes, extending to critical industry. Even in this quarter, we can see progress in our growing product line and our increasing understanding of the work, all of that creating confidence in our forward trajectory across those critical sectors. That's the overview of the markets.
Now let's move to the segments. In the C&I Group, organic sales were down 1.3% with declines in the critical industries, a little attenuated by gains in SNA Europe, Asia Pacific and the Power Tools division. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.1 million, representing an operating margin of 14.3%, a decrease of 50 basis points, pretty much authored by lower sales in our higher-margin critical industry business. 
But as I said, we do remain committed to extending in critical industries, and we'll keep strengthening our position to capture new business as the segment improves. You can see this particularly on our innovative new products, fortifying our ability to make work easier outside the garage in a range of industrial settings. 
One new product family in that category is -- in our collection is the Snap-on 3/4-inch flank drive 12-point impact socket. You pick this up, they're a handful, big but effective and durable, aimed at power generation, mining -- the mining and oil and gas sectors, perfect for turning large bolts on wind turbine engines, earthmoving equipment, oil wells, multiple other places, any place where heavy work gets done. They're ideal for pneumatic or hydraulic bolting systems and incorporates Snap-on's flank drive, which moves stresses away from fastener points, delivering more turning power right in the field without slipping or rounding off a fastener. Those sockets are made down in Alabama at our Outland plant, and they're a great addition to our tool line, they fill a vital need for our critical industry customers. 
Now in past quarters, I'm sure you may remember that we discussed Snap-on's lineup of tool control solutions, safeguarding the assets and improving productivity. I've spoken about our innovative and sophisticated automated tool control system or ATC, the smart tool storage unit, which electronically keeps track of the who, the when and the where of individual tool usage. It's popular. 
While in the quarter, our industrial division introduced its latest and another version of Tool Control, the Snap-on 5S Dual Visual Control Cabinet. The 5S Duo [ph] off-the-shelf or custom built utilizes visible control trace to quickly identify missing tools with the help of custom-cut foam or with -- foam or with CAD design tool silhouettes. It's the perfect addition to any place where work is performed within a and tool storage like assembly lines and where the shop is aiming to drive improvements through 5S or RCI. 
I mentioned the strength of SNA Europe and the continuing advancement that was clearly evident in its mid-single-digit sales gains, marking now 10 straight quarters of year-over-year sales progress across several challenged geographies. And once again, sales rose but profits were up more, now the 12th straight quarter of margin improvement. 
And speaking of gains, our Asia Pacific division, an area of strong potential, and these days, of significant variation. We're building our principal capabilities and we saw progress in the quarter, with sales rising compared to last year. 
So now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales increased 8.1%. The operating margin of 16.6% was up nicely versus the 15.8% recorded last year. The Tools Group. The results continue to speak for themselves. Ongoing progress along their runway for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise channel. 
And there's abundant evidence of growing strength, of ongoing positive trajectory across that channel, all on display in our franchisee metrics. Important financial and physical indicators like cash, like turnover, we monitor those metrics very closely. And again this quarter, they're favorable across the board and they continue to trend upward. 
There's also evidence in sort of anecdotal and direct interaction with the franchisees at events this year like our January kickoff meeting held all over the network. Orders were up considerably. And atmosphere, enthusiasm and optimism and a team marked by commitment and energy. When you meet our franchisees, you clearly see they're brimming with confidence, reaching higher and expecting to achieve and grow.
The Tools Group is marked by growth but was also driven by Snap-on Value Creation. It's always a critical component of the group's progress. Authoring new innovative -- authoring innovative new products, sometimes just an improvement on an established line but making work easier, solving new problems, delivering productivity gains from observing the work in shops on a daily basis. 
An example to that is our -- is the Snap-on 312CF heavy-duty diagonal cutters manufactured off the road in our Milwaukee plant. The next generation of our most powerful diagonal cutting pliers, utilizing Milwaukee's sophisticated coal forging technology. They've been redesigned for better overall strength, substantially increased cutting performance and longer life, more precise cutting edges and a repositioned pivot point for increased leverage. 
The 312, using both those edges and the new leverage, the 312CF cuts material ranging from plastic cable ties to hardened spring steel, tremendous versatility. And the pliers' head has been improved. Our designers better pinpointed the failure point, added material in those places, reducing the breakage of even when these pliers are engaged in the toughest tasks. 
And we matched it all with the latest in Snap-on cushion grips. Our customer [indiscernible] that there was a great need for pliers with improved versatility, durability and comfort. The 312CF provides just that. And we expect strong sales even in an established category. 
Also in the quarter, the Tools Group introduced the low-profile swivel impact socket set. Now we've been selling sockets for I'd say a long time. But this new set expands our line of confined space solutions. With a reduced height provide better -- provide better access to fasteners, great for tight engine compartments, underneath spaces and any difficult-to-reach area. The new design also features -- it features laser-welded pivot points, and the well beads are machine-flushed to the socket for improved safety. It has a smooth full 30-degree swivel action for more efficient power, power and access, just what's needed for the tight spaces and the challenging task of today's more complex engine compartment. 
Snap-on innovation. A tradition in Snap-on since 1920 but we believe getting much better, helping technicians perform their work more efficiently and enabling solutions in a rapid changing environment. But the Tools Group is not just product. It's also based on amplifying the capability our franchisees and the power of our network. 
The Rock 'N Roll Pads and the Express are great examples of that. But now we're also enabling our team with the Express Plus system, supporting multiple mobile terminals. A number of our franchisees have chosen to add [indiscernible] Chrome Express Plus enables that making it possible to multiply selling time and to reach more customers. It's another clear opportunity for more growth. 
And we can't talk about the Tools without speaking of its strategic partner, our Financial Services team, tapping the power and insight of our franchisees, financing big-ticket sales, serving as the greatest tools business, and you can see it in the strategic relationships playing out visibly in the quarter's results. 
Now let's speak of RS&I. First quarter organic sales growth, 3.1% led by sales to independent shop owners and managers. Operating earnings of $69 million, up $5.1 million from 2015. The operating margin, 24.7%, a rise of 120 basis points. 
RS&I. We're clearly seeing the power of RS&I -- RCI, Rapid Continuous Improvement driving margin expansion. It's evident again this quarter in the strong earnings. Our [indiscernible] successful handheld -- successful line of handheld diagnostic well received in the market, driving growth throughout independent repair shops. 
While in the first quarter, that advantage was again highlighted publicly our edge and our handhelds were honored by [indiscernible] both recognized by that magazine as a top 10 tool. The edge, faster processing larger screen [indiscernible] all combining for the fastest fixes. It's the tool for experienced technicians. 
And the with its considerable functionality and attractive price point, great for the first time diagnostic buyer. Both handheld -- both handhelds were selected by the technicians and shop owners who use these tools everyday and [indiscernible] digest. 
One clear reason why the RS&I margins have continued to climb all these quarters is the ongoing stream of innovation made possible by customer connections with professional tool users. An example of that in the quarter, in this quarter, our RS&I launched its -- and shipped, launched and shipped its new advanced touchscreen diagnostic workstation. It features our most powerful diagnostic tool, the Edge Handheld, and it's paired with a customer for easy mobility and a large 27-inch touchscreen monitor for increased readability and productivity. This workstation, all of this visibly reinforcing an independent repair shop's capabilities, building that customer confidence so important in an environment of rising vehicle technology. 
In addition, this quarter, our division launched what we believe to be a game-changer, the V3300 wheel aligner, a next-generation unit targeted specifically at specialty shops and dealerships, faster readings, real-time data to the technician and a significant reduction in cycle time. We already see the enthusiastic feedback in just a few weeks from a wide range of potential customers, and we're confident it's another share taker. 
Finally, RS&I continued expansion into heavy-duty -- into the heavy-duty segment, strengthening the Snap-on PRO-LINK Ultra's position as the go-to handheld in big truck shops, adding coverage, enhancing functionality and building an expanding presence in heavy-duty repair shops across the U.S 
So that's the highlights. Continued progress, organic sales rising 2.5%, gains achieved through Snap-on Value Creation Processes, especially innovation in RCI, strengthening our businesses and driving to an 18.6% opco operating margin up substantially. And in the face of currency and industry headwinds, EPS of $2.16, up 15.5%. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo."

Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $834.2 million were up 2.5% organically, primarily reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, partially offset by lower sales to critical industries in our C&I segment. 
On a reported basis, net sales, which included $16.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $2.6 million of acquisition-related sales, increased $6.4 million or just under 1% from 2015 levels. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q1 sales comparisons by 200 basis points.
Consolidated gross margin of 49.8% improved 30 basis points from 2015 levels as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $259.9 million yielded an operating expense margin of 31.2% in the quarter, an improvement of 160 basis points from last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, lower stock-based mark-to-market compensation and other expenses as well as lower pension expense. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $155.4 million, including $7.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.7% as compared to the prior year, and as a percentage of sales, increased 190 basis points to 18.6%. 
Financial Services revenue of $66.3 million in the quarter increased 15.5% from 2015 levels, and operating earnings of $47 million increased 16.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.
Consolidated operating earnings of $202.4 million, including $8.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 13.6%, and the operating margin of 22.5% increased 240 basis points from 20.1% a year ago. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 32% last year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full year 2015 rate of 31.7%. Finally, net earnings of $128.3 million or $2.16 per share increased $17.8 million or $0.29 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 15.5% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial or C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $287 million in the first quarter decreased 1.3% organically, primarily due to a double-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries. This decline was partially offset by double-digit increase in the segment's Asia Pacific operations, a high single-digit gain in the segment's Power Tools operations and a mid-single-digit sales increase from the segment's European-based hand tools business. 
Gross profit in the C&I Group of $110.5 million compared to $116.5 million last year. The gross margin of 38.5% decreased 70 basis points, primarily due to a decrease in higher gross margin sales to customers in critical industries and 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. 
Operating expenses of $69.4 million in the quarter compared to $72.5 million last year. The operating expense margin of 24.2% improved 20 basis points from 24.4% last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.1 million, including $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $2.9 million from 2015 levels and the operating margin of 14.3% compared to 14.8% last year.
Turning now to Slide 8. First quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $402.5 million increased 8.1% organically, reflecting a high single-digit gain in the company's U.S. franchise operations and a mid-single-digit increase in the company's international franchise operations. 
Sales gains continue to reflect strong demand, including for big-ticket items such as tool storage and diagnostics. Gross profit of $173.2 million compared to $166.3 million last year. The gross margin of 43% decreased 100 basis points, for the most part due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Our operating expenses were $106.5 million in both the first quarters of 2016 and 2015. The operating expense margin of 26.4% improved 180 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives as well as 50 basis points of lower stock-based costs associated with the company's franchisee stock purchase plan. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $66.7 million, including $4.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.9 million, and the operating margin of 16.6% improved 80 basis points from 15.8% last year.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group, showed on Slide 9. First quarter sales of $278.8 million increased 3.1% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products, low single-digit increases in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. 
Gross profit of $131.6 million compared to $127.3 million last year. Gross margin of 47.2% improved 40 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $62.6 million in the quarter compared to $63.4 million last year. The operating expense margin of 22.5% improved 80 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives.
First quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $69 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $5.1 million from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 24.7% improved 120 basis points from 23.5% last year.
Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $47 million on revenue of $66.3 million compared with operating earnings of $40.3 million on revenue of $57.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared with 17.7% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $264.6 million in the quarter increased 14.7% from 2015 levels.
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.6 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.4 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 81% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. 
In the first quarter of 2016, our worldwide Financial Services portfolio grew $53.3 million, continuing to reflect the previously mentioned higher sales of big-ticket items by the Snap-on Tools Group. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $141.6 million in the quarter increased $63.5 million from comparable 2015 levels, due in part to higher 2016 net earnings and lower growth in working investment as compared to the prior year. Net cash used by investing activities of $79.6 million included $56.8 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $19.5 million in the quarter compared with $18.1 million last year.
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days compared with 60 days in 2015 year-end. Inventories increased $13.8 million from 2015 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand in the auto repair sector and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.4 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end.
Our quarter-end cash position of $106.3 million increased $13.5 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $174.1 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $141.6 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $230.9 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $35.4 million, the repurchase of 157,000 shares for $23.1 million and $19.5 million for capital expenditures. 
Our net debt to capital ratio of 23.6% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end. In addition to our $106.3 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we had more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of the first quarter end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

We believe it's a period that authors strong confidence going forward, authoring or auguring progress along our runways for both improvement and growth. 
Enhancing the Van channel, the Tools Group grew 8.1% organically and the OI margin reached 16.6%, up 80 basis points. Franchisees confident and committed, a stream of exciting new hit products and a continuing line of ways to wield the Van channel more powerfully. The Rock 'N Roll to the Express and now the Chrome Express Plus, enabling the franchisees to reach more customers. 
Expanding to repair shop owners and managers. Sales up 3.1%, OI margin rising 120 basis points to 25.7%, great products. The V3300 aligner, the ETHOS and the SOLUS handheld, meeting the growing complexity of vehicle repair. 
Building in emerging markets, expanding the physicals, sales increasing in a varying landscape. And finally, extending to critical industries, turbulence, but we still see progress clear to us in terms of expanding product lines aimed at solving the critical in those sectors outside the garage. 
And you can't look at our quarter without seeing the hallmarks of Snap-on Value Creation, driving improvement against the difficulties, authoring an OI margin of 18.6%, up substantially versus last year again. 
And when you add that opco performance to our Financial Services progress, it rolls together for an EPS of $2.16, up 15.5%, extending our trend of rising profitability. A 15.5% rise in what most would call a turbulent environment. We believe it was an encouraging quarter and one which points clearly to continue in the significant gains as we move forward.
Not before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate that I say words to our franchisees and associates. Once again, I know many of you are listening. The progress of our first quarter most clearly reflects your extraordinary capability and your unique dedication.

So when I talk about franchisees, they almost never really mention the competition. Although I'm sure it's formidable, they mention about how we can improve back on ourselves. And I'm seeing no change in that really. And I think the Tools Group numbers seems to say that. I mean, their numbers look pretty good. I mean, they continually [indiscernible] they've been up 6% or greater 23 of 24 quarters. One of the things I like to say about that and I think one of the investment thesis about Snap-on is that Snap-on is a company that has so much more to do, so many more places to grow and improve. And the Tools Group, the Van channel has been around for decades and yet they've been able to do this by creating a better -- be able to expand so dramatically by creating greater product and figuring out through things like these Rock 'N Roll and T Chrome Express Plus how to wield those vans more effectively.

Really the $21 million kind of compares to the $25 million run rate if you really want to think of it in those terms. If you talk about operating expense, yes, in operating expense, there's that mark-to-market and the pension expense that's in there that's making some of the improvements in operating expense. What we do is when we look at our numbers, we say this: yes, we got good news from mark-to-market but we got bad news from currency. They balance mark-to-market and pension currency and we still grew EPS at 15.5%."

As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter, and along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, on our markets, on the progress we've made and on what we believe it all",2479,"Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter, and along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, on our markets, on the progress we've made and on what we believe it all means. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.
We believe that our first quarter provided confirmation of Snap-on's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, overcoming headwinds, advancing along our runways for both growth and improvement. Our EPS in the quarter was $2.16, up from last year's $1.87. That rise includes an opco operating margin of 18.6%, an increase of 190 basis points. 
When you combine those opco gains with earnings of $47 million from Financial Services, it brings Snap-on's consolidated operating margin to 22.5%, up from the 20.1% in 2015. And that EPS, $2.16, it represents an increase of 15.5% over last year. That improvement came on a organic sales growth of 2.5% and the continuing contributions from our Snap-on Value Creation Processes. The suite of principles we use everyday around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI. Once again, you can see it in the results. Those processes contributed strongly to the earnings climb. 
Our reported sales in the quarter of $834.2 million were up 80 basis points, and that gain included 200 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Now currency has been a headwind for some time, both to sales and to profit, but we've been able to overcome with the help of Snap-on Value Creation, especially with innovation and with RCI. 
Innovation, taking practical insight and matching it with the latest technology, generating product excitement while making work easier for professionals with an array of new products. You see, that's been part of our DNA from the very beginning in 1920, and we're only getting better at doing it. There are more new products than ever before. 
RCI, ongoing improvements, finding operating efficiency and achieving cost reduction up and down and across the corporation. Innovation and RCI overcoming the challenges, extending the trend of rising profits again. 
Now let's consider the markets, the markets we serve. The first quarter once again highlighted the extensive opportunities of the auto repair segment. More solutions to service the growing complexities of new vehicles, requiring advanced solutions, and an aging fleet, driving more repairs. Both factors in play, not only in the United States but worldwide. And the numbers of our quarter reflect those tailwind. They show -- and they not only reflect the tailwinds, they show our ability to take advantage, to progress down our runways for growth. 
Consider the Tools Group. Organic sales up 8.1%, clearly enhancing the Van channel, providing innovative new tools to engage continually changing tests, making work easier for technicians, and our franchise team more prosperous and more powerful.
And Repair Systems & Information, or our RS&I Group, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage, capitalizing on a broader product line, growth across all the divisions, but most notably, in diagnostic and repair information businesses -- in the diagnostic and repair information businesses serving independent repair shop owners, let me add.
C&I, well, it includes the businesses that serve critical industries and is the most international of our group. And in the quarter, the results show the challenges of turbulent industrial sectors, and the difficulties of a few troubled geographies. 
In critical industries, the headwinds from the fourth quarter continued, and they were a bit more pronounced. Sales to the U.S. Military and to oil and gas customers were down significantly, with both segments showing the impact of the ongoing measured spending and budget constraints. At the same time, we saw dips in some international markets, specifically the Middle East, where aerospace project activity was down, due in part to macro developments in that turbulent -- in that region. Pretty turbulent there.
That said -- all of that said, C&I did demonstrate strength. SNA Europe delivered mid-single-digit growth, mid-single-digit growth in places like the U.K., Spain and the Nordic region, while Asia Pacific registered double-digit increases in countries like India, Thailand and Indonesia. So overall, I'd describe our C&I markets as mixed, turbulence and strength. 
These challenges -- but were also encourages -- encouraged by the advancements, taking advantage of the opportunities that are available. And when coupled with a string of positive performances surrounding our auto repair-related businesses, on a whole, we believe there's clear progress along our runways for growth. 
Enhancing the Van network, expanding where repair shop owners and managers, building in emerging markets and yes, extending to critical industry. Even in this quarter, we can see progress in our growing product line and our increasing understanding of the work, all of that creating confidence in our forward trajectory across those critical sectors. That's the overview of the markets.
Now let's move to the segments. In the C&I Group, organic sales were down 1.3% with declines in the critical industries a little attenuated by gains in SNA Europe, Asia Pacific and the Power Tools division. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.1 million, representing an operating margin of 14.3%, a decrease of 50 basis points, pretty much authored by lower sales in our higher-margin critical industry business. But as I said, we do remain committed to extending in critical industries, and we'll keep strengthening our position to capture new business as the segment improves. You can see this, particularly on our innovative new products, fortifying our ability to make work easier outside the garage in a range of industrial settings. 
One new product family in that category is -- in our collection is the Snap-on 3/4-inch flank drive 12-point impact socket. You pick these up, they're a handful. Big but effective and durable, aimed at power generation, mining and -- the mining and oil and gas sectors, perfect for turning large bolts on wind turbine engines, earthmoving equipment, oil wells, multiple other places. Any place where heavy work gets done. They're ideal for pneumatic or hydraulic bolting systems and incorporates Snap-on's flank drive, which moves stresses away from fastener points, delivering more turning power right in the field without slipping or rounding off a fastener. Those sockets are made down in Alabama at our Elkmont plant, and they're a great addition to our tool line, they fill a vital need for our critical industry customers. 
Now in past quarters, I'm sure you may remember that we discussed Snap-on's lineup of tool control solutions, safeguarding the assets and improving productivity. I've spoken about our innovative and sophisticated automated tool control system or ATC, the smart tool storage unit, which electronically keeps track of the who, the when and the where of individual tool usage. It's popular. 
While in the quarter, our industrial division introduced its latest and another version of Tool Control, the Snap-on 5S Dual Visual Control Cabinet. The 5S Duo off-the-shelf or custom built, utilizes visible control trace to quickly identify missing tools with the help of custom-cut foam or with -- foam or with CAD design tool silhouettes. It's a perfect addition to any place where work is performed with an [indiscernible] tool storage, like assembly lines, and where the shop is aiming to drive improvements through 5S or RCI. 
Now I mentioned the strength of SNA Europe, and the continuing advancement there was clearly evident in its mid-single-digit sales gains, marking now 10 straight quarters of year-over-year sales progress across several challenged geographies. And once again, sales rose but profits were up more, now the 12th straight quarter of margin improvement. 
And speaking of gains, our Asia Pacific division, an area of strong potential, and these days, of significant variation. We're building our principal capabilities and we saw progress in the quarter, with sales rising compared to last year. 
So now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales increased 8.1%. The operating margin of 16.6% was up nicely versus the 15.8% recorded last year, the Tools Group. The results continue to speak for themselves. Ongoing progress along their runway for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise channel. And there's abundant evidence of growing strength, of an ongoing positive trajectory across that channel, all on display in our franchisee metrics. Important financial and physical indicators like cash, like turnover, we monitor those metrics very closely. And again this quarter, they're favorable across the board and they continue to trend upward. 
There's also evidence in sort of anecdotal and direct interaction with the franchisees at events this year, like our January kickoff meetings held all over the network. Orders were up considerably. And atmosphere, enthusiasm and optimism and a team marked by commitment and energy. When you meet our franchisees, you clearly see they're brimming with confidence, reaching higher, and expecting to achieve and grow.
The Tools Group is marked by growth but was also driven by Snap-on Value Creation. It's always a critical component of the group's progress. Authoring new innovative -- authoring innovative new products, sometimes just an improvement on an established line, but making work easier, solving new problems, delivering productivity gains from observing the work in shops on a daily basis. 
An example to that is our -- is the Snap-on 312CF heavy-duty diagonal cutters manufactured up the road in our Milwaukee plant. The next generation of our most powerful diagonal cutting pliers, utilizing Milwaukee's sophisticated coal forging technology. They've been redesigned for better overall strength, substantially increased cutting performance and a longer life, more precise cutting edges and a repositioned pivot point for increased leverage. 
The 312, using both those edges and the new leverage, the 312CF cuts material ranging from plastic cable ties to hardened spring steel, tremendous versatility. And the pliers' head has been improved. Our designers better pinpointed the failure points, added material in those places, reducing the breakage of -- tip breakage, even when these pliers are engaged in their toughest tasks. 
And we matched it all with the latest in Snap-on cushion grips. Our customer connection showed that there was a great need for pliers with improved versatility, durability and comfort. The 312CF provides just that. And we expect strong sales even in an established category. 
Also in the quarter, the Tools Group introduced the low-profile swivel impact socket set. Now we've been selling sockets for I'd say a long time. But this new set expands our line of confined space solutions. With a reduced hex height provide better -- that reduced height provides better access to fasteners, great for tight engine compartments, underneath dash spaces and any difficult-to-reach area. The new design also features -- it features laser-welded pivot points, and the weld beads are machine-flushed to the socket for improved appearance and safety. It has a smooth full 30-degree swivel action for more efficient power, power and access, just what's needed for the tight spaces and the challenging task of today's more complex engine compartments. 
Snap-on innovation. A tradition in Snap-on since 1920 but we believe getting much better, helping technicians perform their work more efficiently and enabling solutions in a rapid changing environment. But the Tools Group is not just product. It's also based on amplifying the capability of our franchisees and the power of our network. 
The Rock 'N Roll Cab and the TechKnow Express are great examples of that. But now we're also enabling our team with the Chrome Express Plus system, supporting multiple mobile terminals. A number of our franchisees have chosen to add an assistant to the route. Well Chrome Express Plus enables that add, making it possible to multiply selling time and to reach more customers. It's another clear opportunity for more growth. 
And we can't talk about the Tools without speaking of its strategic partner, our Financial Services team, tapping the power and insight of our franchisees, financing big-ticket sales, serving as a great assist to our tools business, and you can see it in the strategic relationships playing out vividly in the quarter's results. 
Now let's speak of RS&I. First quarter organic sales growth, 3.1% led by sales to independent shop owners and managers. Operating earnings of $69 million, up $5.1 million from 2015. The operating margin, 24.7%, a rise of 120 basis points. 
RS&I. We're clearly seeing the power of RS&I -- RCI, Rapid Continuous Improvement driving margin expansion. It's evident again in this quarter in the strong earnings. I'll also speak of the successful handheld -- our successful line of handheld diagnostic units, well received in the market, driving growth throughout independent repair shops. 
Well in the first quarter, that advantage was again highlighted, publicly. Our SOLUS edge and our ETHOS Tech handhelds were honored by Undercar Digest, both recognized by that magazine as a top 10 tool. The SOLUS edge, faster processing, a larger screen ,the power of Mitchell 1 SureTrack, all combining for the fastest fixes. It's the tool for experienced technicians. 
And the ETHOS Tech, with its considerable functionality and attractive price point, great for the first time diagnostic buyer. Both handheld -- both handhelds were selected by the votes of technicians and shop owners who use these tools everyday and read Undercar Digest. 
One clear reason why the RS&I margins have continued to climb all these quarters, is the ongoing stream of innovations made possible by customer connections with professional tool users. An example of that in the quarter -- in this quarter, our RS&I launched its -- and shipped, launched and shipped its new advanced touchscreen diagnostic workstation. It features our most powerful diagnostic tool, the VERUS Edge Handheld, and it's paired with a custom roll cart for easy mobility and a large 27-inch touchscreen monitor for increased readability and productivity. This workstation, all of this, visibly reinforcing an independent repair shop's capabilities, building that customer confidence, so important in an environment of rising vehicle technology. 
In addition, this quarter, our equipment division launched, what we believe to be a game-changer, the V3200 wheel aligner, a next-generation unit, targeted specifically at specialty shops and dealerships. Faster readings, real-time data to the technician and a significant reduction in cycle time. We've already received enthusiastic feedback in just a few weeks from a wide range of potential customers, and we're confident it's another share taker. 
Finally, RS&I continued its expansion into heavy-duty -- into the heavy-duty segment, strengthening the Snap-on PRO-LINK Ultra's position as the go-to handheld in big truck shops, adding coverage, enhancing functionality and building an expanding presence in the heavy-duty repair shops across the U.S 
So that's the highlights. Continued progress, organic sales rising 2.5%, gains achieved through Snap-on Value Creation Processes, especially innovation in RCI, strengthening our businesses and driving to an 18.6% opco operating margin up substantially. And in the face of currency and industry headwinds, EPS of $2.16, up 15.5%. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo."

Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $834.2 million were up 2.5% organically, primarily reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, partially offset by lower sales to",1348,"Thanks, Nick. Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $834.2 million were up 2.5% organically, primarily reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, partially offset by lower sales to critical industries in our C&I segment. 
On a reported basis, net sales, which included $16.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $2.6 million of acquisition-related sales, increased $6.4 million or just under 1% from 2015 levels. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q1 sales comparisons by 200 basis points.
Consolidated gross margin of 49.8% improved 30 basis points from 2015 levels as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $259.9 million yielded an operating expense margin of 31.2% in the quarter, an improvement of 160 basis points from last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, lower stock-based mark-to-market compensation and other expenses as well as a lower pension expense. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $155.4 million, including $7.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.7% as compared to the prior year, and as a percentage of sales, increased 190 basis points to 18.6%. 
Financial Services revenue of $66.3 million in the quarter increased 15.5% from 2015 levels, and operating earnings of $47 million increased 16.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.
Consolidated operating earnings of $202.4 million, including $8.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 13.6%, and the operating margin of 22.5% increased 240 basis points from 20.1% a year ago. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 32% last year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full year 2015 rate of 31.7%. Finally, net earnings of $128.3 million or $2.16 per share increased $17.8 million or $0.29 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 15.5% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial or C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $287 million in the first quarter decreased 1.3% organically, primarily due to a double-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries. This decline was partially offset by a double-digit increase in the segment's Asia Pacific operations, a high single-digit gain in the segment's Power Tools operations, and a mid-single-digit sales increase from the segment's European-based hand tools business. 
Gross profit in the C&I Group of $110.5 million compared to $116.5 million last year. The gross margin of 38.5% decreased 70 basis point, primarily due to a decrease in the higher gross margin sales to customers in critical industries and 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. 
Operating expenses of $69.4 million in the quarter compared to $72.5 million last year. The operating expense margin of 24.2% improved 20 basis points from 24.4% last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.1 million, including $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $2.9 million from 2015 levels and the operating margin of 14.3% compared to 14.8% last year.
Turning now to Slide 8. First quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $402.5 million increased 8.1% organically, reflecting a high single-digit gain in the company's U.S. franchise operations and a mid-single-digit increase in the company's international franchise operations. 
Sales gains continue to reflect strong demand, including for big-ticket items such as tool storage and diagnostics. Gross profit of $173.2 million compared to $166.3 million last year. The gross margin of 43% decreased 100 basis points, for the most part due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Our operating expenses were $106.5 million in both the first quarters of 2016 and 2015. The operating expense margin of 26.4% improved 180 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives as well as 50 basis points of lower stock-based cost associated with the company's franchisee stock purchase plan. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $66.7 million, including $4.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.9 million, and the operating margin of 16.6% improved 80 basis points from 15.8% last year.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group, showed on Slide 9. First quarter sales of $278.8 million increased 3.1% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products, low single-digit increases in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. 
Gross profit of $131.6 million compared to $127.3 million last year. Gross margin of 47.2% improved 40 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $62.6 million in the quarter compared to $63.4 million last year. The operating expense margin of 22.5% improved 80 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives.
First quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $69 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $5.1 million from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 24.7% improved 120 basis points from 23.5% last year.
Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $47 million on revenue of $66.3 million compared with operating earnings of $40.3 million on revenue of $57.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared with 17.7% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $264.6 million in the quarter increased 14.7% from 2015 levels.
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.6 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.4 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 81% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. 
In the first quarter of 2016, our worldwide Financial Services portfolio grew $53.3 million, continuing to reflect the previously mentioned higher sales of big-ticket items by the Snap-on Tools Group. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $141.6 million in the quarter increased $63.5 million from comparable 2015 levels, due in part to higher 2016 net earnings and lower growth in working investment as compared to the prior year. Net cash used by investing activities of $79.6 million included $56.8 million to fund a net increase in the finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $19.5 million in the quarter compared with $18.1 million last year.
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days compared with 60 days in 2015 year-end. Inventories increased $13.8 million from 2015 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand in the auto repair sector and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.4 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end.
Our quarter-end cash position of $106.3 million increased $13.5 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $174.1 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $141.6 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $230.9 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $35.4 million, the repurchase of 157,000 shares for $23.1 million and $19.5 million for capital expenditures. 
Our net debt to capital ratio of 23.6% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end. In addition to our $106.3 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we had more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of the first quarter end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

We believe it's a period that authors strong confidence going forward, authoring or auguring progress along our runways for both improvement and growth. 
Enhancing the Van channel, the Tools Group grew 8.1% organically and the OI margin reached 16.6%, up 80 basis points. Franchisees, confident and committed, a stream of exciting new hit products and a continuing line of ways to wield the Van channel more powerfully. The Rock 'N Roll Cab to the TechKnow Express, and now, the Chrome Express Plus, enabling the franchisees to reach more customers. 
Expanding to repair shop owners and managers. Sales up 3.1%, OI margin rising 120 basis points to 25.7%, great products. The V3300 aligner, the ETHOS and the SOLUS handheld, meeting the growing complexity of vehicle repair. 
Building in emerging markets, expanding the physicals, sales increasing in a varying landscape. And finally, extending to critical industries, turbulence, but we still see progress clear to us in terms of expanding product lines aimed at solving the critical in those sectors outside the garage. 
And you can't look at our quarter without seeing the hallmarks of Snap-on Value Creation, driving improvement against the difficulties, authoring an OI margin of 18.6%, up substantially versus last year again. 
And when you add that opco performance to our Financial Services progress, it rolls together for an EPS of $2.16, up 15.5%, extending our trend of rising profitability. A 15.5% rise in what most would call a turbulent environment. We believe it was an encouraging quarter, and one which points clearly to continuing the significant gains as we move forward.
Now before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate that I say words to the -- our franchisees and associates.

So when I talk about franchisees, they almost never really mention the competition. Although I'm sure it's formidable, they mention about how we can improve back on ourselves. And I'm seeing no change in that, really. And I think the Tools Group numbers seems to say that. I mean, their numbers look pretty good. I mean, they continually make themselves. They've been up, 6% or greater, 23 of 24 quarters. One of the things, I'd like to say about that, and I think one of the investment thesis about Snap-on is that Snap-on's a company that has so much more to do, so many more places to grow and improve. And the Tools Group, the Van channel has been around for decades and yet they've been able to do this by creating a bigger -- be able to expand, so dramatically, by creating a greater [indiscernible] new product and figuring out through things like these Rock 'N Roll Cabs and TechKnow Express and now, Chrome Express Plus, how to wield those vans more effectively.

They're spending time thinking about how to deal with credit. And the better guy, the top-end guys are what we call the platinum elite. And what this really means, Richard, is, certain franchisees can judge credit, can add to our credit model. We have -- our credit process is like this one, somebody applies, we have the standard credit bureau look. We have our customized scoring model. And then we ask what does the franchisee think? We try to look at the potential borrower through the lens of the franchisee's eyes. And some of them are much better than others at giving us the information on that. And the better they are, the more repeatable they are in standing behind people, the more we say -- the higher the level they are. So platinum elite people, we listen to more, and therefore might take on borrowers, which we wouldn't normally, based on standardized credit or a customized scoring model. That's how it works, really. And we've been doing this -- we've actually been doing this for some time over -- it's been -- platinum's probably been in place for several -- a number of years. Platinum elite is a more recent event. But it basically, as you get more confidence in the franchisees, you tend to be -- they tend to guide you a little bit more effectively, you have more opportunities to wield credit. But no change in the credit model."

As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter, and along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, on our markets, on the progress we've made and on what we believe it all",2481,"Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter, and along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, on our markets, on the progress we've made and on what we believe it all means. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.
We believe that our first quarter provided confirmation of Snap-on's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, overcoming headwinds, advancing along our runways for both growth and improvement. Our EPS in the quarter was $2.16, up from last year's $1.87. That rise includes an opco operating margin of 18.6%, an increase of 190 basis points. 
When you combine those opco gains with earnings of $47 million from Financial Services, it brings Snap-on's consolidated operating margin to 22.5%, up from the 20.1% in 2015. And that EPS, $2.16, it represents an increase of 15.5% over last year. That improvement came on an organic sales growth of 2.5% and the continuing contributions from our Snap-on Value Creation Processes. The suite of principles we use every day around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI. Once again, you can see it in the results. Those processes contributed strongly to the earnings climb. 
Our reported sales in the quarter of $834.2 million were up 80 basis points, and that gain included 200 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Now currency has been a headwind for some time, both to sales and to profit, but we've been able to overcome with the help of Snap-on Value Creation, especially with innovation and with RCI. 
Innovation, taking practical insight and matching it with the latest technology, generating product excitement while making work easier for professionals with an array of new products. You see, that's been part of our DNA from the very beginning in 1920, and we're only getting better at doing it. There are more new products than ever before. 
RCI, ongoing improvements, finding operating efficiency and achieving cost reduction up and down and across the corporation. Innovation and RCI overcoming the challenges, extending the trend of rising profits, again. 
Now let's consider the markets, the markets we serve. The first quarter once again highlighted the extensive opportunities of the auto repair segment. More solutions to service the growing complexities of new vehicles, requiring advanced solutions, and an aging fleet, driving more repairs. Both factors in play, not only in the United States but worldwide. And the numbers of our quarter reflect those tailwinds. They show -- and they not only reflect the tailwinds, they show our ability to take advantage, to progress down our runways for growth. 
Consider the Tools Group. Organic sales up 8.1%, clearly enhancing the Van channel, providing innovative new tools to engage continually changing tasks, making work easier for technicians, and our franchise team more prosperous and more powerful.
And Repair Systems & Information, or our RS&I Group, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage, capitalizing on a broader product line, growth across all the divisions, but most notably, in diagnostic and repair information businesses -- in the diagnostic and repair information businesses serving independent repair shop owners and managers.
C&I, well, it includes the businesses that serve critical industries and is the most international of our group. And in the quarter, the results show the challenges of turbulent industrial sectors, and the difficulties of a few troubled geographies. 
In critical industries, the headwinds from the fourth quarter continued, and they were a bit more pronounced. Sales to the U.S. Military and to oil and gas customers were down significantly, with both segments showing the impact of the ongoing measured spending and budget constraints. At the same time, we saw dips in some international markets, specifically the Middle East, where aerospace project activity was down, due in part to macro developments in that turbulent -- in that region. Pretty turbulent there.
That said -- all of that said, C&I did demonstrate strength. SNA Europe delivered mid-single-digit growth, mid-single-digit growth in places like the U.K., Spain and the Nordic region, while Asia Pacific registered double-digit increases in countries like India, Thailand and Indonesia. So overall, I'd describe our C&I markets as mixed, turbulence and strength. 
These challenges -- but were also encourages -- encouraged by the advancements, taking advantage of the opportunities that are available. And when coupled with a string of positive performances surrounding our auto repair-related businesses, on the whole, we believe there's clear progress along our runways for growth. 
Enhancing the Van network, expanding where -- our repair shop owners and managers, building in emerging markets and yes, extending to critical industry. Even in this quarter, we can see progress in our growing product line and our increasing understanding of the work, all of that creating confidence in our forward trajectory across those critical sectors. That's the overview of the markets.
Now let's move to the segments. In the C&I Group, organic sales were down 1.3% with declines in the critical industries, attenuated by gains in SNA Europe, Asia Pacific and the Power Tools division. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.1 million, representing an operating margin of 14.3%, a decrease of 50 basis points, pretty much authored by lower sales in our higher-margin critical industry business. But as I said, we do remain committed to extending in critical industries, and we'll keep strengthening our position to capture new business as the segment improves. You can see this, particularly on our innovative new products, fortifying our ability to make work easier outside the garage in a range of industrial settings. 
One new product family in that category is -- in our collection is the Snap-on 3/4-inch flank drive 12-point impact socket. You pick these up, they're a handful. Big, but effective and durable, aimed at power generation, mining and -- the mining and oil and gas sectors, perfect for turning large bolts on wind turbine engines, earthmoving equipment, oil wells, multiple other places. Any place where heavy work gets done. They're ideal for pneumatic or hydraulic bolting systems and incorporates Snap-on's flank drive, which moves stresses away from fastener points, delivering more turning power right in the field without slipping or rounding off a fastener. Those sockets are made down in Alabama at our Elkmont plant, and they're a great addition to our tool line, they fill a vital need for our critical industry customers. 
Now in past quarters, I'm sure you may remember that we discussed Snap-on's lineup of tool control solutions, safeguarding the assets and improving productivity. I've spoken about our innovative and sophisticated automated tool control system or ATC, the smart tool storage unit, which electronically keeps track of the who, the when and the where of individual tool usage. It's popular. 
While in the quarter, our industrial division introduced its latest and another version of Tool Control, the Snap-on 5S Dual Visual Control Cabinet. The 5S Duo off-the-shelf or custom built, utilizes visible control trace to quickly identify missing tools with the help of custom-cut foam or with -- foam or with CAD design tool silhouettes. It's a perfect addition to any place where the work is performed within the sited tool storage, like assembly lines, and where the shop is aiming to drive improvements through 5S or RCI. 
Now I mentioned the strength of SNA Europe, and the continuing advancement there was clearly evident in its mid-single-digit sales gains, marking now 10 straight quarters of year-over-year sales progress across several challenged geographies. And once again, sales rose but profits were up more, now the 12th straight quarter of margin improvement. 
And speaking of gains, our Asia Pacific division, an area of strong potential and these days, of significant variation, we're building our physical capabilities and we saw progress in the quarter, with sales rising compared to last year. 
So now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales increased 8.1%. The operating margin of 16.6% was up nicely versus the 15.8% recorded last year, the Tools Group. The results continue to speak for themselves. Ongoing progress along their runway for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise channel. And there's abundant evidence of growing strength, of an ongoing positive trajectory across that channel, all on display in our franchisee metrics. Important financial and physical indicators like cash, like turnover, we monitor those metrics very closely. And again this quarter, they're favorable across the board and they continue to trend upward. 
There's also evidence in sort of anecdotal and direct interaction with the franchisees at events this year, like our January kickoff meetings held all over the network. Orders were up considerably. And atmosphere, enthusiasm and optimism and a team marked by commitment and energy. When you meet our franchisees, you clearly see they're brimming with confidence, reaching higher, and expecting to achieve and grow.
The Tools Group is marked by growth but was also driven by Snap-on Value Creation. It's always a critical component of the group's progress. Authoring new innovative -- authoring innovative new products, sometimes just an improvement on an established line, but making work easier, solving new problems, delivering productivity gains from observing the work in shops on a daily basis. 
An example to that is our -- is the Snap-on 312CF heavy-duty diagonal cutters manufactured up the road in our Milwaukee plant. The next generation of our most powerful diagonal cutting pliers, utilizing Milwaukee's sophisticated coal forging technology. They've been redesigned for better overall strength, substantially increased cutting performance and a longer life, more precise cutting edges and a repositioned pivot point for increased leverage. 
The 312, using both those edges and the new leverage, the 312CF cuts material ranging from plastic cable ties to hardened spring steel, tremendous versatility. And the pliers' head has been improved. Our designers better pinpointed the failure points, added material in those places, reducing the breakage of -- tip breakage, even when these pliers are engaged in their toughest tasks. 
And we matched it all with the latest in Snap-on cushion grips. Our customer connection showed that there was a great need for pliers with improved versatility, durability and comfort. The 312CF provides just that. And we expect strong sales even in an established category. 
Also in the quarter, the Tools Group introduced the low-profile swivel impact socket set. Now we've been selling sockets for I'd say a long time. But this new set expands our line of confined space solutions. With a reduced hex height provide better -- that reduced height provides better access to fasteners, great for tight engine compartments, underneath dash spaces and any difficult-to-reach area. The new design also features -- it features laser-welded pivot points, and the weld beads are machine-flushed to the socket for improved appearance and safety. It has a smooth full 30-degree swivel action for more efficient power, power and access, just what's needed for the tight spaces and the challenging task of today's more complex engine compartments. 
Snap-on innovation. A tradition in Snap-on since 1920 but we believe getting much better, helping technicians perform their work more efficiently and enabling solutions in a rapid changing environment. But the Tools Group is not just product. It's also based on amplifying the capability of our franchisees and the power of our network. 
The Rock 'N Roll Cab and the TechKnow Express are great examples of that. But now we're also enabling our team with the Chrome Express Plus system, supporting multiple mobile terminals. A number of our franchisees have chosen to add an assistant to the route. Well Chrome Express Plus enables that add, making it possible to multiply selling time and to reach more customers. It's another clear opportunity for more growth. 
And we can't talk about the Tools without speaking of its strategic partner, our Financial Services team, tapping the power and insight of our franchisees, financing big-ticket sales, serving as a great assist to our tools business, and you can see it in the strategic relationships playing out vividly in the quarter's results. 
Now let's speak of RS&I. First quarter organic sales growth, 3.1% led by sales to independent shop owners and managers. Operating earnings of $69 million, up $5.1 million from 2015. The operating margin, 24.7%, a rise of 120 basis points. 
RS&I. We're clearly seeing the power of RS&I -- RCI, Rapid Continuous Improvement driving margin expansion. It's evident again in this quarter in the strong earnings. I'll also speak of the successful handheld -- our successful line of handheld diagnostic units, well received in the market, driving growth throughout independent repair shops. 
Well in the first quarter, that advantage was again highlighted, publicly. Our SOLUS edge and our ETHOS Tech handhelds were honored by Undercar Digest, both recognized by that magazine as a top 10 tool. The SOLUS edge, faster processing, a larger screen ,the power of Mitchell 1 SureTrack, all combining for the fastest fixes. It's the tool for experienced technicians. 
And the ETHOS Tech, with its considerable functionality and attractive price point, great for the first time diagnostic buyer. Both handheld -- both handhelds were selected by the votes of technicians and shop owners who use these tools every day and read Undercar Digest. 
One clear reason why the RS&I margins have continued to climb all these quarters, is the ongoing stream of innovations made possible by customer connections with professional tool users. An example of that in the quarter -- in this quarter, our RS&I launched its -- and shipped, launched and shipped its new advanced touchscreen diagnostic workstation. It features our most powerful diagnostic tool, the VERUS Edge Handheld, and it's paired with a custom roll cart for easy mobility and a large 27-inch touchscreen monitor for increased readability and productivity. This workstation, all of this, visibly reinforcing an independent repair shop's capabilities, building that customer confidence, so important in an environment of rising vehicle technology. 
In addition, this quarter, our equipment division launched what we believe to be a game-changer, the V3300 wheel aligner, a next-generation unit, targeted specifically at specialty shops and dealerships. Faster readings, real-time data to the technician and a significant reduction in cycle time. We've already received enthusiastic feedback in just a few weeks from a wide range of potential customers, and we're confident it's another share taker. 
Finally, RS&I continued its expansion into heavy-duty -- into the heavy-duty segment, strengthening the Snap-on PRO-LINK Ultra's position as the go-to handheld in big truck shops, adding coverage, enhancing functionality and building an expanding presence in the heavy-duty repair shops across the U.S 
So that's the highlights. Continued progress, organic sales rising 2.5%, gains achieved through Snap-on Value Creation Processes, especially innovation in RCI, strengthening our businesses and driving to an 18.6% opco operating margin, up substantially. And in the face of currency and industry headwinds, EPS of $2.16, up 15.5%. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo."

Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $834.2 million were up 2.5% organically, primarily reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, partially offset by lower sales to critical industries in our C&I segment. 
On a reported basis, net sales, which included $16.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $2.6 million of acquisition-related sales, increased $6.4 million or just under 1% from 2015 levels. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q1 sales comparisons by 200 basis points.
Consolidated gross margin of 49.8% improved 30 basis points from 2015 levels as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $259.9 million yielded an operating expense margin of 31.2% in the quarter, an improvement of 160 basis points from last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, lower stock-based mark-to-market compensation and other expenses as well as a lower pension expense. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $155.4 million, including $7.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.7% as compared to the prior year, and as a percentage of sales, increased 190 basis points to 18.6%. 
Financial Services revenue of $66.3 million in the quarter increased 15.5% from 2015 levels, and operating earnings of $47 million increased 16.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.
Consolidated operating earnings of $202.4 million, including $8.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 13.6%, and the operating margin of 22.5% increased 240 basis points from 20.1% a year ago. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 32% last year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full year 2015 rate of 31.7%. Finally, net earnings of $128.3 million or $2.16 per share increased $17.8 million or $0.29 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 15.5% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial or C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $287 million in the first quarter decreased 1.3% organically, primarily due to a double-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries. This decline was partially offset by a double-digit increase in the segment's Asia Pacific operations, a high single-digit gain in the segment's Power Tools operations, and a mid-single-digit sales increase from the segment's European-based hand tools business. 
Gross profit in the C&I Group of $110.5 million compared to $116.5 million last year. The gross margin of 38.5% decreased 70 basis point, primarily due to a decrease in higher gross margin sales to customers in critical industries and 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. 
Operating expenses of $69.4 million in the quarter compared to $72.5 million last year. The operating expense margin of 24.2% improved 20 basis points from 24.4% last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.1 million, including $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $2.9 million from 2015 levels and the operating margin of 14.3% compared to 14.8% last year.
Turning now to Slide 8. First quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $402.5 million increased 8.1% organically, reflecting a high single-digit gain in the company's U.S. franchise operations and a mid-single-digit increase in the company's international franchise operations. 
Sales gains continue to reflect strong demand, including for big-ticket items such as tool storage and diagnostics. Gross profit of $173.2 million compared to $166.3 million last year. The gross margin of 43% decreased 100 basis points, for the most part due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Our operating expenses were $106.5 million in both the first quarters of 2016 and 2015. The operating expense margin of 26.4% improved 180 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives as well as 50 basis points of lower stock-based cost associated with the company's franchisee stock purchase plan. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $66.7 million, including $4.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.9 million, and the operating margin of 16.6% improved 80 basis points from 15.8% last year.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group, showed on Slide 9. First quarter sales of $278.8 million increased 3.1% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products, and low single-digit increases in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. 
Gross profit of $131.6 million compared to $127.3 million last year. Gross margin of 47.2% improved 40 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $62.6 million in the quarter compared to $63.4 million last year. The operating expense margin of 22.5% improved 80 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives.
First quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $69 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $5.1 million from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 24.7% improved 120 basis points from 23.5% last year.
Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $47 million on revenue of $66.3 million compared with operating earnings of $40.3 million on revenue of $57.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared with 17.7% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $264.6 million in the quarter increased 14.7% from 2015 levels.
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.6 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.4 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 81% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. 
In the first quarter of 2016, our worldwide Financial Services portfolio grew $53.3 million, continuing to reflect the previously mentioned higher sales of big-ticket items by the Snap-on Tools Group. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $141.6 million in the quarter increased $63.5 million from comparable 2015 levels, due in part to higher 2016 net earnings and lower growth in working investment as compared to the prior year. Net cash used by investing activities of $79.6 million included $56.8 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $19.5 million in the quarter compared with $18.1 million last year.
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days compared with 60 days in 2015 year-end. Inventories increased $13.8 million from 2015 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand in the auto repair sector and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.4 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end.
Our quarter-end cash position of $106.3 million increased $13.5 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $174.1 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $141.6 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $230.9 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $35.4 million, the repurchase of 157,000 shares for $23.1 million and $19.5 million for capital expenditures. 
Our net debt to capital ratio of 23.6% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end. In addition to our $106.3 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we had more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of the first quarter end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

We believe it's a period that authors strong confidence going forward, authoring or auguring progress along our runways for both improvement and growth. 
Enhancing the Van channel, the Tools Group grew 8.1% organically and the OI margin reached 16.6%, up 80 basis points. Franchisees, confident and committed, a stream of exciting new hit products and a continuing line of ways to wield the Van channel more powerfully. The Rock 'N Roll Cab to the TechKnow Express, and now, the Chrome Express Plus, enabling the franchisees to reach more customers. 
Expanding with our repair shop owners and managers. Sales up 3.1%, OI margin rising 120 basis points to 25.7%, great products. The V3300 aligner, the ETHOS and the SOLUS handheld, meeting the growing complexity of vehicle repair. 
Building in emerging markets, expanding the physicals, sales increasing in a varying landscape. And finally, extending to critical industries, turbulence, but we still see progress clear to us in terms of expanding product lines aimed at solving the critical in those sectors outside the garage. 
And you can't look at our quarter without seeing the hallmarks of Snap-on Value Creation, driving improvement against the difficulties, authoring an OI margin of 18.6%, up substantially versus last year again. 
And when you add that opco performance to our Financial Services progress, it rolls together for an EPS of $2.16, up 15.5%, extending our trend of rising profitability. A 15.5% rise in what most would call a turbulent environment. We believe it was an encouraging quarter, and one which points clearly to continuing the significant gains as we move forward.
Now before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate that I say words to the -- our franchisees and associates. Once again, I know many of you are listening, the progress of our first quarter most clearly reflects your extraordinary capability and your unique dedication. For the skills you bring to our company, for the energy you devote to our efforts and for the commitment you give to our team, you have my admiration and you have my thanks.

And generally, as I've said many times on these calls, built on, I think, the overwhelming capability of our Van network and the skill of our franchisees and the ongoing understanding of the repair shop, we generally reflect back on ourselves. So when I talk about franchisees, they almost never really mention the competition, although I'm sure it's formidable. They mention about how we can improve back on ourselves. And I'm seeing no change in that, really. And I think the Tools Group numbers seems to say that. I mean, their numbers look pretty good. I mean, they continually make the sales. They've been up, 6% or greater, 23 of 24 quarters. One of the things, I'd like to say about that, and I think one of the investment theses about Snap-on is that Snap-on's a company that has so much more to do, so many more places to grow and improve. And the Tools Group, the Van channel, has been around for decades and yet they've been able to do this by creating a bigger plume -- be able to expand, so dramatically, by creating a greater plume of new product and figuring out through things like these Rock 'N Roll Cabs and TechKnow Express and now, Chrome Express Plus, how to wield those vans more effectively.

I'll start this call with some of the highlights of our second quarter. I'll speak about the general environment and the trends we see, and I'll take you through some of the progress we've made.

I'll speak about the general environment and the trends we see, and I'll take you through some of the progress we've made. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. 
Our second quarter was encouraging. And we believe it once again offered evidence of clear advancements along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Reported sales were up 2.4% or $872.3 million and that included unfavorable foreign currency translation, this quarter, an impact of $10.2 million. It also reflected an incremental $5.9 million from last year's Ecotechnics acquisition. 
Now organic sales for the quarter rose 2.9%. Opco operating margin expanded by 140 basis points. And earnings per share, they reached $2.36, up 16.3% compared with the $2.03 the last year. The opco operating margin reached 19.1%, up from 17.7% in 2015. And that 140 basis point increase reflects the higher sales, but it also represents the power of Snap-on value creation. For financial services, operating income grew to $49.5 million from last year's $41.4 million, combining with opco to drive our consolidated operating margin to 22.9%, up 180 basis points. 
From an overall macro perspective, the automotive repair arena remains strong. And that can be seen clearly in the businesses serving that sector, the tools group and the repair system and information or RS&I group. They continue to make progress in the quarter, both in and outside United States. The Tools Group organic activity increased 5.8%. Once again demonstrating the ability to expand on our already strong position, leveraging a stream of new products and innovative solutions, capturing more business by helping technicians keep pace with changing vehicle technologies and with the aging fleet. 
And RS&I, organic gains of 5.2%, higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shops, owner -- independent repair shop owners and managers, increased volumes with OEM dealerships, expanded activity in other car equipment and broad progress in most regions. 
For the Commercial & Industrial Group, or C&I Group, organic sales were down 2%. Results were mixed across our industrial sectors and geographies. And in critical industries, headwinds surrounding our military business remain, spending stagnation from Washington continued in the quarter. We also witnessed ongoing inactivity within the Middle East. Aviation customers delaying project work, due in part to the turbulence throughout that area, that region. That said, the [ph] positive industrial sectors in places like U.S. aviation and power generation, where we made progress based on our understanding of the task, our increasing understanding of the task, and our expanding product lines that enable that work. 
Also a positive for C&I, SNA Europe advanced. SNA Europe, our European hand tools business delivering positive results, broad strength across the core of Europe in places like the U.K., Germany and Spain. In a period when the word Brexit entered our vocabulary accompanied by uncertainty. 
So the overall results remain positive. Strength in vehicle repair, mixed performances from critical industries and advancements against the wind in Europe, opportunities outweighing the challenges and the sales growth confirms it. And the operating income clearly demonstrated the leverage and the power of Snap-on value creation. Our Snap-on value creation processes and safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. In this quarter, special note should be made in customer connection and innovation, keeping pace with the aging car park and the changing technologies across the workplaces of the world. 
And another broad trend, as we move toward automatic control and more drive by wire, is the growing need for more precision and mechanical adjustments and more insight into data trends. Snap-on innovation is responding to that opportunity. And the products that support the need for precision and insight helped drive our sales and our margins in the quarter. Customer connection and innovation, and in fact, all of the Snap-on value creation processes helped us advance down our runways for improvement every day, driving our 140 basis point OI gain and overcoming the challenges. 
Well, that's the overview, that's the macro overview. Now, let's turn to the group. Let's move to the groups. We'll start with C&I. As I just said, a 2% organic sales decrease with lower critical industry activity and higher volume at SNA Europe and our Asia Pacific and power tools operations. The operating income margin was 13.8%, a 5% -- a 50 basis point decrease, impacted principally by the reduced sales in the higher-margin critical industry businesses.
For the industrial division, we had headwinds. But as we said, we also had sectors of growth. U.S. aviation sales were higher, bolstered by innovative new product like our latest in the tool control solutions, the automated tool control locker. You may remember our ATC smart toolboxes, visually keeping track of workplace hand tools. Well, the new ATC locker brings that asset control to a regularly shaped items [ph], like extension cords, toolkits and plastic or fabric carrying cases, personal protective equipment, all common in aviation shops. The new ATC locker makes tracking those nonstandard tools easy and reliable. And like the smart box, [ph] the ATC locker is fully networkable. It enables tracking from essential site, displaying the tool controls status for easy surveillance and avoidance of foreign object damage. Avoiding foreign object damage, a really important feature in those critical aviation applications, we can all relate to that. And based on the early reception, we believe we have a winning extension to our flagship tool control line with this locker, selling well. 
Now we often speak about customer connection, direct observation of the work and guiding new product innovation based on that observation. Well, the industrial division is constantly introducing new products borne out of that value-creating process. One example is our SGDE [ph]  series of electrostatic dissipative screwdrivers, great for places like avionics maintenance shops or any critical application where static discharge can damage sensitive equipment. 
Special conductivity to dissipate static and then a rotating handle mechanism that's ideal for precise detailed electronics work. Safety and precision, tools special needs made clear by direct observations at aviation MRO back shops across the world, customer connection and actually making work easier in the aviation sector. That's what these screwdrivers are. 
Another customer connection. This time, the offset [ph] adapter for the especially configured fasteners at power generation sites. It replaces homemade welded tools that frequently break and damage those high-voltage insulators we've all seen on the top of transformers. Damage that equals a critical failure. Visiting those substations, observing the work, we also saw a Frankenstein-like modified tools, welded out of multiple tools, trying to do the transformer tests, and we knew we could do better. So we designed a Snap-on professional tool that's more durable, safer and easier to use. It's a great attraction in power generation and it's products like that, that are behind this quarter's positive results in that sector. 
Now let's speak about SNA Europe. During the double dip in Europe, we said we would use RCI energetically, and we did. But we also said we wouldn't reduce capacity. Well, that [ph] is paying off. SNA Europe registered its 11th straight quarter of year-over-year sales growth, a positive trend in a very uncertain economic environment in Europe. And profit? Q2 marked the 13th straight quarter of margin improvement. SNA Europe up again in sales and in profit. 
Our Asia Pacific operations also contributed positively. And we capped investing in that region, more products, more distribution, more capabilities, positioning to take advantage of that building potential. Well, that's the C&I story. Turbulence in certain critical industries, partially offset by progress in other divisions. 
Now let's move to the Tools Group. Organic sales were up 5.8%, reflecting mid-single-digit gains in the U.S. and internationally. Operating margin of 18.3%, up 120 basis points overcoming 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. That 18.3% and 120 basis point rise, it's a clear demonstration of our improving position and progress along one of our more -- most important runways for growth, enhancing the van channel. The advancements are evident in the sales and in the margins. And perhaps, most importantly, in the overall franchisee health metrics which are all trending positively, again, this quarter. We believe our franchisees are growing stronger, armed with an array of innovative products. Products like the new quarter inch drive extra long flex head ratchet. At 10.5 inches, it allows technicians to work in difficult to reach spot, under the desk, in tight engine compartments or anywhere that access is limited. And it combines our patented dual pull system with a finely machined 72-tooth gear, more power and less lateral space at a distance. [ph] To manufacture in  Elizabethton, Tennessee, in our Elizabethton, Tennessee tool plant, and it's the next in the series of extra long handled tools designed specifically to make the technicians toughest jobs much easier. And we believe it does just that, and early sales have been robust. 
Now we we're making torque products for some time and the second quarter -- but in the second quarter we launched the heavy-duty half inch drive mechanical torque wrench. We call it the Brutus. [ph] The Brutus 300, [ph] targeted at technicians servicing larger vehicles. It sounds the critical need. Making it possible to torque a wide range of fasteners using a single tool in places where a number of special tools would normally be required. 
Today, the trend I described, many larger vehicles, large SUVs and pickup trucks, responding to the need for more precise specifications require a wider range of torque, some in tight places, some on varied components, some above 250 foot pounds, big components, like brake calibers, Pitman arms and wheel hubs. 
Previously, a technician would go through a time-consuming multi-tool procedure, sometimes just torque by judgment. The Brutus [ph] uses Snap-on's unique metallurgical capability to reach in the farthest places, fit in the smallest spaces, but have the strength necessary for larger torque values, all in a relatively light package for less fatigue. It's manufactured at our plant in City of Industry, California. It's long, small, light and strong, responding to a growing need for precise torquing in larger vehicles. 
Along with the innovative product, the Tools Group has another special advantage, our financial services arm, Snap-on credit. Strategic program aimed at supporting those essential big-ticket purchases. The credit company is focused on enhancing our van network. And again, this quarter, it did just that. So [ph] that's the Tools Group, new products guided by customer connection driving sales growth and strong margins. 
Now on to RS&I. Solid across the group. Organic sales of $14.2 million or 5 point -- organic sales growth of $14.2 million or 5.2%. Operating margin, 25.2%, rising 80 basis points, broad-based progress operation-by-operation, the diagnostics and information businesses selling to independent repair shops, driven by our award-winning handheld diagnostics products and by our extensive database of repair solutions. 
Whether it's the top-of-the-line [ph], with its comprehensive diagnostics, technical service [ph] and the power of SureTrack big repair data for advanced professionals and working on those really difficult repair, whether it's that big [ph] edge or advanced professionals. Or for the entry-level technician, the ETHOS Tech with its considerable functionality and attractive price point, the Snap-on lineup of handhelds makes work easier across the garage. 
Some of today's vehicles now have over 100 electronic control units, all requiring service. So the demand for diagnostic tools and data insight is rising. And to support those growing complexities, our Mitchell1 team continues to refine its ProDemand product, expanding make and model coverage, adding the most recent vehicle platforms, broadening search result, improving navigation, providing even more shortcuts to a quick fix with its SureTrack big database. All of it, savings technician's time. The Mitchell1 solution gets better every quarter and you see it in the results. 
Now sales undercar equipment, also up mid-single digits, with growth registered in the U.S. and our international market. U.S. gains included particular strength by a pair of our recent acquisitions, the challenger lifts and Pro-Cut brake lathes, both expanding the Snap-on's presence in the garage and both progressing well in the quarter, with products like Challengers versatile CL 12 lift, 3 stage, low-profile alarm for more flexibility and Pro-Cut's new x9 on car brake late, more precision and matching, more repeatability, state calibrated over thousands of cuts. The trending vehicle repair, more precision. That means more wheel alignments and more rotor matching, and Snap-on has the products that make it easier. 
Speaking about hit products and alignment. Last quarter, I mentioned the launch of the V3300 wheel aligner. I said it was a game changer, and so it was. Based on -- so it was, based on the enthusiastic reception from many prominent dealer networks, now with a full quarter and the book results are in and the sales have been strong and it's no wonder. We've spoken about the trend more precision and that means more frequent alignments, enabling some of the new features like laying departure systems or adaptive cruise control and the V3300 fits that trend, more alignments are in the future and the speed and the accuracy of the V3300 is a great asset. 
So to wrap up RS&I, we see it as a confirmation, together with the tools group, of the strength of the auto repair market. RS&I, great diagnostics, new repair information and expanded offerings of undercar equipment, all driving positive trends and improving our position with repair shop owners and managers. 
Well, that's the highlights of the quarter, growth and improvement, progress along our runways for coherent growth and clear advancements down our runways for improvement. When you step back and you look at these numbers, sales increasing organically by 2.9%; opco operating income margin of 19.1%, up 140 basis points; EPS, $2.36 in the quarter, 16.3% higher than last year; it was another encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"
303646,372491916,1009348,"Snap-on Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Nick. Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $872.3 million were up 2.4%, including $10.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales. Excludi",1337,"Thanks, Nick. Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $872.3 million were up 2.4%, including $10.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales. Excluding foreign currency translation and acquisition-related sales, organic sales increased 2.9%, primarily reflecting higher sales in our businesses serving automotive repair, partially offset by lower sales to critical industries in our C&I segment. 
Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q2 sales comparisons by 120 basis points. 
Consolidated gross margin of 49.4% improved 20 basis points in 2015 levels as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $264.9 million yielded an operating expense margin of 30.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 120 basis points from 31.5% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, as well as lower stock-based mark-to-market compensations and other expenses, and the lower pension expense. As a result of these factors, operating earnings from financial services of $166.4 million, including $6.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 10.3% compared to prior year and as a percentage of sales increased 140 basis points to 19.1%. 
Financial services revenues of $69.3 million in the quarter increased 18.1% from 2015 levels. And operating earnings of $49.5 million increased 19.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the financial services portfolio. 
Consolidated operating earnings of $215.9 million, including $6.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.3%. And the operating margin of 22.9% increased 180 basis points from 21.1% a year ago. 
Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 32% last year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full year 2015 rate of 31.7%. 
Finally, net earnings of $140.1 million or $2.36 per share, increased $20.1 million or $0.33 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 16.3% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $285.7 million in the second quarter decreased 3.4%. Excluding $4.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales declined 2%, primarily due to a double-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, largely in the military and international aerospace market segments. This decline was partially offset by mid-single-digit increases in the segments Asia Pacific and power tools operations and a low single-digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business. 
Gross profit in the C&I group of $111.4 million compared to $112.9 million last year. The gross margin of 39% increased 80 basis points, mostly due to savings from RCI and other cost-reduction initiatives. 
Operating expenses of $72.1 million in the quarter compared to $70.7 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25.2% increased 130 basis points from 23.9% last year, primarily as a result of unfavorable sales volume leverage and 70 basis points of higher cost, including costs associated with continued expansion initiatives in Asia. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $39.3 million including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects decreased $2.9 million from 2015 levels. And the operating margin of 13.8% compared to 14.3% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales from the Snap-on Tools group of $416.7 million increased 4.5%. Excluding $4.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $22.7 million or 5.8%, reflecting similar gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. 
Gross profit of $182.1 million compared to $176.5 million last year. The gross margin of 43.7% decreased 60 basis points largely due to 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $105.8 million in the quarter compared to $108.5 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25.4% improved 180 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives and 20 basis points of lower stock-based costs associated with the company's franchisees stock purchase program. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools group of $76.3 million, including $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $8.3 million. And operating margin of 18.3% improved 120 basis points from 17.1% last year. 
Turning to Repair Systems and Information or RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Second quarter sales of $295.2 million increased 6.4% from 2015 levels. Excluding $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 5.2%. The organic sales increase reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products, the independent repair shop-owners and managers as well as mid-single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. 
Gross profit of $137.8 million compared to $129.6 million last year. Gross margin was 46.7% in both periods. 
Operating expenses of $63.3 million in the quarter compared to $61.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 21.5% improved 80 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. 
Second quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $74.5 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.8 million from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 25.2% improved 80 basis points from 24.4% last year. 
Now turning to slide 10. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $49.5 million and revenue of $69.3 million compared to operating earnings of $41.4 million and revenue of $58.7 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared to 17.8% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables of 9.3% in the quarter compared to 9.4% last year. Originations of $281 million increased 10.9% from 2015. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $1.7 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.5 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 82% of our U.S. financing portfolio related to extended credit loans to technicians. 
In the first half of 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $121.3 million. As for finance portfolio loans and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $162.1 million in the quarter increased $1.8 million from comparable 2015 levels, as higher net earnings and improvement working investment were largely offset by the timing of cash tax payments. Net cash used by investing activities of $95.3 million included $76.9 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $20.6 million in the quarter compared with $27.7 million last year. 
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days was unchanged from 2015 year-end levels. Inventories increased $9.3 million from 2015 year-end levels, mainly to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.4 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year end. 
Our quarter-end tax position of $119.9 million increased $27.1 million in 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $341.4 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $303.7 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $475.1 million of new finance receivables, dividend payment of $70.9 million, the repurchase of 377,000 shares for $58.5 million and $40.1 million for capital expenditures. Our net debt to capital ratio of 23% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end. 
In addition to our $119.9 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million of available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of second quarter end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

The tools group, growing 5.8% organically and an OI margin of 18.3%, up 120 basis points, something we haven't seen. And it was achieved against 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. 
RS&I, in the vehicle repair space, broad gains, growing at 5.2% organically; OI margins of 25.2%, up 80 basis points. Tools and RS&I up again, clear evidence that vehicle repair is strong and it has abundant opportunity and that Snap-on knows how to take full advantage. 
C&I, battling the difficulties in the military and international aviation, but proving it can extend in advance in sectors like U.S. aviation, power generation and in geographies like Europe, where our efforts with SNA Europe are paying off. And all of the combined other organic growth at 2.9%. 
The second quarter also bears the mark of Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, creating a growing list of new products to provide higher value, matching the need for greater precision and performing the work of today and of tomorrow. 
And RCI, people all over the corporation getting up every day and making our complex business more efficient. Snap-on Value Creation drove our opco operating margin to 19.1%. 
Again, stepping back and looking at the performance and at the numbers. Growth of 2.9% organically. Performance, opco operating margin of 19.1%, up 140 basis points, a significant rise again this quarter. And EPS of $2.36, a 16.3% increase. It was another encouraging quarter. And we believe that we have the abundant opportunity and a demonstrated capability to continue that positive trend on through the remainder of 2016 and well beyond. 
Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll directly speak to our franchisees and associates. I know that many of you are once again listening to this call.

So I didn't get any feeling from that from an anecdotal point of view. And during the quarter, I met with our group of our franchisees several times from the United States and Canada and so uniformly positive.

High-value -- some of the things I talked about, high-value tools that attack precision like the Brutus 300, strong, strong seller. So the idea of hand tools in fact, were also up very strong. So we saw -- I think pretty wide strength. But again, in this quarter, big-ticket led the way.

So if I didn't know anything, I would say Snap-on puts rock 'n roll cabs and TechKnow vans critical boxes, I'm going to see higher originations because it's going to have higher big-ticket sales."

So, from time to time, we get above it. And I think our ability to grow above the 4% to 5% depends in our ability to keep coming up with those things. That doesn't mean we can grow at every quarter. So I think it's how I view it. I think we were at a solid 4% to 5%, but I think if we can keep coming up with ways to amplify our business, the technicians are there. There's 1.3 million technicians, we are calling at 850,000 [ph] of them. So a lot of them are retiring [ph] every year. So we see a great market there.

I'll speak about the general environment and the trends we see, and I'll take you through some of the progress we've made. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. 
Our second quarter was encouraging. And we believe it once again offered evidence of clear advancements along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Reported sales were up 2.4% or $872.3 million and that included unfavorable foreign currency translation, this quarter, an impact of $10.2 million. It also reflected an incremental $5.9 million from last year's Ecotechnics acquisition. 
Now organic sales for the quarter rose 2.9%. Opco operating margin expanded by 140 basis points. And earnings per share, they reached $2.36, up 16.3% compared with the $2.03 the last year. The opco operating margin reached 19.1%, up from 17.7% in 2015. And that 140 basis point increase reflects the higher sales, but it also represents the power of Snap-on value creation. For financial services, operating income grew to $49.5 million from last year's $41.4 million, combining with opco to drive our consolidated operating margin to 22.9%, up 180 basis points. 
From an overall macro perspective, the automotive repair arena remains strong. And that can be seen clearly in the businesses serving that sector, the tools group and the repair system and information or RS&I group. They continue to make progress in the quarter, both in and outside United States. The Tools Group organic activity increased 5.8%. Once again demonstrating the ability to expand on our already strong position, leveraging a stream of new products and innovative solutions, capturing more business by helping technicians keep pace with changing vehicle technologies and with the aging fleet. 
And RS&I, organic gains of 5.2%, higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shops, owner -- independent repair shop owners and managers, increased volumes with OEM dealerships, expanded activity in other car equipment and broad progress in most regions. 
For the Commercial & Industrial Group, or C&I Group, organic sales were down 2%. Results were mixed across our industrial sectors and geographies. And in critical industries, headwinds surrounding our military business remain, spending stagnation from Washington continued in the quarter. We also witnessed ongoing inactivity within the Middle East. Aviation customers delaying project work, due in part to the turbulence throughout that area, that region. That said, the more positive industrial sectors in places like U.S. aviation and power generation, where we made progress based on our understanding of the task, our increasing understanding of the task, and our expanding product lines that enable that work. 
Also a positive for C&I, SNA Europe advanced. SNA Europe, our European hand tools business delivering positive results, broad strength across the core of Europe in places like the U.K., Germany and Spain. In a period when the word Brexit entered our vocabulary accompanied by uncertainty. 
So the overall results remain positive. Strength in vehicle repair, mixed performances from critical industries and advancements against the wind in Europe, opportunities outweighing the challenges and the sales growth confirms it. And the operating income clearly demonstrated the leverage and the power of Snap-on value creation. Our Snap-on value creation processes and safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. In this quarter, special note should be made in customer connection and innovation, keeping pace with the aging car park and the changing technologies across the workplaces of the world. 
And another broad trend, as we move toward automatic control and more drive by wire, is the growing need for more precision and mechanical adjustments and more insight into data trends. Snap-on innovation is responding to that opportunity. And the products that support the need for precision and insight helped drive our sales and our margins in the quarter. Customer connection and innovation, and in fact, all of the Snap-on value creation processes helped us advance down our runways for improvement every day, driving our 140 basis point OI gain and overcoming the challenges. 
Well, that's the overview, that's the macro overview. Now, let's turn to the group. Let's move to the groups. We'll start with C&I. As I just said, a 2% organic sales decrease with lower critical industry activity and higher volume at SNA Europe and our Asia Pacific and power tools operations. The operating income margin was 13.8%, a 5% -- a 50 basis point decrease, impacted principally by the reduced sales in the higher-margin critical industry businesses.
For the industrial division, we had headwinds. But as we said, we also had sectors of growth. U.S. aviation sales were higher, bolstered by innovative new product like our latest in the tool control solutions, the automated tool control locker. You may remember our ATC smart toolboxes, visually keeping track of workplace hand tools. Well, the new ATC locker brings that asset control to a regularly shaped items like extension cords, toolkits and plastic or fabric carrying cases, personal protective equipment, all common in aviation shops. The new ATC locker makes tracking those nonstandard tools easy and reliable. And like the smart box, the ATC locker is fully networkable. It enables tracking from essential site, displaying the tool controls status for easy surveillance and avoidance of foreign object damage. Avoiding foreign object damage, a really important feature in those critical aviation applications, we can all relate to that. And based on the early reception, we believe we have a winning extension to our flagship tool control line with this locker, selling well. 
Now we often speak about customer connection, direct observation of the work and guiding new product innovation based on that observation. Well, the industrial division is constantly introducing new products borne out of that value-creating process. One example is our SGDE series of electrostatic dissipative screwdrivers, great for places like avionics maintenance shops or any critical application where static discharge can damage sensitive equipment. 
Special conductivity to dissipate static and then a rotating handle mechanism that's ideal for precise detailed electronics work. Safety and precision, tools special needs made clear by direct observations at aviation MRO back shops across the world, customer connection and actually making work easier in the aviation sector. That's what these screwdrivers are. 
Another customer connection. This time, the offset crowfoot adapter for the especially configured fasteners at power generation sites. It replaces homemade welded tools that frequently break and damage those high-voltage insulators we've all seen on the top of transformers. Damage that equals a critical failure. Visiting those substations, observing the work, we also saw a Frankenstein-like modified tools, welded out of multiple tools, trying to do the transformer tests, and we knew we could do better. So we designed a Snap-on professional tool that's more durable, safer and easier to use. It's a great attraction in power generation and it's products like that, that are behind this quarter's positive results in that sector. 
Now let's speak about SNA Europe. During the double dip in Europe, we said we would use RCI energetically, and we did. But we also said we wouldn't reduce capacity. Well, that faith is paying off. SNA Europe registered its 11th straight quarter of year-over-year sales growth, a positive trend in a very uncertain economic environment in Europe. And profit? Q2 marked the 13th straight quarter of margin improvement. SNA Europe up again in sales and in profit. 
Our Asia Pacific operations also contributed positively. And we capped investing in that region, more products, more distribution, more capabilities, positioning to take advantage of that building potential. Well, that's the C&I story. Turbulence in certain critical industries, partially offset by progress in other divisions. 
Now let's move to the Tools Group. Organic sales were up 5.8%, reflecting mid-single-digit gains in the U.S. and internationally. Operating margin of 18.3%, up 120 basis points overcoming 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. That 18.3% and 120 basis point rise, it's a clear demonstration of our improving position and progress along one of our more -- most important runways for growth, enhancing the van channel. The advancements are evident in the sales and in the margins. And perhaps, most importantly, in the overall franchisee health metrics which are all trending positively, again, this quarter. We believe our franchisees are growing stronger, armed with an array of innovative products. Products like the new quarter inch drive extra long flex head ratchet. At 10.5 inches, it allows technicians to work in difficult to reach spot, under the desk, in tight engine compartments or anywhere that access is limited. And it combines our patented dual pull system with a finely machined 72-tooth gear, more power and less lateral space at a distance. It's manufactured in  Elizabethton, Tennessee, in our Elizabethton, Tennessee tool plant, and it's the next in the series of extra-long handled tools designed specifically to make the technicians toughest jobs much easier. And we believe it does just that, and early sales have been robust. 
Now we we're making torque products for some time and the second quarter -- but in the second quarter we launched the heavy-duty half inch drive mechanical torque wrench. We call it the BRUTUS, the BRUTUS 300, targeted at technicians servicing larger vehicles. It sounds the critical need. Making it possible to torque a wide range of fasteners using a single tool in places where a number of special tools would normally be required. 
Today, the trend I described, many larger vehicles, large SUVs and pickup trucks, responding to the need for more precise specifications require a wider range of torque, some in tight places, some on varied components, some above 250 foot pounds, big components, like brake calibers, Pitman arms and wheel hubs. 
Previously, a technician would go through a time-consuming multi-tool procedure, sometimes just torque by judgment. The BRUTUS uses Snap-on's unique metallurgical capability to reach in the farthest places, fit in the smallest spaces, but have the strength necessary for larger torque values, all in a relatively light package for less fatigue. It's manufactured at our plant in City of Industry, California. It's long, small, light and strong, responding to a growing need for precise torquing in larger vehicles. 
Along with the innovative product, the Tools Group has another special advantage, our financial services arm, Snap-on credit. Strategic program aimed at supporting those essential big-ticket purchases. The credit company is focused on enhancing our van network. And again, this quarter, it did just that. So that's the Tools Group, new products guided by customer connection driving sales growth and strong margins. 
Now on to RS&I. Solid across the group. Organic sales of $14.2 million or 5 point -- organic sales growth of $14.2 million or 5.2%. Operating margin, 25.2%, rising 80 basis points, broad-based progress operation-by-operation, the diagnostics and information businesses selling to independent repair shops, driven by our award-winning handheld diagnostics products and by our extensive database of repair solutions. 
Whether it's the top-of-the-line VERUS Edge, with its comprehensive diagnostics, technical service bulletins and the power of SureTrack big repair data for advanced professionals and working on those really difficult repair, whether it's that big VERUS edge or advanced professionals, or for the entry-level technician the ETHOS Tech with its considerable functionality and attractive price point, the Snap-on lineup of handhelds makes work easier across the garage. 
Some of today's vehicles now have over 100 electronic control units, all requiring service. So the demand for diagnostic tools and data insight is rising. And to support those growing complexities, our Mitchell1 team continues to refine its ProDemand product, expanding make and model coverage, adding the most recent vehicle platforms, broadening search result, improving navigation, providing even more shortcuts to a quick fix with its SureTrack big database. All of it, saving technician's time. The Mitchell1 solution gets better every quarter and we see it in the results. 
Now sales undercar equipment, also up mid-single digits, with growth registered in the U.S. and our international market. The U.S. gains included a particular strength by a pair of our recent acquisitions, the Challenger Lifts and Pro-Cut brake lathes, both expanding the Snap-on's presence in the garage and both progressing well in the quarter, with products like Challenger's versatile CL 12 lift, 3 stage, low-profile alarm for more flexibility and Pro-Cut's new X9 on-car brake lathe, more precision in rotor matching, more repeatability, stayed calibrated over thousands of cuts. The trend in vehicle repair, more precision. That means more wheel alignments and more rotor matching, and Snap-on has the product that make it easier. 
Speaking about hit products and alignment, last quarter I mentioned the launch of the V3300 wheel aligner. I said it was a game changer, and so it was. Based on -- so it was based on the enthusiastic reception from many prominent dealer networks. Now with a full quarter in the book, the results are in and the sales have been strong, and it's no wonder. We've spoken about the trend to more precision and that means more frequent alignments, enabling some of the new features like laying departure systems or adaptive cruise control. And the V3300 fits that trend, more alignments are in the future and the speed and the accuracy of the V3300 is a great asset. 
So to wrap up RS&I, we see it as a confirmation, together with the Tools Group, of the strength of the auto repair market. RS&I, great diagnostics, new repair information and expanded offerings of undercar equipment, all driving positive trends and improving our position with repair shop owners and managers. 
Well, that's the highlights of the quarter, growth and improvement, progress along our runways for coherent growth and clear advancements down our runways for improvement. When you step back and you look at these numbers, sales increasing organically by 2.9%; opco operating income margin of 19.1%, up 140 basis points; EPS, $2.36 in the quarter, 16.3% higher than last year, it was another encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"

Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $872.3 million were up 2.4%, including $10.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales. Excluding foreign currency translation and acquisition-related sales, organic sales increased 2.9%, primarily reflecting higher sales in our businesses serving automotive repair, partially offset by lower sales to critical industries in our C&I segment. 
Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q2 sales comparisons by 120 basis points.  Consolidated gross margin of 49.4% improved 20 basis points in 2015 levels, as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $264.9 million yielded an operating expense margin of 30.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 120 basis points from 31.5% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, as well as lower stock-based mark-to-market compensations and other expenses, and the lower pension expense. As a result of these factors, operating earnings from financial services of $166.4 million, including $6.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 10.3% compared to prior year, and as a percentage of sales increased 140 basis points to 19.1%. 
Financial services revenues of $69.3 million in the quarter increased 18.1% from 2015 levels. And operating earnings of $49.5 million increased 19.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the financial services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $215.9 million, including $6.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.3%. And the operating margin of 22.9% increased 180 basis points from 21.1% a year ago. 
Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 32% last year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full year 2015 rate of 31.7%. Finally, net earnings of $140.1 million or $2.36 per share, increased $20.1 million or $0.33 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 16.3% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $285.7 million in the second quarter decreased 3.4%. Excluding $4.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales declined 2% primarily due to a double-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, largely in the military and international aerospace market segments. This decline was partially offset by mid-single-digit increases in the segments Asia Pacific and power tools operations, and a low single-digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business. Gross profit in the C&I group of $111.4 million compared to $112.9 million last year. The gross margin of 39% increased 80 basis points, mostly due to savings from RCI and other cost-reduction initiatives. 
Operating expenses of $72.1 million in the quarter compared to $70.7 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25.2% increased 130 basis points from 23.9% last year, primarily as a result of unfavorable sales volume leverage and 70 basis points of higher cost, including costs associated with continued expansion initiatives in Asia. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $39.3 million including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects decreased $2.9 million from 2015 levels and the operating margin of 13.8% compared to 14.3% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales from the Snap-on Tools Group of $416.7 million increased 4.5%. Excluding $4.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $22.7 million or 5.8%, reflecting similar gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $182.1 million compared to $176.5 million last year. The gross margin of 43.7% decreased 60 basis points largely due to 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $105.8 million in the quarter compared to $108.5 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25.4% improved 180 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives and 20 basis points of lower stock-based costs associated with the company's franchisees stock purchase program. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $76.3 million, including $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $8.3 million and the operating margin of 18.3% improved 120 basis points from 17.1% last year. 
Turning to the Repair Systems and Information or RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Second quarter sales of $295.2 million increased 6.4% from 2015 levels. Excluding $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 5.2%. The organic sales increase reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products, the independent repair shop-owners and managers as well, as mid-single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. Gross profit of $137.8 million compared to $129.6 million last year. Gross margin was 46.7% in both periods. 
Operating expenses of $63.3 million in the quarter compared to $61.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 21.5% improved 80 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Second quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $74.5 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.8 million from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 25.2% improved 80 basis points from 24.4% last year. 
Now turning to slide 10. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $49.5 million and revenue of $69.3 million compared to operating earnings of $41.4 million on revenue of $58.7 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared to 17.8% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables of 9.3% in the quarter compared to 9.4% last year. Originations of $281 million increased 10.9% from 2015. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $1.7 billion of gross financing receivables including $1.5 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 82% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In the first half of 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $121.3 million. As for finance portfolio loans and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $162.1 million in the quarter increased $1.8 million from comparable 2015 levels, as higher net earnings and improvement in working investment were largely offset by the timing of cash tax payments. Net cash used by investing activities of $95.3 million included $76.9 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $20.6 million in the quarter compared with $27.7 million last year. 
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days was unchanged from 2015 year-end levels. Inventories increased $9.3 million from 2015 year-end levels, mainly to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.4 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end. 
Our quarter end tax position of $119.9 million increased $27.1 million in 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $341.4 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $303.7 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $475.1 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $70.9 million, the repurchase of 377,000 shares for $58.5 million and $40.1 million for capital expenditures. Our net debt to capital ratio of 23% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end. 
In addition to our $119.9 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of second quarter end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Continuing the trend of positive performance with ongoing year-over-year gains, runways for growth, enhancing the van channel and expanding with the repair shop owners and managers. Vehicle repair, a space with a strong tailwind, aging car parts, changing technologies and a need for more precision, abundant opportunity, and you can see it in the results. 
The Tools Group, growing 5.8% organically and an OI margin of 18.3%, up 120 basis points, something we haven't seen. And it was achieved against 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. RS&I, in the vehicle repair space, broad gains, growing at 5.2% organically. OI margins of 25.2%, up 80 basis points. Tools and RS&I up again, clear evidence that vehicle repair is strong and it has abundant opportunity and that Snap-on knows how to take full advantage. 
C&I, battling the difficulties in the military and international aviation, but proving it can extend and advance in sectors like U.S. aviation, power generation and in geographies like Europe, where our efforts with SNA Europe are paying off. And all of the combined author organic growth of 2.9%. 
The second quarter also bears the mark of Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, creating a growing list of new products to provide higher value, matching the needs for greater precision and performing the work of today and of tomorrow. 
And RCI, people all over the corporation getting up every day and making our complex business more efficient. Snap-on Value Creation drove our opco operating margin to 19.1%. Again, stepping back and looking at the performance and at the numbers. Growth of 2.9% organically. Performance, opco operating margin of 19.1%, up 140 basis points, a significant rise, again, this quarter. And EPS of $2.36, a 16.3% increase. It was another encouraging quarter.

I was just on a van within just a little over a week ago, and the franchisees and the garages we visited were all very, very optimistic. So I didn't get any feeling from that from an anecdotal point of view. And then during the quarter, I met with our group of our franchisees several times from the United States and Canada and so, and they seemed uniformly positive. And when I look at the numbers, I think this market looks like it has looked to us for multiple quarters now for a long time. So empirically, with the numbers, and anecdotally from what I get from talking to franchisees and technicians, I think this is pretty positive."

Because 50% to -- 40% to 50% of repairs in the park today needed diagnostic to affect it efficiently, and new cars were 80%. So there's a growth toward everybody needing a diagnostic, we see that in our everyday sales and the trends in the market. But in this particular quarter, big-ticket items were fairly strong. High-value -- some of the things I talked about, high-value tools that attack precision like the BRUTUS 300, strong, strong seller. So the idea of hand tools, in fact, were also up very strong. So we saw -- I think pretty wide strength. But again, in this quarter, big-ticket led the way. And that's what we expect because our marketing gains around Rock 'N Roll Cabs, and we've just done a major refurb on the TechKnow van have -- kind of support those purchases."

An easing of the pressure of currency, but I think that happens more in the fourth and the third, primarily because of the pound.

I'll speak about the general environment and the trends we see, and I'll take you through some of the progress we've made. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. 
Our second quarter was encouraging. And we believe it once again offered evidence of clear advancements along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Reported sales were up 2.4% or -- to $872.3 million and that included unfavorable foreign currency translation this quarter, an impact of $10.2 million. It also reflected an incremental $5.9 million from last year's Ecotechnics acquisition. 
Now organic sales for the quarter rose 2.9%. Opco operating margin expanded by 140 basis points. And earnings per share, they reached $2.36, up 16.3% compared with the $2.03 the last year. The opco operating margin reached 19.1%, up from 17.7% in 2015. And that 140 basis point increase reflects the higher sales, but it also represents the power of Snap-on value creation. For financial services, operating income grew to $49.5 million from last year's $41.4 million, combining with opco to drive our consolidated operating margin to 22.9%, up 180 basis points. 
From an overall macro perspective, the automotive repair arena remains strong. And that can be seen clearly in the businesses serving that sector, the tools group and the repair systems and information or RS&I group. They continue to make progress in the quarter, both in and outside United States. The Tools Group organic activity increased 5.8%, once again demonstrating the ability to expand on our already strong position, leveraging a stream of new products and innovative solutions, capturing more business by helping technicians keep pace with changing vehicle technologies and with the aging fleet. 
And RS&I, organic gains of 5.2%, higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shops, owner -- independent repair shop owners and managers, increased volumes with OEM dealerships, expanded activity in undercar equipment and broad progress in most regions. 
For the Commercial & Industrial Group, or C&I Group, organic sales were down 2%. Results were mixed across our industrial sectors and geographies. And in critical industries, headwinds surrounding our military business remain; spending stagnation from Washington continued in the quarter. We also witnessed ongoing inactivity within the Middle East. Aviation customers delaying project work, due in part to the turbulence throughout that area, that region. That said, there were positive industrial sectors in places like U.S. aviation and power generation, where we made progress based on our understanding of the task -- our increasing understanding of the task, and our extending product lines that enable that work. 
Also a positive for C&I, SNA Europe advanced. SNA Europe, our European hand tools business delivering positive results, broad strength across the core of Europe in places like the U.K., Germany and Spain, in a period when the word Brexit entered our vocabulary accompanied by uncertainty. 
So the overall results remain positive. Strength in vehicle repair, mixed performances from critical industries and advancements against the wind in Europe, opportunities outweighing the challenges and the sales growth confirms it. And the operating income clearly demonstrated the leverage and the power of Snap-on value creation -- our Snap-on value creation processes in safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. In this quarter, special note should be made of customer connection and innovation, keeping pace with the aging car park and the changing technologies across the workplaces of the world. 
And another broad trend, as we move toward automatic control and more drive by wire, is the growing need for more precision and mechanical adjustments and more insight into data trends. Snap-on innovation is responding to that opportunity. And the products that support the need for precision and insight helped drive our sales and our margins in the quarter. Customer connection and innovation, and in fact, all of the Snap-on value creation processes helped us advance down our runways for improvement every day, driving our 140 basis point OI gain and overcoming the challenges. 
Well, that's the overview, that's the macro overview. Now, let's turn to the groups. Let's move to the groups. We'll start with C&I. As I just said, a 2% organic sales decrease with lower critical industry activity and higher volume at SNA Europe and our Asia Pacific and power tools operations. The operating income margin was 13.8%, a 5% -- a 50 basis point decrease, impacted principally by the reduced sales in the higher-margin critical industry businesses.
For the industrial division, we had headwinds. But as we said, we also had sectors of growth. U.S. aviation sales were higher, bolstered by innovative new product like our latest in the tool control solutions, the automated tool control locker. You may remember our ATC smart toolboxes, visually keeping track of workplace hand tools. Well, the new ATC locker brings that asset control to irregularly-shaped items like extension cords, toolkits and plastic or fabric carrying cases, personal protective equipment, all common in aviation shops. The new ATC locker makes tracking those nonstandard tools easy and reliable. And like the smart box, the ATC locker is fully networkable. It enables tracking from a central site, displaying the tool controls status for easy surveillance and avoidance of foreign object damage. Avoiding foreign object damage, a really important feature in those critical aviation applications; we can all relate to that. And based on the early reception, we believe we have a winning extension to our flagship tool control line with this locker, selling well. 
Now we often speak about customer connection, direct observation of the work and guiding new product innovation based on that observation. Well, the industrial division is constantly introducing new products borne out of that value-creating process. One example is our SGDE series of electrostatic dissipative screwdrivers, great for places like avionics maintenance shops or any critical application where static discharge can damage sensitive equipment. 
Special conductivity to dissipate static and then a rotating handle mechanism that's ideal for precise detailed electronics work. Safety and precision, 2 special needs made clear by direct observations at aviation MRO back shops across the world, customer connection in action, making work easier in the aviation sector. That's what these screwdrivers are. 
Another customer connection. This time, the offset crowfoot adapter for the especially-configured fasteners at power generation sites. It replaces homemade welded tools that frequently break and damage those high-voltage insulators; we've all seen them on the top of transformers. Damage that equals a critical failure. Visiting those substations, observing the work, we also saw Frankenstein-like modified tools, welded out of multiple tools, trying to do the transformer tasks, and we knew we could do better. So we designed a Snap-on professional tool that's more durable, safer and easier to use. It's a great attraction in power generation and it's products like that, that are behind this quarter's positive results in that sector. 
Now let's speak about SNA Europe. During the double dip in Europe, we said we would use RCI energetically, and we did. But we also said we wouldn't reduce capacity. Well, that faith is paying off. SNA Europe registered its 11th straight quarter of year-over-year sales growth, a positive trend in the very uncertain economic environment of Europe. And profit? Q2 marked the 13th straight quarter of margin improvement. SNA Europe up again in sales and in profit. 
Our Asia Pacific operations also contributed positively. And we kept investing in that region, more products, more distribution, more capabilities, positioning to take advantage of that building potential. Well, that's the C&I story. Turbulence in certain critical industries, partially offset by progress in other divisions. 
Now let's move to the Tools Group. Organic sales were up 5.8%, reflecting mid-single-digit gains in the U.S. and internationally. Operating margin of 18.3%, up 120 basis points overcoming 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. That 18.3% and 120 basis point rise, it's a clear demonstration of our improving position and progress along one of our more -- most important runways for growth, enhancing the van channel. The advancements are evident in the sales and in the margins. And perhaps, most importantly, in the overall franchisee health metrics which are all trending positively, again, this quarter. We believe our franchisees are growing stronger, armed with an array of innovative products. Products like the new quarter inch drive extra long flex head ratchet. At 10.5 inches, it allows technicians to work in difficult-to-reach spots -- under the dash, in tight engine compartments or anywhere that access is limited. And it combines our patented dual pull system with a finely machined 72-tooth gear, more power and less lateral space at a distance. It's manufactured in  Elizabethton, Tennessee -- in our Elizabethton, Tennessee tool plant, and it's the next in the series of extra-long handled tools designed specifically to make the technicians' toughest jobs much easier. And we believe it does just that, and early sales have been robust. 
Now we've been making torque products for some time and the second quarter -- but in the second quarter we launched a heavy-duty half inch drive mechanical torque wrench. We call it the BRUTUS, the BRUTUS 300, targeted at technicians servicing larger vehicles. It solves a critical need: making it possible to torque a wide range of fasteners using a single tool in places where a number of special tools would normally be required. 
Today, the trend I described, many larger vehicles, large SUVs and pickup trucks, responding to the need for more precise specifications require a wider range of torque, some in tight places, some on varied components, some above 250 foot pounds -- big components, like brake calibers, Pitman arms and wheel hubs. 
Previously, a technician would go through a time-consuming multi-tool procedure, sometimes just torque by judgment. The BRUTUS uses Snap-on's unique metallurgical capability to reach in the farthest places, fit in the smallest spaces, but have the strength necessary for larger torque values, all in a relatively-light package for less fatigue. It's manufactured at our plant in City of Industry, California. It's long, small, light and strong, responding to a growing need for precise torquing in larger vehicles. 
Along with the innovative product, the Tools Group has another special advantage, our financial services arm, Snap-on credit. Strategic program aimed at supporting those essential big-ticket purchases. The credit company is focused on enhancing our van network. And again, this quarter, it did just that. So that's the Tools Group, new products guided by customer connection driving sales growth and strong margins. 
Now on to RS&I. Solid across the group. Organic sales of $14.2 million or 5 point -- organic sales growth of $14.2 million or 5.2%. Operating margin, 25.2%, rising 80 basis points, broad-based progress operation-by-operation, the diagnostics and information businesses selling to independent repair shops, driven by our award-winning handheld diagnostics products and by our extensive database of repair solutions. 
Whether it's the top-of-the-line VERUS Edge, with its comprehensive diagnostics, technical service bulletins and the power of SureTrack big repair data for advanced professionals and working on those really difficult repair, whether it's that big VERUS edge or advanced professionals, or for the entry-level technician the ETHOS Tech with its considerable functionality and attractive price point, the Snap-on lineup of handhelds makes work easier across the garage. 
Some of today's vehicles now have over 100 electronic control units, all requiring service. So the demand for diagnostic tools and data insight is rising. And to support those growing complexities, our Mitchell1 team continues to refine its ProDemand product, expanding make and model coverage, adding the most recent vehicle platforms, broadening search result, improving navigation, providing even more shortcuts to a quick fix with its SureTrack big database -- all of it saving technician's time. The Mitchell1 solution gets better every quarter and we see it in the results. 
Now sales undercar equipment, also up mid-single digits, with growth registered in the U.S. and our international markets. The U.S. gains included a particular strength by a pair of our recent acquisitions, the Challenger Lifts and Pro-Cut brake lathes, both expanding the Snap-on's presence in the garage and both progressing well in the quarter, with products like Challenger's versatile CL 12 lift, 3 stage, low-profile alarms for more flexibility and Pro-Cut's new X9 on-car brake lathe, more precision in rotor matching, more repeatability, it'll stay calibrated over thousands of cuts. The trend in vehicle repair, more precision. That means more wheel alignments and more rotor matching, and Snap-on has the products that make it easier. 
Speaking about hit products and alignment, last quarter I mentioned the launch of the V3300 wheel aligner. I said it was a game changer, and so it was. Based on -- so it was, based on the enthusiastic reception from many prominent dealer networks. Now with a full quarter in the book, the results are in and the sales have been strong, and it's no wonder. We've spoken about the trend to more precision and that means more frequent alignments, enabling some of the new features like lane departure systems or adaptive cruise control. And the V3300 fits that trend, more alignments are in the future and the speed and the accuracy of the V3300 is a great asset. 
So to wrap up RS&I, we see it as a confirmation, together with the Tools Group, of the strength of the auto repair market. RS&I, great diagnostics, new repair information and expanded offerings of undercar equipment, all driving positive trends and improving our position with repair shop owners and managers. 
Well, that's the highlights of the quarter: growth and improvement, progress along our runways for coherent growth and clear advancements down our runways for improvement. When you step back and you look at these numbers, sales increasing organically by 2.9%; opco operating income margin of 19.1%, up 140 basis points; EPS, $2.36 in the quarter, 16.3% higher than last year. It was another encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"

Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $872.3 million were up 2.4%, including $10.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales. Excludi",1341,"Thanks, Nick. Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $872.3 million were up 2.4%, including $10.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales. Excluding foreign currency translation and acquisition-related sales, organic sales increased 2.9%, primarily reflecting higher sales in our businesses serving automotive repair, partially offset by lower sales to critical industries in our C&I segment. 
Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q2 sales comparisons by 120 basis points.  Consolidated gross margin of 49.4% improved 20 basis points from 2015 levels, as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $264.9 million yielded an operating expense margin of 30.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 120 basis points from 31.5% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, as well as lower stock-based mark-to-market compensations and other expenses, and the lower pension expense. As a result of these factors, operating earnings from financial services of $166.4 million, including $6.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 10.3% as compared to prior year, and as a percentage of sales increased 140 basis points to 19.1%. 
Financial services revenues of $69.3 million in the quarter increased 18.1% from 2015 levels. And operating earnings of $49.5 million increased 19.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the financial services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $215.9 million, including $6.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.3%. And the operating margin of 22.9% increased 180 basis points from 21.1% a year ago. 
Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 32% last year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full year 2015 rate of 31.7%. Finally, net earnings of $140.1 million or $2.36 per share, increased $20.1 million or $0.33 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 16.3% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $285.7 million in the second quarter decreased 3.4%. Excluding $4.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales declined 2% primarily due to a double-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, largely in the military and international aerospace market segments. This decline was partially offset by mid-single-digit increases in the segment's Asia Pacific and power tools operations, and a low single-digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business. Gross profit in the C&I group of $111.4 million compared to $112.9 million last year. The gross margin of 39% increased 80 basis points, mostly due to savings from RCI and other cost-reduction initiatives. 
Operating expenses of $72.1 million in the quarter compared to $70.7 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25.2% increased 130 basis points from 23.9% last year, primarily as a result of unfavorable sales volume leverage and 70 basis points of higher cost, including costs associated with continued expansion initiatives in Asia. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $39.3 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $2.9 million from 2015 levels and the operating margin of 13.8% compared to 14.3% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales from the Snap-on Tools Group of $416.7 million increased 4.5%. Excluding $4.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $22.7 million or 5.8%, reflecting similar gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $182.1 million compared to $176.5 million last year. The gross margin of 43.7% decreased 60 basis points largely due to 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $105.8 million in the quarter compared to $108.5 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25.4% improved 180 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives and 20 basis points of lower stock-based costs associated with the company's franchisees stock purchase program. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $76.3 million, including $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $8.3 million and the operating margin of 18.3% improved 120 basis points from 17.1% last year. 
Turning to the Repair Systems and Information or RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Second quarter sales of $295.2 million increased 6.4% from 2015 levels. Excluding $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 5.2%. The organic sales increase reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop-owners and managers as well, as mid-single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. Gross profit of $137.8 million compares to $129.6 million last year. Gross margin was 46.7% in both periods. 
Operating expenses of $63.3 million in the quarter compared to $61.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 21.5% improved 80 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Second quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $74.5 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.8 million from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 25.2% improved 80 basis points from 24.4% last year. 
Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $49.5 million and revenue of $69.3 million compared to operating earnings of $41.4 million on revenue of $58.7 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared to 17.8% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables of 9.3% in the quarter compared to 9.4% last year. Originations of $281 million increased 10.9% from 2015. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $1.7 billion of gross financing receivables including $1.5 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 82% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In the first half of 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $121.3 million. As for finance portfolio loans and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $162.1 million in the quarter increased $1.8 million from comparable 2015 levels, as higher net earnings and improvement in working investment were largely offset by the timing of cash tax payments. Net cash used by investing activities of $95.3 million included $76.9 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $20.6 million in the quarter compared with $27.7 million last year. 
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days was unchanged from 2015 year-end levels. Inventories increased $9.3 million from 2015 year-end levels, mainly to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.4 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end. 
Our quarter end tax position of $119.9 million increased $27.1 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $341.4 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $303.7 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $475.1 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $70.9 million, the repurchase of 377,000 shares for $58.5 million and $40.1 million for capital expenditures. Our net debt to capital ratio of 23% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end. 
In addition to our $119.9 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of second quarter end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Continuing the trend of positive performance with ongoing year-over-year gains, runways for growth, enhancing the van channel and expanding with repair shop owners and managers. Vehicle repair, a space with strong tailwinds, aging car parts, changing technologies and a need for more precision; abundant opportunity, and you can see it in the results. 
The Tools Group, growing 5.8% organically and an OI margin of 18.3%, up 120 basis points, something we haven't seen. And it was achieved against 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. RS&I, in the vehicle repair space, broad gains, growing at 5.2% organically. OI margins of 25.2%, up 80 basis points. Tools and RS&I up again, clear evidence that vehicle repair is strong and it has abundant opportunity and that Snap-on knows how to take full advantage. 
C&I, battling the difficulties in the military and international aviation, but proving it can extend and advance in sectors like U.S. aviation, power generation and in geographies like Europe, where our efforts with SNA Europe are paying off. And all of the combined author organic growth of 2.9%. 
The second quarter also bears the mark of Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, creating a growing list of new products to provide higher value, matching the needs for greater precision in performing the work of today and of tomorrow. 
And RCI, people all over the corporation getting up every day and making our complex business more efficient. Snap-on Value Creation drove our opco operating margin to 19.1%. Again, stepping back and looking at the performance and at the numbers. Growth, up 2.9% organically. Performance, opco operating margin of 19.1%, up 140 basis points, a significant rise, again, this quarter. And EPS of $2.36, a 16.3% increase. It was another encouraging quarter. And we believe that we have the abundant opportunity and the demonstrated capability to continue that positive trend on through the remainder of 2016 and well beyond. 
Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll directly speak to our franchisees and associates. I know that many of you are once again listening to this call. The encouraging results of this quarter reflect the special capability, energy and dedication you bring to our effort every day.

So I didn't get any feeling from that from an anecdotal point of view. And then during the quarter, I met with our group of our franchisees several times from the United States and Canada and so, and they seemed uniformly positive. And when I look at the numbers, I think this market looks like it has looked to us for multiple quarters now for a long time.

So there's a growth toward everybody needing a diagnostic; we see that in our everyday sales and trends in the market. But in this particular quarter, big-ticket items were fairly strong. High-value -- some of the things I talked about, high-value tools that attack precision like the BRUTUS 300 -- strong, strong seller. So the idea -- hand tools, in fact, were also up very strong. So we saw -- I think pretty wide strength. But again, in this quarter, big-ticket led the way.

If you go forward, if everything stayed where it is, for us, the pound is a big -- is kind of a big deal. So I think you would say that in the third quarter, the comparisons are such that there would be a slight easing, if everything stayed the way it was.

An easing of the pressure of currency, but I think that happens more in the fourth and the third, primarily because of the pound.

There's a lot of noise from quarter-to-quarter. But if you look at overall the last year, the originations are roughly the same as the sales of the big-ticket items. So it's being driven by the sale of those big-ticket items. And if you've been a student of Snap-on, you know that we have been energizing big-ticket sales through, we think, better product, of course, in diagnostics and tool storage, but also in terms of the marketing. In terms of the marketing, the Rock 'N Roll cabs and the TechKnow van. So if I didn't know anything, I would say Snap-on puts Rock 'N Roll Cabs and TechKnow vans in and it makes clear coat boxes, I'm going to see higher originations because it's going to have a higher big-ticket sale."

During the string of 23 out of 24, I think a year before, in '13 I think we grew it like -- we threw a bunch of 6s during that period, so it goes up and down. There is fluctuation. I've said this, I think -- look, I think the Tools Group goes in the 4 to 5 range if -- based on the tailwind. It's got -- that's a great market. Automotive repair is the market -- one of the markets -- in our models, one of the market or one of the business models that fell from Saturn [ph]  and automotive repairs is one of the great markets, you've got -- you got aging of the park and you got the changing of technology, you've got more precision, and that will drive us in the 4% to 5% range. And things like Rock 'N Roll Cab and TechKnow Express and the system program drives us up into higher levels, depending on how effective that unleashes the -- how much more effective that makes the van business. So from time to time, we get above this. And I think our ability to grow above the 4% to 5% depends on our ability to keep coming up with those things. That doesn't mean we can grow at every quarter. So I think that's how I view it. I think we were at a solid 4% to 5%, but I think if we can keep coming up with ways to amplify our business, the technicians are there. There's 1.3 million technicians, we're calling on 850,000 of them. So a lot of them are retiring every year. So we see a great market there.

I'll start this call with some of the highlights of our second quarter. I'll speak about the general environment and the trends we see, and I'll take you through some of the progress we've made.

I'll speak about the general environment and the trends we see, and I'll take you through some of the progress we've made. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. 
Our second quarter was encouraging. And we believe it once again offered evidence of clear advancements along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Reported sales were up 2.4% or -- to $872.3 million and that included unfavorable foreign currency translation this quarter, an impact of $10.2 million. It also reflected an incremental $5.9 million from last year's Ecotechnics acquisition. 
Now organic sales for the quarter rose 2.9%. Opco operating margin expanded by 140 basis points. And earnings per share, they reached $2.36, up 16.3% compared with the $2.03 the last year. The opco operating margin reached 19.1%, up from 17.7% in 2015. And that 140 basis point increase reflects the higher sales, but it also represents the power of Snap-on value creation. For financial services, operating income grew to $49.5 million from last year's $41.4 million, combining with opco to drive our consolidated operating margin to 22.9%, up 180 basis points. 
From an overall macro perspective, the automotive repair arena remains strong. And that can be seen clearly in the businesses serving that sector, the tools group and the repair systems and information or RS&I group. They continue to make progress in the quarter, both in and outside United States. The Tools Group organic activity increased 5.8%, once again demonstrating the ability to expand on our already strong position, leveraging a stream of new products and innovative solutions, capturing more business by helping technicians keep pace with changing vehicle technologies and with the aging fleet. 
And RS&I, organic gains of 5.2%, higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shops, owner -- independent repair shop owners and managers, increased volumes with OEM dealerships, expanded activity in undercar equipment and broad progress in most regions. 
For the Commercial & Industrial Group, or C&I Group, organic sales were down 2%. Results were mixed across our industrial sectors and geographies. And in critical industries, headwinds surrounding our military business remain; spending stagnation from Washington continued in the quarter. We also witnessed ongoing inactivity within the Middle East. Aviation customers delaying project work, due in part to the turbulence throughout that area, that region. That said, there were positive industrial sectors in places like U.S. aviation and power generation, where we made progress based on our understanding of the task -- our increasing understanding of the task, and our extending product lines that enable that work. 
Also a positive for C&I, SNA Europe advanced. SNA Europe, our European hand tools business delivering positive results, broad strength across the core of Europe in places like the U.K., Germany and Spain, in a period when the word Brexit entered our vocabulary accompanied by uncertainty. 
So the overall results remain positive. Strength in vehicle repair, mixed performances from critical industries and advancements against the wind in Europe, opportunities outweighing the challenges and the sales growth confirms it. And the operating income clearly demonstrated the leverage and the power of Snap-on value creation -- our Snap-on value creation processes in safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. In this quarter, special note should be made of customer connection and innovation, keeping pace with the aging car park and the changing technologies across the workplaces of the world. 
And another broad trend, as we move toward automatic control and more drive by wire, is the growing need for more precision and mechanical adjustments and more insight into data trends. Snap-on innovation is responding to that opportunity. And the products that support the need for precision and insight helped drive our sales and our margins in the quarter. Customer connection and innovation, and in fact, all of the Snap-on value creation processes helped us advance down our runways for improvement every day, driving our 140 basis point OI gain and overcoming the challenges. 
Well, that's the overview, that's the macro overview. Now, let's turn to the groups. Let's move to the groups. We'll start with C&I. As I just said, a 2% organic sales decrease with lower critical industry activity and higher volume at SNA Europe and our Asia Pacific and power tools operations. The operating income margin was 13.8%, a 5% -- a 50 basis point decrease, impacted principally by the reduced sales in the higher-margin critical industry businesses.
For the industrial division, we had headwinds. But as we said, we also had sectors of growth. U.S. aviation sales were higher, bolstered by innovative new product like our latest in the tool control solutions, the automated tool control locker. You may remember our ATC smart toolboxes, visually keeping track of workplace hand tools. Well, the new ATC locker brings that asset control to irregularly-shaped items like extension cords, toolkits and plastic or fabric carrying cases, personal protective equipment, all common in aviation shops. The new ATC locker makes tracking those nonstandard tools easy and reliable. And like the smart box, the ATC locker is fully networkable. It enables tracking from a central site, displaying the tool controls status for easy surveillance and avoidance of foreign object damage. Avoiding foreign object damage, a really important feature in those critical aviation applications; we can all relate to that. And based on the early reception, we believe we have a winning extension to our flagship tool control line with this locker, selling well. 
Now we often speak about customer connection, direct observation of the work and guiding new product innovation based on that observation. Well, the industrial division is constantly introducing new products borne out of that value-creating process. One example is our SGDE series of electrostatic dissipative screwdrivers, great for places like avionics maintenance shops or any critical application where static discharge can damage sensitive equipment. 
Special conductivity to dissipate static and then a rotating handle mechanism that's ideal for precise detailed electronics work. Safety and precision, 2 special needs made clear by direct observations at aviation MRO back shops across the world, customer connection in action, making work easier in the aviation sector. That's what these screwdrivers are. 
Another customer connection. This time, the offset crowfoot adapter for the especially-configured fasteners at power generation sites. It replaces homemade welded tools that frequently break and damage those high-voltage insulators; we've all seen them on the top of transformers. Damage that equals a critical failure. Visiting those substations, observing the work, we also saw Frankenstein-like modified tools, welded out of multiple tools, trying to do the transformer tasks, and we knew we could do better. So we designed a Snap-on professional tool that's more durable, safer and easier to use. It's a great attraction in power generation. And it's products like that, that are behind this quarter's positive results in that sector. 
Now let's speak about SNA Europe. During the double dip in Europe, we said we would use RCI energetically, and we did. But we also said we wouldn't reduce capacity. Well, that faith is paying off. SNA Europe registered its 11th straight quarter of year-over-year sales growth, a positive trend in the very uncertain economic environment of Europe. And profit? Q2 marked the 13th straight quarter of margin improvement. SNA Europe up again in sales and in profit. 
Our Asia Pacific operations also contributed positively. And we kept investing in that region, more products, more distribution, more capabilities, positioning to take advantage of that building potential. Well, that's the C&I story. Turbulence in certain critical industries, partially offset by progress in other divisions. 
Now let's move to the Tools Group. Organic sales were up 5.8%, reflecting mid-single-digit gains in the U.S. and internationally. Operating margin of 18.3%, up 120 basis points overcoming 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. That 18.3% and 120 basis point rise, it's a clear demonstration of our improving position and progress along one of our more -- most important runways for growth, enhancing the van channel. The advancements are evident in the sales and in the margins. And perhaps, most importantly, in the overall franchisee health metrics which are all trending positively, again, this quarter. We believe our franchisees are growing stronger, armed with an array of innovative products. Products like the new quarter inch drive extra long flex head ratchet. At 10.5 inches, it allows technicians to work in difficult-to-reach spots -- under the dash, in tight engine compartments or anywhere that access is limited. And it combines our patented dual pull system with a finely machined 72-tooth gear, more power and less lateral space at a distance. It's manufactured in Elizabethton, Tennessee -- in our Elizabethton, Tennessee tool plant, and it's the next in the series of extra-long handled tools designed specifically to make the technicians' toughest jobs much easier. And we believe it does just that, and early sales have been robust. 
Now we've been making torque products for some time and the second quarter -- but in the second quarter we launched a heavy-duty half inch drive mechanical torque wrench. We call it the BRUTUS, the BRUTUS 300, targeted at technicians servicing larger vehicles. It solves a critical need: making it possible to torque a wide range of fasteners using a single tool in places where a number of special tools would normally be required. 
Today, the trend I described, many larger vehicles, large SUVs and pickup trucks, responding to the need for more precise specifications require a wider range of torque, some in tight places, some on varied components, some above 250 foot pounds -- big components, like brake calibers, Pitman arms and wheel hubs. 
Previously, a technician would go through a time-consuming multi-tool procedure, sometimes just torque by judgment. The BRUTUS uses Snap-on's unique metallurgical capability to reach in the farthest places, fit in the smallest spaces, but have the strength necessary for larger torque values, all in a relatively-light package for less fatigue. It's manufactured at our plant in City of Industry, California. It's long, small, light and strong, responding to a growing need for precise torquing in larger vehicles. 
Along with the innovative product, the Tools Group has another special advantage, our financial services arm, Snap-on credit. Strategic program aimed at supporting those essential big-ticket purchases. The credit company is focused on enhancing our van network. And again, this quarter, it did just that. So that's the Tools Group, new products guided by customer connection driving sales growth and strong margins. 
Now on to RS&I. Solid across the group. Organic sales of $14.2 million or 5 point -- organic sales growth of $14.2 million or 5.2%. Operating margin, 25.2%, rising 80 basis points, broad-based progress operation-by-operation, the diagnostics and information businesses selling to independent repair shops, driven by our award-winning handheld diagnostics products and by our extensive database of repair solutions. 
Whether it's the top-of-the-line VERUS Edge, with its comprehensive diagnostics, technical service bulletins and the power of SureTrack big repair data for advanced professionals and working on those really difficult repair, whether it's that big VERUS edge or advanced professionals, or for the entry-level technician the ETHOS Tech with its considerable functionality and attractive price point, the Snap-on lineup of handhelds makes work easier across the garage. 
Some of today's vehicles now have over 100 electronic control units, all requiring service. So the demand for diagnostic tools and data insight is rising. And to support those growing complexities, our Mitchell1 team continues to refine its ProDemand product, expanding make and model coverage, adding the most recent vehicle platforms, broadening search result, improving navigation, providing even more shortcuts to a quick fix with its SureTrack big database -- all of it saving technician's time. The Mitchell1 solution gets better every quarter and we see it in the results. 
Now sales undercar equipment, also up mid-single digits, with growth registered in the U.S. and our international markets. The U.S. gains included a particular strength by a pair of our recent acquisitions, the Challenger Lifts and Pro-Cut brake lathes, both expanding the Snap-on's presence in the garage and both progressing well in the quarter, with products like Challenger's versatile CL 12 lift, 3 stage, low-profile alarms for more flexibility and Pro-Cut's new X9 on-car brake lathe, more precision in rotor matching, more repeatability, it'll stay calibrated over thousands of cuts. The trend in vehicle repair, more precision. That means more wheel alignments and more rotor matching, and Snap-on has the products that make it easier. 
Speaking about hit products and alignment, last quarter I mentioned the launch of the V3300 wheel aligner. I said it was a game changer, and so it was. Based on -- so it was, based on the enthusiastic reception from many prominent dealer networks. Now with a full quarter in the book, the results are in and the sales have been strong, and it's no wonder. We've spoken about the trend to more precision and that means more frequent alignments, enabling some of the new features like lane departure systems or adaptive cruise control. And the V3300 fits that trend, more alignments are in the future and the speed and the accuracy of the V3300 is a great asset. 
So to wrap up RS&I, we see it as a confirmation, together with the Tools Group, of the strength of the auto repair market. RS&I, great diagnostics, new repair information and expanded offerings of undercar equipment, all driving positive trends and improving our position with repair shop owners and managers. 
Well, that's the highlights of the quarter: growth and improvement, progress along our runways for coherent growth and clear advancements down our runways for improvement. When you step back and you look at these numbers, sales increasing organically by 2.9%; opco operating income margin of 19.1%, up 140 basis points; EPS, $2.36 in the quarter, 16.3% higher than last year. It was another encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"

Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $872.3 million were up 2.4%, including $10.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales. Excludi",1341,"Thanks, Nick. Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $872.3 million were up 2.4%, including $10.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales. Excluding foreign currency translation and acquisition-related sales, organic sales increased 2.9%, primarily reflecting higher sales in our businesses serving automotive repair, partially offset by lower sales to critical industries in our C&I segment. 
Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q2 sales comparisons by 120 basis points. Consolidated gross margin of 49.4% improved 20 basis points from 2015 levels, as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $264.9 million yielded an operating expense margin of 30.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 120 basis points from 31.5% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, as well as lower stock-based mark-to-market compensations and other expenses, and the lower pension expense. As a result of these factors, operating earnings from financial services of $166.4 million, including $6.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 10.3% as compared to prior year, and as a percentage of sales increased 140 basis points to 19.1%. 
Financial services revenues of $69.3 million in the quarter increased 18.1% from 2015 levels. And operating earnings of $49.5 million increased 19.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the financial services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $215.9 million, including $6.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.3%. And the operating margin of 22.9% increased 180 basis points from 21.1% a year ago. 
Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 32% last year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full year 2015 rate of 31.7%. Finally, net earnings of $140.1 million or $2.36 per share, increased $20.1 million or $0.33 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 16.3% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $285.7 million in the second quarter decreased 3.4%. Excluding $4.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales declined 2% primarily due to a double-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, largely in the military and international aerospace market segments. This decline was partially offset by mid-single-digit increases in the segment's Asia Pacific and power tools operations, and a low single-digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business. Gross profit in the C&I group of $111.4 million compared to $112.9 million last year. The gross margin of 39% increased 80 basis points, mostly due to savings from RCI and other cost-reduction initiatives. 
Operating expenses of $72.1 million in the quarter compared to $70.7 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25.2% increased 130 basis points from 23.9% last year, primarily as a result of unfavorable sales volume leverage and 70 basis points of higher cost, including costs associated with continued expansion initiatives in Asia. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $39.3 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $2.9 million from 2015 levels and the operating margin of 13.8% compared to 14.3% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales from the Snap-on Tools Group of $416.7 million increased 4.5%. Excluding $4.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $22.7 million or 5.8%, reflecting similar gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $182.1 million compared to $176.5 million last year. The gross margin of 43.7% decreased 60 basis points largely due to 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $105.8 million in the quarter compared to $108.5 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25.4% improved 180 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives and 20 basis points of lower stock-based costs associated with the company's franchisees stock purchase program. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $76.3 million, including $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $8.3 million and the operating margin of 18.3% improved 120 basis points from 17.1% last year. 
Turning to the Repair Systems and Information or RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Second quarter sales of $295.2 million increased 6.4% from 2015 levels. Excluding $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 5.2%. The organic sales increase reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop-owners and managers as well, as mid-single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. Gross profit of $137.8 million compares to $129.6 million last year. Gross margin was 46.7% in both periods. 
Operating expenses of $63.3 million in the quarter compared to $61.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 21.5% improved 80 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Second quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $74.5 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.8 million from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 25.2% improved 80 basis points from 24.4% last year. 
Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $49.5 million and revenue of $69.3 million compared to operating earnings of $41.4 million on revenue of $58.7 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared to 17.8% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables of 9.3% in the quarter compared to 9.4% last year. Originations of $281 million increased 10.9% from 2015. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $1.7 billion of gross financing receivables including $1.5 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 82% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In the first half of 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $121.3 million. As for finance portfolio loans and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $162.1 million in the quarter increased $1.8 million from comparable 2015 levels, as higher net earnings and improvement in working investment were largely offset by the timing of cash tax payments. Net cash used by investing activities of $95.3 million included $76.9 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $20.6 million in the quarter compared with $27.7 million last year. 
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days was unchanged from 2015 year-end levels. Inventories increased $9.3 million from 2015 year-end levels, mainly to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.4 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end. 
Our quarter end tax position of $119.9 million increased $27.1 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $341.4 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $303.7 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $475.1 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $70.9 million, the repurchase of 377,000 shares for $58.5 million and $40.1 million for capital expenditures. Our net debt to capital ratio of 23% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end. 
In addition to our $119.9 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of second quarter end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Continuing the trend of positive performance with ongoing year-over-year gains, runways for growth, enhancing the van channel and expanding with repair shop owners and managers. Vehicle repair, a space with strong tailwinds, aging car parts, changing technologies and a need for more precision; abundant opportunity, and you can see it in the results. 
The Tools Group, growing 5.8% organically and an OI margin of 18.3%, up 120 basis points, something we haven't seen. And it was achieved against 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. RS&I, in the vehicle repair space, broad gains, growing at 5.2% organically. OI margins of 25.2%, up 80 basis points. Tools and RS&I up again, clear evidence that vehicle repair is strong and it has abundant opportunity and that Snap-on knows how to take full advantage. 
C&I, battling the difficulties in the military and international aviation, but proving it can extend and advance in sectors like U.S. aviation, power generation and in geographies like Europe, where our efforts with SNA Europe are paying off. And all of the combined author organic growth of 2.9%. 
The second quarter also bears the mark of Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, creating a growing list of new products to provide higher value, matching the needs for greater precision in performing the work of today and of tomorrow. 
And RCI, people all over the corporation getting up every day and making our complex business more efficient. Snap-on Value Creation drove our opco operating margin to 19.1%. Again, stepping back and looking at the performance and at the numbers. Growth, up 2.9% organically. Performance, opco operating margin of 19.1%, up 140 basis points, a significant rise, again, this quarter. And EPS of $2.36, a 16.3% increase. It was another encouraging quarter.

So I didn't get any feeling from that from an anecdotal point of view. And then during the quarter, I met with our group of our franchisees several times from the United States and Canada and so, and they seemed uniformly positive. And when I look at the numbers, I think this market looks like it has looked to us for multiple quarters now for a long time. So empirically, with the numbers, and anecdotally from what I get from talking to franchisees and technicians, I think this is pretty positive."

So there's a growth toward everybody needing a diagnostic; we see that in our everyday sales and trends in the market. But in this particular quarter, big-ticket items were fairly strong. High-value -- some of the things I talked about, high-value tools that attack precision like the BRUTUS 300 -- strong, strong seller. So the idea -- hand tools, in fact, were also up very strong. So we saw -- I think pretty wide strength. But again, in this quarter, big-ticket led the way.

An easing of the pressure of currency, but I think that happens more in the fourth and the third, primarily because of the pound.

So from time to time, we get above this. And I think our ability to grow above the 4% to 5% depends on our ability to keep coming up with those things. That doesn't mean we can grow at every quarter.

The product moves from Snap-on tools to the franchisees, it might go into inventory, it might sell directly, and it might ignite say, okay, I sold you this Mr. Big box, it's like 15 feet wide and I took your 7-foot box in trade and I'm selling that; both transactions would be financed. And so while the net -- you get a discount from the original for the amount in trade and then that would be on some -- the total amount tends to be sort of the same, the timing of those 2 things can be very different. So a franchisee might end up, in his garage, might have 3 boxes, used boxes waiting there. And then one quarter might roll them all out, might find a seller for them. You see what I mean?"

I tend to think, as we get more installed base, we'll see both because people will buy in first. The entry technician will buy in at the bottom level for that ETHOS.

Generally, if you think about the numbers of people that we have in the field, the 3,487 vans and versus the -- even the advanced Matco numbers, we're -- our people are much more focused and spend more time with a certain amount of customers and call on those customer bases.

In the third quarter, we again showed progress along our runways for growth and for improvement. And we saw those gains across all our operating segments. Total reported sales were $834.1 million, up 1.5%, and that included $9.7 million of unfavorable currency. It also included the incremental $1.1 million of sales from last year's acquisition of Ecotechnics. Organic sales were up 2.6%. And the opco operating margin, it was up 140 basis points, reaching 18.9%. When you add in the $50.6 million of operating earnings from financial services, and that was up from $43.5 million in 2015, the consolidated operating margin was 23%, an increase of 180 basis points. Our EPS was $2.22, up $0.24, a double-digit increase, rising 12.1% from last year.
Let's consider the environment. Look at that environment. Automotive repair continues to be favorable, and we believe our Tools Group and our Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group, they're both well-positioned to take full advantage of the opportunity.
The Tools Group clearly demonstrated enhancements to the franchise network, gains in both the North American and European markets, continuing to make the most of the opportunities so abundant in an aging and changing vehicle fleet.
At RS&I, serving repair shop owners and managers, sales progress was mixed. The volume of diagnostics and repair information products independent shops was up mid-single-digits. For the OEM side, activity with individual dealers was up, while programs commissioned by the OEM manufacturers, a historically lumpy space, was down. Undercar equipment was flat with variations from product line to product line.
For Commercial & Industrial or C&I, the group was up organically, 1.5%. Snap-on Europe, SNA Europe was higher again, making progress against the turbulence of Brexit and the other uncertainties across this market. The Industrial business was flat, reflecting the challenges we've seen now for a year. Significantly, however, the critical industry activity recorded its second straight quarter of sequential growth following more than a year of decreases, reductions driven by the difficult macro environment in areas like oil and gas, military in the Middle East.
Now there will always be headwinds across our operations. They were a factor in other quarters and they were present in the third quarter, but we did overcome, we did keep growing because we're well-positioned to confront the challenges and continue to proceed down our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding the repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industry and building an emerging market. These do represent our growth strategies, and we continue to make progress along those quarters.
At the same time, those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, Rapid Continuous Improvement or, as we call it, RCI. Together, these are the processes, the tools we use each and every day to drive improvement. And improvement is written all over our results, especially customer connection, understanding the work of professional technician; and innovation, matching that insight with technology to make work, work easier.
Snap-on Value Creation once again led to more prestigious awards. We were recently honored with 2 MOTOR Magazine Top 20 and with 5 Professional Tool and Equipment News or PTEN Innovation Awards, which -- those winners represent only a fraction of a wide array of new products borne out of the insight of our franchisees and our direct sales people, translating workplace observations into productivity solutions. And in the quarter, those customer connections were a big factor in our results.
To see some of that, let's move to the individual groups. Commercial & Industrial, organic sales up, with an operating margin reaching 15.1%, an increase of 80 basis points from last year's 14.3%, the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation evident in the ongoing stream of innovative new products developed for the critical industries.
One of those products launched in the third quarter by our Industrial division is the PWZ5 pliers wrench. This wrench is the latest and the largest model in the popular Snap-on PWZ series. It's long, 41 and 3/4 inches. It can handle jobs that would traditionally require a pipe wrench with much less slippage for better overall performance and for better safety. It features inwardly angled teeth, fine at the back, large at the front for a stronger and more secure grip on objects of all sizes. And the narrow jaw design gives improved accessibility in tight compartments and those cramped corners. It's perfect for applications in tie rods and other areas that are hard to reach and industries like railroad, oil and gas for servicing fleets, actually any heavy-duty application. You heard me speak about -- in the past about our growing Industrial product line. Well, this wrench is another great addition to our hand tool lineup for critical industries.
Now, SNA Europe, 12 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth, navigating some difficult geographies and some tepid economies. SNA Europe sales activity continues to be positive. But its profits are even more encouraging, now up for 14 straight quarters, and we believe there's still more opportunity.
In the Asia Pacific operations, mixed environment across the region. We continue to invest in building our physicals, and the Asia operation had gains contributing to the progress in the quarter. So that's C&I.
Now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales up 5.6%. Significant growth both in the U.S. and international -- internationally. Operating income of $64.6 million compared to $56.3 million in 2015. The operating income margin of 16.3% rose 150 basis points from last year's 14.8%. Volume gains as well as operating improvements from RCI translated into a significant margin rise. And that 150 basis point gain, it overcame 60 basis points of negative currency.
When you consider the Tools Group success, you can see the power of Snap-on Value Creation, of customer connection and innovation, the MOTOR Top 20 and the PTEN Award represent just a few examples of the recognition our products continue to receive. Awards from industry publications, but also awards from the professionals that use our tools everyday.
Innovation. It's consistently been a key contributor to our Tools Group. And in the third quarter, more new products like our Reversible Ratcheting Combination Wrench, the latest in the lineup of Snap-on wrenches, adding a reversible feature to our patented ratcheting mechanism, utilizing our Dual 80 technology, combining dual pulls with thin wall box and design, smooth operation, more torque transfer on tight spaces in a court. It incorporates the iconic Snap-on Flank Drive profile, biting into fasteners without rounding corners, preventing slippage. The new Reversible Ratcheting Combo Wrench, it's more turning power, enhanced durability, compact design and built stronger to last longer. This is the core of Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation solving specific problems in the shop.
Take the new 20 millimeter 12-Point Impact Socket, borne from hours of observation in the workplace. This socket is designed to remove head bolts in large industrial engines, long enough to reach the deepest of inset bolt and strong enough to remove the toughest fasteners, a unique combination. It's produced in our Elkmont, Alabama plant and it's essential for servicing a large off-road equipment. It may not be needed often, but when it is, it's critical, and Snap-on has it. It's just another example of our commitment to make work easier, solving our technicians' most challenging problems.
The third quarter is also when we hold the annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference or SFC. This year, it was in Orlando, with more than 8,700 attendees, franchisees and family members from over 3,000 routes, 3 days of showcasing the opportunities to enhance the franchise channel. And I can report to you, because I was there, that based on the optimism and the confidence of our franchisees, it was a big success. And orders, because we take orders at these events, and orders, well they were up once again, beating the record levels of 2015.
And when we speak of that channel, we also have to consider the strategic combination of Snap-on Credit. Our financial services arm helps create opportunities across the organization, but especially within the Tools Group. It's been an ongoing partnership for over 50 years. And our credit company had a strong presence at this year's SFC, supporting franchisees with unique programs. 270,000 of our approximately 875,000, about 30% of our technician customers in the United States have credit company contracts, enabling those big ticket items. The credit company has been a key part of franchisee success and the third quarter was no exception to that.
Now let's move to RS&I. Organic sales were up 1.7%. The operating margin, up 25.1%. It increased 50 basis points from the 24.6% registered last year. As I mentioned, RS&I clearly showed progress in providing repair information and diagnostics to independent shop owners and managers.
And certainly, a portion of that growth came from innovative new products, several launched at the SFC, products like the MODIS Edge, our latest diagnostic offering, an enhanced industrial design, improved ergonomics, reduced weight and coat scan capability that allows the tech to scan all of a vehicle's computer systems with the push of a single button. It also contains fast access to oil change and recent information, automatic vehicle identification and our unique SureTrack Expert database, all features specifically designed to save the technician significant time. This new handheld is lighter, faster and smarter. And simply based on the excited crowd of franchisees at the SFC that carved out precious time to attend MODIS Edge hands-on training, we expect it to be a very popular item.
Another exciting SFC launch was our Diagnostic Thermal Imager. This completely new Snap-on offering is a breakthrough in pinpointing problems with a graphical display illustrating surface data, temperature data and a reference library of nominal and out-of-spec thermal images for a variety of auto parts found in brakes, emission systems and in vehicle electrical equipment. We believe we have a winner with the Diagnostic Thermal Imager and orders at the SFC prove it. It sold out.
And RS&I innovation wasn't just in diagnostics products. Take the brand-new Polartek air conditioning unit from a recent acquisition, Ecotechnics. Developed and manufactured specifically for the North American market, meeting a very aggressive launch, both our U.S. and our Canadian customers have a firm, the strength of the units design and performance. It's been a real testament to the capability of the Ecotechnics team. 
And speaking of products. Getting more to sell to the repair shop owners and managers. This week, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Car-O-Liner, based in Gothenburg, Sweden, but reaching around the globe. Car-O-Liner's product offering and its special expertise are important additions to the Snap-on team, providing extraordinary capabilities in collision repair, a segment where change now authoring opportunity. It's an operation that strengthens our position, both in auto and in heavy duty. Car-O-Liner is another coherent business, and we believe that matched with the Snap-on team, it offers substantial possibilities for both growth and for improvement. All of that, great opportunity going forward. 
So that's the highlights of our quarter. Organic sales up 2.6%, gains across all groups, progress along our runways for growth, Snap-on Value Creation, turning customer connection insights into innovative new products, and along with our ongoing RCI initiatives, driving margin improvement, and it all shows in the results. Opco OI margin rising to 18.9%, up 140 basis points; EPS of $2.22, up 12.1%. It was an encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"

Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $834.1 million were up $12.6 million or 1.5%. Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q3 sales comparisons by 120 basis points. Excluding $9.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $1.1 million of acquisition-related sales, organic sales increased 2.6%, reflecting continued progress in serving the vehicle repair sector as well as improvements in sales in our commercial and industrial segment. 
Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 70 basis points from 2015 levels, primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives. 
Operating expenses of $261.5 million yielded an operating expense margin of 31.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 70 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and lower pension expense. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $157.6 million, including $4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 9.7%, and as a percentage of sales, improved 140 basis points to 18.9%. 
Financial services revenue of $71.6 million in the quarter increased 17.2% from 2015 levels, and operating earnings of $50.6 million increased 16.3%. 
Consolidated operating earnings of $208.2 million, including $4.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.3%. And the operating margin of 23% improved 180 basis points from 21.2% a year ago. 
Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.2% compared to 31.6% last year. For the full year, we now anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be slightly below our full year 2015 rate of 31.7%. 
Finally, net earnings of $131.7 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, increased $14.9 million or $0.24 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 12.1% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now, let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $289.3 million in the third quarter increased modestly over 2015 levels. Excluding $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 1.5%, primarily due to a mid-single-digit increase in the segments European based [indiscernible] business and a low-single-digit increase in both the segment's power tools and Asia Pacific operations.
Organic sales to customers in critical industries were essentially flat, as the decline in aerospace market segment was largely offset by a gain in sales to the military and increases in both the technical education and natural resources market segments. Despite the continued presence of certain headwinds in the industrial space, we were encouraged that sales performance has improved from what we had seen earlier in the year. 
Gross profit in the C&I group of $112.7 million compared to $109.5 million last year. The gross margin of 39% improved 110 basis points primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives and 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $69 million in the quarter compared to $68.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 23.9% increased 30 basis points, primarily as a result of higher cost, including cost associated with continued expansion initiatives in Asia and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $43.7 million, including $0.3 million of favorable foreign currency effects, increased $2.4 million from 2015 levels, and the operating margin of 15.1% improved 80 basis points from 14.3% last year, representing a recent high for C&I and up 130 basis points sequentially. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $397.2 million increased 4.4%. Excluding $4.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $21.2 million or 5.6%, reflecting mid-single-digit gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $173.3 million compared to $166.5 million last year. Gross margin of 43.6% declined 20 basis points, as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were more than offset by 16 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $108.7 million in the quarter compared to $110.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 27.3% improved 170 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI and other cost-reduction initiatives. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $64.6 million, including $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $8.3 million, and the operating margin of 16.3% improved 150 basis points from 14.8% last year. 
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Third quarter sales of $286.1 million increased 1.1% from 2015 levels. Excluding $2.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $1.1 million of acquisition-related sales, organic sales increased 1.7%. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. 
In the quarter, sales of both under car equipment and sales to OEM dealerships were essentially flat. As Nick mentioned, sales to OEM dealerships this quarter were particularly impacted by the timing of essential tools and facilitation program sales. For example, sales in Q3 of last year benefited from a refrigeration-related facility action program, which has since lapsed. 
Gross profit of $133.1 million compared to $130.9 million last year, and the gross margin of 46.5% improved 20 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $61.3 million in the quarter compared to $61.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 21.4% improved 30 basis points principally due to savings from RCI initiatives. 
Third quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $71.8 million, including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $2.1 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 25.1% improved 50 basis points from 24.6% last year. 
As we announced earlier this week and as Nick mentioned in his remarks, we have entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Car-O-Liner. Car-O-Liner's annual sales are approximately $95 million, and we expect them to generate operating income margin somewhat similar to those of RS&I's undercar equipment business, which are typically in the low teens. We expect to complete the acquisition of Car-O-Liner within the next month. Our plan is to fund the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and approximately $125 million in issuances of commercial paper. 
Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $50.6 million on revenue of $71.6 million compared to operating earnings of $43.5 million on revenue of $61.1 million last year. Financial services expenses in the quarter included some additional headcount-related expenses to help better serve our growing portfolio. But as a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.2% in both periods. 
The average yield on finance receivables of 18% in the quarter compared to 17.9% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.4% compared to 9.5% last year. 
Originations of $269.8 million in the quarter increased 4.7% from prior year levels. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $1.8 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.6 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 81% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In the first 9 months of 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $190.3 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $111.9 million in the quarter decreased $1.8 million from comparable 2015 levels as higher net earnings were more than offset by $11.4 million of higher cash tax payments and $5.4 million of higher U.S. pension contributions. 
Net cash used by investing activities of $69.2 million included $56 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables and $16.5 million of capital expenditures. 
Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $26.6 million from 2015 year-end levels, reflecting both higher sales and an increase in days sales outstanding from 60 days at year-end to 63 days at third quarter end. 
Inventories increased $25.8 million from 2015 year-end levels primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.3 compared with 3.5 turns in 2015 year end. 
Our quarter-end cash position of $117.5 million increased $24.7 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $501.7 million of cash collections from finance receivables and $415.6 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of the $691.4 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $106.3 million, the repurchase of 492,000 shares for $76.4 million and $56.6 million for capital expenditures. 
Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 22.6% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end. 
In addition to our $117 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of third quarter end, we had $8 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance, and I'll now turn the call back over to Nick."

Looking back and looking at the snap Snap-on third quarter, we believe a number of things are apparent. Our part of the auto repair market is solid. As we've seen in the past, it follows a different trajectory than new car sales. It was reliable even in the withering recession of 2009 and is strong today. And we believe our ability to take advantage of that opportunity grows every quarter, and you can see it in the results. 
Tools Group, sales up 5.6% organically. The franchisees, more prosperous and stronger. The group's OI margin, up 150 basis points, again 60 basis points of unfavorable currency. The credit company continuing to service as the Tools Group strategic partner, enabling franchisees and technicians, as it has done for 5 decades, through recession after recession, without disruption. 
RS&I, selling to repair shop owners and managers, mixed growth. In countering the usual ups and downs of OEM-sponsored programs but showing real progress with individual shops, both independent and dealers. 
And C&I, a mixed turbulence but now growing again, showing year-over-year and sequential gains despite the difficult macros. And despite the difficult macro, registering an operating margin of 15.1%, up 80 basis points, showing what we believe is confirmation of the great value it offers as a runway for coherent growth. 
And finally in the results, you can see the effects of Snap-on value creation, more new product driving games and the engine of rapid continuous improvement authoring efficiency, it all came together for organic sales growth of 2.6% and an opco operating margin of 18.9%, up 140 basis points, and an EPS of $2.22, an increase of 12.1%, a double-digit gain again. 
And the Car-O-Liner acquisition, giving us more to sell, more opportunities for coherent growth and providing more possibilities for the Snap-on value creation to drive progress. It's a great opportunity. It was an encouraging quarter, and we believe it clearly confirms the future of continuous Snap-on growth and improvement as we move through the end of this year and into 2017 and beyond. 
Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening or will listen to this call.

And inci",451,"Sure. Look, a couple of things. First of all, big-ticket, the idea of Snap-on tools, Snap-on tool storage, tool storage and diagnostics -- were strong in the quarter, in fact, stronger than -- so much longer than the overall Snap-on Tools growth. And incidentally, this is hand tool were also pretty strong in the quarter. So still a good quarter for big-ticket items, which are the principal driver for these things. Secondly, and the reason that is the case, reason why big-ticket has been the case, is because we've been investing in product, great new tool storage products and a number of huge features and a number of great attractive products that get customers excited. The fact that diagnostics are more important in the repair shop than ever before and technicians and are trying to, I guess, caliber up to have better and bigger diagnostics to take care of those products, it's natural that big-ticket items would be stronger, so you would see that. So I think that looking at the Tools Group and seeing lead that way is just the consequence of our investment in the marketplace we think and the kinds of products we've had and the demand in the market associated, the shift in the market associated with more diagnostics. And also our investment in enabling events that break through this original structure barriers of demand that is the space and time, the rock 'n roll cast, which we've talked about quite a bit, which helps tool storage, and the techno vas, we have 67 of them now, and TechKnow vans, we have 49 of them, and that drives fairly robust bigger ticket item sales. In terms of higher double digits before -- double-digit originations before and the somewhat less originations now, you can't trace quarter-to-quarter, because there is an appropriate 1 for 1 correlation. Remember that when you're looking at originations, you're looking at franchisee sales. When you're looking at a tools Group, you're looking at our sales. So we sell to the franchisees, so the timing is different. Then you have on top on that the franchisees margin. And then you have on top of that, the idea that a tool storage sale or a diagnostics sale may ignite a couple of trade-in types sales, which would also be somewhat supported by the credit company. So you put those all together, and that shows the landscape. But when we step back and we look at the, say, 2015 numbers, when we look at the 2015 numbers about originations and the Tools Group big-ticket sales, they seem pretty much the same. And this year, we are starting to see year to date the same kind of thing."

This quarter, you actually maintain the strong rate of growth, organic growth stable quarter-over-quarter, originations came down. That either to me seems like the hand tool category maybe strengthened quarter-over-quarter or this whole relationship of thinking Tools Group as a byproduct of the credit business maybe isn't the most accurate relationship."

Of course, it has grown because the market has -- the customers have turned that way, and we have invested into support that with new product. And also, part of the way we figured out how to enable the Van has been associated with that segment. But it's a natural thing.

So I think we've been able to grow that margin in a lot of different situations in an overall basis.

That's doing pretty well. I think the big thing about diagnostics this time, I mean, not diagnostics, but RS&I at this time, as I try to made clear in the quarter, we have been this business in RS&I, which produces -- which takes contract OEM commission contract to distribute, you could talk essential tools or it's facilitated projects. So for example, you might have somebody that Aldo referred to this, to do some air-conditioning, provide air conditioning reclaim system for all its dealers. One of the manufacturers say, I want you to provide air-conditioning system. I want you to get it to my dealer. I want it to be 2 per dealer and I want it to be rolled out the next 4 quarters or 3 quarters. We roll it out. That's a pretty big piece of sales business. You might have another  one that does an essential tool for a particular new product or a new technology that rolls out on a new truck, and that rolls through [ph] in a quarter. But what happens is, these are driven by the view of the OEM and the technology and the differences that are rolled into their new models, so they tend to be quite lumpy. And what happened in this quarter for that particular type of business, this was kind of a stall quarter in that business and that created the overhang in our -- one of the overhangs in the RS&I.

We have market hit products than we ever had. Secondly, our franchisees are stronger. They are stronger. And despite the fact they're stronger, they seem to be hungrier for more product.

But generally, overall, volume, it was a great market for Snap-on. U.K. was one of our better markets. The problem is in the currency. So it becomes a big dinger in terms of -- it becomes a big effect in terms of sales, translation effect on our sales, because we have pretty good sales in pound. And secondly, remember, we are selling into the British market, selling in pound, but we're making in dollars, we're making in United States. So we have a transactional impact. So if you step back and you look at our currency in the -- overall for the corporation, that 2 22 -- $2.22, it had $0.05 of currency impact and a lot of that was the U.K., a lot of it was U.K. Of course, there were some other factors in there. And then looking forward, when you start to look at, the U.K. started kind of went down in the quarter, so we think it's kind of like from a sales perspective looking forward, we probably don't see as much pressure from translation, but the profitability will be about the same, maybe a little bit more impacted going forward because of the pound. Now, going out beyond where we are now, that's based on where we sit today in terms of the pound. If the pound gets weaker, it will impact us more. But that's the major factor. We think our product and our improved capabilities overwhelm the sales factor, the selling factor. It's just the currency sensitivity factor."

Good to see the continued improvement in the profitability across the group still and still seeing that nice growth in the financial services area. And appreciated that a little bit of color earlier on the differentiation between what's going on in hand tools and the growth in financial services. Just the final question remaining for me, was I noticed that on a percentage basis, if you take a look at your inner segment number on the breakdown for revenue with the segments, it's gotten a little bit larger compared to history. It's running now above 14% kind of number as a percentage of the total -- of the segment revenues, and on an absolute basis, now up to $139 million. Just curious what's driving that. And should we be expecting that percentage to be higher amount of the total going forward?"

In the third quarter, we again showed progress along our runways for growth and for improvement. And we saw those gains across all our operating segments. Total reported sales were $834.1 million, up 1.5%, and that included $9.7 million of unfavorable currency. It also included the incremental $1.1 million of sales from last year's acquisition of Ecotechnics. Organic sales were up 2.6%. And the opco operating margin, it was up 140 basis points, reaching 18.9%. When you add in the $50.6 million of operating earnings from financial services, and that was up from $43.5 million in 2015, the consolidated operating margin was 23%, an increase of 180 basis points. Our EPS was $2.22, up $0.24, a double-digit increase, rising 12.1% from last year.
Let's consider the environment. Look at that environment. Automotive repair continues to be favorable, and we believe our Tools Group and our Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group, they're both well-positioned to take full advantage of the opportunity.
The Tools Group clearly demonstrated enhancements to the franchise network, gains in both the North American and European markets, continuing to make the most of the opportunities so abundant in an aging and changing vehicle fleet.
At RS&I, serving repair shop owners and managers, sales progress was mixed. The volume of diagnostics and repair information products independent shops was up mid-single-digits. For the OEM side, activity with individual dealers was up, while programs commissioned by the OEM manufacturers, a historically lumpy space, was down. Undercar equipment was flat with variations from product line to product line.
For Commercial & Industrial or C&I, the group was up organically, 1.5%. Snap-on Europe, SNA Europe was higher again, making progress against the turbulence of Brexit and the other uncertainties across this market. The Industrial business was flat, reflecting the challenges we've seen now for a year. Significantly, however, the critical industry activity recorded its second straight quarter of sequential growth following more than a year of decreases, reductions driven by the difficult macro environment in areas like oil and gas, military in the Middle East.
Now there will always be headwinds across our operations. They were a factor in other quarters and they were present in the third quarter, but we did overcome, we did keep growing because we're well-positioned to confront the challenges and continue to proceed down our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding the repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industry and building an emerging market. These do represent our growth strategies, and we continue to make progress along those quarters.
At the same time, those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, Rapid Continuous Improvement or, as we call it, RCI. Together, these are the processes, the tools we use each and every day to drive improvement. And improvement is written all over our results, especially customer connection, understanding the work of professional technician; and innovation, matching that insight with technology to make work, work easier.
Snap-on Value Creation once again led to more prestigious awards. We were recently honored with 2 MOTOR Magazine Top 20 and with 5 Professional Tool and Equipment News or PTEN Innovation Awards, which -- those winners represent only a fraction of a wide array of new products borne out of the insight of our franchisees and our direct sales people, translating workplace observations into productivity solutions. And in the quarter, those customer connections were a big factor in our results.
To see some of that, let's move to the individual groups. Commercial & Industrial, organic sales up, with an operating margin reaching 15.1%, an increase of 80 basis points from last year's 14.3%, the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation evident in the ongoing stream of innovative new products developed for the critical industries.
One of those products launched in the third quarter by our Industrial division is the PWZ5 pliers wrench. This wrench is the latest and the largest model in the popular Snap-on PWZ series. It's long, 41 and 3/4 inches. It can handle jobs that would traditionally require a pipe wrench with much less slippage for better overall performance and for better safety. It features inwardly angled teeth, fine at the back, large at the front for a stronger and more secure grip on objects of all sizes. And the narrow jaw design gives improved accessibility in tight compartments and those cramped corners. It's perfect for applications in tie rods and other areas that are hard to reach and industries like railroad, oil and gas for servicing fleets, actually any heavy-duty application. You heard me speak about -- in the past about our growing Industrial product line. Well, this wrench is another great addition to our hand tool lineup for critical industries.
Now, SNA Europe, 12 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth, navigating some difficult geographies and some tepid economies. SNA Europe sales activity continues to be positive. But its profits are even more encouraging, now up for 14 straight quarters, and we believe there's still more opportunity.
In the Asia/Pacific operations, mixed environment across the region. We continue to invest in building our physicals, and the Asia operation had gains contributing to the progress in the quarter. So that's C&I.
Now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales up 5.6%. Significant growth both in the U.S. and international -- internationally. Operating income of $64.6 million compared to $56.3 million in 2015. The operating income margin of 16.3% rose 150 basis points from last year's 14.8%. Volume gains as well as operating improvements from RCI translated into a significant margin rise. And that 150 basis point gain, it overcame 60 basis points of negative currency.
When you consider the Tools Group success, you can see the power of Snap-on Value Creation, of customer connection and innovation, the MOTOR Top 20 and the PTEN Award represent just a few examples of the recognition our products continue to receive. Awards from industry publications, but also awards from the professionals that use our tools everyday.
Innovation. It's consistently been a key contributor to our Tools Group. And in the third quarter, more new products like our Reversible Ratcheting Combination Wrench, the latest in the lineup of Snap-on wrenches, adding a reversible feature to our patented ratcheting mechanism, utilizing our Dual 80 technology, combining dual pulls with thin wall box and design, smooth operation, more torque transfer on tight spaces in a court. It incorporates the iconic Snap-on Flank Drive profile, biting into fasteners without rounding corners, preventing slippage. The new Reversible Ratcheting Combo Wrench, it's more turning power, enhanced durability, compact design and built stronger to last longer. This is the core of Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation solving specific problems in the shop.
Take the new 20 millimeter 12-Point Impact Socket, borne from hours of observation in the workplace. This socket is designed to remove head bolts in large industrial engines, long enough to reach the deepest of inset bolt and strong enough to remove the toughest fasteners, a unique combination. It's produced in our Elkmont, Alabama plant and it's essential for servicing a large off-road equipment. It may not be needed often, but when it is, it's critical, and Snap-on has it. It's just another example of our commitment to make work easier, solving our technicians' most challenging problems.
The third quarter is also when we hold the annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference or SFC. This year, it was in Orlando, with more than 8,700 attendees, franchisees and family members from over 3,000 routes, 3 days of showcasing the opportunities to enhance the franchise channel. And I can report to you, because I was there, that based on the optimism and the confidence of our franchisees, it was a big success. And orders, because we take orders at these events, and orders, well they were up once again, beating the record levels of 2015.
And when we speak of that channel, we also have to consider the strategic combination of Snap-on Credit. Our financial services arm helps create opportunities across the organization, but especially within the Tools Group. It's been an ongoing partnership for over 50 years. And our credit company had a strong presence at this year's SFC, supporting franchisees with unique programs. 270,000 of our approximately 875,000, about 30% of our technician customers in the United States have credit company contracts, enabling those big ticket items. The credit company has been a key part of franchisee success and the third quarter was no exception to that.
Now let's move to RS&I. Organic sales were up 1.7%. The operating margin, up 25.1%. It increased 50 basis points from the 24.6% registered last year. As I mentioned, RS&I clearly showed progress in providing repair information and diagnostics to independent shop owners and managers.
And certainly, a portion of that growth came from innovative new products, several launched at the SFC, products like the MODIS Edge, our latest diagnostic offering, an enhanced industrial design, improved ergonomics, reduced weight and coat scan capability that allows the tech to scan all of a vehicle's computer systems with the push of a single button. It also contains fast access to oil change and recent information, automatic vehicle identification and our unique SureTrack Expert database, all features specifically designed to save the technician significant time. This new handheld is lighter, faster and smarter. And simply based on the excited crowd of franchisees at the SFC that carved out precious time to attend MODIS Edge hands-on training, we expect it to be a very popular item.
Another exciting SFC launch was our Diagnostic Thermal Imager. This completely new Snap-on offering is a breakthrough in pinpointing problems with a graphical display illustrating surface data, temperature data and a reference library of nominal and out-of-spec thermal images for a variety of auto parts found in brakes, emission systems and in vehicle electrical equipment. We believe we have a winner with the Diagnostic Thermal Imager and orders at the SFC prove it. It sold out.
And RS&I innovation wasn't just in diagnostics products. Take the brand-new Polartek air conditioning unit from our recent acquisition, Ecotechnics. Developed and manufactured specifically for the North American market, meeting a very aggressive launch, both our U.S. and our Canadian customers have affirmed the strength of the unit's design and performance. It's been a real testament to the capability of the Ecotechnics team.
And speaking of products, getting more to sell to the repair shop owners and managers, this week, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Car-O-Liner based in Gothenburg, Sweden, but reaching around the globe. Car-O-Liner's product offering and its special expertise are important additions to the Snap-on team, providing extraordinary capabilities in collision repair, a segment where change is now authoring opportunity. It's an operation that strengthens our position, both in auto and in heavy duty. Car-O-Liner is another coherent business and we believe that, matched with the Snap-on team, it offers substantial possibilities for both growth and for improvement. All of that, great opportunity going forward.
So that's the highlights of our quarter. Organic sales up 2.6%; gains across all groups; progress along our runways for growth; Snap-on Value Creation, turning our customer connection insights into innovative new products; and along with our ongoing RCI initiatives, driving margin improvement. And it all shows in the results. Opco OI margin rising to 18.9%, up 140 basis points; EPS of $2.22, up 12.1%. It was an encouraging quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"

Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $834.1 million were up $12.6 million or 1.5%. Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q3 sales comparisons by 120 basis points. Excluding $9.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $1.1 million of acquisition-related sales, organic sales increased 2.6%, reflecting continued progress in serving the vehicle repair sector as well as improvements in sales in our Commercial & Industrial segment.
Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 70 basis points from 2015 levels, primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives.
Operating expenses of $261.5 million yielded an operating expense margin of 31.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 70 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and lower pension expense.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $157.6 million, including $4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 9.7% and, as a percentage of sales, improved 140 basis points to 18.9%.
Financial services revenue of $71.6 million in the quarter increased 17.2% from 2015 levels and operating earnings of $50.6 million increased 16.3%.
Consolidated operating earnings of $208.2 million, including $4.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.3%. And the operating margin of 23% improved 180 basis points from 21.2% a year ago.
Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.2% compared to 31.6% last year. For the full year, we now anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be slightly below our full year 2015 rate of 31.7%.
Finally, net earnings of $131.7 million or $2.22 per diluted share increased $14.9 million or $0.24 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 12.1% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $289.3 million in the third quarter increased modestly over 2015 levels. Excluding $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 1.5%, primarily due to a mid-single-digit increase in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a low-single-digit increase in both the segment's power tools and Asia/Pacific operations.
Organic sales to customers in critical industries were essentially flat as the decline in the aerospace market segment was largely offset by a gain in sales to the military and increases in both the technical education and natural resources market segments. Despite the continued presence of certain headwinds in the industrial space, we were encouraged that sales performance has improved from what we had seen earlier in the year.
Gross profit in the C&I group of $112.7 million compared to $109.5 million last year. The gross margin of 39% improved 110 basis points primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives and 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses of $69 million in the quarter compared to $68.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 23.9% increased 30 basis points, primarily as a result of higher cost, including cost associated with continued expansion initiatives in Asia and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $43.7 million, including $0.3 million of favorable foreign currency effects, increased $2.4 million from 2015 levels and the operating margin of 15.1% improved 80 basis points from 14.3% last year, representing a recent high for C&I and up 130 basis points sequentially.
Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $397.2 million increased 4.4%. Excluding $4.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $21.2 million or 5.6%, reflecting mid-single-digit gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations.
Gross profit of $173.3 million compared to $166.5 million last year. Gross margin of 43.6% declined 20 basis points as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were more than offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses of $108.7 million in the quarter compared to $110.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 27.3% improved 170 basis points primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $64.6 million, including $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $8.3 million and the operating margin of 16.3% improved 150 basis points from 14.8% last year.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Third quarter sales of $286.1 million increased 1.1% from 2015 levels. Excluding $2.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $1.1 million of acquisition-related sales, organic sales increased 1.7%. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.
In the quarter, sales of both undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships were essentially flat. As Nick mentioned, sales to OEM dealerships this quarter were particularly impacted by the timing of essential tool and facilitation program sales. For example, sales in Q3 of last year benefited from a refrigeration-related facility action program which has since elapsed.
Gross profit of $133.1 million compared to $130.9 million last year and the gross margin of 46.5% improved 20 basis points primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses of $61.3 million in the quarter compared to $61.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 21.4% improved 30 basis points principally due to savings from RCI initiatives.
Third quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $71.8 million, including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $2.1 million from prior year levels and the operating margin of 25.1% improved 50 basis points from 24.6% last year.
As we announced earlier this week and as Nick mentioned in his remarks, we have entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Car-O-Liner. Car-O-Liner's annual sales are approximately $95 million and we expect them to generate operating income margin somewhat similar to those of RS&I's undercar equipment business, which are typically in the low teens.
We expect to complete the acquisition of Car-O-Liner within the next month. Our plan is to fund the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and approximately $125 million in issuances of commercial paper.
Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $50.6 million on revenue of $71.6 million compared to operating earnings of $43.5 million on revenue of $61.1 million last year. Financial services expenses in the quarter included some additional headcount-related expenses to help better serve our growing portfolio. But as a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.2% in both periods. The average yield on finance receivables of 18% in the quarter compared to 17.9% last year and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.4% compared to 9.5% last year. Originations of $269.8 million in the quarter increased 4.7% from prior year levels.
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.8 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.6 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 81% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In the first 9 months of 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $190.3 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $111.9 million in the quarter decreased $1.8 million from comparable 2015 levels as higher net earnings were more than offset by $11.4 million of higher cash tax payments and $5.4 million of higher U.S. pension contributions. 
Net cash used by investing activities of $69.2 million included $56 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables and $16.5 million of capital expenditures.
Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $26.6 million from 2015 year-end levels, reflecting both higher sales and an increase in days sales outstanding from 60 days at year-end to 63 days at third quarter-end.
Inventories increased $25.8 million from 2015 year-end levels primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.3 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end.
Our quarter-end cash position of $117.5 million increased $24.7 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $501.7 million of cash collections from finance receivables and $415.6 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $691.4 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $106.3 million, the repurchase of 492,000 shares for $76.4 million and $56.6 million for capital expenditures.
Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 22.6% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end.
In addition to our $117 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of third quarter-end, we had $8 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. And I'll now turn the call back over to Nick."

Looking back and looking at the Snap-on third quarter, we believe a number of things are apparent. Our part of the auto repair market is solid. As we've seen in the past, it follows a different trajectory than new car sales. It was reliable even in the withering recession of 2009 and it's strong today. And we believe our ability to take advantage of that opportunity grows every quarter. And you can see it in the results.
Tools Group, sales up 5.6% organically. The franchisees, more prosperous and stronger. The group's OI margin, up 150 basis points, again 60 basis points of unfavorable currency.
The credit company continuing to serve as the Tools Group's strategic partner, enabling franchisees and technicians, as it has done for 5 decades, through recession after recession without disruption.
RS&I, selling to repair shop owners and managers, mixed growth. In countering the usual ups and downs of OEM-sponsored programs, but showing real progress with individual shops, both independent and dealers.
And C&I, amidst turbulence, but now growing again, showing year-over-year and sequential gains despite the difficult macros. And despite the difficult macros, registering an operating margin of 15.1%, up 80 basis points, showing what we believe is confirmation of the great value it offers as a runway for coherent growth.
And finally, in the results, you can see the effects of Snap-on Value Creation, more new product driving gains and the engine of Rapid Continuous Improvement authoring efficiency. It all came together for organic sales growth of 2.6% and an opco operating margin of 18.9%, up 140 basis points; and an EPS of $2.22, an increase of 12.1%, a double-digit gain again.
And the Car-O-Liner acquisition, giving us more to sell, more opportunities for coherent growth and providing more possibilities for Snap-on Value Creation to drive progress. It's a great opportunity.
It was an encouraging quarter. And we believe it clearly confirms the future of continuous Snap-on growth and improvement as we move through the end of this year and into 2017 and beyond.
Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening or will listen to this call. Once again, you should know that the encouraging performance of our corporation is only possible because of your capability, your energy and your dedication. For your extraordinary contributions to our progress, you have my congratulations. And for your unfailing commitment to our team, you have my thanks.

First of all, big ticket, the idea of Snap-on tools, Snap-on tool storage and diagnostics was -- were strong in the quarter, in fact, stronger than -- so much stronger than the overall Snap-on tools growth. And incidentally",461,"Sure. Look, a couple of things. First of all, big ticket, the idea of Snap-on tools, Snap-on tool storage and diagnostics was -- were strong in the quarter, in fact, stronger than -- so much stronger than the overall Snap-on tools growth. And incidentally, this is a side, hand tools were also pretty strong in the quarter. So it was still a good quarter for big ticket items, which are the principal driver for these things.
Secondly -- and the reason that is the case, reason why big ticket has been the case is because we've been investing in product, great new tool storage products and a number of huge features and a number of great attractive products that get customers excited. The fact that diagnostics are more important in the repair shop than ever before and technicians are trying to, I guess, caliber up to have better and bigger diagnostics to take care of those products, it's natural that big ticket items would be stronger, so you would see that. So I think that looking at the Tools Group and seeing that lead the way is just the consequence of our investment in the marketplace we think. And it's the kinds of products we've had and the demand in the market associated -- the shift in the market associated with more diagnostics, and also our investment in enabling events that break through this original structural barriers of demand that is the space and time. The Rock 'N Roll Cab, which we've talked about quite a bit, which helped tool storage, and the TechKnow vans -- we have 67 of them now, and the TechKnow vans, we have 49 of them, and that drives fairly robust bigger ticket item sales.
In terms of higher double digits before -- double-digit originations before and the somewhat less originations now, you can't trace quarter-to-quarter because there is an appropriate one for one correlation. Remember that when you're looking at originations, you're looking at franchisee sales. When you're looking at the Tools Group, you're looking at our sales. So we sell to the franchisees, so the timing is different. Then, you have on top on that the franchisees' margin. And then, you have on top of that the idea that a tool storage sale or a diagnostics sale may ignite a couple of trade-in type sales, which would also be somewhat supported by the credit company.
So you put those all together and that shows the landscape. But when we step back and we look at the, say, 2015 numbers, when we look at the 2015 numbers about originations and the Tools Group big ticket sales, they seem pretty much the same. And this year, we're starting to see, year-to-date, the same kind of thing."

This quarter, you actually maintained a strong rate of growth, organic growth stable quarter-over-quarter, originations came down. That either to me seems like the hand tool category maybe strengthened quarter-over-quarter or this whole relationship of painting Tools Group as a byproduct of the credit business maybe isn't the most accurate relationship."

It has grown because the market has -- the customers have turned that way and we have invested into support that with new product. And also part of the way we figured out how to enable the van has been associated with that segment, but it's a natural thing. I've been talking about the Rock 'N Roll Cabs for multiple quarters, and that would, naturally, of course, drive a little bit more credit company activity. Okay?"

So for example, not in this particular quarter, because we wouldn't make product adjustments for the quarter, we see opportunities, we build out -- our goal is to build up in each of the markets. For example, last year, we brought out 920 new products just for aviation; 330 for oil and gas, even though it was having probably one of the most difficult times; 313 for the military, even though it was difficult times. So we just keep adding, not so much targeting.
Now we saw some great opportunities as you saw in heavy duty, the substitute for the pipe wrench, that's a great new product. And so we see things like that all the time. We see enhancements to our visual controls, our tool control system, which we've seen now. Amazingly, we've seen the tool control systems more and go bleed into oil and gas. We had a major sale in Canada associated with oil and gas as opposed when we had been using it just for aviation. We can see it rolling into railroads, so with small enhancements, that's the kind of thing we're doing."

Of course, when we want them -- we got our eyeballs bleeding for trying double-digit growth, that kind of thing, you maybe pass out on some efficiency opportunities, but we like to believe we take full advantage of those kinds of things.
I think though, if you look at our overall numbers, if you look at the OI margin growth for the corporation and you take a look at the year-over-year opco margin and you go back and see it, you'll see that it's been triple digits an awful lot of times awfully far back in big sales growth and small sales growth. So I think we've been able to grow that margin in a lot of different situations in an overall basis.
Now, when -- in the situation of the Tools Group, it does give you a little more advantage, a little opportunity to look at that. But I wouldn't let -- I wouldn't allow the characterization that 5.6% is dual growth. I think that's pretty good growth.

So I think that's doing pretty well.
I think the big thing about diagnostics this time -- I mean, not diagnostics, but RS&I at this time, as I tried to make clear in the quarter, we had this business in RS&I which produces -- which takes contracts, OEM-commissioned contracts to distribute -- well, you could talk essential tools or facilitated projects. So for example, you might have somebody that, Aldo referred to this, to do some air conditioning, provide an air conditioning reclaim system for all its dealers. One of the manufacturers say I want you to provide an air conditioning system, I want you to get it to my dealers, I want it to be 2 per dealer and I want it to be rolled out in the next 4 quarters or 3 quarters. We roll it out. That's a pretty big piece of sales business. You might have another one that does an essential tool for a particular new product or a new technology that rolls out on a new truck, and that rolls through in a quarter. But what happens is these are driven by the view of the OEM and the technology and the differences that are rolling through their new models, so they tend to be quite lumpy. And what happened in this quarter for that particular type of business, this was kind of a stall quarter in that business and that created the overhang in our -- one of the overhangs in RS&I. So now [indiscernible] the stuff we sell to individual dealers was pretty good."

Just a quick follow-up on RS&I and specifically the undercar business being flat. We've heard similar commentary from other aftermarket retailers and installers, and they mostly been referencing the residual impact from last year's middle -- mild winter weather. Just thinking about some of the industry fundamentals and miles driven being up, it feels like it's a bit surprising that, that segment is still lagging. And, I guess, the question is do you think there's some pent-up demand there or some real opportunity for you as we kind of lap last winter and slowly inch to 2017?"

On the other hand, I heard people say, yes, people are crashing into each other left and right. There's a lot of repair. We need more lifts. We need more alignments going on. People are running into bumpers or bouncing into potholes. So it's a double-edged sword. I'm not so sure for us.
I don't do think there's opportunity in our business. What we saw there was variation from product to product. We saw kind of a stronger quarter in alignment and a couple of the other product lines are a little bit weaker. We didn't really think it was very significant or indicative of anything, actually, for us. We do think there's opportunity for the equipment business going forward though because we like our product."

The thing is, I can tell you, I was just with a bunch of franchisees and -- from all over the country. This is the franchisee -- the National Franchisee Advisory Council. They all seem positive and they're representing their regions. So I didn't run into a single person who was saying [indiscernible]. They weren't saying that. They were positive.
At the SFC, I can't emphasize enough how important it is when people order more year-over-year. What it means is they're putting their money on the line. They're committing to taking product that they think things are going to be positive. So they've got a positive outlook. So we feel good about that.
What's driving our business, I think, are 3 -- maybe 3 factors. One is our new product is pretty robust. You heard me talk about a couple of them. From hand tools -- hand tools were up in the quarter. Tool storage is up in the quarter. Diagnostics is up in the quarter. You talked about that product line because our -- I think about customer -- innovation is better than ever before. We have more hit products than we ever had. Secondly, our franchisees are stronger. They are stronger. And despite the fact they're stronger, they seem to be hungrier for more product. And thirdly, we've invested in things in the vans like the Rock 'N Roll Cabs, the assist -- our -- for the TechKnow vans. And our franchisees are so confident they're taking on assistance, so that model itself is getting better.
Said another way, it's a great market. Auto repair is a great market. And like I said, every quarter we know how to take better advantage of the opportunity. You can see it in the numbers."

One is we believe Car-O-Liner is a great brand, but when you smear the Snap-on patina over it, it's even stronger.
Secondly, this is a space which is changing. Different materials are requiring different modes of collision repair, and Car-O-Liner is at the upfront on that regard with their product line. And our research and engineering can augment those 50 or 45 engineers at Car-O-Liner to make them better.
Thirdly, we think that repair is starting to become more important in collision shops because there's intelligence that's distributed around the car. You get a dent, you've got to repair things. And so we can bring the repair aspect to collision shops something no one else can do in this space, our products in terms of our physical products and our database associated with repair.

Look, Brexit, of course, as I referenced, is a challenge for us as far as the turbulence in Europe.

Look, Brexit, of course, as I referenced, is a challenge for us as far as the turbulence in Europe. But in fact, if you look at the 3 pieces of our businesses in Europe, if you look at the Tools Group, up strong in the U.K. You look at RS&I, up nicely. But you look at SNA Europe, and SNA Europe was up in the quarter again, I think it was the 12th straight quarter of growth, that was down slightly. So Brexit might have hurt them a little bit. Really, but generally, overall volume, it was a great market for Snap-on. U.K. was one of our better markets.
The problem is in the currency. So it becomes a big dinger in terms of -- it becomes a big effect in terms of sales, translation effect on our sales because we have pretty good sales in pounds. And secondly, remember, we're selling into the British market, selling in pounds, but we're making in dollars. We're making in the United States. So we have a transactional impact. So if you step back and you look at our currency in the -- overall for the corporation, that $2.22, it had $0.05 of currency impact and a lot of that was the U.K., a lot of it was U.K. Of course, there were some other factors in there.
And then, looking forward, when you start to look at -- the U.K. started, it kind of went down in the quarter. So we think it's kind of like from a sales perspective looking forward, we probably don't see as much pressure from translation, but the profitability will be about the same, maybe a little bit more impacted going forward because of the pound.
Now going out beyond where we are now, that's based on where we sit today in terms of the pound. If the pound gets weaker, it will impact us more. But that's the major factor. We think our product and our improved capabilities overwhelm the sales factor, the selling factor. It's just that the currency tends to impact us."

In the third quarter, we again showed progress along our runways for growth and for improvement. And we saw those gains across all our operating segments. Total reported sales were $834.1 million, up 1.5%, and that included $9.7 million of unfavorable currency. It also included the incremental $1.1 million of sales from last year's acquisition of Ecotechnics. Organic sales were up 2.6%. And the opco operating margin, it was up 140 basis points, reaching 18.9%. When you add in the $50.6 million of operating earnings from financial services, and that was up from $43.5 million in 2015, the consolidated operating margin was 23%, an increase of 180 basis points. Our EPS was $2.22, up $0.24, a double-digit increase, rising 12.1% from last year.
Let's consider the environment. Look at that environment. Automotive repair continues to be favorable, and we believe our Tools Group and our Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I, Group, they're both well-positioned to take full advantage of the opportunity.
The Tools Group clearly demonstrated enhancements to the franchise network, gains in both the North American and European markets, continuing to make the most of the opportunities so abundant in an aging and changing vehicle fleet.
At RS&I, serving repair shop owners and managers, sales progress was mixed. The volume of diagnostics and repair information products with independent shops was up mid-single-digits. For the OEM side, activity with individual dealers was up, while programs commissioned by the OEM manufacturers, a historically lumpy space, was down. Undercar equipment was flat, with variations from product line to product line.
For Commercial & Industrial, or C&I, the group was up organically, 1.5%. Snap-on Europe, SNA Europe was higher again, making progress against the turbulence of Brexit and the other uncertainties across this market. The Industrial business was flat, reflecting the challenges we've seen now for a year. Significantly, however, the critical industry activity recorded its second straight quarter of sequential growth following more than a year of decreases, reductions driven by the difficult macro environment in areas like oil and gas, military and the Middle East.
Now there will always be headwinds across our operations. They were a factor in other quarters and they were present in the third quarter, but we did overcome, we did keep growing, because we're well-positioned to confront the challenges and continue to proceed down our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding the repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industry and building an emerging market. These do represent our growth strategies, and we continue to make progress along those quarters.
At the same time, those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, Rapid Continuous Improvement or, as we call it, RCI. Together, these are the processes, the tools we use each and every day to drive improvement. And improvement is written all over our results, especially customer connection, understanding the work of the professional technician; and innovation, matching that insight with technology to make work, work easier.
Snap-on Value Creation once again led to more prestigious awards. We were recently honored with 2 MOTOR Magazine Top 20 and with 5 Professional Tool and Equipment News, or PTEN, Innovation Awards, which -- those winners represent only a fraction of a wide array of new products borne out of the insight of our franchisees and our direct sales people, translating workplace observations into productivity solutions. And in the quarter, those customer connections were a big factor in our results.
To see some of that, let's move to the individual groups. Commercial & Industrial, organic sales up, with an operating margin reaching 15.1%, an increase of 80 basis points from last year's 14.3%, the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation evident in the ongoing stream of innovative new products developed for the critical industries.
One of those products launched in the third quarter by our Industrial division is the PWZ5 pliers wrench. This wrench is the latest and the largest model in the popular Snap-on PWZ series. It's long, 41 3/4 inches. It can handle jobs that would traditionally require a pipe wrench with much less slippage for better overall performance and for better safety. It features inwardly angled teeth, fine at the back, large at the front for a stronger and more secure grip on objects of all sizes. And the narrow jaw design gives improved accessibility in tight compartments and those cramped corners. It's perfect for applications in tie rods and other areas that are hard to reach in industries like railroad, oil and gas for servicing fleets, actually, any heavy-duty application. You heard me speak about -- in the past, about our growing Industrial product line. Well, this wrench is another great addition to our hand tool lineup for critical industries.
Now, SNA Europe, 12 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth, navigating some difficult geographies and some tepid economies. SNA Europe sales activity continues to be positive. But its profits are even more encouraging, now up for 14 straight quarters, and we believe there's still more opportunity.
In the Asia-Pacific operations, mixed environment across the region. We continue to invest in building our physicals, and the Asia operation had gains contributing to the progress in the quarter. So that's C&I.
Now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales up 5.6%. Significant growth both in the U.S. and international -- internationally. Operating income of $64.6 million compared to $56.3 million in 2015. The operating income margin of 16.3% rose 150 basis points from last year's 14.8%. Volume gains as well as operating improvements from RCI translated into a significant margin rise. And that 150 basis point gain, it overcame 60 basis points of negative currency.
When you consider the Tools Group success, you can see the power of Snap-on Value Creation, of customer connection and innovation. The MOTOR Top 20 and the PTEN Award represent just a few examples of the recognition our products continue to receive. Awards from industry publications, but also awards from the professionals that use our tools every day.
Innovation. It's consistently been a key contributor to our Tools Group. And in the third quarter, more new products like our Reversible Ratcheting Combination Wrench, the latest in the lineup of Snap-on wrenches, adding a reversible feature to our patented ratcheting mechanism, utilizing our Dual 80 technology, combining dual pulls with thin walls, box and design, smooth operation, more torque transfer in tight spaces and, of course, it incorporates the iconic Snap-on Flank Drive profile, biting into fasteners without rounding corners, preventing slippage. The new Reversible Ratcheting Combo Wrench, it's more turning power, enhanced durability, compact design and built stronger to last longer. This is the core of Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation solving specific problems in the shop.
Take the new 20 millimeter 12-Point Impact Socket, borne from hours of observation in the workplace, hours of observation in the workplace. This socket is designed to remove head bolts in large industrial engines, long enough to reach the deepest of inset bolts and strong enough to remove the toughest fasteners, a unique combination. It's produced in our Elkmont, Alabama plant and it's essential for servicing large off-road equipment. It may not be needed often, but when it is, it's critical, and Snap-on has it. It's just another example of our commitment to make work easier, solving our technicians' most challenging problems.
The third quarter is also when we hold the annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, or SFC. This year, it was in Orlando, with more than 8,700 attendees, franchisees and family members from over 3,000 routes, 3 days of showcasing the opportunities to enhance the franchise channel. And I can report to you, because I was there, that based on the optimism and the confidence of our franchisees, it was a big success. And orders, because we take orders at these events, and orders, well, they were up once again, beating the record levels of 2015.
And when we speak of van channel, we also have to consider the strategic combination of Snap-on Credit. Our financial services arm helps create opportunities across the organization, but especially within the Tools Group. It's been an ongoing partnership for over 50 years. And our credit company had a strong presence at this year's SFC, supporting franchisees with unique programs. 270,000 of our approximately 875,000, about 30% of our technician customers in the United States have credit company contracts, enabling those big-ticket items. The credit company has been a key part of franchisee success and the third quarter was no exception to that.
Now let's move to RS&I. Organic sales were up 1.7%. The operating margin, up 25.1%. It increased 50 basis points from the 24.6% registered last year. As I mentioned, RS&I clearly showed progress in providing repair information and diagnostics to independent shop owners and managers.
And certainly, a portion of that growth came from innovative new products, several launched at the SFC, products like the MODIS Edge, our latest diagnostic offering, an enhanced industrial design, improved ergonomics, reduced weight and coat scan capability that allows the tech to scan all of a vehicle's computer systems with the push of a single button. It also contains fast access to oil change and reset information, automatic vehicle identification and our unique SureTrack Expert database, all features specifically designed to save the technician significant time. This new handheld is lighter, faster and smarter. And simply based on the excited crowd of franchisees at the SFC that carved out precious time to attend MODIS Edge hands-on training, we expect it to be a very popular item.
Another exciting SFC launch was our Diagnostic Thermal Imager. This completely new Snap-on offering is a breakthrough in pinpointing problems, with a graphical display illustrating surface data, temperature data and a reference library of nominal and out-of-spec thermal images for a variety of auto parts found in brakes, emission systems and in vehicle electrical equipment. We believe we have a winner with the Diagnostic Thermal Imager and orders at the SFC prove it. It sold out.
And RS&I innovation wasn't just in diagnostics products. Take the brand-new Polartek air-conditioning unit from our recent acquisition, Ecotechnics. Developed and manufactured specifically for the North American market, meeting a very aggressive launch, both our U.S. and our Canadian customers have affirmed the strength of the unit's design and performance. It's been a real testament to the capability of the Ecotechnics team.
And speaking of products, of getting more to sell to the repair shop owners and managers, this week, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Car-O-Liner based in Gothenburg, Sweden, but reaching around the globe. Car-O-Liner's product offering and its special expertise are important additions to the Snap-on team, providing extraordinary capabilities in collision repair, a segment where change is now authoring opportunity. It's an operation that strengthens our position, both in auto and in heavy duty. Car-O-Liner is another coherent business and we believe that, matched with the Snap-on team, it offers substantial possibilities for both growth and for improvement. All of that, a great opportunity going forward.
So that's the highlights of our quarter. Organic sales up 2.6%; gains across all groups; progress along our runways for growth; Snap-on Value Creation, turning our customer connection insights into innovative new products; and along with our ongoing RCI initiatives, driving margin improvement. And it all shows in the results. Opco OI margin rising to 18.9%, up 140 basis points; EPS of $2.22, up 12.1%. It was an encouraging quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"
303646,403998025,1057963,"Snap-on Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Nick.Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $834.1 million were up $12.6 million or 1.5%. Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q3 sales c",1544,"Thanks, Nick.
Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $834.1 million were up $12.6 million or 1.5%. Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q3 sales comparisons by 120 basis points. Excluding $9.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $1.1 million of acquisition-related sales, organic sales increased 2.6%, reflecting continued progress in serving the vehicle repair sector as well as improvements in sales in our Commercial & Industrial segment.
Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 70 basis points from 2015 levels, primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives.
Operating expenses of $261.5 million yielded an operating expense margin of 31.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 70 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and lower pension expense.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $157.6 million, including $4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 9.7% and, as a percentage of sales, improved 140 basis points to 18.9%.
Financial services revenue of $71.6 million in the quarter increased 17.2% from 2015 levels and operating earnings of $50.6 million increased 16.3%.
Consolidated operating earnings of $208.2 million, including $4.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.3%. And the operating margin of 23% improved 180 basis points from 21.2% a year ago.
Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.2% compared to 31.6% last year. For the full year, we now anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be slightly below our full year 2015 rate of 31.7%.
Finally, net earnings of $131.7 million or $2.22 per diluted share increased $14.9 million or $0.24 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 12.1% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $289.3 million in the third quarter increased modestly over 2015 levels. Excluding $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 1.5%, primarily due to a mid-single-digit increase in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a low-single-digit increase in both the segment's power tools and Asia-Pacific operations.
Organic sales to customers in critical industries were essentially flat as the decline in the aerospace market segment was largely offset by a gain in sales to the military and increases in both the technical education and natural resources market segments. Despite the continued presence of certain headwinds in the industrial space, we were encouraged that sales performance has improved from what we had seen earlier in the year.
Gross profit in the C&I Group of $112.7 million compared to $109.5 million last year. The gross margin of 39% improved 110 basis points primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives and 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses of $69 million in the quarter compared to $68.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 23.9% increased 30 basis points, primarily as a result of higher cost, including cost associated with continued expansion initiatives in Asia and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $43.7 million, including $0.3 million of favorable foreign currency effects, increased $2.4 million from 2015 levels and the operating margin of 15.1% improved 80 basis points from 14.3% last year, representing a recent high for C&I and up 130 basis points sequentially.
Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $397.2 million increased 4.4%. Excluding $4.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $21.2 million or 5.6%, reflecting mid-single-digit gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations.
Gross profit of $173.3 million compared to $166.5 million last year. Gross margin of 43.6% declined 20 basis points as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were more than offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses of $108.7 million in the quarter compared to $110.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 27.3% improved 170 basis points primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $64.6 million, including $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $8.3 million; and the operating margin of 16.3% improved 150 basis points from 14.8% last year.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Third quarter sales of $286.1 million increased 1.1% from 2015 levels. Excluding $2.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $1.1 million of acquisition-related sales, organic sales increased 1.7%. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.
In the quarter, sales of both undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships were essentially flat. As Nick mentioned, sales to OEM dealerships this quarter were particularly impacted by the timing of essential tool and facilitation program sales. For example, sales in Q3 of last year benefited from a refrigeration-related facility action program, which has since lapsed.
Gross profit of $133.1 million compared to $130.9 million last year; and the gross margin of 46.5% improved 20 basis points primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses of $61.3 million in the quarter compared to $61.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 21.4% improved 30 basis points, principally due to savings from RCI initiatives.
Third quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $71.8 million, including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $2.1 million from prior year levels; and the operating margin of 25.1% improved 50 basis points from 24.6% last year.
As we announced earlier this week and as Nick mentioned in his remarks, we have entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Car-O-Liner. Car-O-Liner's annual sales are approximately $95 million and we expect them to generate operating income margins somewhat similar to those of RS&I's undercar equipment business, which are typically in the low teens.
We expect to complete the acquisition of Car-O-Liner within the next month. Our plan is to fund the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and approximately $125 million in issuances of commercial paper.
Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $50.6 million on revenue of $71.6 million compared to operating earnings of $43.5 million on revenue of $61.1 million last year. Financial services expenses in the quarter included some additional headcount-related expenses to help better serve our growing portfolio. But as a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.2% in both periods. The average yield on finance receivables of 18% in the quarter compared to 17.9% last year and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.4% compared to 9.5% last year. Originations of $269.8 million in the quarter increased 4.7% from prior year levels.
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.8 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.6 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 81% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In the first 9 months of 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $190.3 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $111.9 million in the quarter decreased $1.8 million from comparable 2015 levels, as higher net earnings were more than offset by $11.4 million of higher cash tax payments and $5.4 million of higher U.S. pension contributions. 
Net cash used by investing activities of $69.2 million included $56 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables and $16.5 million of capital expenditures.
Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $26.6 million from 2015 year-end levels, reflecting both higher sales and an increase in days sales outstanding from 60 days at year-end to 63 days at third quarter-end.
Inventories increased $25.8 million from 2015 year-end levels primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.3 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end.
Our quarter-end cash position of $117.5 million increased $24.7 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $501.7 million of cash collections from finance receivables and $415.6 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $691.4 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $106.3 million, the repurchase of 492,000 shares for $76.4 million and $56.6 million for capital expenditures.
Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 22.6% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end.
In addition to our $117 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of third quarter-end, we had $8 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. And I'll now turn the call back over to Nick."

Looking back and looking at the Snap-on third quarter, we believe a number of things are apparent. Our part of the auto repair market is solid. As we've seen in the past, it follows a different trajectory than new car sales. It was reliable even in the withering recession of 2009 and it's strong today. And we believe our ability to take advantage of that opportunity grows every quarter. And you can see it in the results.
Tools Group, sales up 5.6% organically. The franchisees, more prosperous and stronger. The group's OI margin, up 150 basis points, again 60 basis points of unfavorable currency.
The credit company continuing to serve as the Tools Group's strategic partner, enabling franchisees and technicians, as it has done for 5 decades, through recession after recession without disruption.
RS&I, selling to repair shop owners and managers, mixed growth. In countering the usual ups and downs of OEM-sponsored programs, but showing real progress with individual shops, both independents and dealers.
And C&I, amidst turbulence, but now growing again, showing year-over-year and sequential gains despite the difficult macros. And despite the difficult macros, registering an operating margin of 15.1%, up 80 basis points, showing what we believe is confirmation of the great value it offers as a runway for coherent growth.
And finally in the results, you can see the effects of Snap-on Value Creation, more new product driving gains and the engine of Rapid Continuous Improvement authoring efficiency. It all came together for organic sales growth of 2.6% and an opco operating margin of 18.9%, up 140 basis points; and an EPS of $2.22, an increase of 12.1%, a double-digit gain again.
And the Car-O-Liner acquisition, giving us more to sell, more opportunities for coherent growth and providing more possibilities for Snap-on Value Creation to drive progress. It's a great opportunity.
It was an encouraging quarter. And we believe it clearly confirms the future of continuous Snap-on growth and improvement as we move through the end of this year and into 2017 and beyond.
Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening or will listen to this call. Once again, you should know that the encouraging performance of our corporation is only possible because of your capability, your energy and your dedication.

First of all, big ticket, the idea of Snap-on tools, Snap-on-tool tool storage and diagnostics was -- were strong in the quarter, in fact, stronger than -- so much stronger than the overall Snap-on tools growth. And inciden",459,"Sure. Look, a couple of things. First of all, big ticket, the idea of Snap-on tools, Snap-on-tool tool storage and diagnostics was -- were strong in the quarter, in fact, stronger than -- so much stronger than the overall Snap-on tools growth. And incidentally, this is an aside, hand tools were also pretty strong in the quarter. So it was still a good quarter for big ticket items, which are the principal driver for these things.
Secondly -- and the reason that is the case, reason why big ticket has been the case is because we've been investing in product, great new tool storage products and a number of huge features and a number of great attractive products that get customers excited. The fact that diagnostics are more important in the repair shop than ever before and technicians are trying to, I guess, caliber up to have better and bigger diagnostics to take care of those products, it's natural that big ticket items would be stronger, so you would see that. So I think that looking at the Tools Group and seeing that lead the way is just a consequence of our investment in the marketplace, we think, and it's the kinds of products we've had and the demand in the market associated -- the shift in the market associated with more diagnostics, and also our investment in enabling events that break through this original structural barriers of demand that is the space and time. The Rock 'N Roll Cab, which we've talked about quite a bit, which helped tool storage, and the TechKnow vans -- we have 67 of them now, and the TechKnow vans, we have 49 of them, and that drives fairly robust bigger-ticket item sales.
In terms of higher double digits before -- double-digit originations before and the somewhat less originations now, you can't trace quarter-to-quarter because there isn't a perfect one-for-one correlation. Remember that when you're looking at originations, you're looking at franchisee sales. When you're looking at the Tools Group, you're looking at our sales. So we sell to the franchisees, so the timing is different. Then, you have on top on that the franchisees' margin. And then you have on top of that the idea that a tool storage sale or a diagnostics sale may ignite a couple of trade-in type sales, which would also be somewhat supported by EC, by the credit company.
So you put those all together and that shows the landscape. But when we step back and we look at the, say, 2015 numbers, when we look at the 2015 numbers about originations and the Tools Group big-ticket sales, they seem pretty much the same. And this year, we're starting to see, year-to-date, the same kind of thing."

This quarter, you actually maintained a strong rate of growth, organic growth stable quarter-over-quarter, originations came down.

Of course, it has grown because the market has -- the customers have turned that way and we have invested into support that with new product. And also part of the way we figured out how to enable the van has been associated with that segment, but it's a natural thing. I've been talking about the Rock 'N Roll Cabs for multiple quarters, and that would, naturally, of course, drive a little bit more credit company activity. Okay?"

It doesn't translate one to one. But what it says is our guys saw the new product, they were confident in the future, they invested in it, they ordered, so they think good things are coming."

So, for example, not in this particular quarter, because we wouldn't make product adjustments for a quarter, we see opportunities, we build out -- our goal is to build up in each of the markets. For example, last year, we brought out 920 new products just for aviation; 313 for oil and gas, even though it was having probably one of the most difficult times; 313 for the military, even though it was difficult times. So we just keep adding, not so much targeting.
Now we saw some great opportunities, as you saw, in heavy duty, the substitute for the pipe wrench, that's a great new product. And so we see things like that all the time. We see enhancements to our visual control system, our tool control system, which we've seen now. Amazingly, we've seen the tool control systems more and go bleed into oil and gas. We had a major sale in Canada associated with oil and gas as opposed to when we had been using it just for aviation. We can see it rolling into railroads, so with small enhancements, that's the kind of thing we're doing."

I think, though, if you look at our overall numbers, if you look at the OI margin growth for the corporation and you take a look at the year-over-year opco margin and you go back and see it, you'll see that it's been triple digits an awful lot of times awfully far back in big sales growth and small sales growth.

Now, when -- in the situation of the Tools Group, it does give you a little more advantage, a little opportunity to look at that.

That kind of number, gee, I think every quarter for a long time, I can't attest to exactly, but I think it's been -- most quarters, it's been bouncing around mid- to high-single digits. So I think that's doing pretty well.
I think the big thing about diagnostics is time -- I mean, or not diagnostics, but RS&I is time. As I tried to make clear in the quarter, we had this business in RS&I which produces -- which takes contracts, OEM-commissioned contracts, to distribute -- well, you could talk essential tools or facilitate a project. So for example, you might have somebody that, Aldo referred to this, to do some air-conditioning, provide an air-conditioning reclaim system for all its dealers. One of the manufacturers will say, ""I want you to provide an air-conditioning system. I want you to get it to my dealers, I want it to be 2 per dealer, and I want it to be rolled out in the next 4 quarters or 3 quarters."" We roll it out. That's a pretty big piece of sales business. You might have another one that does an essential tool for a particular new product or a new technology that rolls out on a new truck, and that rolls through in a quarter. But what happens is these are driven by the view of the OEMs and the technology and the differences that are rolling through their new models, so they tend to be quite lumpy. And what happened in this quarter for that particular type of business, this was kind of a stall quarter in that business, and that created the overhang in -- one of the overhangs in RS&I. So now [indiscernible] the stuff we sell to individual dealers was pretty good."

Look, Brexit, of course, as I referenced, is a challenge for us as far as the turbulence in Europe. But in fact, if you look at the 3 pieces of our businesses in Europe, if you look at the Tools Group, up strong in the U.K. You look at RS&I, up nicel",349,"Yes. Look, Brexit, of course, as I referenced, is a challenge for us as far as the turbulence in Europe. But in fact, if you look at the 3 pieces of our businesses in Europe, if you look at the Tools Group, up strong in the U.K. You look at RS&I, up nicely. But you look at SNA Europe, and SNA Europe was up in the quarter again. I think it was the 12th straight quarter of growth, that was down slightly. So Brexit might have hurt them a little bit. Really, but generally, overall volume, it was a great market for Snap-on. U.K. was one of our better markets.
The problem is in the currency. So it becomes a big dinger in terms of -- it becomes a big effect in terms of sales, translation effect on our sales, because we have pretty good sales in pounds. And secondly, remember, we're selling into the British market, selling in pounds, but we're making in dollars. We're making in the United States. So we have a transactional impact. So if you step back and you look at our currency in the -- overall for the corporation, that $2.22, it had $0.05 of currency impact and a lot of that was the U.K., a lot of it was U.K. Of course there were some other factors in there.
And then, looking forward, when you start to look at -- the U.K. started, it kind of went down in the quarter. So we think it's kind of like from a sales perspective looking forward, we probably don't see as much pressure from translation, but the profitability will be about the same, maybe a little bit more impacted going forward, because of the pound.
Now going out beyond where we are now, that's based on where we sit today in terms of the pound. If the pound gets weaker, it will impact us more. But that's the major factor. We think our product and our improved capabilities overwhelm the sales factor, the selling factor. It's just that the currency tends to impact us."

Just the final question remaining for me was, I noticed that on a percentage basis, if you take a look at your inner segment number on the breakdown for revenue with the segment, it's gotten a little bit larger compared to history. It's running now above a 14% kind of number as a percentage of the total -- of the segment revenues and on an absolute basis now up to $139 million. Just curious what's driving that?

In the third quarter, we again showed progress along our runways for growth and for improvement. And we saw those gains across all our operating segments. Total reported sales were $834.1 million, up 1.5%, and that included $9.7 million of unfavorable currency. It also included the incremental $1.1 million of sales from last year's acquisition of Ecotechnics. Organic sales were up 2.6%. And the opco operating margin, it was up 140 basis points, reaching 18.9%. When you add in the $50.6 million of operating earnings from financial services, and that was up from $43.5 million in 2015, the consolidated operating margin was 23%, an increase of 180 basis points. Our EPS was $2.22, up $0.24, a double-digit increase, rising 12.1% from last year.
Let's consider the environment. Look at that environment. Automotive repair continues to be favorable, and we believe our Tools Group and our Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I, Group, they're both well-positioned to take full advantage of the opportunity.
The Tools Group clearly demonstrated enhancements to the franchise network, gains in both the North American and European markets, continuing to make the most of the opportunities so abundant in an aging and changing vehicle fleet.
At RS&I, serving repair shop owners and managers, sales progress was mixed. The volume of diagnostics and repair information products with independent shops was up mid-single-digits. For the OEM side, activity with individual dealers was up, while programs commissioned by the OEM manufacturers, a historically lumpy space, was down. Undercar equipment was flat, with variations from product line to product line.
For Commercial & Industrial, or C&I, the group was up organically, 1.5%. Snap-on Europe, SNA Europe was higher again, making progress against the turbulence of Brexit and the other uncertainties across this market. The Industrial business was flat, reflecting the challenges we've seen now for a year. Significantly, however, the critical industry activity recorded its second straight quarter of sequential growth following more than a year of decreases, reductions driven by the difficult macro environment in areas like oil and gas, military and the Middle East.
Now there will always be headwinds across our operations. They were a factor in other quarters and they were present in the third quarter, but we did overcome, we did keep growing, because we're well-positioned to confront the challenges and continue to proceed down our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding the repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industry and building an emerging market. These do represent our growth strategies, and we continue to make progress along those quarters.
At the same time, those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, Rapid Continuous Improvement or, as we call it, RCI. Together, these are the processes, the tools we use each and every day to drive improvement. And improvement is written all over our results, especially customer connection, understanding the work of the professional technician; and innovation, matching that insight with technology to make work, work easier.
Snap-on Value Creation once again led to more prestigious awards. We were recently honored with 2 MOTOR Magazine Top 20 and with 5 Professional Tool and Equipment News, or PTEN, Innovation Awards, which -- those winners represent only a fraction of a wide array of new products borne out of the insight of our franchisees and our direct sales people, translating workplace observations into productivity solutions. And in the quarter, those customer connections were a big factor in our results.
To see some of that, let's move to the individual groups. Commercial & Industrial, organic sales up, with an operating margin reaching 15.1%, an increase of 80 basis points from last year's 14.3%, the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation evident in the ongoing stream of innovative new products developed for the critical industries.
One of those products launched in the third quarter by our Industrial division is the PWZ5 pliers wrench. This wrench is the latest and the largest model in the popular Snap-on PWZ series. It's long, 41 3/4 inches. It can handle jobs that would traditionally require a pipe wrench with much less slippage for better overall performance and for better safety. It features inwardly angled teeth, fine at the back, large at the front for a stronger and more secure grip on objects of all sizes. And the narrow jaw design gives improved accessibility in tight compartments and those cramped corners. It's perfect for applications in tie rods and other areas that are hard to reach in industries like railroad, oil and gas for servicing fleets, actually, any heavy-duty application. You heard me speak about -- in the past, about our growing Industrial product line. Well, this wrench is another great addition to our hand tool lineup for critical industries.
Now SNA Europe, 12 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth, navigating some difficult geographies and some tepid economies. SNA Europe sales activity continues to be positive. But its profits are even more encouraging, now up for 14 straight quarters, and we believe there's still more opportunity.
In the Asia-Pacific operations, mixed environment across the region. We continue to invest in building our physicals, and the Asia operation had gains contributing to the progress in the quarter. So that's C&I.
Now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales up 5.6%. Significant growth both in the U.S. and international -- internationally. Operating income of $64.6 million compared to $56.3 million in 2015. The operating income margin of 16.3% rose 150 basis points from last year's 14.8%. Volume gains as well as operating improvements from RCI translated into a significant margin rise. And that 150 basis point gain, it overcame 60 basis points of negative currency.
When you consider the Tools Group success, you can see the power of Snap-on Value Creation, of customer connection and innovation. The MOTOR Top 20 and the PTEN Award represent just a few examples of the recognition our products continue to receive. Awards from industry publications, but also awards from the professionals that use our tools every day.
Innovation. It's consistently been a key contributor to our Tools Group. And in the third quarter, more new products like our Reversible Ratcheting Combination Wrench, the latest in the lineup of Snap-on wrenches, adding a reversible feature to our patented ratcheting mechanism, utilizing our Dual 80 technology, combining dual pulls with thin walls, box and design, smooth operation, more torque transfer in tight spaces and, of course, it incorporates the iconic Snap-on Flank Drive profile, biting into fasteners without rounding corners, preventing slippage. The new Reversible Ratcheting Combo Wrench, it's more turning power, enhanced durability, compact design and built stronger to last longer. This is the core of Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation solving specific problems in the shop.
Take the new 20 millimeter 12-Point Impact Socket, borne from hours of observation in the workplace, hours of observation in the workplace. This socket is designed to remove head bolts in large industrial engines, long enough to reach the deepest of inset bolts and strong enough to remove the toughest fasteners, a unique combination. It's produced in our Elkmont, Alabama plant and it's essential for servicing large off-road equipment. It may not be needed often, but when it is, it's critical, and Snap-on has it. It's just another example of our commitment to make work easier, solving our technicians' most challenging problems.
The third quarter is also when we hold the annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, or SFC. This year, it was in Orlando, with more than 8,700 attendees, franchisees and family members from over 3,000 routes, 3 days of showcasing the opportunities to enhance the franchise channel. And I can report to you, because I was there, that based on the optimism and the confidence of our franchisees, it was a big success. And orders, because we take orders at these events, and orders, well, they were up once again, beating the record levels of 2015.
And when we speak of van channel, we also have to consider the strategic combination of Snap-on Credit. Our financial services arm helps create opportunities across the organization, but especially within the Tools Group. It's been an ongoing partnership for over 50 years. And our credit company had a strong presence at this year's SFC, supporting franchisees with unique programs. 270,000 of our approximately 875,000, about 30% of our technician customers in the United States have credit company contracts, enabling those big-ticket items. The credit company has been a key part of franchisee success and the third quarter was no exception to that.
Now let's move to RS&I. Organic sales were up 1.7%. The operating margin, up 25.1%. It increased 50 basis points from the 24.6% registered last year. As I mentioned, RS&I clearly showed progress in providing repair information and diagnostics to independent shop owners and managers.
And certainly, a portion of that growth came from innovative new products, several launched at the SFC, products like the MODIS Edge, our latest diagnostic offering, an enhanced industrial design, improved ergonomics, reduced weight and coat scan capability that allows the tech to scan all of a vehicle's computer systems with the push of a single button. It also contains fast access to oil change and reset information, automatic vehicle identification and our unique SureTrack Expert database, all features specifically designed to save the technician significant time. This new handheld is lighter, faster and smarter. And simply based on the excited crowd of franchisees at the SFC that carved out precious time to attend MODIS Edge hands-on training, we expect it to be a very popular item.
Another exciting SFC launch was our Diagnostic Thermal Imager. This completely new Snap-on offering is a breakthrough in pinpointing problems, with a graphical display illustrating surface data, temperature data and a reference library of nominal and out-of-spec thermal images for a variety of auto parts found in brakes, emission systems and in vehicle electrical equipment. We believe we have a winner with the Diagnostic Thermal Imager and orders at the SFC prove it. It sold out.
And RS&I innovation wasn't just in diagnostics products. Take the brand-new Polartek air-conditioning unit from our recent acquisition, Ecotechnics. Developed and manufactured specifically for the North American market, meeting a very aggressive launch, both our U.S. and our Canadian customers have affirmed the strength of the unit's design and performance. It's been a real testament to the capability of the Ecotechnics team.
And speaking of products, of getting more to sell to the repair shop owners and managers, this week, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Car-O-Liner based in Gothenburg, Sweden, but reaching around the globe. Car-O-Liner's product offering and its special expertise are important additions to the Snap-on team, providing extraordinary capabilities in collision repair, a segment where change is now authoring opportunity. It's an operation that strengthens our position, both in auto and in heavy duty. Car-O-Liner is another coherent business and we believe that, matched with the Snap-on team, it offers substantial possibilities for both growth and for improvement. All of that, a great opportunity going forward.
So that's the highlights of our quarter. Organic sales up 2.6%; gains across all groups; progress along our runways for growth; Snap-on Value Creation, turning our customer connection insights into innovative new products; and along with our ongoing RCI initiatives, driving margin improvement. And it all shows in the results. Opco OI margin rising to 18.9%, up 140 basis points; EPS of $2.22, up 12.1%. It was an encouraging quarter.

Excluding $9.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $1.1 million of acquisition-related sales, organic sales increased 2.6%, reflecting continued progress in serving the vehicle repair sector as well as improvements in sales in our Commercial & Industrial segment.
Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 70 basis points from 2015 levels, primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives.
Operating expenses of $261.5 million yielded an operating expense margin of 31.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 70 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and lower pension expense.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $157.6 million, including $4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 9.7% and, as a percentage of sales, improved 140 basis points to 18.9%.
Financial services revenue of $71.6 million in the quarter increased 17.2% from 2015 levels and operating earnings of $50.6 million increased 16.3%.
Consolidated operating earnings of $208.2 million, including $4.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.3%. And the operating margin of 23% improved 180 basis points from 21.2% a year ago.
Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.2% compared to 31.6% last year. For the full year, we now anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be slightly below our full year 2015 rate of 31.7%.
Finally, net earnings of $131.7 million or $2.22 per diluted share increased $14.9 million or $0.24 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 12.1% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $289.3 million in the third quarter increased modestly over 2015 levels. Excluding $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 1.5%, primarily due to a mid-single-digit increase in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a low-single-digit increase in both the segment's power tools and Asia-Pacific operations.
Organic sales to customers in critical industries were essentially flat as the decline in the aerospace market segment was largely offset by a gain in sales to the military and increases in both the technical education and natural resources market segments. Despite the continued presence of certain headwinds in the industrial space, we were encouraged that sales performance has improved from what we had seen earlier in the year.
Gross profit in the C&I Group of $112.7 million compared to $109.5 million last year. The gross margin of 39% improved 110 basis points primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives and 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses of $69 million in the quarter compared to $68.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 23.9% increased 30 basis points, primarily as a result of higher cost, including cost associated with continued expansion initiatives in Asia and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $43.7 million, including $0.3 million of favorable foreign currency effects, increased $2.4 million from 2015 levels and the operating margin of 15.1% improved 80 basis points from 14.3% last year, representing a recent high for C&I and up 130 basis points sequentially.
Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $397.2 million increased 4.4%. Excluding $4.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $21.2 million or 5.6%, reflecting mid-single-digit gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations.
Gross profit of $173.3 million compared to $166.5 million last year. Gross margin of 43.6% declined 20 basis points as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were more than offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses of $108.7 million in the quarter compared to $110.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 27.3% improved 170 basis points primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $64.6 million, including $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $8.3 million; and the operating margin of 16.3% improved 150 basis points from 14.8% last year.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Third quarter sales of $286.1 million increased 1.1% from 2015 levels. Excluding $2.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $1.1 million of acquisition-related sales, organic sales increased 1.7%. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.
In the quarter, sales of both undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships were essentially flat. As Nick mentioned, sales to OEM dealerships this quarter were particularly impacted by the timing of essential tool and facilitation program sales. For example, sales in Q3 of last year benefited from a refrigeration-related facility action program, which has since lapsed.
Gross profit of $133.1 million compared to $130.9 million last year; and the gross margin of 46.5% improved 20 basis points primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses of $61.3 million in the quarter compared to $61.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 21.4% improved 30 basis points, principally due to savings from RCI initiatives.
Third quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $71.8 million, including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $2.1 million from prior year levels; and the operating margin of 25.1% improved 50 basis points from 24.6% last year.
As we announced earlier this week and as Nick mentioned in his remarks, we have entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Car-O-Liner. Car-O-Liner's annual sales are approximately $95 million and we expect them to generate operating income margins somewhat similar to those of RS&I's undercar equipment business, which are typically in the low teens.
We expect to complete the acquisition of Car-O-Liner within the next month. Our plan is to fund the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and approximately $125 million in issuances of commercial paper.
Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $50.6 million on revenue of $71.6 million compared to operating earnings of $43.5 million on revenue of $61.1 million last year. Financial services expenses in the quarter included some additional headcount-related expenses to help better serve our growing portfolio. But as a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.2% in both periods. The average yield on finance receivables of 18% in the quarter compared to 17.9% last year and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.4% compared to 9.5% last year. Originations of $269.8 million in the quarter increased 4.7% from prior year levels.
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.8 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.6 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 81% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In the first 9 months of 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $190.3 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $111.9 million in the quarter decreased $1.8 million from comparable 2015 levels, as higher net earnings were more than offset by $11.4 million of higher cash tax payments and $5.4 million of higher U.S. pension contributions. 
Net cash used by investing activities of $69.2 million included $56 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables and $16.5 million of capital expenditures.
Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $26.6 million from 2015 year-end levels, reflecting both higher sales and an increase in days sales outstanding from 60 days at year-end to 63 days at third quarter-end.
Inventories increased $25.8 million from 2015 year-end levels primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.3 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end.
Our quarter-end cash position of $117.5 million increased $24.7 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $501.7 million of cash collections from finance receivables and $415.6 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $691.4 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $106.3 million, the repurchase of 492,000 shares for $76.4 million and $56.6 million for capital expenditures.
Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 22.6% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end.
In addition to our $117 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of third quarter-end, we had $8 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. And I'll now turn the call back over to Nick."

Looking back and looking at the Snap-on third quarter, we believe a number of things are apparent. Our part of the auto repair market is solid. As we've seen in the past, it follows a different trajectory than new car sales. It was reliable even in the withering recession of 2009 and it's strong today. And we believe our ability to take advantage of that opportunity grows every quarter. And you can see it in the results.
Tools Group, sales up 5.6% organically. The franchisees, more prosperous and stronger. The group's OI margin, up 150 basis points, again 60 basis points of unfavorable currency.
The credit company continuing to serve as the Tools Group's strategic partner, enabling franchisees and technicians, as it has done for 5 decades, through recession after recession without disruption.
RS&I, selling to repair shop owners and managers, mixed growth. In countering the usual ups and downs of OEM-sponsored programs, but showing real progress with individual shops, both independents and dealers.
And C&I, amidst turbulence, but now growing again, showing year-over-year and sequential gains despite the difficult macros. And despite the difficult macros, registering an operating margin of 15.1%, up 80 basis points, showing what we believe is confirmation of the great value it offers as a runway for coherent growth.
And finally in the results, you can see the effects of Snap-on Value Creation, more new product driving gains and the engine of Rapid Continuous Improvement authoring efficiency. It all came together for organic sales growth of 2.6% and an opco operating margin of 18.9%, up 140 basis points; and an EPS of $2.22, an increase of 12.1%, a double-digit gain again.
And the Car-O-Liner acquisition, giving us more to sell, more opportunities for coherent growth and providing more possibilities for Snap-on Value Creation to drive progress. It's a great opportunity.
It was an encouraging quarter. And we believe it clearly confirms the future of continuous Snap-on growth and improvement as we move through the end of this year and into 2017 and beyond.
Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening or will listen to this call.

First of all, big ticket, the idea of Snap-on tools, Snap-on-tool tool storage and diagnostics was -- were strong in the quarter, in fact, stronger than -- so much stronger than the overall Snap-on tools growth. And inciden",459,"Sure. Look, a couple of things. First of all, big ticket, the idea of Snap-on tools, Snap-on-tool tool storage and diagnostics was -- were strong in the quarter, in fact, stronger than -- so much stronger than the overall Snap-on tools growth. And incidentally, this is an aside, hand tools were also pretty strong in the quarter. So it was still a good quarter for big ticket items, which are the principal driver for these things. Secondly -- and the reason that is the case, reason why big ticket has been the case is because we've been investing in product, great new tool storage products and a number of huge features and a number of great attractive products that get customers excited. The fact that diagnostics are more important in the repair shop than ever before and technicians are trying to, I guess, caliber up to have better and bigger diagnostics to take care of those products, it's natural that big ticket items would be stronger, so you would see that. So I think that looking at the Tools Group and seeing that lead the way is just a consequence of our investment in the marketplace, we think, and it's the kinds of products we've had and the demand in the market associated -- the shift in the market associated with more diagnostics, and also our investment in enabling events that break through this original structural barriers of demand that is the space and time. The Rock 'N Roll Cab, which we've talked about quite a bit, which helped tool storage, and the TechKnow vans -- we have 67 of them now, and the TechKnow vans, we have 49 of them, and that drives fairly robust bigger-ticket item sales. In terms of higher double digits before -- double-digit originations before and the somewhat less originations now, you can't trace quarter-to-quarter because there isn't a perfect one-for-one correlation. Remember that when you're looking at originations, you're looking at franchisee sales. When you're looking at the Tools Group, you're looking at our sales. So we sell to the franchisees, so the timing is different. Then, you have on top on that the franchisees' margin. And then you have on top of that the idea that a tool storage sale or a diagnostics sale may ignite a couple of trade-in type sales, which would also be somewhat supported by EC, by the credit company. So you put those all together and that shows the landscape. But when we step back and we look at the, say, 2015 numbers, when we look at the 2015 numbers about originations and the Tools Group big-ticket sales, they seem pretty much the same. And this year, we're starting to see, year-to-date, the same kind of thing."

This quarter, you actually maintained a strong rate of growth, organic growth stable quarter-over-quarter, originations came down. That either to me seems like the hand tool category maybe strengthened quarter-over-quarter or this whole relationship of painting Tools Group as a byproduct of the credit business maybe isn't the most accurate relationship."

So if you think that the Tools Group growth is being driven exclusively by the credit company mojo, I think, think again because it just isn't that wide. Of course, it has grown because the market has -- the customers have turned that way and we have invested into support that with new product. And also part of the way we figured out how to enable the van has been associated with that segment, but it's a natural thing. I've been talking about the Rock 'N Roll Cabs for multiple quarters, and that would, naturally, of course, drive a little bit more credit company activity. Okay?"

So for example, not in this particular quarter, because we wouldn't make product adjustments for a quarter, we see opportunities, we build out -- our goal is to build up in each of the markets. For example, last year, we brought out 920 new products just for aviation; 313 for oil and gas, even though it was having probably one of the most difficult times; 313 for the military, even though it was difficult times. So we just keep adding, not so much targeting. Now we saw some great opportunities, as you saw, in heavy duty, the substitute for the pipe wrench, that's a great new product. And so we see things like that all the time. We see enhancements to our visual control system, our tool control system, which we've seen now. Amazingly, we've seen the tool control systems more and go bleed into oil and gas. We had a major sale in Canada associated with oil and gas as opposed to when we had been using it just for aviation.

That kind of number, gee, I think every quarter for a long time, I can't attest to exactly, but I think it's been -- most quarters, it's been bouncing around mid- to high-single digits. So I think that's doing pretty well. I think the big thing about diagnostics is time -- I mean, or not diagnostics, but RS&I is time. As I tried to make clear in the quarter, we had this business in RS&I which produces -- which takes contracts, OEM-commissioned contracts, to distribute -- well, you could talk essential tools or facilitate a project. So for example, you might have somebody that, Aldo referred to this, to do some air-conditioning, provide an air-conditioning reclaim system for all its dealers. One of the manufacturers will say, ""I want you to provide an air-conditioning system. I want you to get it to my dealers, I want it to be 2 per dealer, and I want it to be rolled out in the next 4 quarters or 3 quarters."" We roll it out. That's a pretty big piece of sales business. You might have another one that does an essential tool for a particular new product or a new technology that rolls out on a new truck, and that rolls through in a quarter. But what happens is these are driven by the view of the OEMs and the technology and the differences that are rolling through their new models, so they tend to be quite lumpy. And what happened in this quarter for that particular type of business, this was kind of a stall quarter in that business, and that created the overhang in -- one of the overhangs in RS&I. So now [indiscernible] the stuff we sell to individual dealers was pretty good."

From hand tools -- hand tools were up in the quarter. Tool storage is up in the quarter. Diagnostics is up in the quarter. You talked about that product line because our -- I think about customer -- innovation is better than ever before. We have more hit products than we ever had. Secondly, our franchisees are stronger. They are stronger. And despite the fact they're stronger, they seem to be hungrier for more product. And thirdly, we've invested in things in the vans, like the Rock 'N Roll Cabs, the assist -- our -- for the TechKnow vans. And our franchisees are so confident they're taking on assistants, so that model itself is getting better. Said another way, it's a great market. Auto repair is a great market.

And our research and engineering can augment those 50 or 45 engineers at Car-O-Liner to make them better. Thirdly, we think that repair is starting to become more important in collision shops because there's intelligence that's distributed around the car. You get a dent, you've got to repair things.

But in fact, if you look at the 3 pieces of our businesses in Europe, if you look at the Tools Group, up strong in the U.K. You look at RS&I, up nicely. But you look at SNA Europe, and SNA Europe was up in the quarter again. I think it was the 12th straight quarter of growth, that was down slightly. So Brexit might have hurt them a little bit. Really, but generally, overall volume, it was a great market for Snap-on. U.K. was one of our better markets.
The problem is in the currency. So it becomes a big dinger in terms of -- it becomes a big effect in terms of sales, translation effect on our sales, because we have pretty good sales in pounds. And secondly, remember, we're selling into the British market, selling in pounds, but we're making in dollars. We're making in the United States. So we have a transactional impact. So if you step back and you look at our currency in the -- overall for the corporation, that $2.22, it had $0.05 of currency impact and a lot of that was the U.K., a lot of it was U.K. Of course there were some other factors in there. And then, looking forward, when you start to look at -- the U.K. started, it kind of went down in the quarter. So we think it's kind of like from a sales perspective looking forward, we probably don't see as much pressure from translation, but the profitability will be about the same, maybe a little bit more impacted going forward, because of the pound. Now going out beyond where we are now, that's based on where we sit today in terms of the pound. If the pound gets weaker, it will impact us more. But that's the major factor. We think our product and our improved capabilities overwhelm the sales factor, the selling factor. It's just that the currency tends to impact us."

So you can multiply that by 3 and you get the year-to-date amount. Then the noise is created by how the stock price moved, not just this year, but remember you have to look at the movement relative to last year. So this particular quarter, there's really no change in-mark to-market. It's very benign. So most of the change in corporate expenses this quarter is related solely to pension expense."

Good to see the continued improvement in the profitability across the group still and still seeing that nice growth in the financial services area. And appreciated that a little bit of color earlier on the differentiation between what's going on in hand tools and the growth in financial services. Just the final question remaining for me was, I noticed that on a percentage basis, if you take a look at your inner segment number on the breakdown for revenue with the segment, it's gotten a little bit larger compared to history. It's running now above a 14% kind of number as a percentage of the total -- of the segment revenues and on an absolute basis now up to $139 million. Just curious what's driving that? And should we be expecting that percentage to be a higher amount of the total going forward?"

You see, if you think about it, the Tools Group is -- it's got its own factories, but it's got that great distribution. So inside C&I, there are factories like the power tools factory and so on like other places that sell -- they sell externally, but they also sell to the Tools Group. SNA Europe does that. RS&I has some divisions that do that. We have torque wrenches in C&I that do that out in California, so sell in both places. So as the Tools Group grows, you will see intercompany sales grow. It's the natural outcome of that."
