330706,325482380,948066,"Urban Outfitters Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 07, 2016",2016-03-07,"Earnings Calls","Urban Outfitters, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start my prepared commentary discussing our recently completed fiscal year 2016 fourth quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share some of our thoughts concerning the fiscal",1384,"Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start my prepared commentary discussing our recently completed fiscal year 2016 fourth quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share some of our thoughts concerning the fiscal year 2017 first quarter and full year.
Total company or URBN sales for the fourth quarter increased to $1 billion. This sales increased included a minus 2% Retail segment comp, a $1.5 million increase in noncomp sales including the opening of 6 net new stores, and a 29% jump in Wholesale segment sales. Additionally, please note that our sales growth during the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 160 basis points of foreign currency translation.
Within our Retail segment comps, the direct-to-consumer channel continue to outperform stores, posting a double-digit sales increase driven by increases in sessions and conversion rates, which more than offset a slight decrease in average order value. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transaction and average unit selling price, while units per transaction was flat. The negative transaction could have been affected by traffic, which was down at each of our brands' comp stores during the quarter.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 2% at Free People while decreasing by 3% in Urban Outfitters and 2% at the Anthropologie Group. Our URBN Retail segment comp was negative in all months during the quarter, with each month coming in fairly consistent to the minus 2% for the quarter.
Wholesale segment sales delivered another strong quarter as sales rose 29% to $75 million. These results came from double-digit growth in specialty and department store doors domestically and internationally. Please keep in mind that the fourth quarter did benefit from approximately $9 million in carryover orders that were delayed in shipping at the end of the third quarter. We are now completely up-to-date and do not anticipate any further fulfillment center delays.
Total URBN gross profit for the quarter is flat to the prior comparable quarter at $349 million. Gross profit rate declined by 12 basis points to 34.5%. The decline in gross profit rate was driven by almost 100 basis points of deleverage in delivery and fulfillment center expense. Please note that approximately 25 basis points of this deleverage is due to to the fulfillment center transition and should begin to be recaptured in future quarters. The remainder of the delivering and fulfillment center deleverage primarily relates to the increase in sales penetration of the direct-to-consumer channel, which increased in Retail segment penetration by nearly 400 basis points in the quarter.
Store occupancy also deleveraged in the quarter by just under 100 basis points, primarily due to store impairment charges, which I will discuss in a few minutes, and partially due to the negative store comps at all 3 brands.  Almost fully offsetting these decreases was close to 200 basis points of improvement in markdown rate, driven by significant improvements at the Urban Outfitters brand. Both Free People and Anthropologie experienced higher markdown rates during the quarter as they worked through some slow-moving apparel products.
As mentioned earlier, we incurred store impairment charges of $9 million in the quarter, with $7 million of this charge negatively affecting gross profit rate by approximately 70 basis points, which is included in the 100 basis points already noted above, and the remaining $2 million negatively affecting SG&A rate by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter. These store impairments relates to 3 stores in Europe, 1 in Canada and 1 in the United States. 4 were Urban Outfitters stores and the 1 Canadian store belongs to Anthropologie.
Certainly, a lot of moving pieces in gross profit margin for the quarter. What we are most proud of is our improvement is maintained margin, largely driven by overall lower markdown rate. Had it not been for the impairment charges, we would have delivered in an overall improvement in gross profit margin of over 50 basis points for the quarter as well as an improvement in overall profit dollars and rate.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 3% to $233 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 65 basis points to 23%. This SG&A deleverage was primarily due to an increase in marketing expense to support our customer acquisition and retention efforts and an increase in technology-related expenses used to support our omnichannel initiatives.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 6% to $116 million, with operating profit margin deleveraging by 77 basis points to 11.5%. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our operating profit rate by approximately 50 basis points in the quarter. And as earlier mentioned, store impairments negatively affected operating profit rate by approximately 90 basis points in the quarter.
Net income for the quarter was $73 million or $0.61 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory decreased by 8% to $330 million. The reduction in inventory is due to a 6% reduction in Retail segment comp inventory at cost. The decrease in Retail segment comp inventory is due to improved inventory planning and control as the business continues to work towards managing to a lower supply. The reduction in inventory is not necessarily predictive of future sales growth as we are currently doing a nice job of getting faster turns out of our inventory, as shown over the previous quarters.
We ended the quarter with $363 million in cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, the company repurchased and retired 4.3 million common shares for approximately $100 million. We repurchased and retired a total of 15 million common shares in fiscal year 2016 for approximately $465 million. We have 7.3 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors share repurchase authorization.
As we enter the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 26 net new stores for the year, excluding our food and beverage division. For the first quarter, we are planning 3 new Free People stores in North America and will close 1 Urban Outfitters store. For the year, we are planning on opening 4 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe, 10 net new Anthropologie stores including 2 in Europe and 12 net new Free People stores. We are excited that we are opening approximately 4 expanded format Anthropologie stores this year, primarily through expansions and relocations of existing stores. These extended formats does give us a great opportunity to please the customer more with a broader assortment in categories like home, beauty and intimates as well as the Bhldn wedding brands and the Terrain outdoor living brands. We are also planning on opening 2 to 3 pizzerias, which will be stand-alone locations.
URBN gross margin rate for the quarter could improve slightly versus the prior year. The improvement could come from improved margin, driven primarily by the Urban Outfitters brand, which could be partially offset by a maintained margin decline at Free People brand and store occupancy deleverage for all of URBN if negative store comps continue. 
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a high single-digit rate for the first quarter. This increase will be driven by direct-to-consumer channel investments related to marketing and technology as well as store-related expenses to support our square footage growth, which is planned at approximately 5% for fiscal 2017. For the year, we believe SG&A could grow at a mid-single-digit rate.
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 came in at $135 million, which is approximately $10 million under our original plan. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $160 million, with approximately $10 million moving from fiscal 2016 into fiscal 2017.  Total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new and relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Finally, our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 37% and could be fairly consistent each quarter. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast, but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligations to update forward-looking statements.
Now it's my pleasure to pass the call over to Dick Hayne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of all of URBN."

Today, I'll speak to our fourth quarter results, talk about the macro business environment and then finish with how we plan to navigate in this climate.  In general, the holiday quarter performed pretty much as expected and as we discussed on this call last December. 
Let me begin with the Urban Outfitters brand. Results of Urban North America during the quarter benefited from steady execution of the basic merchandising strategy implemented at the beginning of the year, namely upgrade the fashion and the quality of products offering, grow initial margins and control inventory tightly by decreasing weeks of supply so there would be fewer markdowns. This strategy worked in the Urban brands on regular priced sales and margin improvement throughout the quarter and the year.  In Q4, total comparable sales came in below where we would have liked, but the negative comps were caused solely by fewer markdowns sales. Regular priced comp sales grew nicely in the quarter, and when combined with higher IMU, resulted in the Urban brand achieving many hundreds of basis points improvement in merchandise margins. The strongest regular priced comps came from the women's apparel, intimates and home category.
Not only were regularly priced comparable sales were up in the quarter, but Trish and her team were able to drive those sales with less inventory. Total comp ending inventory decreased by 12% in the quarter. 
Looking ahead, comparisons look favorable for the brand. Excessive markdowns began to subside last year and as Q1 progressed. So as the brand begins to anniversary fewer promotions, I believe Urban comps could benefit from the regular priced sales momentum that began in early FY '16 and has continued to date. 
The story at Urban Europe in Q4 was similar to that of North America, except that the EU teams were not able to achieve the same initial margin improvement, largely because of weak exchange rates and higher penetration of branded products.  Like its North American counterparts, I believe the EU business has upside sales opportunity in Q1 versus the prior year period.
Now let me turn our attention to Anthropologie. The brand's fourth quarter performance in North America mirrored the prior 3 quarters. All product categories, except apparel, posted positive comparable sales. Assortments that lacked diversity like sweaters and dresses weighed on comp sales in the apparel division. since the category mix of sales skews heavily to apparel, the negative comp in that category offset gains in others. The result, total brand comp sales dropped by 2% in the quarter. Markdowns rose, but their effect on margins was partially offset by nicely higher IMU across all product categories including apparel. David and the team also effectively managed comp inventory, which ended the quarter down 2% versus the prior year.
The Anthropologie team produced many product categories in Q4. The home product expansion continues to exceed expectations. And David's goal announced at Investor Day 18 months ago of doubling home product sales by 2020 seem very achievable.  The recent home catalog has been well received, so the brand expects strong home sales to continue throughout the first half of FY '17. 
In Q4, Christmas also responded eagerly to the new beauty assortment offered online and in 70 concept shops within stores. The shops were so successful that the team is planning to roll out an additional 60 shops this year.  Other notable Q4 success stories include the Bhldn and Terrain concepts, both of which delivered strong double-digit comparable sale. 
Customer excitement around all these expansion categories has confirmed our belief that the Anthropologie brand continues to resonate deeply with its customer and processes significant opportunities to expand and grow. Clearly, the task at hand for the Anthropologie team is to improve the apparel . To that end, David, Meg and creative teams at Anthropologie have worked hard over the last 9 months to implement new process and procedures to unlock the team's creativity to improve their in-house design product and creative messaging. I believe positive results from this work could become visible in the first 6 months of FY '17. 
An example is our dress assortment, which is now flowing into the stores and is available online. These dresses were featured in a dedicated catalog of that went into homes last week. The new product and the marketing materials to support it have successfully boosted dress sales. Comparable weekly sales in that class have run from negative to double-digit positive.
Anthropologie was not alone in building a successful expansion category. During the quarter and throughout the year, Free People experience significant growth in their intimates, movement, shoes and party dress categories across all channels. Like the Anthropologie brand, the recent slower growth rate of Retail segment comps for Free People is the result of slower apparel sales. The brand team attributes this slowdown to difficult comparisons following 13 consecutive quarters of strong growth and suboptimized distortion of new fashion trend. For the first half of this year, I would not be surprised to see the brand produce flat to low single-digit negative Retail segment comps as the brand chases reorders and distorts its buys into the emerging trend.
In Q4, the Wholesale channel experienced very strong 29% sales growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Even after backing up the benefit of carryover shipments from the third quarter, Wholesale revenue increased by an impressive 14% in the fourth quarter. This was when many retailers were struggling with the excess inventory. Current Wholesale bookings remain strong. And in late January for the first time, the brand ship FP Movement product to selected wholesale accounts and 60 new and 16 athletic-only accounts. Early sales report indicated that the movement product is performing very well.
Now let me say a few words about the macro environment. As all of you know, fashion retailers had a difficult 2015. The consumer's appetite for fashion seems to be inversely related to price. It's relatively easy to list the many headwinds that might cause such a phenomenon: anemic growth; stagnant household incomes; increased spending on nondiscretionary items like health care, education and shelter; increased competition from newer retailers, both traditional and online; stiff deflationary pressures; and continued competition from other trending categories like electronics and dining out.
However, the results in Q4 show all of our brands produced solid positive comps in most of their nonapparel category: home, intimates, accessories, shoes and beauty. Obviously, all these categories faced the same headwinds, so why then was apparel the outlier? To me, the answer is simple: fashion, or more accurately, the lack thereof. The last major fashion shift was 10 years ago when the skinny bottom returned to popularity. Since then, we've had over rise the skinny, low rise, high rise, color, black, white print, wash, sanded, spliced and destroyed, yoga and active, leggings, and stretch. Today, the customer has a closetful of various skinny bottoms and she has many, many tops and sweaters go over them. Without a fashion need to drive her purchases, the customer can easily defer her apparel spend. Surely, a major fashion shift is a cure for the current apparel malaise. I'm not predicting exactly when that change will come, but I'm certain it will meanwhile, the good news is I see more fashion excitement this spring than I've seen in quite a few years.
Given the headwinds and assuming the fashion emerges, what is Urban's growth strategy? How do we operate 3 strong omnichannel lifestyle brands, adapt to the environment and continue to grow? While there are differences by brand, the essential strategy hasn't changed. We plan to invest in category growth, channel growth and geographic expansion.
I'll begin the category expansion. All brands have experienced strong growth in the expansion categories. And this remains a primary area of focus for developing categories that fit customer's lifestyle and also complement the core product is a way to leverage the equity of our brands, without the enormous cost of launching a completely separate business. We believe that all brands have the opportunity to show significant sales growth, especially in the direct channel by doing nothing more than fully developing the following categories. 
First, home. We've already seen success with the Anthropologie and Urban brands with home category expansion. As I said earlier, David Anthro home could easily become $0.5 billion business within the next 5 years. That alone could drive mid-single-digit growth for Anthropologie.
Intimates. All brands are currently producing double-digit sales growth in intimates. This category is trending strongly and has enormous opportunity. We expect continued double-digit growth across all of our channels, including Wholesale.
Beauty. This category worked very well for the Anthropologie and Urban brands this past holiday season. We know it's an important business, but it's too early to know how big the business can be for our brands.
Shoes. Each brand now has its own internal development team producing shoes. The products they are creating are differentiating and selling very well, including the Free People Wholesale shoe offering, which continues to show solid growth in both sales dollars and number of stores sold.
Active. Free People has championed this category with their FP Movement line of feminine active wear. The first wholesale shipment left in the last week of January to 132 accounts and 200 doors, including 30 Nordstrom doors. Obviously, the potential of this category is huge, judging by the size of the main players in this space.
And finally, Bhldn and Terrain. Both of these Anthropologie-sold brands continued to produce excellent year-over-year sales gains, and we believe both have the potential to be at least $100 million brands.
Proper category development requires significant upfront investment. Since our goal is to develop each category with proprietary product, we must invest in talent and infrastructure to create, produce and market products that can compete favorably alongside national brands. Much of our growth in expenses over the past few years has been aimed at creating the capabilities to help drive category growth. As these categories mature and sales increase, we should begin to leverage these investment.
Channel growth is the next strategic element, but our goal here it is to expand each channel of distribution: Retail, Wholesale and hybrid-like concession. Omnichannel retail can further be subdivided into stores and direct. Let me briefly discuss our position on stores because there has been much discussion about the future.
But to paraphrase Mark Twain, the death of the retail stores have been greatly exaggerated. But granted, North America is overstored and many retailers underperforming units won't have growth. And it certainly is true that the role of the store in the digital age is changing, but I envision that brick-and-mortar store has an equal partner with the virtual store in this new omnichannel world. There's no better proof of this than the current launch by most retailers to open their retail stores.
Staying on the subject of stores. As we've discussed many times, both the Urban and Anthropologie brands are approaching what we believe to be our maximum unit potential in North America. Long before the Internet was a selling vehicle, we calculated full penetration for both brands at 200 to 250 units. stores fleet in North America now numbers 209 and 197 for Anthropologie and Urban respectively.  Going forward, therefore, you'll see minimum unit growth in North America for both brands, although Anthropologie will continue to increase square footage as they plan to open 4 expanded format stores in FY '17.  All of these larger Anthropologie stores will house bigger assortments of the expanded category. After proof of concept, the brand expects to expend additional stores by relocating and enlarging existing locations.
Unlike its larger siblings, the Free People brand currently operates a smaller fleet of stores in North America. The brand will continue to selectively open more domestic stores and expand some existing smaller units. Given how the customers have embraced the brand's newly expanded stores in Dallas and Denver, future stores, new and expanded, will cluster around 4,000 to 6,000 square feet where the brand can offer wider, more representative range of Free People products.
Turning to direct. In order to drive additional direct and omnichannel sales, we will continue to make investments in technology, marketing and infrastructure. The consumer's expectations continue to rise with regard to functionality and experience in the direct and omnichannel worlds. She wants to shop any time, any place and on any device and have an equally compelling and seamless experience. She wants product information including when it's available and where it is in the size she needs. Once the purchase is made, she expects her shipments fast and free, delivered where and when it's most convenient for her. 
To live up to these expectations, we are in the process of improving our functionality around checkup, payment, search, inventory visibility and speed on all of our brands' web platforms. Additional site functionality is scheduled to be rolled out later this year include in-store pickup, ship through store and enhanced mobile operation capability.  Other technology investment of this year include new software to mine our current data and provide our brand teams with more predictive analytics to improve demand forecasting for purchasing and allocation and new programs to allow for better customer segmentation and personalization.
The final element of our growth strategy is geographic expansion. If our store count is approaching full penetration in North America, certainly, the same cannot be said for other areas of the world. International expansion provides an exciting opportunity for all 3 brands. Almost 90% of our sales still come from North America, and yet only 30% of overall sales in the developed world comes from our region. This implies we could triple sales if we could match global penetrations to that which we enjoy in North America.
There are many robust markets in Asia and Middle East where our brands have almost no distribution and still many in Europe that are untapped or underpenetrated. We already sell and ship in over 130 different countries through the Internet. In order to increase our international penetration and help augment the DTC business, we will begin to utilize our other channels of distribution. Different countries, however, will have different approaches, ranging from cellphones [ph] operated stores to concessions and traditional wholesale arrangements to licensing and partnership relationships. Developing the global expansion strategy, which countries to enter first and what structure to use would be a top priority for David in his newly announced role. He would flesh out his vision for that role shortly.
In conclusion, despite many macro headwinds and lull in new fashion trend, our brands had done well and remain highly desirable and competitive. We have successfully developed many new and expanded product categories that complement our core apparel businesses. Customers responded positively in these categories across all of our brands and channels. We believe each brand has significant growth opportunities to more fully develop these categories and reach many new customers in areas beyond North America.
Now before turning the call over to questions, I would like to make 2 personnel announcements. First it's my pleasure to announce that Trish Donnelly has been promoted to the role of CEO of the Urban Outfitters Group. In this role, she will be responsible for overseeing the brand across all channels and geographies. Trish joined Urban Outfitters brand as North American President 2 years ago and has done a terrific job of moving the brand forward and navigating the brand through some very choppy waters.
Additionally as previously announced, David McCreight has been promoted and will assume the role of President of URBN. in addition to his current responsibility as CEO of the Anthropologie Group, David will now also oversee strategic international development and global direct-to-consumer initiatives for URBN.
David, perhaps you can discuss your vision for this role?"

I'd like to thank you, Meg and the leadership team for your support in me as incoming President of URBN. I believe our portfolio of globalized brands contain some of the strongest, most differentiated brands in the industry. And while continuing the Anthropologie Group's growth will remain my main priorities, I am excited by the opportunities to help shape URBN's strategy for DTC and international expansion.  We are in an environment where the pace of soft- and hardware innovation has engendered more and evolving ways to shape brands. And with the point of influence in transactions shifting, it makes sense that we align our resources across brands to ensure that our investment are strategic and coordinated.
Of course, the brands will remain the customer and creative experts, but well executed. This approach will help the brands and URBN perform at an even higher level, with greater resources than if each brand were researching and investing on their own.
Regarding our geographic distribution, we plan to more aggressively expand all channels and brands into underdeveloped markets globally, explore launching new digital platforms, opening stores, creating partnerships or entering into licensing agreements for our brands and products in regions and countries where we have little or no presence currently.
While the plan is still being developed and similar to the DTC initiative, I will be hiring a leader to help us coordinate activities in a new and more impactful way across all brands. I look forward to updating you on our progress with these important initiatives in the coming season. Thank you."

As it relates to inventory management, I think we've done a pretty good job here on effectively lowering our weeks of supply, putting faster turn into the business. And we anticipate continuing to do so in fiscal '17. The brands have opportunity to keep inventory basically at, if not below, their total comp sales growth rates as they manage through faster turn into fiscal '17. As it relates to merch margin opportunity for the full year, I think we're going to defer on talking about the full year right now as we enter into the first quarter. The fourth quarter is awful long way away. As of right now, it is obviously very early in the quarter, but we have seen some improvement in our business from where the quarter started. We did -- we do believe with the strength of the Urban Outfitters business and how that business is trending right now that we do believe we can drive gross profit margin improvement in the first quarter through improved markdowns and lower markdown rate at the Urban Outfitters brand, which we think will more than offset some risks and the higher markdown rate at the Free People brand. And as it relates to the Anthropologie brand, right now, we are starting to see some early read of some improving women's apparel and women's accessories business. And we do think that their margin could be flat to slightly better in the first quarter. Also, there's a lot of moving pieces in there. You got store occupancy that continues to deleverage as store comp remains negative. you've got deleverage related to delivery expense as a direct-to-consumer channel continues to increase in overall penetration. With that being said, those things happened in the fourth quarter. And had it not been for the impairment charges that we recorded in the fourth quarter, we would have had over 50 basis points of improvement in our gross profit margin in our most recent quarter. And we think we can do something similar in the first quarter this year."

Meg, Barb and the merchant team at Anthropologie have done a good job starting to make traction with the new approaches. As Meg mentioned earlier, the concept to customer approach. We are seeing nice movement in dresses. That being said, we're still early stages, and we want to see the rest of the offer round out. We are seeing interesting reads as it relates to fashion and her appetite for specialness. We're selling even higher quantities than we've recognized before when the product's right. We are working in our inventory management. We several years of good inventory management and we still believe there's more opportunity in the future to improve margins there. And one of the healthier indications we have going forward is that the own brand design has improved, and it's been growing in penetration year-over-year quite strong. So we'll look to see those. It's still very early in the season but we are seeing some interesting leads that help us look towards the back half of spring and early fall. As it relates to international, as one always wants to focus in on the customer you know best, which is the domestic market. And we still have much opportunity in all brands to grow domestically. But we also noted international takes time to learn and to scale across all markets. And so we want to make sure we're starting that, while we're understanding the maturing store base we have in North America."

We spent a lot of time at Vision 20|20 talking about the different concepts that we were going to expand and enlarge, and have done that. And the reaction with a customer has been, I think, extraordinarily strong. We think that there's lots of opportunity to develop it further. And to that end if you recall, we talked about the importance of having an omnichannel strategy. Because not only did we want to have larger stores that housed some of these are large concepts, but we wanted their stores to be marketing vehicles to help drive traffic to the web. And as we put these enhanced concepts and categories of online, we have seen exactly that happened. I think we have seen no better example of this than Free People. Free People's apparel sales probably have been slowing for the better part of 2 years. And they continue to have great comps because their other categories are really doing quite well. And that's intimates, the shoes are doing extremely well. And now, we're pretty confident the movement is going to start taking some of that -- those sales and pushing them forward as well. So it was a strategy that not only talked about how we're going to grow, but it was a strategy to spread some of the risks, in case there were issues around anyone of our larger categories. And as it turns out, I think we didn't know that this was going to happen. But as it turned out, I think it was the right play because there are -- we just went through over the last 12 months. And it's been fairly significant downturn, or as I called it, a lull in the fashion apparel business. I don't expect that to continue. I've seen it happen before. I've seen it come out, and I think it will come up at some point in the future, but I think it's a very good that we embarked on these expanded categories."

So as it relates to IMU, I think both the Urban and the Anthropologie brand exited the fourth quarter with nice opportunity for -- to drive some improvement in IMU. I think both those brands working with Barbara and the rest of our sourcing team have seen some nice gains in some of the work that they've done around making sure that we're capturing the commodity pricing deflation that's going on as well as working through some of our near-sourcing opportunities in order to put some speed into -- some additional speed into our supply chain. It's something that I think we're certainly very proud of. I think we ended the year 1 week faster from a supply chain perspective than we were a year ago. And being able to put that speed into the supply chain is something that's critically important to us. And to be able to do it while we're still showing IMU gains as I think a testament to a lot of the work that been done. And we think we can continue to show some IMU improvement into fiscal '17. As it relates to store capital or as it relates to total capital, the number for fiscal '17 is a little bit higher than we originally anticipated. We have about $10 million pushed out from the current year into the upcoming year. And that number is largely driven to some closeout payments and some additional work that is needed to be done to finish out our East Coast fulfillment center. The remaining capital is dedicated to the new store growth as well as our expanded stores to support the larger format at both the Anthropologie and Free People. As you know, we repurchased 15 million shares in fiscal '16. We have 7.3 million shares remaining in our current authorization. And as free cash flow exists as you spoke to, we do have some cash obviously remaining in our balance sheet as well as opportunity within our revolver up and down when we see appropriate. We do anticipate continuing with the share repurchase in fiscal '17, but this is not something that will be linear. We'll do it in times where we feel appropriate and we have free cash flow to be comfortable doing so."

So I think apparel would be one of the biggest areas of her spend. So I can't give you exact numbers, but. I would say the Anthropologie brand, there's no reason to believe that apparel couldn't be somewhere around to 50% to even possibly below that. I would expect the Urban brand to still remain above the 50%. And with Free People, I think it's still above 50% and above would still be the place where I would put apparel.

The same thing with the information categories. So those will vary. What we have seen is that the categories we've added, since Dick alluded to the beauty shops, they drove what we can tell is incremental comps in the stores, despite negative traffic. again we are getting in these instances, more of the share of her spend at that time."

As far as the fashion lull, I think it's pretty clear that the fashion is going through a change right now, and I think a fashion change. We've been with BHLDN for the better part of 10 years, and I think it's nearing the end of its life cycle. And when that happens, there's often a lot of staleness or slowness in the innovation in the fashion world. People lack sort of the excitement and inspiration because a lot of people still with the old fashion, as Meg talked about. Some people with the new fashion, some check on all together because they don't know what to do. I think that, that is a predictable -- what happens predictably at the bottom of the cycle. As new fashion's born starts to catch on, there's a point of which starts to ramp up, and there's excitement that surrounds the newness. When that happens, sales typically if we follow that fashion and give it to her the way she wants it, the sales take off. So in the in-between period, the business is a little tougher. At the end of the cycle, the business is very slow. And when it starts to pick up, the business picks up quite rapidly how long it's good to take through that cycle, I really can't tell you. I do see an awful lot of science out there that suggest me, the cycle has begun and certainly, we hope it's sooner than later."

I will start my prepared commentary discussing our recently completed fiscal year 2016 fourth quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share some of our thoughts concerning the fiscal year 2017 first quarter and full year.
Total company or URBN sales for the fourth quarter increased to $1 billion. This sales increase included a minus 2% Retail segment comp, a $1.5 million increase in noncomp sales, including the opening of 6 net new stores, and a 29% jump in Wholesale segment sales. Additionally, please note that our sales growth during the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 160 basis points of foreign currency translation.
Within our Retail segment comps, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting a double-digit sales increase driven by increases in sessions and conversion rates, which more than offset a slight decrease in average order value. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transaction and average unit selling price, while units per transaction were flat. The negative transaction could have been affected by traffic, which was down at each of our brands' comp stores during the quarter.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 2% at Free People while decreasing by 3% in Urban Outfitters and 2% at the Anthropologie Group. Our URBN Retail segment comp was negative in all months during the quarter, with each month coming in fairly consistent with the minus 2% for the quarter.
Free People Wholesale segment sales delivered another strong quarter as sales rose 29% to $75 million. These results came from double-digit growth in specialty and department store doors domestically and internationally. Please keep in mind that the fourth quarter did benefit from approximately $9 million in carryover of orders that were delayed in shipping at the end of the third quarter. We are now completely up-to-date and do not anticipate any further fulfillment center delays.
Total URBN gross profit for the quarter is flat to the prior comparable quarter at $349 million. Gross profit rate declined by 12 basis points to 34.5%. The decline in gross profit rate was driven by almost 100 basis points of deleverage in delivery and fulfillment center expense. Please note that approximately 25 basis points of this deleverage is due to the fulfillment center transition and should begin to be recaptured in future quarters. The remainder of the delivery and fulfillment center deleverage primarily relates to the increase in sales penetration of the direct-to-consumer channel, which increased in Retail segment penetration by nearly 400 basis points in the quarter.
Store occupancy also deleveraged in the quarter by just under 100 basis points, primarily due to store impairment charges, which I will discuss in a few minutes, and partially due to the negative store comps at all 3 brands. Almost fully offsetting these decreases was close to 200 basis points of improvement in markdown rate driven by significant improvements at the Urban Outfitters brand. Both Free People and Anthropologie experienced higher markdown rates during the quarter as they worked through some slow-moving apparel products.
As mentioned earlier, we incurred store impairment charges of $9 million in the quarter, with $7 million of this charge negatively affecting gross profit rate by approximately 70 basis points, which is included in the 100 basis points already noted above, and the remaining $2 million negatively affecting SG&A rate by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter. These store impairments relates to 3 stores in Europe, 1 in Canada and 1 in the United States. 4 were Urban Outfitters stores and the 1 Canadian store belongs to Anthropologie.
Certainly, a lot of moving pieces in gross profit margin for the quarter. What we are most proud of is our improvement in maintained margin, largely driven by overall lower markdown rate. Had it not been for the impairment charges, we would have delivered an overall improvement in gross profit margin of over 50 basis points for the quarter as well as an improvement in overall profit dollars and rate.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 3% to $233 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 65 basis points to 23%. This SG&A deleverage was primarily due to an increase in marketing expense to support our customer acquisition and retention efforts and an increase in technology-related expenses used to support our omnichannel initiatives.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 6% to $116 million, with operating profit margin deleveraging by 77 basis points to 11.5%. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our operating profit rate by approximately 50 basis points in the quarter. And as earlier mentioned, store impairments negatively affected our operating profit rate by approximately 90 basis points in the quarter.
Net income for the quarter was $73 million or $0.61 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory decreased by 8% to $330 million. The reduction in inventory is due to a 6% reduction in Retail segment comp inventory at cost. The decrease in Retail segment comp inventory is due to improved inventory planning and control as the business continues to work towards managing to a lower weeks of supply. The reduction in inventory is not necessarily predictive of future sales growth as we are currently doing a nice job of getting faster turns out of our inventory, as shown over previous quarters.
We ended the quarter with $363 million in cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, the company repurchased and retired 4.3 million common shares for approximately $100 million. We repurchased and retired a total of 15 million common shares in fiscal year 2016 for approximately $465 million. We have 7.3 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors share repurchase authorization.
As we enter the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 26 net new stores for the year, excluding our Food & Beverage division. For the first quarter, we are planning 3 new Free People stores in North America and will close 1 Urban Outfitters store. For the year, we are planning on opening 4 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe; 10 net new Anthropologie stores, including 2 in Europe; and 12 net new Free People stores. We are excited that we're opening approximately 4 expanded-format Anthropologie stores this year, primarily through expansions or relocations of existing stores. These expanded-format stores give us a great opportunity to please the customer more with a broader assortment in categories like home, beauty and intimates as well as the BHLDN wedding brands and the Terrain outdoor living brands. We're also planning on opening 2 to 3 Vetri pizzerias, which will be stand-alone locations.
URBN gross margin rate for the quarter could improve slightly versus the prior year. The improvement could come from improved maintained margin, driven primarily by the Urban Outfitters brand, which could be partially offset by a maintained margin decline at the Free People brand and store occupancy deleverage for all of URBN if negative store comps continue.
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a high single-digit rate for the first quarter. This increase will be driven by direct-to-consumer channel investments related to marketing and technology as well as store-related expenses to support our square footage growth, which is planned at approximately 5% for fiscal 2017. For the year, we believe SG&A could grow at a mid-single-digit rate.
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 came in at $135 million, which was approximately $10 million under our original plan. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $160 million, with approximately $10 million moving from fiscal 2016 into fiscal 2017. Total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new, relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Finally, our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 37% and could be fairly consistent each quarter. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligations to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Dick Hayne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of all of URBN."

Today, I'll speak to our fourth quarter results, talk about the macro business environment and then finish with how we plan to navigate in this climate. In general, the holiday quarter performed pretty much as we expected and as we discussed on this call last November.
Let me begin with the Urban Outfitters brand. Results of Urban North America during the quarter benefited from steady execution of the basic merchandising strategy implemented at the beginning of the year, namely upgrade the fashion and the quality of products offered, grow initial margins and control inventory tightly by decreasing weeks of supply so there would be fewer markdowns. This strategy worked, and the Urban brand saw regular-price sales and margin improvement throughout the quarter and the year. In Q4, total comparable sales came in below where we would have liked, but the negative comps were caused solely by fewer markdown sales. Regular-price comp sales grew nicely in the quarter, and when combined with higher IMU, resulted in the Urban brand achieving many hundreds of basis points improvement in merchandise margin. The strongest regular-price comps came from the women's apparel, intimates and home category.
Not only were regular-price comparable sales up in the quarter, but Trish and her team were able to drive those sales with less inventory. Total comp ending inventory decreased by 12% in the quarter.
Looking ahead, comparisons look favorable for the brand. Excessive markdowns began to subside last year and as Q1 progressed. So as the brand begins to anniversary fewer promotions, I believe Urban comps could benefit from the regular-price sales momentum that began in early FY '16 and has continued to date.
The story at Urban Europe in Q4 was similar to that of North America, except that the EU teams were not able to achieve the same initial margin improvement, largely because of weak exchange rates and higher penetration of branded products. Like its North American counterpart, I believe the EU business has upside sales opportunity in Q1 versus the prior year period.
Now let me turn your attention to Anthropologie. The brand's fourth quarter performance in North America mirrored the prior 3 quarters. All product categories, except apparel, posted positive comparable sales. Assortments that lacked diversity like sweaters and dresses weighed on comp sales in the apparel division. And since the category mix of sales skews heavily toward apparel, the negative comp in that category offset gains in others. The result, total brand comp sales dropped by 2% in the quarter. Markdowns rose, but their effect on margins was partially offset by nicely higher IMU across all product categories, including apparel. David and the team also effectively managed comp inventory, which ended the quarter down 2% versus the prior year.
The Anthropologie team produced many product category successes in Q4. The home product expansion continues to exceed expectations, and David's goal announced at Investor Day 18 months ago of doubling home product sales by 2020 seem very achievable. The recent home catalog has been well received, so the brand expects strong home sales to continue throughout the first half of FY '17.
In Q4, Christmas also responded eagerly to the new beauty assortment offered online and in 70 concept shops within stores. The shops were so successful that the team is planning to roll out an additional 60 shops this year. Other notable Q4 success stories include the BHLDN and Terrain concepts, both of which delivered strong double-digit comparable sale.
Customer excitement around all of these expansion categories has confirmed our belief that the Anthropologie brand continues to resonate deeply with its customer and possesses significant opportunities to expand and grow. Clearly, the task at hand for the Anthropologie team is to improve the apparel assortment. To that end, David, Meg and the creative teams at Anthropologie have worked hard over the last 9 months to implement new process and procedures to unlock the team's creativity and to improve the in-house design product and creative messaging. I believe positive results from this work could become visible in the first 6 months of FY '17.
An example is the dress assortment, which is now flowing into the stores and is available online. These dresses were featured in a dedicated catalog that went into homes last week. The new product and the marketing materials to support it have successfully boosted dress sales. Comparable weekly sales in that class have gone from negative to double-digit positive.
Anthropologie was not alone in building successful expansion categories. During the quarter and throughout the year, Free People experienced significant growth in their intimates, movement, shoes and party dress categories across all channels. Like with the Anthropologie brand, the recent slower growth rate of Retail segment comps for Free People is the result of slower apparel sales. The brand team attributes this slowdown to difficult comparisons following 13 consecutive quarters of strong growth and suboptimized distortion of new fashion trend. For the first half of this year, I would not be surprised to see the brand produce flat to low single-digit negative Retail segment comps as the brand chases reorders and distorts its buys into the emerging trend.
In Q4, the Wholesale channel experienced very strong 29% sales growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Even after backing out the benefit of carryover shipments from the third quarter, Wholesale revenue increased by an impressive 14% in the fourth quarter, this when many retailers were struggling with the excess inventory. Current Wholesale bookings remain strong. And in late January for the first time, the brand shipped FP Movement product to selected Wholesale accounts and 60 new athletic-only accounts. Early sales report indicates that the movement product is performing very well.
Now let me say a few words about the macro environment. As all of you know, fashion retailers had a difficult 2015. The consumer's appetite for fashion seems to be inversely related to price. It's relatively easy to list the many headwinds that might cause such a phenomenon: anemic growth; stagnant household incomes; increased spending on nondiscretionary items like health care, education and shelter; increased competition from newer retailers, both traditional and online; stiff deflationary pressures; and continued competition from other trending categories like electronics and dining out.
However, the results in Q4 show all of our brands produced solid positive comps in most of their nonapparel category: home, intimates, accessories, shoes and beauty. Obviously, all of these categories faced the same headwinds, so why then was apparel the outlier? To me, the answer is simple: fashion, or more accurately, the lack thereof. The last major fashion shift was 10 years ago when the skinny bottom returned to popularity. Since then, we've had all varieties of skinny: low rise, high rise; color, black, white and print; wash, sanded, sliced and destroyed; yoga and active; leggings, jeggings and stretch. Today, the customer has a closet full of various skinny bottoms, and she has many, many long tops and sweaters to go over them. Without a fashion need to drive her purchases, the customer can easily defer her apparel spend. Surely, a major fashion shift is a cure for the current apparel malaise. I'm not predicting exactly when that change will come, but I'm certain it will. Meanwhile, the good news is I see more fashion excitement this spring than I've seen in quite a few years.
Given the headwinds and assuming new fashion emerges, what is Urban's growth strategy? How do we operate 3 strong omnichannel lifestyle brands, adapt to the environment and continue to grow? While there are differences by brand, the essential strategy hasn't changed. We plan to invest in category growth, channel growth and geographic expansion.
I'll begin with category expansion. All brands have experienced strong growth in their expansion categories, and this remains a primary area of focus. Developing categories that fit the customer's lifestyle and also complement the core product is a way to leverage the equity of our brands without the enormous cost of launching a completely separate business. We believe that all brands have the opportunity to show significant sales growth, especially in the direct channel, by doing nothing more than fully developing the following categories.
First, home. We've already seen success at the Anthropologie and Urban brands with home category expansion. As I said earlier, David believes Anthro home could easily become $0.5 billion business within the next 5 years. That alone could drive mid-single-digit growth for Anthropologie.
Intimates. All brands are currently producing double-digit sales growth in intimates. This category is trending strongly and has enormous opportunity. We expect continued double-digit growth across all of our channels, including Wholesale.
Beauty. This category worked very well for the Anthropologie and Urban brands this past holiday season. We know it's an important business, but it's too early to know how big the business can be for our brands.
Shoes. Each brand now has its own internal development team producing shoes. The products they're creating are differentiating and selling very well, including the Free People Wholesale shoe offering, which continues to show solid growth in both sales dollars and number of doors sold.
Active. Free People has championed this category with their FP Movement line of feminine active wear. The first Wholesale shipment left the last week of January to 132 accounts and 200 doors, including 30 Nordstrom doors. Obviously, the potential of this category is huge, judging by the size of the main players in this space.
And finally, BHLDN and Terrain. Both of these Anthropologie sub brands continued to produce excellent year-over-year sales gains, and we believe both have the potential to be at least $100 million brands.
Proper category development requires significant upfront investment. Since our goal is to develop each category of our proprietary product, we must invest in talent and infrastructure to create, produce and market products that can compete favorably alongside national brands. Much of our growth in expenses over the past few years has been aimed at creating the capabilities to help drive category growth. As these categories mature and sales increase, we should begin to leverage these investments.
Channel growth is the next strategic element. Our goal here is to expand each channel distribution: Retail, Wholesale and hybrid, like concessions. Omnichannel retail can further be subdivided into stores and direct. Let me briefly discuss our position on stores because there has been much discussion about their future.
To paraphrase Mark Twain, the death of the retail store has been greatly exaggerated. Granted, North America is overstored, and many retailers' underperforming units will have to close. And it certainly is true that the role of the store in the digital age is changing, but I envision that brick-and-mortar store has an equal partner with the virtual store in this new omnichannel world. There's no better proof of this than the current rush by most pure-play retailers to open their own retail stores.
Staying on the subject of stores. As we've discussed many times, both the Urban and the Anthropologie brands are approaching what we believe to be our maximum unit potential in North America. Long before the Internet was a selling vehicle, we calculated full penetration for both brands at 200 to 250 units. The store fleet in North America now numbers 209 and 197 for Anthropologie and Urban, respectively. Going forward, therefore, you will see minimum unit growth in North America for both brands, although Anthropologie will continue to increase square footage as they plan to open 4 expanded-format stores in FY '17. All of these larger Anthropologie stores will house bigger assortments of their expanded category. After proof of concept, the brand expects to expand additional stores by relocating or enlarging existing locations.
Unlike its larger siblings, the Free People brand currently operates a smaller fleet of stores in North America. The brand will continue to selectively open more domestic stores and expand some existing smaller units. Given how the customers have embraced the brand's newly expanded stores in Dallas and Denver, future stores, both new and expanded, will cluster around 4,000 to 6,000 square feet where the brand can offer a wider, more representative range of Free People products.
Turning to direct. In order to drive additional direct and omnichannel sales, we will continue to make investments in technology, marketing and new infrastructure. Consumer's expectations continue to rise with regard to functionality and experience in the direct and omnichannel worlds. She wants to shop any time, any place and on any device and have an equally compelling and seamless experience. She wants product information, including when it's available and where it is, in the size she needs. Once her purchase is made, she expects her shipments fast and free, delivered where and when it's most convenient for her.
To live up to these expectations, we are in the process of improving our functionality around checkout, payment, search, inventory visibility and speed on all of our brands' web platforms. Additional site functionality that is scheduled to be rolled out later this year includes in-store pickup, ship through store and enhanced mobile application capability. Other technology investments this year include new software to mine our current data and provide our brand teams with more predictive analytics to improve demand forecasting for purchasing and allocation and new programs that will allow for better customer segmentation and personalization.
The final element of our growth strategy is geographic expansion. If our store count is approaching full penetration in North America, certainly the same cannot be said for other areas of the world. International expansion provides an exciting and fertile opportunity for all 3 brands. Almost 90% of our sales still come from North America, and yet only 30% of overall sales in the developed world comes from our region. This implies we could triple sales if we could match global penetration to that which we enjoy in North America.
There are many robust markets in Asia and Mid-East where our brands have almost no distribution and still many in Europe that are untapped or underpenetrated. We already sell and ship to over 130 different countries through the Internet. In order to increase our international penetration and help augment the DTC business, we will begin to utilize our other channels of distribution. Different countries, however, will have different approaches, ranging from self-owned and operated stores to concessions and traditional wholesale arrangements to licensing and partnership relationships. Developing the global expansion strategy, which countries to enter first and what structure to use will be a top priority for David in his newly announced role. He will discuss his vision for that role shortly.
In conclusion, despite many macro headwinds and a lull in new fashion trend, our brands have done well and remain highly desirable and competitive. We have successfully developed many new and expanded product categories that complement our core apparel businesses. Customers responded positively in these categories across all of our brands and channels. We believe each brand has significant growth opportunities to more fully develop these categories and reach many new customers in areas beyond North America.
Now before turning the call over to questions, I would like to make 2 personnel announcements. First, it's my pleasure to announce that Trish Donnelly has been promoted to the role of CEO of the Urban Outfitters Group. In this role, she will be responsible for overseeing the brand across all channels and geographies. Trish joined Urban Outfitters brand as North American President 2 years ago and has done a terrific job of moving the brand forward and navigating the brand through some very choppy waters.
Additionally, as previously announced, David McCreight has been promoted and will assume the role of President of URBN. In addition to his current responsibility as CEO of the Anthropologie Group, David will now also oversee strategic international development and global direct-to-consumer initiatives for URBN.
David, perhaps you can discuss your vision for this new role?"

I'd like to thank you, Meg and the leadership team for the support in becoming President of URBN. I believe our portfolio of global lifestyle brands contains some of the strongest, most differentiated brands in the industry. And while continuing the Anthropologie Group's growth will remain my main priority, I am excited by the opportunities to help shape URBN's strategy for DTC and international expansion. We are in an environment where the pace of soft and hardware innovation has engendered more and evolving ways to shape brands. And with the point of influence and transactions shifting, it makes sense that we align our resources across brands to ensure that our investment are strategic and coordinated.
Of course, the brands will remain the customer and creative experts, but well executed. This approach will help the brands and URBN perform at an even higher level, with greater resources than if each brand were researching and investing on their own.
Regarding our geographic distribution, we plan to more aggressively expand all channels and brands into underdeveloped markets globally, explore launching new digital platforms, opening stores, creating partnerships or entering into licensing agreements for our brands and products in regions and countries where we have little or no presence currently.
While the plan is still being developed and similar to the DTC initiative, I will be hiring a leader to help us coordinate activities in a new and more impactful way across all brands. I look forward to updating you on our progress with these important initiatives over the coming season. Thank you."

As it relates to inventory management, I think we've done a pretty good job here at effectively lowering our weeks of supply and putting a faster turn into the business. And we anticipate continuing to do so in fiscal '17. And I think all of the brands have opportunity to keep inventory basically at, if not below, their total comp sales growth rates as they manage through a faster turn into fiscal '17. As it relates to merch margin opportunity for the full year, I think we're going to defer on talking about the full year right now as we enter into the first quarter. The fourth quarter is an awful long way away. As of right now, it is obviously very early in the quarter, but we have seen some improvement in our business from where the quarter started. We did -- we do believe with the strength of the Urban Outfitters business and how that business is trending right now that we do believe we can drive gross profit margin improvement in the first quarter through improved markdowns or lower markdown rate at the Urban Outfitters brand, which we think will more than offset some risks in the higher markdown rate at the Free People brand. And as it relates to the Anthropologie brand, right now, we are starting to see some early reads, some improving women's apparel and women's accessories business. And we do think that their maintained margin could be flat to even slightly better in the first quarter. Also, there's a lot of moving pieces in there. You've got store occupancy that could continue to deleverage if store comp remains negative. You've got deleverage related to delivery expense as the direct-to-consumer channel continues to increase in overall penetration. With all of that being said, those things happened in the fourth quarter. And had it not been for the impairment charges that we recorded in the fourth quarter, we would have had over 50 basis points of improvement in our gross profit margin in our most recent quarter. And we think we can do something similar in the first quarter this year."

As it relates to Anthropologie reads, as Dick mentioned, we continue to see real strength in the expanded categories and brands we have. In fact, the home business with the recent launch is comping last year's book quite handsomely. Very good response to that. We're seeing even the accessory business, beauty business all track and move ahead as well as intimates. Terrain and BHLDN continued their multiquarter performance. We've been focusing on apparel. Meg, Barb and the merchant team at Anthropologie have done a good job, starting to make traction with the new approaches. As Meg mentioned earlier, the concept-to-customer approach. We are seeing nice movement in dresses. That being said, we're still early stages, and we want to see the rest of the offer round out. We are seeing some interesting reads as it relates to fashion and her appetite for specialness. We're selling even higher quantities than we've recognized before when the product's right. We are working on our inventory management. We've had several years of good inventory management, and we still believe there's more opportunity in the future to improve margins there. And one of the healthier indications we have going forward is that the own brand design has improved, and it's been growing in penetration year-over-year quite strong. So we'll look to see those. It's still very early in the season, but we are seeing some interesting reads that help us look towards the back half of spring and early fall. As it relates to international, as one always wants to focus in on the customer you know best, which is the domestic market, and we still have much opportunity in all brands to grow domestically. But we also know that international takes time to learn and to scale across all markets, and so we want to make sure we're starting that while we're understanding the maturing store base we have in North America."

We spent a lot of time at Vision 20|20 talking about the different concepts that we were going to expand and enlarge, and we have done that. And the reaction with the customer has been, I think, extraordinarily strong. We think that there's lots of opportunity to develop it further. And to that end, if you recall, we talked about the importance of having an omnichannel strategy because not only did we want to have larger stores that house some of these enlarged concepts, but we wanted those stores to be marketing vehicles to help drive traffic to the web. And as we put these enhanced concepts and categories up online, we have seen exactly that happened. I think nowhere have we seen a better example of this than the Free People. Free People's apparel sales probably have been slowing for the better part of 2 years. And they continue to have great comps because their other categories are really doing quite well. And that's the intimates. The shoes are doing extremely well. And now we're pretty confident the movement is going to start taking some of that -- those sales and pushing them forward as well. So it was a strategy that not only talked about how we're going to grow, but it was a strategy to spread some of the risks in case there were issues around any one of our larger categories. And as it turns out, I think we didn't know that this was going to happen. But as it turned out, I think it was the right play because there are -- what we just went through over the last 12 months has been a fairly significant downturn, or as I called it, a lull in the fashion apparel business. I don't expect that to continue. I've seen it happen before. I've seen it come out, and I think it will come out at some point in the future, but I think it's very good that we embarked on these expanded categories."

So as it relates to IMU, I think both the Urban and the Anthropologie brand exited the fourth quarter with nice opportunity for -- to drive some improvement in IMU. I think both those brands working with Barbara Rozsas and the rest of our sourcing team have seen some nice gains in some of the work that they've done around making sure that we're capturing the commodity pricing deflation that's going on as well as working through some of our near-sourcing opportunities in order to put some speed into -- some additional speed into our supply chain. It's something that I think that we're certainly very proud of. I think we ended the year 1 week faster from a supply chain perspective than we were a year ago. And being able to put that speed into the supply chain is something that's critically important to us. And able to do it while we're still showing IMU gains, I think, is a testament to a lot of the work that has been done. And we think we can continue to show some IMU improvement into fiscal '17. As it relates to store capital -- or as it relates to total capital, the number for fiscal '17 is a little bit higher than what we had originally anticipated. We had about $10 million pushed out from the current year into the upcoming year. And that number is largely driven to some closeout payments and some additional work that is needed to be done to finish out our East Coast fulfillment center. The remaining capital is dedicated to the new store growth as well as our expanded stores to support the larger format at both the Anthropologie and Free People. As you know, we repurchased 15 million shares in fiscal '16. We have 7.3 million shares remaining on our current authorization. And as free cash flow exists, as you spoke to, we do have some cash, obviously, remaining on our balance sheet as well as the opportunity within our revolver to flex up and down when we see appropriate. We do anticipate continuing with the share repurchase in fiscal '17, but this is not something that will be linear. We'll do it at times where we feel appropriate and we have enough free cash flow to be comfortable doing so."

So I guess the way we look at it is we have no reason to believe that home can't be as large as apparel. Now of course, when you take a look at a brand like Urban, that's certainly not true. So it's a very -- a customer that travels around a lot and moves quite a bit, she's much less -- typically spends much less money on home. So I think apparel would still be one of the bigger areas of her spend. So I can't give you exact numbers, but I would say at the Anthropologie brand, there's no reason to believe that apparel couldn't be somewhere around the 50% to even possibly below that. I would expect the Urban brand to still remain above the 50%. And with Free People, I think it's still above 50% and above would still be the place where I would put apparel. I'm going to have to get back to you on your second question on the omnichannel. I have to tell you that I really don't have a good handle right now. We've done some experimentation, and we found that ship to store is going to be a very good thing for us. Anthropologie was testing it before the holiday -- or during the holiday season, but they didn't call it out on their side.

There's no question that apparel and some other categories like beauty, if you're doing your own beauty, have the highest margins. And a category like home have lower margins even though typically, since there's lower markdowns, they have the same maintained margins. Now having said that, apparel still usually or typically sells faster than home. So the sales per square foot are better. And therefore, you have usually better operating margins with apparel than you do with home. I guess we don't look at the world like that. We look at the world like when is the opportunity for us to please our customer? When is our opportunity to drive the top line? Let's be as good as we possibly can be in the items -- the products that we produce and how she will respond to them. And if we do all that, I think the margins will take care of themselves, and we'll have a very profitable business. We don't have a fixed margin -- operating margin objectives. Our objective is to be profitable, to be solidly profitable, to be above our peers and to drive the top line."

Well, as Dick said, we went through 13 consecutive quarters of positive comps. So Free People had a great ride. And it was bound to come to end at some point, and the end, I believe, has come with the fashion shift, which Dick has talked about. So it's sort of difficult for Free People to overcome that because part of the customers are wanting new and part of the customers are wanting things that they are just really comfortable with. So when you have a change in fashion and when it's bottom driven, it really affects the top business. So we're seeing the top business affected with this. We are seeing great signs of life in the new fashion. I'm very excited about what Free People has and where we're going with these new ideas. It's just not resonating with the total customer base. So we have parts of the customers adopting and wanting still things that they've known for Free People for quite some time. And then we have the others that have enough of that in their wardrobe that are looking for the new ideas. And I'm extremely excited about new ideas. And I'm optimistic that she will come around, and we'll be able to convert across all of our customers. In terms of how long that will take, when we went through this before, when we went from a wider leg to a skinny leg, it took some time. In fact, when we tried skinny leg probably for 1.5 years to 2 years before she finally started to take it on. And we were really one of the first brands to adopt with a big over a skinny. So again, pioneering with the fashion. And I believe that Free People will come back and the customer will be able to adopt all these new fashion changes. Thank you."

We haven't acted on it, but that's not to say we won't act on it. As far as the fashion lull, I think it's pretty clear that the fashion is going through a change right now, and I think it's a fashion silhouette change. We've been with big over a little now for the better part of 10 years, and I think it's nearing the end of its life cycle. And when that happens, there's often a lot of staleness or slowness in the innovation in the fashion world. People lack sort of the excitement and inspiration because a number of people are still with the old fashion, as Meg talked about. Some people are with the new fashion, and some people just sort of check out altogether because they don't know what to do. I think that, that is always a predictable -- what happens predictably at the bottom of the cycle. As the new fashion is born and starts to catch on, there's a point at which the innovation starts to ramp up, and there's tremendous amount of excitement that surrounds the newness. When that happens, the sales -- typically, if we follow that fashion and give it to her the way she wants it, the sales take off. So in the in-between period, the business is a little tougher. At the very end of the cycle, the business is very slow. And then when it starts to pick up, the business picks up quite rapidly. How long it's going to get through that cycle, I really can't tell you. I do see an awful lot of science out there that would suggest to me that, that cycle has begun.

I will start my prepared commentary discussing our recently completed fiscal year 2016 fourth quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share some of our thoughts concerning the fiscal year 2017 first quarter and full year.
Total company or URBN sales for the fourth quarter increased to $1 billion. This sales increase included a minus 2% Retail segment comp, a $1.5 million increase in noncomp sales, including the opening of 6 net new stores, and a 29% jump in Wholesale segment sales. Additionally, please note that our sales growth during the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 160 basis points of foreign currency translation.
Within our Retail segment comps, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting a double-digit sales increase driven by increases in sessions and conversion rates, which more than offset a slight decrease in average order value. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and average unit selling price, while units per transaction were flat. The negative transactions could have been affected by traffic, which was down at each of our brands' comp stores during the quarter.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 2% at Free People while decreasing by 3% in Urban Outfitters and 2% at the Anthropologie Group. Our URBN Retail segment comp was negative in all months during the quarter, with each month coming in fairly consistent with a minus 2% for the quarter.
Free People Wholesale segment sales delivered another strong quarter as sales rose 29% to $75 million. These results came from double-digit growth in specialty and department store doors domestically and internationally. Please keep in mind that the fourth quarter did benefit from approximately $9 million in carryover of orders that were delayed in shipping at the end of the third quarter. We are now completely up-to-date and do not anticipate any further fulfillment center delays.
Total URBN gross profit for the quarter is flat to the prior comparable quarter at $349 million. Gross profit rate declined by 12 basis points to 34.5%. The decline in gross profit rate was driven by almost 100 basis points of deleverage in delivery and fulfillment center expense. Please note that approximately 25 basis points of this deleverage is due to the fulfillment center transition and should begin to be recaptured in future quarters. The remainder of the delivery and fulfillment center deleverage primarily relates to the increase in sales penetration of the direct-to-consumer channel, which increased in Retail segment penetration by nearly 400 basis points in the quarter.
Store occupancy also deleveraged in the quarter by just under 100 basis points, primarily due to store impairment charges, which I will discuss in a few minutes, and partially due to the negative store comps at all 3 brands. Almost fully offsetting these decreases was close to 200 basis points of improvement in markdown rate driven by significant improvements at the Urban Outfitters brand. Both Free People and Anthropologie experienced higher markdown rates during the quarter as they worked through some slow-moving apparel products.
As mentioned earlier, we incurred store impairment charges of $9 million in the quarter, with $7 million of this charge negatively affecting gross profit rate by approximately 70 basis points, which is included in the 100 basis points already noted above, and the remaining $2 million negatively affecting SG&A rates by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter. These store impairments relate to 3 stores in Europe, 1 in Canada and 1 in the United States. 4 were Urban Outfitters stores and the 1 Canadian store belongs to Anthropologie.
Certainly, a lot of moving pieces in gross profit margin for the quarter. What we are most proud of is our improvement in maintained margin, largely driven by overall lower markdown rate. Had it not been for the impairment charges, we would have delivered an overall improvement in gross profit margin of over 50 basis points for the quarter as well as an improvement in overall profit dollars and rate.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 3% to $233 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 65 basis points to 23%. This SG&A deleverage was primarily due to an increase in marketing expense to support our customer acquisition and retention efforts and an increase in technology-related expenses used to support our omnichannel initiatives.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 6% to $116 million, with operating profit margin deleveraging by 77 basis points to 11.5%. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our operating profit rate by approximately 50 basis points in the quarter. And as earlier mentioned, store impairments negatively affected our operating profit rate by approximately 90 basis points in the quarter.
Net income for the quarter was $73 million or $0.61 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory decreased by 8% to $330 million. The reduction in inventory is due to a 6% reduction in Retail segment comp inventory at cost. The decrease in Retail segment comp inventory is due to improved inventory planning and control as the business continues to work towards managing to a lower reads of supply. The reduction in inventory is not necessarily predictive of future sales growth as we are currently doing a nice job of getting faster turns out of our inventory, as shown over previous quarters.
We ended the quarter with $363 million in cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, the company repurchased and retired 4.3 million common shares for approximately $100 million. We repurchased and retired a total of 15 million common shares in fiscal year 2016 for approximately $465 million. We have 7.3 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors share repurchase authorization.
As we enter the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 26 net new stores for the year, excluding our Food & Beverage division. For the first quarter, we are planning 3 new Free People stores in North America and will close 1 Urban Outfitters store. For the year, we are planning on opening 4 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe; 10 net new Anthropologie stores, including 2 in Europe; and 12 net new Free People stores. We are excited that we're opening approximately 4 expanded-format Anthropologie stores this year, primarily through expansions or relocations of existing stores. These expanded-format stores give us a great opportunity to please the customer more with a broader assortment in categories like home, beauty and intimates as well as the BHLDN wedding brands and the Terrain outdoor living brands. We're also planning on opening 2 to 3 Vetri pizzerias, which will be stand-alone locations.
URBN gross margin rate for the quarter could improve slightly versus the prior year. The improvement could come from improved maintained margin, driven primarily by the Urban Outfitters brand, which could be partially offset by a maintained margin decline at the Free People brand and store occupancy deleverage for all of URBN if negative store comps continue.
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a high single-digit rate for the first quarter. This increase would be driven by direct-to-consumer channel investments related to marketing and technology as well as store-related expenses to support our square footage growth, which is planned at approximately 5% for fiscal 2017. For the year, we believe SG&A could grow at a mid-single-digit rate.
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 came in at $135 million, which was approximately $10 million under our original plan. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $160 million, with approximately $10 million moving from fiscal 2016 into fiscal 2017. Total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new, relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Finally, our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 37% and could be fairly consistent each quarter. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligations to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Dick Hayne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of all of URBN."

Today, I'll speak to our fourth quarter results, talk about the macro business environment and then finish with how we plan to navigate in this climate. In general, the holiday quarter performed pretty much as we expected and as we discussed on this call last November.
Let me begin with the Urban Outfitters brand. Results of Urban North America during the quarter benefited from steady execution of the basic merchandising strategy implemented at the beginning of the year, namely upgrade the fashion and the quality of products offered, grow initial margins and control inventory tightly by decreasing weeks of supply so there would be fewer markdowns. This strategy worked, and the Urban brand saw regular-price sales and margin improvement throughout the quarter and the year. In Q4, total comparable sales came in below where we would have liked, but the negative comps were caused solely by fewer markdown sales. Regular-price comp sales grew nicely in the quarter, and when combined with higher IMU, resulted in the Urban brand achieving many hundreds of basis points improvement in merchandise margin. The strongest regular-price comps came from the women's apparel, intimates and home category.
Not only were regular-price comparable sales up in the quarter, but Trish and her team were able to drive those sales with less inventory. Total comp ending inventory decreased by 12% in the quarter.
Looking ahead, comparisons look favorable for the brand. Excessive markdowns began to subside last year as Q1 progressed. So as the brand begins to anniversary fewer promotions, I believe Urban comps could benefit from the regular-price sales momentum that began in early FY '16 and has continued to date.
The story at Urban Europe in Q4 was similar to that of North America, except that the EU teams were not able to achieve the same initial margin improvement, largely because of weak exchange rates and higher penetration of branded product. Like its North American counterpart, I believe the EU business has upside sales opportunity in Q1 versus the prior year period.
Now let me turn your attention to Anthropologie. The brand's fourth quarter performance in North America mirrored the prior 3 quarters. All product categories, except apparel, posted positive comparable sales. Assortments that lacked diversity like sweaters and dresses weighed on comp sales in the apparel division. And since the category mix of sales skews heavily toward apparel, the negative comp in that category offset gains in others. The result, total brand comp sales dropped by 2% in the quarter. Markdowns rose, but their effect on margins was partially offset by nicely higher IMU across all product categories, including apparel. David and the team also effectively managed comp inventory, which ended the quarter down 2% versus the prior year.
The Anthropologie team produced many product category successes in Q4. The home product expansion continues to exceed expectations, and David's goal announced at Investor Day 18 months ago of doubling home product sales by 2020 seemed very achievable. The recent home catalog has been well received, so the brand expects strong home sales to continue throughout the first half of FY '17.
In Q4, customers also responded eagerly to the new beauty assortment offered online and in 70 concept shops within stores. The shops were so successful that the team is planning to roll out an additional 60 shops this year. Other notable Q4 success stories include the BHLDN and Terrain concepts, both of which delivered very strong double-digit comparable sale.
Customer excitement around all of these expansion categories has confirmed our belief that the Anthropologie brand continues to resonate deeply with its customer and possesses significant opportunities to expand and grow. Clearly, the task at hand for the Anthropologie team is to improve the apparel assortment. To that end, David, Meg and the creative teams at Anthropologie have worked hard over the last 9 months to implement new process and procedures to unlock the team's creativity and to improve the in-house design product and creative messaging. I believe positive results from this work could become visible in the first 6 months of FY '17.
An example is the dress assortment, which is now flowing into the stores and is available online. These dresses were featured in a dedicated catalog that went into homes last week. The new product and the marketing materials to support it have successfully boosted dress sales. Comparable weekly sales in that class have gone from negative to double-digit positive.
Anthropologie was not alone in building successful expansion categories. During the quarter and throughout the year, Free People experienced significant growth in their intimates, movement, shoes and party dress categories across all channels. Like with the Anthropologie brand, the recent slower growth rate of Retail segment comps for Free People is the result of slower apparel sales. The brand team attributes this slowdown to difficult comparisons following 13 consecutive quarters of strong growth and suboptimized distortion of new fashion trend. For the first half of this year, I would not be surprised to see the brand produce flat to low single-digit negative Retail segment comps as the brand chases reorders and distorts its buys into the emerging trends.
In Q4, the Wholesale channel experienced very strong 29% sales growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Even after backing out the benefit of carryover shipments from the third quarter, Wholesale revenue increased by an impressive 14% in the fourth quarter, this when many retailers were struggling with excess inventory. Current Wholesale bookings remain strong. And in late January for the first time, the brand shipped FP Movement product to selected Wholesale accounts and 60 new athletic-only accounts. Early sales report indicates that the movement product is performing very well.
Now let me say a few words about the macro environment. As all of you know, fashion retailers had a difficult 2015. The consumer's appetite for fashion seems to be inversely related to price. It's relatively easy to list the many headwinds that might cause such a phenomenon: anemic growth; stagnant household incomes; increased spending on nondiscretionary items like health care, education and shelter; increased competition from newer retailers, both traditional and online; stiff deflationary pressures; and continued competition from other trending categories like electronics and dining out.
However, the results in Q4 show all of our brands produced solid positive comps in most of their nonapparel category: home, intimates, accessories, shoes and beauty. Obviously, all of these categories faced the same headwinds, so why then was apparel the outlier? To me, the answer is simple: fashion, or more accurately, the lack thereof. The last major fashion shift was 10 years ago when the skinny bottom returned to popularity. Since then, we've had all varieties of skinny: low rise, high rise; color, black, white and print; wash, sanded, sliced and destroyed; yoga and active; leggings, jeggings and stretch. Today, the customer has a closet full of various skinny bottoms, and she has many, many long tops and sweaters to go over them. Without a fashion need to drive her purchases, the customer can easily defer her apparel spend. Surely, a major fashion shift is a cure for the current apparel malaise. I'm not predicting exactly when that change will come, but I am certain it will. Meanwhile, the good news is I see more fashion excitement this spring than I've seen in quite a few years.
Given the headwinds and assuming new fashion emerges, what is Urban's growth strategy? How do we operate 3 strong omnichannel lifestyle brands, adapt to the environment and continue to grow? While there are differences by brand, the essential strategy hasn't changed. We plan to invest in category growth, channel growth and geographic expansion.
I'll begin with category expansion. All brands have experienced strong growth in their expansion categories, and this will remain a primary area of focus. Developing categories that fit the customer's lifestyle and also complement the core product is a way to leverage the equity of our brands without the enormous cost of launching a completely separate business. We believe that all brands have the opportunity to show significant sales growth, especially in the direct channel, by doing nothing more than fully developing the following categories.
First, home. We've already seen success at the Anthropologie and Urban brands with home category expansion. As I said earlier, David believes Anthro Home could easily become $0.5 billion business within the next 5 years. That alone could drive mid-single-digit growth for Anthropologie.
Intimates. All brands are currently producing double-digit sales growth in intimates. This category is trending strongly and has enormous opportunity. We expect continued double-digit growth across all of our channels, including Wholesale.
Beauty. This category worked very well for the Anthropologie and Urban brands this past holiday season. We know it's an important business, but it's too early to know how big the business can be for our brands.
Shoes. Each brand now has its own internal development team producing shoes. The products they're creating are differentiating and selling very well, including the Free People Wholesale shoe offering, which continues to show solid growth in both sales dollars and number of doors sold.
Active. Free People has championed this category with their FP Movement line of feminine active wear. The first Wholesale shipment left the last week of January to 132 accounts and 200 doors, including 30 Nordstrom doors. Obviously, the potential of this category is huge, judging by the size of the main players in this space.
And finally, BHLDN and Terrain. Both of these Anthropologie sub brands continued to produce excellent year-over-year sales gains, and we believe both have the potential to be at least $100 million brands.
Proper category development requires significant upfront investment. Since our goal is to develop each category of our proprietary product, we must invest in talent and infrastructure to create, produce and market products that can compete favorably alongside national brands. Much of our growth in expenses over the past few years has been aimed at creating the capabilities to help drive category growth. As these categories mature and sales increase, we should begin to leverage these investments.
Channel growth is the next strategic element. Our goal here is to expand each channel distribution: Retail, Wholesale and hybrid, like concession. Omnichannel retail can further be subdivided into stores and direct. Let me briefly discuss our position on stores because there has been much discussion about their future.
To paraphrase Mark Twain, the death of the retail store has been greatly exaggerated. Granted, North America is overstored, and many retailers' underperforming units will have to close. And it certainly is true that the role of the store in the digital age is changing, but I envision that brick-and-mortar store has an equal partner with the virtual store in this new omnichannel world. There's no better proof of this than the current rush by most pure-play retailers to open their own retail stores.
Staying on the subject of stores. As we've discussed many times, both the Urban and the Anthropologie brands are approaching what we believe to be our maximum unit potential in North America. Long before the Internet was a selling vehicle, we calculated full penetration for both brands at 200 to 250 units. The store fleet in North America now numbers 209 and 197 for Anthropologie and Urban, respectively. Going forward, therefore, you will see minimum unit growth in North America for both brands, although Anthropologie will continue to increase square footage as they plan to open 4 expanded-format stores in FY '17. All of these larger Anthropologie stores will house bigger assortments of their expanded category. After proof of concept, the brand expects to expand additional stores by relocating or enlarging existing locations.
Unlike its larger siblings, the Free People brand currently operates a smaller fleet of stores in North America. The brand will continue to selectively open more domestic stores and expand some existing smaller units. Given how the customers have embraced the brand's newly expanded stores in Dallas and Denver, future stores, both new and expanded, will cluster around 4,000 to 6,000 square feet where the brand can offer a wider, more representative range of Free People product.
Turning to direct. In order to drive additional direct and omnichannel sales, we will continue to make investments in technology, marketing and new infrastructure. Consumer's expectations continue to rise with regard to functionality and experience in the direct and omnichannel worlds. She wants to shop any time, any place and on any device and have an equally compelling and seamless experience. She wants product information, including when it's available and where it is, in the size she needs. Once her purchase is made, she expects her shipments fast and free, delivered where and when it's most convenient for her.
To live up to these expectations, we are in the process of improving our functionality around checkout, payment, search, inventory visibility and speed on all of our brands' web platforms. Additional site functionality that is scheduled to be rolled out later this year includes in-store pickup, ship through store and enhanced mobile application capability. Other technology investments this year include new software to mine our current data and provide our brand teams with more predictive analytics to improve demand forecasting for purchasing and allocation and new programs that will allow for better customer segmentation and personalization.
The final element of our growth strategy is geographic expansion. If our store count is approaching full penetration in North America, certainly the same cannot be said for other areas of the world. International expansion provides an exciting and fertile opportunity for all 3 brands. Almost 90% of our sales still come from North America, and yet only 30% of overall sales in the developed world comes from our region. This implies we could triple sales if we could match global penetration to that which we enjoy in North America.
There are many robust markets in Asia and Mid-East where our brands have almost no distribution and still many in Europe that are untapped or underpenetrated. We already sell and ship to over 130 different countries through the Internet. In order to increase our international penetration and help augment the DTC business, we will begin to utilize our other channels of distribution. Different countries, however, will have different approaches, ranging from self-owned and operated stores to concessions and traditional wholesale arrangements to licensing and partnership relationships. Developing the global expansion strategy, which countries to enter first and what structure to use will be a top priority for David in his newly announced role. He will discuss his vision for that role shortly.
In conclusion, despite many macro headwinds and a lull in new fashion trend, our brands have done well and remain highly desirable and competitive. We have successfully developed many new and expanded product categories that complement our core apparel businesses. Customers responded positively in these categories across all of our brands and channels. We believe each brand has significant growth opportunities to more fully develop these categories and reach many new customers in areas beyond North America.
Now before turning the call over to questions, I would like to make 2 personnel announcements. First, it's my pleasure to announce that Trish Donnelly has been promoted to the role of CEO of the Urban Outfitters Group. In this role, she will be responsible for overseeing the brand across all channels and geographies. Trish joined Urban Outfitters brand as North American President 2 years ago and has done a terrific job of moving the brand forward and navigating the brand through some very choppy waters.
Additionally, as previously announced, David McCreight has been promoted and will assume the role of President of URBN. In addition to his current responsibility as CEO of the Anthropologie Group, David will now also oversee strategic international development and global direct-to-consumer initiatives for URBN.
David, perhaps you can discuss your vision for this new role?"

I'd like to thank you, Meg and the leadership team for the support in becoming President of URBN. I believe our portfolio of global lifestyle brands contains some of the strongest, most differentiated brands in the industry. And while continuing the Anthropologie Group's growth will remain my main priority, I am excited by the opportunities to help shape URBN's strategy for DTC and international expansion. We are in an environment where the pace of soft and hardware innovation has engendered more and evolving ways to shape brands. And with the point of influence and transactions shifting, it makes sense that we align our resources across brands to ensure that our investment are strategic and coordinated.
Of course, the brands will remain the customer and creative experts, but well executed. This approach will help the brands and URBN perform at an even higher level, with greater resources than if each brand were researching and investing on their own.
Regarding our geographic distribution, we plan to more aggressively expand all channels and brands into underdeveloped markets globally, explore launching new digital platforms, opening stores, creating partnerships or entering into licensing agreements for our brands and products in regions and countries where we have little or no presence currently.
While the plan is still being developed and similar to the DTC initiative, I will be hiring a leader to help us coordinate activities in a new and more impactful way across all brands. I look forward to updating you on our progress with these important initiatives over the coming season. Thank you."

As it relates to merch margin opportunity for the full year, I think we're going to defer on talking about the full year right now as we enter into the first quarter. The fourth quarter is an awful long way away. As of right now, it is obviously very early in the quarter, but we have seen some improvement in our business from where the quarter started. We did -- we do believe with the strength of the Urban Outfitters business and how that business is trending right now that we do believe we can drive gross profit margin improvement in the first quarter through improved markdowns or lower markdown rate at the Urban Outfitters brand, which we think would more than offset some risks in a higher markdown rate at the Free People brand. And as it relates to the Anthropologie brand, right now, we are starting to see some early reads, some improving women's apparel and women's accessories business. And we do think that their maintained margin could be flat to even slightly better in the first quarter. Also, there's a lot of moving pieces in there. You've got store occupancy that could continue to deleverage if store comp remains negative. You've got deleverage related to delivery expense as the direct-to-consumer channel continues to increase in overall penetration. With all of that being said, those things happened in the fourth quarter. And had it not been for the impairment charges that we recorded in the fourth quarter, we would have had over 50 basis points of improvement in our gross profit margin in our most recent quarter. And we think we can do something similar in the first quarter this year."

Meg, Barb and the merchant team at Anthropologie have done a good job, starting to make traction with the new approaches. As Meg mentioned earlier, the concept-to-customer approach. We are seeing nice movement in dresses. That being said, we're still early stages, and we want to see the rest of the offer round out. We are seeing some interesting reads as it relates to fashion and her appetite for specialness. We're selling even higher quantities than we've recognized before when the product's right. We are working on our inventory management. We've had several years of good inventory management, and we still believe there's more opportunity in the future to improve margins there.

It's still very early in the season, but we are seeing some interesting reads that help us look towards the back half of spring and early fall.

We spent a lot of time at Vision 20|20 talking about the different concepts that we were going to expand and enlarge, and we have done that. And the reaction with the customer has been, I think, extraordinarily strong. We think that there's lots of opportunity to develop it further. And to that end, if you recall, we talked about the importance of having an omnichannel strategy because not only did we want to have larger stores that house some of these enlarged concepts, but we wanted those stores to be marketing vehicles to help drive traffic to the web. And as we put these enhanced concepts and categories up online, we have seen exactly that happen. I think nowhere have we seen a better example of this than at Free People. Free People's apparel sales probably have been slowing for the better part of 2 years. And they continue to have great comps because their other categories are really doing quite well. And that's intimates. The shoes are doing extremely well. And now we're pretty confident the movement is going to start taking some of that -- those sales and pushing them forward as well. So it was a strategy that not only talked about how we're going to grow, but it was a strategy to spread some of the risks in case there were issues around any one of our larger categories. And as it turns out, I think we didn't know that this was going to happen. But as it turns out, I think it was the right play because there are -- what we just went through over the last 12 months has been a fairly significant downturn, or as I called it, a lull in the fashion apparel business. I don't expect that to continue. I've seen it happen before. I've seen it come out, and I think it will come out at some point in the future, but I think it's very good that we embarked on these expanded categories."

So as it relates to IMU, I think both the Urban and the Anthropologie brand exited the fourth quarter with nice opportunity for -- to drive some improvement in IMU. I think both those brands working with Barbara Rozsas and the rest of our sourcing team have seen some nice gains in some of the work that they've done around making sure that we're capturing the commodity pricing deflation that's going on as well as working through some of our near-sourcing opportunities in order to put some speed into -- some additional speed into our supply chain. It's something that I think that we're certainly very proud of. I think we ended the year 1 week faster from a supply chain perspective than we were a year ago. And being able to put that speed into the supply chain is something that's critically important to us. And be able to do it while we're still showing IMU gains, I think, is a testament to a lot of the work that has been done. And we think we can continue to show some IMU improvement into fiscal '17. As it relates to store capital -- or as it relates to total capital, the number for fiscal '17 is a little bit higher than what we had originally anticipated. We had about $10 million push out from the current year into the upcoming year. And that number is largely driven to some closeout payments and some additional work that is needed to be done to finish out our East Coast fulfillment center. The remaining capital is primarily dedicated to the new store growth as well as our expanded stores to support the larger format at both Anthropologie and Free People. As you know, we repurchased 15 million shares in fiscal '16. We have 7.3 million shares remaining on our current authorization. And as free cash flow exists, as you spoke to, we do have some cash, obviously, remaining on our balance sheet as well as the opportunity within our revolver to flex up and down when we see appropriate. We do anticipate continuing with the share repurchase in fiscal '17, but this is not something that will be linear. We'll do it at times where we feel appropriate and we have enough free cash flow to be comfortable doing so."

So do you think apparel will become less than half of mix as you think about 5 to 10 years? And then the second question, just a quick follow-up on digital. Omnichannel, you've been really good at omnichannel penetration and also the visual presentation inside your stores. What percentage of your digital orders will be fulfilled, leveraging your store network, either by BOPIS or ship from store? At competitors, it's coming up between 20% to 40%.

Oliver, I think in terms of the long-term positioning of apparel, David always talks about the fact that his customer in the Anthropologie brand spends just as much money on home as she does on apparel. So I guess the way we look at it is we have no reason to believe that home can't be as large as apparel. Now of course, when you take a look at a brand like Urban, that's certainly not true. So it's a very -- a customer that travels around a lot and moves quite a bit, she's much less -- typically spends much less money on home. So I think apparel would still be one of the bigger areas of her spend. So I can't give you exact numbers, but I would say at the Anthropologie brand, there's no reason to believe that apparel couldn't be somewhere around the 50% to even possibly below that. I would expect the Urban brand to still remain above the 50%. And with Free People, I think it's still above 50% and above would still be the place that I would put apparel. I'm going to have to get back to you on your second question on the omnichannel. I have to tell you that I really don't have a good handle right now. We've done some experimentation, and we found that ship to store is going to be a very good thing for us. Anthropologie was testing it before the holiday -- or during the holiday season, but they didn't call it out on their site. And so we really don't have good information right now, and I'd hate to speculate."

Now having said that, apparel still usually or typically sells faster than home. So the sales per square foot are better. And therefore, you usually have better operating margins with apparel than you do with home. I guess we don't look at the world like that. We look at the world like when is the opportunity for us to please our customer? When is our opportunity to drive the top line? Let's be as good as we possibly can be in items -- the products that we produce and how she will respond to them.

Well, as Dick said, we went through 13 consecutive quarters of positive comps. So Free People had a great ride. And it was bound to come to end at some point, and the end, I believe, has come with the fashion shift, which Dick has talked about.

So when you have a change in fashion and when it's bottom driven, it really affects the top business. So we're seeing the top business affected with this. We are seeing great signs of life in the new fashion. I'm very excited about what Free People had and where we're going with these new ideas. It's just not resonating with the total customer base.

And then we have the others that have enough of that in their wardrobe that are looking for the new ideas. And I'm extremely excited about new ideas. And I'm optimistic that she will come around, and we'll be able to convert across all of our customers. In terms of how long that will take, when we went through this before, when we went from a wider leg to a skinny leg, it took some time. In fact, we tried skinny leg probably for 1.5 years to 2 years before she finally started to take it on. And we were really one of the first brands to adopt with a big over a skinny. So again, pioneering with the fashion. And I believe that Free People will come back and the customer will be able to adopt all these new fashion changes. Thank you."

We haven't acted on it, but that's not to say we won't act on it. As far as the fashion lull, I think it's pretty clear that the fashion is going through a change right now, and I think it's a fashion silhouette change. We've been with big over little now for the better part of 10 years, and I think it's nearing the end of its life cycle. And when that happens, there's often a lot of staleness or slowness in the innovation in the fashion world. People lack sort of the excitement and inspiration because a number of people are still with the old fashion, as Meg talked about. Some people are with the new fashion, and some people just sort of check out altogether because they don't know what to do. I think that, that is always a predictable -- what happens predictably at the bottom of the cycle. As the new fashion is born and starts to catch on, there's a point at which the innovation starts to ramp up, and there's tremendous amount of excitement that surrounds the newness. When that happens, the sales -- typically, if we follow that fashion and give it to her the way she wants it, the sales take off. So in the in-between period, the business is a little tougher. At the very end of the cycle, the business is very slow. And then when it starts to pick up, the business picks up quite rapidly. How long it's going to take to get through that cycle, I really can't tell you. I do see an awful lot of signs out there that would suggest to me that, that cycle has begun. And certainly, we all here hope that it's sooner than later."

I'll begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 first quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share some of our thoughts concerning our second quarter and the remainder of fiscal year",1191,"Thank you, Oona. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 first quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share some of our thoughts concerning our second quarter and the remainder of fiscal year 2017. 
Total company for URBN sales for the first quarter increased by 3% to a first quarter record of $763 million. This sales increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a 16% increase in Wholesale segment sales and a $9.5 million increase in noncomp sales, including the opening of 2 net new stores in the quarter and sales from the newly-acquired Vetri Family restaurants. Please note that unlike many other retailers, we are not on a 4 5 4 calendar and, therefore, our fiscal 2017 first quarter did benefit from an extra day versus the prior comparable period resulting from leap year. 
Within our Retail segment comps, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting a double-digit sales increase driven by an increase in sessions while conversion rate was flat and average order value lightly decreased. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and average unit selling price, while units per transaction were flat. 
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 2% at Urban Outfitters, was flat at the Anthropologie Group and was down 2% at Free People. Our URBN Retail segment comp was fairly consistent each month, with March being the strongest and April being the weakest. 
Free People Wholesale segment sales delivered another strong quarter as sales rose 16% to $62 million. These results came from double-digit growth in specialty and department store doors. 
Total URBN gross profit for the quarter increased 6% to $262 million. Gross profit rate improved by 100 basis points to 34.3%. The improvement in gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvement in the Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie Group brands' maintained margins, with Urban Outfitters delivering significantly lower markdowns versus the previous year. Partially offsetting these improvements was a lower gross profit rate at the Free People brand primarily driven by lower maintained margins due to higher markdowns to clear slow-moving product. 
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 9% to $211 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 155 [ph] basis points to 27.%. This SG&A deleverage was primarily due to an increase in marketing expense to support our customer acquisition and retention efforts, deleveraging direct store controllable expenses related to negative store comps and an increase in technology-related expenses used to support our omnichannel initiatives. 
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 5% to $50 million with operating profit margin deleveraging by 55 basis points to 6.6%. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was 39.6% compared to 35.6% in the prior year. This increase is due to the ratio of certain foreign losses to global taxable profits in the first quarter. We are still planning our annual effective tax rate to be approximately 37% for the year and believe our fourth quarter tax rate will be lower than the annual plan tax rate. 
Net income for the quarter was $29.6 million or $0.25 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory  decreased by 10% to $360 million. The reduction in inventory is due to a 10% reduction in Retail segment comp inventory at cost. The decrease in Retail segment comp inventory is due to improved inventory planning and control as the business continues to work towards managing to a lower reads of supply. The reduction of inventory is not necessarily predictive of future sales growth as we are currently doing a nice job of getting faster turns out of our inventory as shown over previous quarters. We ended the quarter with $306 million in cash and marketable securities. 
During the quarter, the company repurchased and retired 325,000, common shares for $11 million. We've repurchased and retired a total of 15 million common shares in fiscal year 2016 for $465 million. We have 7 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors share repurchase authorization. Additionally, during the first [ph] quarter, we paid down $75 million of our outstanding revolver, leaving $75 million currently outstanding. 
As we enter the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 24 net new stores for the year, excluding our food and beverage division. For the second quarter, we are planning 6 new Free People stores in North America, 2 new Anthropologie stores in North America and 1 new Urban Outfitters store in Europe. For the year, we are planning on opening 4 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe; 8 net new Anthropologie stores, including 2 in Europe; and 12 net new Free People stores. Additionally, we are expanding or relocating 4 existing Anthropologie stores in support of our new Anthropologie store format. As David McCreight will soon speak to you about, these expanded format stores gives us a tremendous opportunity to please the customer more with a broader assortment in categories like home, beauty and intimates as well as the BHLDN wedding brand and the Terrain outdoor living brand. We are also planning to opening 3 new Vetri pizzerias and 1 café adjacent to an Anthropologie large format. 
URBN's gross margin rate for the second quarter could improve slightly versus the prior year. This improvement could come from improved maintained margin driven largely by the Urban Outfitters brand, which could be partially offset by a maintained margin decline at the Free People brand to clear through slow-moving product. This improvement would require the current May sales trend to recover closer to where we are forecasting our business for the second quarter. Quarter to date, May sales have started out slower than what we delivered for the first quarter and slower than what we had originally planned at each of our brands. 
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at the high end of a low single-digit rate for the second quarter. This increase will be driven by direct-to-consumer channel investments related to marketing and technology as well as store-related expenses to support our square footage growth, which is planned at approximately 5% for fiscal 2017. For the year, we believe SG&A could grow at a high mid-single-digit rate with the third quarter potentially coming in higher than the annual rate due to some large incentive compensation reversals in the prior year. 
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $170 [ph] million, with approximately $10 million moving from fiscal 2016 into fiscal '17. The total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Finally, our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 37%. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast, but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements. 
Now it's my pleasure to pass the call over to David McCreight, CEO of the Anthropologie Group and President of URBN."

I will begin by commentary with highlights from the first quarter Anthropologie Group performance and then provide a review of our long-term strategic growth initiatives. The Anthropologie Group delivered fl",1580,"Thank you, Frank, and good evening, everyone. I will begin by commentary with highlights from the first quarter Anthropologie Group performance and then provide a review of our long-term strategic growth initiatives. 
The Anthropologie Group delivered flat Retail segment comparable sales for the quarter along with improved merchandise margins compared to the first quarter of last year. Strong double-digit growth in the expanded categories like home, beauty, intimates, Terrain and BHLDN helped to drive these results and were partially offset by declines in certain apparel categories. Although much has been written about the broad weakness in the apparel category, we believe we have the opportunity regardless of industry trends to improve the appeal of our assortment and find ways to delight her. 
As discussed on previous calls, the Anthropologie apparel merchant and design team has been implementing new processes and procedures designed to provide more structure around the concept to customer approach, shorten the design calendar, reduce overall weeks of supply and improve product accuracy. These changes, modeled after Meg's excellent work within the Free People and Urban Outfitters merchant and design organizations, will emphasize key looks, offer better fabric variety, elevated decoration and a more strategic edit, which will be supported by improved in-store and digital presentations. In this past quarter, the most complete example of the concept-to-customer approach was applied to one of our key apparel categories, dresses. We expanded the choices available in stores, created dress shops in 75 locations, built digital stories and mailed journal focused on this category. Response to this distorted dress category outpaced our expectation with double-digit regular price comps in both stores and online. Additionally, during the quarter, our own brand apparel penetration increased significantly and we experienced strong sellthroughs in some items well above historical performance, giving us confidence on this approach. 
As often occurs in transition periods, it will take some time for the design merchant and planning teams to coalesce around our new approach, but we are encouraged by the early steps and see progress and how the apparel team is working together on future deliveries. Throughout the quarter, we took markdowns less appealing spring apparel and exited the first quarter leaner than where we would have liked to be. Based on our learnings from spring, we chased into what the customer responded to and look forward to the arrival of deliveries later this month. 
Moving on to the successes we have experienced over the last year in our expansion categories, including home, accessories, beauty, BHLDN and Terrain. You may recall, I often refer to the tremendous opportunity the Anthropologie Group has to grow our brand by capturing share of her spend in adjacent categories and services. Our vision has been to grow within our current customers life stage and interest by strategically expanding into specific categories based on her purchase behavior. We have spoken to you about the investments and the teams, marketing and delivery mechanisms in order to grow existing categories as well as to expand into these new categories. We have built a structure within the Anthropologie Group where these categories have become distinct businesses under the brand umbrella. A short year and a half since our Analyst Day, I remain just as convinced and even more excited about achieving the goal of doubling the group's revenue. 
One of the largest contributors to our future growth plans is the home opportunity. Entering the home team's efforts across product, aesthetics, sourcing and marketing have been very well received by our customers. Each season, we have refined our aesthetic and tailored our offer. Successful inroads have been made into each of our target rooms and categories. We are steadily adapting our digital experience to the needs of the home shopper. The spring home journal that you received in March was our best to date, both in terms of product assortment and creative execution. Units per order and average order value continue to climb. The response from our customers has given us momentum towards fall, where we will launch our largest home offer ever, including a journal with more than 200 pages supported with digital marketing. 
Similar to home, the accessories category was an untapped opportunity to build a deeper and more diverse relationship with the Anthropologie customer. We were aware of her level of spend and we knew we have permission to participate in these categories. The right shopping experience and offer will present us with the ability to capture a greater share. While the assortment is still developing, we've seen positive response to our new deliveries in shoes and jewelry, and we believe it will continue to show significant growth. 
Another successful category expansion launch has been Catherine and her team's efforts in building a beauty business. While in the early days of development, we are ahead of where we are expected to be at this stage. We're seeing fascinating trends in her response to our shopping experience and assortment. We continue to seek out unique offerings that appeal to her sensibilities and needs in skincare, color and fragrance. Based on the customers' positive response to our beauty shops within stores, we will be expanding this concept to over 120 communities this summer and look forward to further emphasis on beauty on our digital and social messaging. 
Rounding out our category expansion, our 2 brands, BHLDN and Terrain. Both brands have been built around a unique and appealing product and experience. From helping make a special moment in someone's life more special to tapping into the Gardens' inspirational seasonal change, both brands are delivering a remarkably engaging experience to new and current customers. These efforts, when coupled with the synergies of the Anthropologie Group, have accelerated their growth. 
The momentum of all of these categories and brand expansions has been achieved mostly through existing store base and direct-to-consumer channels. We believe to capture the full opportunity and reach the goal of doubling our revenue, we need to bring more of these products to her. As discussed over 18 months ago, in addition to a web presence, we needed to create an in-store experience to support these categories. The goal is to provide enough representation of the expanded assortments to become a destination for in-store purchases, while driving her online where she can shop the broader assortment, successfully measured be measured by activating a larger assortment online so that the combined store and digital spend at the surrounding area grows. We are proud to announce that during the first quarter, we opened our first 2 expanded footprint locations. The first in Portland, followed by Newport Beach. These locations are expansions of existing stores that now have approximately 2.5x more square footage than the typical Anthropologie store. This larger footprint provides us with the ability to present a broader offering in the expanded categories, including a petite shop, expanded jewelry and accessories and intimates boutique, an 800 square foot beauty shop, a full service shoe salon as well as over 6,000 square feet of home. Additionally, we have dramatically reduced the back of house in these locations to maximize the selling space and are supporting them with more frequent replenishments. 
I was in each market before, during and after the reopenings to observe and evaluate the concept. I can tell you in my almost 30 years in retail, I have never seen such an enthusiastic customer response. She is traveling a greater distance, spending a longer time shopping in the store, shopping across multiple categories. We've seen this behavior from new, reactivated and existing customers. Average order value is up, units per transaction have increased sales are exceeding our expectations. Even if the supporting data and results were not enough already to provide positive indication around proof-of-concept, one only  needed to see the looks on our customers' faces or overhear their comments while gleefully shopping the new concept to know that we're headed in the right direction. And remember, many of these assortments are still developing. I do hope you have the chance, Oona said, to watch the video available on our Investor Relations website of these stores. Our plans are to open 4 or more locations over the next 12 months. These locations will range from 20 to over 30,000 square feet and some will include Terrain, BHLDN and a dining experience. 
Now for a quick update on my new role as President of URBN. As mentioned on the last call, continuing the growth of Anthropologie Group remains my key focus. But I am happy to report that since last we spoke, we have hired a leader for our international expansion plans. The new leadership role will be field by Stefan LeBon, who will join us this summer.  Stefan brings with them decades of experience expanding U.S. brand footprints in new markets across the world. He is highly respected by those that have worked with him and we expect he will be a key strategic partner in growing the reach of our brands. 
In closing, we believe we are headed in the right direction. We have a bold strategy for future growth. We have a line of sight energizing the apparel business and expanded category strategy of material scale that is ahead of schedule and early confirmation from our customers on the new expanded format stores. I would like to thank Dick, Meg and thousands of the numbers that make URBN such a creative and dynamic environment to work. 
I will now pass the call over to Dick."

Both stores look amazing and customer response has been incredible. Sales in all categories of those stores are significantly ahead of plan and customers have responded especially well to the expanded shoe and home assortments. It's hard to over emphasize how important these results are for the future of the brand and the company. Sales and testimonials have affirmed our strategy of giving our customer more choices and more product categories both in-store and online. It certainly gives us confidence to expand more stores across the U.S. These exceptional shopping experiences require well-orchestrated teamwork to create. So David, I thank you and the entire Anthropologie and shared service teams for a job very well done. 
Next, let me discuss the Free People brand. As we've repeated many times, the Free People brand has also benefited from expanding this product categories. And like its sister brands, Free People has also seen success in opening expanded stores. Last year, Free People opened stores in Dallas and Denver with 5,000 square feet of selling space. These replaced smaller stores in both markets. The extra space was used to house expanded assortments of intimates, shoes, party dresses and FP Movement. Customer response to these additional categories has been very positive, and the brand intends to expand more of its smaller stores in select markets. 
While expansion categories continue to perform well in the first quarter across all channels, response at retail to the core Free People apparel assortment was disappointing. The issue was less about having the correct fashion and more about having the correct distortion. The Free People merchant team played Q1 too safe and distorted thereby more to the norm than to the new. Customers clearly wanted the new. As a result, total Retail segment comps in the quarter retreated by 2%. In addition, the team failed to react quickly enough to the retail sales missed to plan, so inventories grew and additional markdowns had to be taken. 
On a more positive note, wholesale channel sales grew by 16% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Sales to both specialty and department store customers registered solid double-digit gains and all categories generated increases. Once again, expansion categories grew the fastest. 
Current wholesale bookings remain positive on a like-for-like basis, but the brand plans to manage future wholesale inventories more tightly, given the current market turbulence. The team, therefore, anticipates good, but somewhat slower wholesale channel growth for the remainder of the year. 
In summary, after producing stellar results for 12 [ph] consecutive quarters, first quarter results of the Free People brand were good, but not outstanding. I believe the team will make adjustments, including more rigorous inventory control and, over the next few quarters will once again realize the kinds results we have come to expect from this fashion leader. I think Meg, Sheila, Dave and their teams for their hard work and look forward to watching the progress of the brand this year. 
Turning now to the Urban Outfitters brand. I'm happy to report that the rebuilding initiatives that began 2.5 years ago are now firmly established and driving positive results. For the quarter, total Retail segment comp sales increased in both North America and Europe. Please keep in mind that the brand remains highly promotional in the first quarter of last year. In Q1 this year, regular price sales rose more than 6% on a comp basis, more than enough to offset the double-digit decrease in markdown sales. By category, women's apparel was strong; accessories gained momentum throughout the quarter; and the expanded categories, intimates, beauty, shoes, home decor, electronics and entertainment, all excelled. 
Comps sales of men's apparel and accessories were still negative in the quarter, but made steady progress as the quarter progressed. 
While delivering better comp and strong regular price sales, the brand also realized improved IMU in the lowest quarterly markdown rate in the past 10 years, which is as far back as our electronic records go. Together, these factors created hundreds of basis points of merchandise margin improvement, and the inventory on the weeks of supply basis was the leanest it's been in years, and merchandise scheduled to arrive in the second quarter shows additional IMU improvement. Thus, the team is enthusiastic about the opportunity to continue to deliver better merchandise margins in the second quarter and beyond. 
During the quarter, the store teams further refined the shop-in-shop concepts to more accurately align product demand and space allocation. The shops also provided an easier shopping experience and clear messaging for the customer. I believe the Urban stores look better and fresher today than they have in many years. Better product and better in-store experiences combined to drive improved conversion, and fell just short of overcoming the high single-digit decline in store traffic we experienced in Q1. Meanwhile, all metrics in the direct-to-consumer channel to remain positive. Sales and number of orders showed double-digit increases, while sessions, AOB and conversion posted strong gains as well. Across both channels, the teams were able to create compelling brand marketing messages, which led to increased omnichannel counts across all customer groups, new, active and reactivated. 
In summary, the Urban team has made excellent progress in reinvigorating the brand over the last 2.5 years. Customers are responding to better product that has less redundancy within assortments; better product distortion by item, class and category; clear and more appropriate marketing with better imagery and a bigger social media presence; and cleaner, less cluttered stores that house a number of clearly defined shop-in-shop. These customer-facing improvements were accomplished by better back of house processes, more teamwork across functions, either controls, and in some instances, better now then. While everyone recognizes there is still much to be accomplished, tremendous effort on the part of the entire team has succeeded in turning this brand around. Congratulations to Trish, Meg and the teams on both sides of the Atlantic for orchestrating this success. I look forward to seeing continued progress in the quarters ahead. 
Now let me say a few words about our customers' spending habits across all brands and what it means to URBN. For many years now, we've repeated that the direct consumer channel and certain product and service categories such as home growth, intimates, beauty, entertainment and dining out, our growth in capturing a larger share of our customers won. As with the apparel category, I believe she is still buying approximately the same number of items per year, but because of unit price deflation, for total annual spend on apparel is down on a year-over-year basis. This has been true for a number of years am a and the continued in the first quarter this year. As a result, we believe it's important for URBN to continue to invest in the following areas: Larger assortment and in higher penetration of proprietary products in all categories especially in the into expanded once, new and enhanced capabilities, including better marketing to support the rapidly growing and changing direct consumer channel; more technology to better know when understand the customer and allow for more efficient operations; expand the stores to house the large assortment of nonapparel product; and controlled international growth, utilizing all of our channels of distribution. These investments are and will be focused in the areas of merchant and creative design talent, technology capabilities, both hard and soft marketing, logistics and data analytics. 
There has been much written lately about the changes in our industry, so allow me to offer some thoughts about the macro environment in which we operate. Obviously, the retail industry is going through a rather painful period of rationalization. Rarely have I read so many negative articles about our industry. Unlike much of what has been written, I don't believe the customers are the problem. I think our customer is in relatively good shape. The problem as I see it is more of a supply issue, especially in the apparel category. Simply put, America is overstored and overstocked. We have approximately 10x more retail space per capita than our European counterparts and more direct-to-consumer choices, too. Rather than try to differentiate their products and experiences, many retailers try to drive demand by offering constant and ever larger price promotions that erode not just the bottom line, but brand equity as well. When that isn't enough, companies are closing stores in an attempt to rightsize their fleet. The URBN brands have invested heavily in the creative talent to make our products and shopping experiences unique and compelling, so demand isn't dependent solely on price-driven promotions. The success of the Anthropologie larger format stores is one example of how to win through creativity. Also, fortunately for us, we have always been cautious, some have argued paranoid, about overpenetrating our brands. The careful, deliberate manner by which we grew the store base of all of our brands now serves as well. There are few markets in which we have store redundancy. Our brands were early direct consumer adopters and while we continue to invest more in electronic shopping capabilities, we also strongly believe that bricks is synergistic with clicks, and that the well conceived and executed store strategy is a powerful competitive advantage. Another advantage for our URBN brands is that most of our offerings consist of unique products. This is increasingly important in the age of comparison shopping via the Internet.  
Finally, the URBN retail cards have always been about offering an eclectic mix of multiple categories. Today, we're emphasizing this feature more than ever. Of course, the complexity and cost to our business model, but we do it because our customers respond positively, it differentiates our brands and it gives us flexibility to promote or demote categories as customer demand changes over time. For these reasons, I believe our brands are strategically well-positioned to weather the current turbulence. AS is true in any business, the best concepts are worthless without the right people to drive and execute them. I believe our teams are among the strongest and most creative in the industry and feel quite confident they will continue to deliver attractive results. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I extend my thanks and deep appreciation to all URBN Associates around the world, and I thank our shareholders for their continued support. 
Now I'll turn the call over for your questions."

And I'm going to attribute that as far as I can tell to weather. If you  had -- I had to say which -- whether the 3 biggest are, I'd say weather, weather and weather, and the follow-up reason to that might be the calendar. As you heard us say before, we're a 4 5 4 -- not a 4 5 4 reporter, we're a monthly reporter. And as a result, we lost 1 Saturday in May. That's a big deal right now. It probably cost us about 2.5% in comp. But as the quarter goes on, that becomes negligible and will become meaningless. So we're not at all concerned about that. I would direct you to the weather in the first week of May. We had 6 out of 7 days of rain here in the mid-Atlantic and temperatures were somewhere between 10 and 20 degrees below normal. The differential that we're seeing between the comps on the West Coast where the weather's behave relatively normally, and the East Coast where it's been atrocious, is up to almost 1,000 basis points, which is extremely unusual. So we believe that's 1 sign. Another sign is that up until, say, mid-April, the comps at the Urban brand in Europe versus North America were basically comparable. And then Europe warmed up and basically got the weather that we usually get, sunny and dry and warm, unusual for London. And we got typical London weather, cool and rainy. We saw at that point a very large diversion between the comps in Europe and the comps in North America. Now there are some other factors that may have played into that, but I think the weather was a big driver. And so if you were to contact me 2 weeks from now when we think we're going to get some 80-degree plus days here on the East Coast, I think I'd be in a any position to tell you where we think we're going to end up. But I can tell you that the merchants here are reasonably optimistic."

Relative to the opportunity in the second quarter, we do believe, as Dick said, if the main sales trend recovers back to something similar to what we saw in the first quarter, we can deliver gross profit margin improvement. The magnitude of that improvement will depend on where our sales trends land and where the customer delivers back from our product standpoint. That being said, I think, the drivers would be continued improvement at the Urban Outfitters brand. You're correct that they don't have the same opportunity from a markdown perspective as they've been over last several quarters, but they still absolutely have markdown opportunity. In addition to that, the Urban Outfitters brand is seeing gains in IMU as well. The Anthropologie brand, I believe, also still has opportunity. I think, the large opportunity for them in the second quarter is IMU driven and a little bit of markdown opportunity. And then as they get into the back half of this year, the Anthropologie brand starts to see a bigger markdown opportunity as you look into it from a year-over-year comparison perspective. We do believe that the Free People brand could partially offset some of those gains as they did have a little bit heavier inventory overhang and they're transitioning their products with some pressure product within the second quarter. We also do think that we could start to see some benefits from the fulfillment center as we now have closed our second -- our own facility in South Carolina completely. And we did experience the leverage in the second quarter last year related to logistics in that fulfillment center transition. That also could contribute to some gross profit margin improvement in the second quarter."

While we probably have offered some things a little bit less expensive as well, our goal has always been to have a higher level assortment where basics are offered at very sharp prices and special pieces are offered at special prices, meaning that we can get more for those things. And that's the nature of, I think, the Urban and probably the Free People customer. The Anthro customer probably has a bit less of a range of high low, but she still likes high low. So I think it's across the board. We need some sharp opening prices for some basics, and we think certainly at the Urban brand, we have those. Then we have absolutely need, it's critical to have the special pieces, the special items of those things that she really wants, and you can then price those at less competitive prices.

I'll begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 first quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share some of our thoughts concerning our second quarter and the remainder of fiscal year 2017.
Total company or URBN sales for the first quarter increased by 3% to a first quarter record of $763 million. This sales increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a 16% increase in Wholesale segment sales and a $9.5 million increase in noncomp sales, including the opening of 2 net new stores in the quarter and sales from the newly-acquired Vetri Family restaurants. Please note that unlike many other retailers, we are not on a 4-5-4 calendar, and therefore our fiscal 2017 first quarter did benefit from an extra day versus the prior comparable period resulting from leap year.
Within our Retail segment comps, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting a double-digit sales increase driven by an increase in sessions while conversion rate was flat and average order value slightly decreased. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and average unit selling price, while units per transaction were flat.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 2% at Urban Outfitters, was flat at the Anthropologie Group and was down 2% at Free People. Our URBN Retail segment comp was fairly consistent each month with March being the strongest and April being the weakest. Free People Wholesale segment sales delivered another strong quarter as sales rose 16% to $62 million. These results came from double-digit growth in specialty and department store doors.
Total URBN gross profit for the quarter increased 6% to $262 million. Gross profit rate improved by 100 basis points to 34.3%. The improvement in gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvement in the Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie Group brands' maintained margins with Urban Outfitters delivering significantly lower markdowns versus the previous year. Partially offsetting these improvements was a lower gross profit rate at the Free People brand primarily driven by lower maintained margins due to higher markdowns to clear slow-moving product.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 9% to $211 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 155 basis points to 27.7%. This SG&A deleverage was primarily due to an increase in marketing expense to support our customer acquisition and retention efforts, deleveraging direct store controllable expenses related to negative store comps and an increase in technology related expenses used to support our omnichannel initiatives.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 5% to $50 million with operating profit margin deleveraging by 55 basis points to 6.6%. Our tax rate for the quarter was 39.6% compared to 35.6% in the prior year. This increase is due to the ratio of certain foreign losses to global taxable profits in the first quarter. We are still planning our annual effective tax rate to be approximately 37% for the year and believe our fourth quarter tax rate will be lower than the annual plan tax rate. Net income for the quarter was $29.6 million or $0.25 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory decreased by 10% to $360 million. The reduction in inventory is due to a 10% reduction in Retail segment comp inventory at cost. The decrease in Retail segment comp inventory is due to improved inventory planning and control as the business continues to work towards managing to a lower reads of supply. The reduction of inventory is not necessarily predictive of future sales growth as we are currently doing a nice job of getting faster turns out of our inventory as shown over previous quarters.
We ended the quarter with $306 million in cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, the company repurchased and retired 325,000 common shares for $11 million. We repurchased and retired a total of 15 million common shares in fiscal year 2016 for $465 million. We have 7 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors' share repurchase authorization. Additionally, during the first quarter, we paid down $75 million of our outstanding revolver, leaving $75 million currently outstanding. 
As we enter the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 24 net new stores for the year, excluding our food and beverage division. For the second quarter, we are planning 6 new Free People stores in North America, 2 new Anthropologie stores in North America and 1 new Urban Outfitters store in Europe. For the year, we are planning on opening 4 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe; 8 net new Anthropologie stores, including 2 in Europe; and 12 net new Free People stores. Additionally, we are expanding or relocating 4 existing Anthropologie stores in support of our new Anthropologie store format. As David McCreight will soon speak to you about, these expanded format stores give us a tremendous opportunity to please the customer more with a broader assortment in categories like home, beauty and intimates as well as the BHLDN wedding brand and the Terrain outdoor living brand. We are also planning on opening 3 new Vetri pizzerias and 1 café adjacent to an Anthropologie large format.
URBN's gross margin rate for the second quarter could improve slightly versus the prior year. This improvement could come from improved maintained margin driven largely by the Urban Outfitters brand, which could be partially offset by a maintained margin decline at the Free People brand to clear through slow-moving product. This improvement would require the current May sales trend to recover closer to where we are forecasting our business for the second quarter. Quarter-to-date, May sales have started out slower than what we delivered for the first quarter and slower than what we had originally planned at each of our brands.
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at the high end of a low single-digit rate for the second quarter. This increase will be driven by direct-to-consumer channel investments related to marketing and technology as well as store-related expenses to support our square footage growth, which is planned at approximately 5% for fiscal 2017. For the year, we believe SG&A could grow at a high mid-single-digit rate with the third quarter potentially coming in higher than the annual rate due to some large incentive compensation reversals in the prior year.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $170 million with approximately $10 million moving from fiscal 2016 into fiscal '17. The total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Finally, our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 37%. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to David McCreight, CEO of the Anthropologie Group and President of URBN."

I will begin my commentary with highlights from the first quarter Anthropologie Group performance and then provide a review of our long-term strategic growth initiatives.The Anthropologie Group delivered fla",1583,"Thank you, Frank, and good evening, everyone. I will begin my commentary with highlights from the first quarter Anthropologie Group performance and then provide a review of our long-term strategic growth initiatives.
The Anthropologie Group delivered flat Retail segment comparable sales for the quarter along with improved merchandise margins compared to the first quarter of last year. Strong double-digit growth in the expanded categories like home, beauty, intimates, Terrain and BHLDN helped to drive these results and were partially offset by declines in certain apparel categories. Although much has been written about the broad weakness in the apparel category, we believe we have the opportunity regardless of industry trends to improve the appeal of our assortment and find ways to delight her.
As discussed on previous calls, the Anthropologie apparel merchant and design team has been implementing new processes and procedures designed to provide more structure around the concept to customer approach, shorten the design calendar, reduce overall weeks of supply and improve product accuracy. These changes, modeled after Meg's excellent work within the Free People and Urban Outfitters merchant and design organizations, will emphasize key looks, offer better fabric variety, elevated decoration and a more strategic edit, which will be supported by improved in-store and digital presentations.
In this past quarter, the most complete example of the concept to customer approach was applied to one of our key apparel categories, dresses. We expanded the choices available in stores, created dress shops in 75 locations, built digital stories and mailed a journal focused on this category. Response to this distorted dress category outpaced our expectation with double-digit regular price comps in both stores and online. Additionally, during the quarter our own brand apparel penetration increased significantly, and we experienced strong sell-throughs in some items well above historical performance, giving us confidence in this approach.
As often occurs in transition periods, it will take some time for the design merchant and planning teams to coalesce around our new approach, but we are encouraged by the early steps and see progress in how the apparel team is working together on future deliveries. Throughout the quarter, we took markdowns on less appealing spring apparel and exited the first quarter leaner than where we would have liked to be. Based on our learnings from spring, we've chased into what the customer responded to and look forward to the arrival of deliveries later this month.
Moving on to the successes we have experienced over the last year in our expansion categories, including home, accessories, beauty, BHLDN and Terrain. You may recall I often refer to the tremendous opportunity the Anthropologie Group has to grow our brand by capturing share of her spend in adjacent categories and services. Our vision has been to grow within our current customer's life stage and interest by strategically expanding into specific categories based on her purchase behavior.
We have spoken to you about the investments in the teams, marketing and delivery mechanisms in order to grow existing categories as well as to expand into these new categories. We have built a structure within the Anthropologie Group where these categories have become distinct businesses under the brand umbrella. A short 1.5 years since our Analyst Day, I remain just as convinced and even more excited about achieving the goal of doubling the group's revenue.
One of the largest contributors to our future growth plans is the home opportunity. Andrew and the home team's efforts across product, aesthetics, sourcing and marketing have been very well received by our customers. Each season, we have refined our aesthetic and tailored our offer. Successful inroads have been made into each of our target rooms and categories. We are steadily adapting our digital experience to the needs of a home shopper.
The spring home journal that you received in March was our best to date, both in terms of product assortment and creative execution. Units per order and average order value continue to climb. The response from our customers has given us momentum towards fall where we will launch our largest home offer ever, including a journal with more than 200 pages supported with digital marketing.
Similar to home, the accessories category was an untapped opportunity to build a deeper and more diverse relationship with the Anthropologie customer. We were aware of her level of spend, and we knew we have permission to participate in these categories. The right shopping experience and offer will present us with the ability to capture greater share. While the assortment is still developing, we've seen positive response to our new deliveries in shoes and jewelry, and we believe we will continue to show significant growth.
Another successful category expansion launch has been Catherine [ph] and her team's efforts in building a beauty business. While in the early days of development, we are ahead of where we're expected to be at this stage. We're seeing fascinating trends in her response to our shopping experience and assortment. We continue to seek out unique offerings that appeal to her sensibilities and needs in skincare, color and fragrance. Based on the customers' positive response to our beauty shops within stores, we will be expanding this concept to over 120 communities this summer and look forward to further emphasis on beauty in our digital and social messaging.
Rounding out our category expansions are our 2 brands, BHLDN and Terrain. Both brands have been built around a unique and appealing product and experience. From helping make a special moment in someone's life more special to tapping into the garden's inspirational seasonal change, both brands are delivering a remarkably engaging experience to new and current customers. These efforts, when coupled with the synergies of the Anthropologie Group, have accelerated their growth.
The momentum of all of these categories and brand expansions has been achieved mostly through existing store base and direct-to-consumer channels. We believe to capture the full opportunity and reach the goal of doubling our revenue, we need to bring more of these products to her. As discussed over 18 months ago, in addition to a web presence, we needed to create an in-store experience to support these categories. The goal is to provide enough representation of the expanded assortments to become a destination for in-store purchases while driving her online where she can shop the broader assortment, successfully measured by activating a larger assortment online so that the combined store and digital spend at the surrounding area grows.
We are proud to announce that during the first quarter, we opened our first 2 expanded footprint locations. The first in Portland, followed by Newport Beach. These locations are expansions of existing stores that now have approximately 2.5x more square footage than the typical Anthropologie store. This larger footprint provides us with the ability to present a broader offering in the expanded categories, including a petite shop, expanded jewelry and accessories, an intimates boutique, an 800-square-foot beauty shop, a full service shoe salon as well over 6,000 square feet of home. Additionally, we have dramatically reduced the back of house in these locations to maximize the selling space and are supporting them with more frequent replenishments.
I was in each market before, during and after the reopenings to observe and evaluate the concept. I can tell you in my almost 30 years in retail, I have never seen such an enthusiastic customer response. She is traveling a greater distance, spending a longer time shopping in the store, shopping across multiple categories. We've seen this behavior from new, reactivated and existing customers. Average order value is up, units per transaction have increased and sales are exceeding our expectations. Even if the supporting data and results were not enough already to provide positive indication around proof-of-concept, one only needed to see the looks on our customers' faces or overhear their comments while gleefully shopping the new concept to know that we're headed in the right direction. And remember, many of these assortments are still developing.
I do hope you have the chance, as Oona said, to watch the video available on our Investor Relations website of these stores. Our plans are to open 4 or more locations over the next 12 months. These locations will range from 20 to over 30,000 square feet and some will include Terrain, BHLDN and a dining experience.
Now for a quick update on my new role as President of URBN. As mentioned on the last call, continuing the growth of Anthropologie Group remains my key focus. But I am happy to report that since last we spoke, we have hired a leader for our international expansion plans. The new leadership role will be filled by Stefan Laban [ph], who will join us this summer. Stefan [ph] brings with him decades of experience expanding U.S. brand footprints in new markets across the world. He is highly respected by those that have worked with him, and we expect he will be a key strategic partner in growing the reach of our brands.
In closing, we believe we are headed in the right direction. We have a bold strategy for future growth. We have a line of sight on reenergizing the apparel business, an expanded category strategy of material scale that is ahead of schedule and early confirmation from our customers on the new expanded format stores. I would like to thank Dick, Meg and thousands of team members that make URBN such a creative and dynamic environment to work.
I will now pass the call over to Dick."

Congratulations on the Portland and Newport Beach store expansions. Both stores look amazing and customer response has been incredible.

Both stores look amazing and customer response has been incredible. Sales in all categories of those stores are significantly ahead of plan, and customers have responded especially well to the expanded shoe and home assortments.
It's hard to over emphasize how important these results are for the future of the brand and the company. Sales and testimonials have affirmed our strategy of giving our customer more choices and more product categories both in-store and online. It certainly gives us confidence to expand more stores across the U.S. These exceptional shopping experiences required well-orchestrated teamwork to create. So David, I thank you and the entire Anthropologie and shared service teams for a job very well done.
Next, let me discuss the Free People brand. As we've repeated many times, the Free People brand has also benefited from expanding these product categories. And like its sister brand, Free People has also seen success in opening expanded stores. Last year, Free People opened stores in Dallas and Denver with 5,000 square feet of selling space. These replaced smaller stores in both markets. The extra space was used to house expanded assortments of intimates, shoes, party dresses and FP Movement. Customer response to these additional categories has been very positive, and the brand intends to expand more of its smaller stores in select markets.
While expansion categories continue to perform well in the first quarter across all channels, response at retail to the core Free People apparel assortment was disappointing. The issue was less about having the correct fashion and more about having the correct distortion. The Free People merchant team played Q1 too safe and distorted their buy more to the known than to the new. Customers clearly wanted the new. As a result, total Retail segment comps in the quarter retreated by 2%. In addition, the team failed to react quickly enough to the retail sales missed to plan, so inventories grew and additional markdowns had to be taken.
On a more positive note, wholesale channel sales grew by 16% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Sales to both specialty and department store customers registered solid double-digit gains and all categories generated increases. Once again, expansion categories grew the fastest. Current wholesale bookings remain positive on a like-for-like basis, but the brand plans to manage future wholesale inventories more tightly given the current market turbulence. The team therefore anticipates good but somewhat slower wholesale channel growth for the remainder of the year.
In summary, after producing stellar results for 12 consecutive quarters, first quarter results of the Free People brand were good but not outstanding. I believe the team will make adjustments, including more rigorous inventory control and over the next few quarters will once again realize the kind of results we have come to expect from this fashion leader. I thank Meg, Sheila, Dave and their teams for their hard work and look forward to watching the progress of the brand this year.
Turning now to the Urban Outfitters brand. I'm happy to report that the rebuilding initiatives that began 2.5 years ago are now firmly established and driving positive results. For the quarter, total Retail segment comp sales increased in both North America and Europe. Please keep in mind that the brand remained highly promotional in the first quarter last year. In Q1 this year, regular price sales rose more than 6% on a comp basis, more than enough to offset the double-digit decrease in markdown sales. By category, women's apparel was strong; accessories gained momentum throughout the quarter; and the expanded categories, intimates, beauty, shoes, home decor, electronics and entertainment, all excelled. Comp sales of men's apparel and accessories were still negative in the quarter, but made steady progress as the quarter progressed.
While delivering better comp and strong regular price sales, the brand also realized improved IMU and the lowest quarterly markdown rate in the past 10 years, which is as far back as our electronic records go. Together these factors created hundreds of basis points of merchandise margin improvement. Ending inventory on a weeks of supply basis was the leanest it's been in years, and merchandise scheduled to arrive in the second quarter shows additional IMU improvement. Thus, the team is enthusiastic about the opportunity to continue to deliver better merchandise margins in the second quarter and beyond.
During the quarter, the store teams further refined the shop-in-shop concepts to more accurately align product demand and space allocation. The shops also provided an easier shopping experience and clearer messaging for the customer. I believe the Urban stores look better and fresher today than they have in many years. Better product and better in-store experiences combined to drive improved conversion and fell just short of overcoming the high mid-single-digit decline in store traffic we experienced in Q1.
Meanwhile, all metrics in the direct-to-consumer channel remained positive. Sales and number of orders showed double-digit increases, while sessions, AOV and conversion posted strong gains as well. Across both channels, the teams were able to create compelling brand marketing messages, which led to increased omnichannel accounts across all customer groups: new, active and reactivated.
In summary, the Urban team has made excellent progress in reinvigorating the brand over the last 2.5 years. Customers are responding to better product that has less redundancy within assortments; better product distortion by item, class and category; clear and more appropriate marketing with better imagery and a bigger social media presence; and cleaner, less cluttered stores that house a number of clearly defined shop-in-shops. These customer-facing improvements were accomplished by better back of house processes, more teamwork across functions, tighter controls and in some instances, better talent.
While everyone recognizes there is still much to be accomplished, tremendous effort on the part of the entire team has succeeded in turning this brand around. Congratulations to Trish, Meg and the teams on both sides of the Atlantic for orchestrating this success. I look forward to seeing continued progress in the quarters ahead.
Now let me say a few words about our customer spending habits across all brands and what it means to URBN. For many years now, we've repeated that the direct-to-consumer channel and certain product and service categories, such as home goods, intimates, beauty, entertainment and dining out, are growing and capturing a larger share of our customer's wallet. As for the apparel category, I believe she is still buying approximately the same number of items per year. But because of unit price deflation, her total annual spend on apparel is down on a year-over-year basis. This has been true for a number of years and it continued in the first quarter this year.
As a result, we believe it's important for URBN to continue to invest in the following areas: larger assortment and a higher penetration of proprietary products in all categories especially in the expanded ones; new and enhanced capabilities, including better marketing, to support the rapidly growing and changing direct-to-consumer channel; more technology to better know and understand the customer and allow for more efficient operations; expanding stores to house the larger assortments of non-apparel product; and controlled international growth, utilizing all of our channels of distribution. These investments are and will be focused in the areas of merchant and creative design talent, technology capabilities, both hard and soft marketing, logistics and data analytics.
There has been much written lately about the changes in our industry, so allow me to offer some thoughts about the macro environment in which we operate. Obviously, the retail industry is going through a rather painful period of rationalization. Rarely have I read so many negative articles about our industry. Unlike much of what has been written, I don't believe the customer is the problem. I think our customer is in relatively good shape. The problem, as I see it, is more of a supply issue, especially in the apparel category.
Simply put, America is overstored and overstocked. We have approximately 10x more retail space per capita than our European counterparts and more direct-to-consumer choices, too. Rather than try to differentiate their products and experiences, many retailers try to drive demand by offering constant and ever larger price promotions that erode not just the bottom line but brand equity as well. When that isn't enough, companies start closing stores in an attempt to rightsize their fleets.
The URBN brands have invested heavily in creative talent to make our products and shopping experiences unique and compelling so demand isn't dependent solely on price-driven promotions. The success of the Anthropologie larger format stores is one example of how to win through creativity. Also, fortunately for us, we have always been cautious, some have argued paranoid, about overpenetrating our brands. The careful, deliberate manner by which we grew the store base of all of our brands now serves us well.
There are few markets in which we have store redundancy. Our brands were early direct-to-consumer adopters. And while we continue to invest more in electronic shopping capabilities, we also strongly believe that bricks is synergistic with clicks and that a well conceived and executed store strategy is a powerful competitive advantage. Another advantage for URBN brands is that most of our offerings consist of unique products. This is increasingly important in the age of comparison shopping via the Internet.
Finally, the URBN retail concepts have always been about offering an eclectic mix of multiple categories. Today, we're emphasizing this feature more than ever. Of course, this adds complexity and cost to our business model, but we do it because our customers respond positively, it differentiates our brands and it gives us flexibility to promote or demote categories as customer demand changes over time. For these reasons, I believe our brands are strategically well positioned to weather the current turbulence. As is true in any business, the best concepts are worthless without the right people to drive and execute them. I believe our teams are among the strongest and most creative in the industry and feel quite confident they will continue to deliver attractive results.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I extend my thanks and deep appreciation to all URBN associates around the world, and I thank our shareholders for their continued support.
Now I turn the call over for your questions."

So far in May, our Retail segment comp is lagging behind the first quarter trend, and I'm going to attribute that, as far as I can tell, to weather. If you had to -- if I had to say which -- what are the 3 biggest reasons, I'd say weather, weather and weather and then the follow-up reason to that might be the calendar. As you heard us say before, we're a 4-5-4 reporter -- not a 4-5-4 reporter. We're a monthly reporter, and as a result, we lost 1 Saturday in May. That's a big deal right now. It probably cost us about 2.5% in comp. But as the quarter goes on, that becomes negligible and will become meaningless. So we're not at all concerned about that. I would direct you to the weather in the first week of May. We had 6 out of 7 days of rain here in the mid-Atlantic and temperatures were somewhere between 10 and 20 degrees below normal. The differential that we're seeing between the comps on the West Coast where the weathers behave relatively normally and the East Coast where it's been atrocious is up to almost 1,000 basis points, which is extremely unusual. So we believe that's one sign. Another sign is that up until, let's say, mid-April, the comps at the Urban brand in Europe versus North America were basically comparable. And then Europe warmed up and basically got the weather that we usually get, sunny and dry and warm, unusual for London. And we got typical London weather, cool and rainy. We saw at that point a very large diversion between the comps in Europe and the comps in North America. Now there are some other factors that may have played into that, but I think the weather was the big driver. And so if you were to contact me 2 weeks from now when we think we're going to get some 80-degree-plus days here on the East Coast, I think I'd be in a better position to tell you where we think we're going to end up. But I can tell you that the merchants here are reasonably optimistic."

Relative to the opportunity in the second quarter, we do believe, as Dick said, if the May sales trend recovers back to something similar to what we saw in the first quarter, we can deliver gross profit margin improvement. The magnitude of that improvement will depend on where our sales trends land and where the customer delivers back from our product standpoint. That being said, I think what the drivers would be, would be continued improvement at the Urban Outfitters brand. You're correct that they don't have the same opportunity from a markdown perspective as they've seen over the last several quarters, but they still absolutely have markdown opportunity. In addition to that, the Urban Outfitters brand is seeing gains in IMU as well. The Anthropologie brand, I believe, also still has opportunity. I think the larger opportunity for them in the second quarter is IMU driven and a little bit of markdown opportunity. And then as they get into the back half of the year, the Anthropologie brand starts to see bigger markdown opportunity as you look it from a year-over-year comparison perspective. We do believe that the Free People brand could partially offset some of those gains as they did have a little bit heavier inventory overhang and they're transitioning their product with some fresher product within the second quarter. We also do think that we could start to see some benefit from the fulfillment center as we now have closed our second -- our old facility in South Carolina completely, and we did experience deleverage in the second quarter last year related to logistics in that fulfillment center transition. That also could contribute to some gross profit margin improvement in the second quarter."

And that's the nature of, I think, the Urban and probably the Free People customer. The Anthro customer probably has a bit less of a range of high/low, but she still likes high/low. So I think it's across the board. We need some sharp opening prices for some basics, and we think certainly at the Urban brand we have those. Then we have -- absolutely need, it's critical to have the special pieces, the special items of those things that she really wants, and you can then price those at less competitive prices.

In the interim, we'll be watching to look for signals in response to the fashion change and whether it's confirmation of the direction we've taken."

I will begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 first quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share some of our thoughts concerning our second quarter and the remainder of fiscal year 2017.
Total company, or URBN, sales for the first quarter increased by 3% to a first quarter record of $763 million. This sales increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a 16% increase in Wholesale segment sales and a $9.5 million increase in non-comp sales, including the opening of 2 net new stores in the quarter and sales from the newly-acquired Vetri Family restaurants. Please note that unlike many other retailers, we are not on a 4-5-4 calendar, and therefore our fiscal 2017 first quarter did benefit from an extra day versus the prior comparable period resulting from leap year.
Within our Retail segment comps, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting a double-digit sales increase driven by an increase in sessions while conversion rate was flat and average order value slightly decreased. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and average unit selling price, while units per transaction were flat.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 2% at Urban Outfitters, was flat at the Anthropologie Group and was down 2% at Free People. Our URBN Retail segment comp was fairly consistent each month with March being the strongest and April being the weakest. Free People Wholesale segment sales delivered another strong quarter as sales rose 16% to $62 million. These results came from double-digit growth in specialty and department store doors.
Total URBN gross profit for the quarter increased 6% to $262 million. Gross profit rate improved by 100 basis points to 34.3%. The improvement in gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvement in the Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie Group brands' maintained margins with Urban Outfitters delivering significantly lower markdowns versus the previous year. Partially offsetting these improvements was a lower gross profit rate at the Free People brand primarily driven by lower maintained margins due to higher markdowns to clear slow-moving product.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 9% to $211 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 155 basis points to 27.7%. This SG&A deleverage was primarily due to an increase in marketing expense to support our customer acquisition and retention efforts, deleverage and direct store controllable expenses related to negative store comps and an increase in technology related expenses used to support our omnichannel initiatives.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 5% to $50 million with operating profit margin deleveraging by 55 basis points to 6.6%. Our tax rate for the quarter was 39.6% compared to 35.6% in the prior year. This increase is due to the ratio of certain foreign losses to global taxable profits in the first quarter. We are still planning our annual effective tax rate to be approximately 37% for the year and believe our fourth quarter tax rate will be lower than the annual planned tax rate. Net income for the quarter was $29.6 million or $0.25 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory decreased by 10% to $360 million. The reduction in inventory is due to a 10% reduction in Retail segment comp inventory at cost. The decrease in Retail segment comp inventory is due to improved inventory planning and control as the business continues to work towards managing to a lower weeks of supply. The reduction of inventory is not necessarily predictive of future sales growth as we are currently doing a nice job of getting faster turns out of our inventory as shown over previous quarters.
We ended the quarter with $306 million in cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, the company repurchased and retired 325,000 common shares for $11 million. We repurchased and retired a total of 15 million common shares in fiscal year 2016 for $465 million. We have 7 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors' share repurchase authorization. Additionally, during the first quarter, we paid down $75 million of our outstanding revolver, leaving $75 million currently outstanding. 
As we enter the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 24 net new stores for the year, excluding our food and beverage division. For the second quarter, we are planning 6 new Free People stores in North America, 2 new Anthropologie stores in North America and 1 new Urban Outfitters store in Europe. For the year, we are planning on opening 4 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe; 8 net new Anthropologie stores, including 2 in Europe; and 12 net new Free People stores. Additionally, we are expanding or relocating 4 existing Anthropologie stores in support of our new Anthropologie store format. As David McCreight will soon speak to you about, these expanded format stores give us a tremendous opportunity to please the customer more with a broader assortment in categories like home, beauty and intimates as well as the BHLDN wedding brand and the Terrain outdoor living brand. We are also planning on opening 3 new Vetri pizzerias and 1 café adjacent to an Anthropologie large format.
URBN's gross margin rate for the second quarter could improve slightly versus the prior year. This improvement could come from improved maintained margin driven largely by the Urban Outfitters brand, which could be partially offset by a maintained margin decline at the Free People brand to clear through slow-moving product. This improvement would require the current May sales trend to recover closer to where we are forecasting our business for the second quarter. Quarter-to-date, May sales have started out slower than what we delivered for the first quarter and slower than what we had originally planned at each of our brands.
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at the high end of a low single-digit rate for the second quarter. This increase would be driven by direct-to-consumer channel investments related to marketing and technology as well as store-related expenses to support our square footage growth, which is planned at approximately 5% for fiscal 2017. For the year, we believe SG&A could grow at a high mid-single-digit rate with the third quarter potentially coming in higher than the annual rate due to some large incentive compensation reversals in the prior year.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $170 million with approximately $10 million moving from fiscal 2016 into fiscal '17. The total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Finally, our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 37%. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to David McCreight, CEO of the Anthropologie Group and President of URBN."

I will begin my commentary with highlights from the first quarter Anthropologie Group performance and then provide a review of our long-term strategic growth initiatives.
The Anthropologie Group delivered flat Retail segment comparable sales for the quarter along with improved merchandise margins compared to the first quarter of last year. Strong double-digit growth in the expanded categories like home, beauty, intimates, Terrain and BHLDN helped to drive these results and were partially offset by declines in certain apparel categories. Although much has been written about the broad weakness in the apparel category, we believe we have the opportunity, regardless of industry trends, to improve the appeal of our assortment and find ways to delight her.
As discussed on previous calls, the Anthropologie apparel merchant and design team has been implementing new processes and procedures designed to provide more structure around the concept-to-customer approach, shorten the design calendar, reduce overall weeks of supply and improve product accuracy. These changes, modeled after Meg's excellent work within the Free People and Urban Outfitters merchant and design organizations, will emphasize key looks, offer better fabric variety, elevated decoration and a more strategic edit, which will be supported by improved in-store and digital presentations.
In this past quarter, the most complete example of the concept-to-customer approach was applied to one of our key apparel categories, dresses. We expanded the choices available in stores, created dress shops in 75 locations, built digital stories and mailed a journal focused on this category. Response to this distorted dress category outpaced our expectation with double-digit regular price comps in both stores and online. Additionally, during the quarter, our own brand apparel penetration increased significantly and we experienced strong sell-throughs in some items, well above historical performance, giving us confidence in this approach.
As often occurs in transition periods, it will take some time for the design merchant and planning teams to coalesce around our new approach, but we are encouraged by the early steps and see progress in how the apparel team is working together on future deliveries. Throughout the quarter, we took markdowns on less appealing spring apparel and exited the first quarter leaner than where we would have liked to be. Based on our learnings from spring, we've chased into what the customer responded to and look forward to the arrival of deliveries later this month.
Moving on to the successes we have experienced over the last year in our expansion categories, including home, accessories, beauty, BHLDN and Terrain. You may recall I often refer to the tremendous opportunity the Anthropologie Group has to grow our brand by capturing share of her spend in adjacent categories and services. Our vision has been to grow within our current customer's life stage and interests by strategically expanding into specific categories based on her purchase behavior.
We have spoken to you about the investments in the teams, marketing and delivery mechanisms in order to grow existing categories as well as to expand into these new categories. We have built a structure within the Anthropologie Group where these categories have become distinct businesses under the brand umbrella. A short 1.5 years since our Analyst Day, I remain just as convinced and even more excited about achieving the goal of doubling the group's revenue.
One of the largest contributors to our future growth plans is the home opportunity. Andrew and the home team's efforts across product, aesthetics, sourcing and marketing have been very well received by our customers. Each season, we have refined our aesthetic and tailored our offer. Successful inroads have been made into each of our target rooms and categories. We are steadily adapting our digital experience to the needs of a home shopper.
The spring home journal that you received in March was our best to date, both in terms of product assortment and creative execution. Units per order and average order value continue to climb. The response from our customers has given us momentum towards fall where we will launch our largest home offer ever, including a journal with more than 200 pages supported with digital marketing.
Similar to home, the accessories category was an untapped opportunity to build a deeper and more diverse relationship with the Anthropologie customer. We were aware of her level of spend, and we knew we had permission to participate in these categories. The right shopping experience and offer would present us with the ability to capture greater share. While the assortment is still developing, we've seen positive response to our new deliveries in shoes and jewelry, and we believe we will continue to show significant growth.
Another successful category expansion launch has been Catherine [ph] and her team's efforts in building a beauty business. While in the early days of development, we are ahead of where I expected to be at this stage. We're seeing fascinating trends in her response to our shopping experience and assortment. We continue to seek out unique offerings that appeal to her sensibilities and needs in skincare, color and fragrance. Based on the customers' positive response to our beauty shops within stores, we will be expanding this concept to over 120 communities this summer and look forward to further emphasis of beauty in our digital and social messaging.
Rounding out our category expansions are our 2 brands, BHLDN and Terrain. Both brands have been built around a unique and appealing product and experience. From helping make a special moment in someone's life more special to tapping into the garden's inspirational seasonal change, both brands are delivering a remarkably engaging experience to new and current customers. These efforts, when coupled with the synergies of the Anthropologie Group, have accelerated their growth.
The momentum of all of these categories and brand expansions has been achieved mostly through existing store base and direct-to-consumer channels. We believe to capture the full opportunity and reach the goal of doubling our revenue, we need to bring more of these products to her. As discussed over 18 months ago, in addition to a web presence, we needed to create an in-store experience to support these categories. The goal is to provide enough representation of the expanded assortments to become a destination for in-store purchases while driving her online where she can shop the broader assortment. Success will be measured by activating a larger assortment online so that the combined store and digital spend of the surrounding area grows.
We are proud to announce that during the first quarter, we opened our first 2 expanded footprint locations. The first in Portland, followed by Newport Beach. These locations are expansions of existing stores and now have approximately 2.5x more square footage than the typical Anthropologie store. This larger footprint provides us with the ability to present a broader offering in the expanded categories, including a petite shop, expanded jewelry and accessories, an intimates boutique, an 800-square-foot beauty shop, a full service shoe salon as well as over 6,000 square feet of home. Additionally, we have dramatically reduced the back of house in these locations to maximize the selling space and are supporting them with more frequent replenishments.
I was in each market before, during and after the reopenings to observe and evaluate the concept. I can tell you in my almost 30 years in retail, I have never seen such an enthusiastic customer response. She is traveling a greater distance, spending a longer time shopping in the store, shopping across multiple categories. We've seen this behavior from new, reactivated and existing customers. Average order value is up, units per transaction have increased and sales are exceeding our expectations. Even if the supporting data and results were not enough already to provide positive indication around proof-of-concept, one only needed to see the looks on our customers' faces or overhear their comments while gleefully shopping the new concept to know that we're headed in the right direction. And remember, many of these assortments are still developing.
I do hope you've had the chance, as Oona said, to watch the video available on our Investor Relations website of these stores. Our plans are to open 4 or more locations over the next 12 months. These locations will range from 20 to over 30,000 square feet and some will include Terrain, BHLDN and a dining experience.
Now for a quick update on my new role as President of URBN. As mentioned on the last call, continuing the growth of Anthropologie Group remains my key focus. But I am happy to report that since last we spoke, we have hired a leader for our international expansion plans. The new leadership role will be filled by Stefan Laban [ph], who will join us this summer. Stefan [ph] brings with him decades of experience expanding U.S. brand footprints in new markets across the world. He is highly respected by those that have worked with him, and we expect he will be a key strategic partner in growing the reach of our brands.
In closing, we believe we are headed in the right direction. We have a bold strategy for future growth. We have a line of sight on reenergizing the apparel business, an expanded category strategy of material scale that is ahead of schedule and early confirmation from our customers on the new expanded format stores. I would like to thank Dick, Meg and thousands of team members that make URBN such a creative and dynamic environment to work.
I will now pass the call over to Dick."

Congratulations on the Portland and Newport Beach store expansions. Both stores look amazing and customer response has been incredible.

Both stores look amazing and customer response has been incredible. Sales in all categories of those stores are significantly ahead of plan, and customers have responded especially well to the expanded shoe and home assortments.
It's hard to over-emphasize how important these results are for the future of the brand and the company. Sales and testimonials have affirmed our strategy of giving our customer more choices and more product categories both in-store and online. It certainly gives us confidence to expand more stores across the U.S. These exceptional shopping experiences required well-orchestrated teamwork to create. So David, I thank you and the entire Anthropologie and shared service teams for a job very well done.
Next, let me discuss the Free People brand. As we've repeated many times, the Free People brand has also benefited from expanding its product categories. And like its sister brand, Free People has also seen success in opening expanded stores. Last year, Free People opened stores in Dallas and Denver with 5,000 square feet of selling space. These replaced smaller stores in both markets. The extra space was used to house expanded assortments of intimates, shoes, party dresses and FP Movement. Customer response to these additional categories has been very positive, and the brand intends to expand more of its smaller stores in select markets.
While expansion categories continued to perform well in the first quarter across all channels, response at retail to the core Free People apparel assortment was disappointing. The issue was less about having the correct fashion and more about having the correct distortion. The Free People merchant team played Q1 too safe and distorted their buy more to the known than to the new. Customers clearly wanted the new. As a result, total Retail segment comps in the quarter retreated by 2%. In addition, the team failed to react quickly enough to the retail sales miss-to-plan, so inventories grew and additional markdowns had to be taken.
On a more positive note, wholesale channel sales grew by 16% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Sales to both specialty and department store customers registered solid double-digit gains and all categories generated increases. Once again, expansion categories grew the fastest. Current wholesale bookings remain positive on a like-for-like basis, but the brand plans to manage future wholesale inventories more tightly given the current market turbulence. The team therefore anticipates good but somewhat slower wholesale channel growth for the remainder of the year.
In summary, after producing stellar results for 12 consecutive quarters, first quarter results of the Free People brand were good but not outstanding. I believe the team will make adjustments, including more rigorous inventory control and over the next few quarters will once again realize the kind of results we have come to expect from this fashion leader. I thank Meg, Sheila, Dave and their teams for their hard work and look forward to watching the progress of the brand this year.
Turning now to the Urban Outfitters brand. I'm happy to report that the rebuilding initiatives that began 2.5 years ago are now firmly established and driving positive results. For the quarter, total Retail segment comp sales increased in both North America and Europe. Please keep in mind that the brand remained highly promotional in the first quarter last year. In Q1 this year, regular price sales rose more than 6% on a comp basis, more than enough to offset the double-digit decrease in markdown sales. By category, women's apparel was strong; accessories gained momentum throughout the quarter; and the expanded categories: intimates, beauty, shoes, home decor, electronics and entertainment, all excelled. Comp sales of men's apparel and accessories were still negative in the quarter but made steady progress as the quarter progressed.
While delivering better comp and strong regular price sales, the brand also realized improved IMU and the lowest quarterly markdown rate in the past 10 years, which is as far back as our electronic records go. Together these factors created hundreds of basis points of merchandise margin improvement. Ending inventory on a weeks of supply basis was the leanest it's been in years, and merchandise scheduled to arrive in the second quarter shows additional IMU improvement. Thus, the team is enthusiastic about the opportunity to continue to deliver better merchandise margins in the second quarter and beyond.
During the quarter, the store teams further refined the shop-in-shop concepts to more accurately align product demand and space allocation. The shops also provided an easier shopping experience and clearer messaging for the customer. I believe the Urban stores look better and fresher today than they have in many years. Better product and better in-store experiences combine to drive improved conversion and fell just short of overcoming the high mid-single-digit decline in store traffic we experienced in Q1.
Meanwhile, all metrics in the direct-to-consumer channel remained positive. Sales and number of orders showed double-digit increases, while sessions, AOV and conversion posted strong gains as well. Across both channels, the teams were able to create compelling brand marketing messages, which led to increased omnichannel counts across all customer groups: new, active and reactivated.
In summary, the Urban team has made excellent progress in reinvigorating the brand over the last 2.5 years. Customers are responding to better product that has less redundancy within assortments; better product distortion by item, class and category; clear and more appropriate marketing with better imagery and a bigger social media presence; and cleaner, less cluttered stores that house a number of clearly defined shop-in-shops. These customer-facing improvements were accomplished by better back of house processes, more teamwork across functions, tighter controls and in some instances, better talent.
While everyone recognizes there is still much to be accomplished, tremendous effort on the part of the entire team has succeeded in turning this brand around. Congratulations to Trish, Meg and the teams on both sides of the Atlantic for orchestrating this success. I look forward to seeing continued progress in the quarters ahead.
Now let me say a few words about our customer spending habits across all brands and what it means to URBN. For many years now, we've repeated that the direct-to-consumer channel and certain product and service categories, such as home goods, intimates, beauty, entertainment and dining out, are growing and capturing a larger share of our customer's wallet. As for the apparel category, I believe she is still buying approximately the same number of items per year. But because of unit price deflation, her total annual spend on apparel is down on a year-over-year basis. This has been true for a number of years and it continued in the first quarter this year.
As a result, we believe it's important for URBN to continue to invest in the following areas: larger assortment and a higher penetration of proprietary products in all categories especially in the expanded ones; new and enhanced capabilities, including better marketing, to support the rapidly growing and changing direct-to-consumer channel; more technology to better know and understand the customer and allow for more efficient operations; expanding stores to house the larger assortments of non-apparel product; and controlled international growth, utilizing all of our channels of distribution. These investments are and will be focused in the areas of merchant and creative design talent, technology capabilities, both hard and soft marketing, logistics and data analytics.
There has been much written lately about the changes in our industry, so allow me to offer some thoughts about the macro environment in which we operate. Obviously, the retail industry is going through a rather painful period of rationalization. Rarely have I read so many negative articles about our industry. Unlike much of what has been written, I don't believe the customer is the problem. I think our customer is in relatively good shape. The problem, as I see it, is more of a supply issue, especially in the apparel category.
Simply put, America is over-stored and overstocked. We have approximately 10x more retail space per capita than our European counterparts and more direct-to-consumer choices, too. Rather than trying to differentiate their products and experiences, many retailers try to drive demand by offering constant and ever larger price promotions that erode not just the bottom line but brand equity as well. When that isn't enough, companies start closing stores in an attempt to rightsize their fleets.
The URBN brands have invested heavily in creative talent to make our products and shopping experiences unique and compelling so demand isn't dependent solely on price-driven promotions. The success of the Anthropologie larger format stores is one example of how to win through creativity. Also, fortunately for us, we have always been cautious, some have argued paranoid, about over-penetrating our brands. The careful, deliberate manner by which we grew the store base of all of our brands now serves us well.
There are few markets in which we have store redundancy. Our brands were early direct-to-consumer adopters. And while we continue to invest more in electronic shopping capabilities, we also strongly believe that bricks is synergistic with clicks and that a well-conceived and executed store strategy is a powerful competitive advantage. Another advantage for URBN brands is that most of our offerings consist of unique products. This is increasingly important in the age of comparison shopping via the Internet.
Finally, the URBN retail concepts have always been about offering an eclectic mix of multiple categories. Today, we're emphasizing this feature more than ever. Of course, this adds complexity and cost to our business model, but we do it because our customers respond positively, it differentiates our brands and it gives us flexibility to promote or demote categories as customer demand changes over time. For these reasons, I believe our brands are strategically well positioned to weather the current turbulence. As is true in any business, the best concepts are worthless without the right people to drive and execute them. I believe our teams are among the strongest and most creative in the industry and feel quite confident they will continue to deliver attractive results.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I extend my thanks and deep appreciation to all URBN associates around the world, and I thank our shareholders for their continued support.
Now I turn the call over for your questions."

So far in May, our Retail segment comp is lagging behind the first quarter trend, and I'm going to attribute that, as far as I can tell, to weather. If you had to -- if I had to say which -- what are the 3 biggest reasons, I'd say weather, weather and weather and then the follow-up reason to that might be the calendar. As you heard us say before, we're a 4-5-4 reporter -- not a 4-5-4 reporter. We're a monthly reporter, and as a result, we lost 1 Saturday in May. That's a big deal right now. It probably cost us about 2.5% in comp. But as the quarter goes on, that becomes negligible and will become meaningless. So we're not at all concerned about that. I would direct you to the weather in the first week of May. We had 6 out of 7 days of rain here in the mid-Atlantic and temperatures were somewhere between 10 and 20 degrees below normal. The differential that we're seeing between the comps on the West Coast where the weather has behaved relatively normally and the East Coast where it's been atrocious is up to almost 1,000 basis points, which is extremely unusual. So we believe that's one sign. Another sign is that up until, let's say, mid-April, the comps at the Urban brand in Europe versus North America were basically comparable. And then Europe warmed up and basically got the weather that we usually get, sunny and dry and warm, unusual for London. And we got the typical London weather, cool and rainy. We saw at that point a very large diversion between the comps in Europe and the comps in North America. Now there are some other factors that may have played into that, but I think the weather was the big driver. And so if you were to contact me 2 weeks from now when we think we're going to get some 80-degree-plus days here on the East Coast, I think I'd be in a better position to tell you where we think we're going to end up. But I can tell you that the merchants here are reasonably optimistic."

Relative to the opportunity in the second quarter, we do believe, as Dick said, if the May sales trend recovers back to something similar to what we saw in the first quarter, we can deliver gross profit margin improvement. The magnitude of that improvement will depend on where our sales trends land and where the customer delivers back from a product standpoint. That being said, I think what the drivers would be, would be continued improvement at the Urban Outfitters brand. You're correct that they don't have the same opportunity from a markdown perspective as they've seen over the last several quarters, but they still absolutely have markdown opportunity. In addition to that, the Urban Outfitters brand is seeing gains in IMU as well. The Anthropologie brand, I believe, also still has opportunity. I think the larger opportunity for them in the second quarter is IMU driven and a little bit of markdown opportunity. And then as they get into the back half of the year, the Anthropologie brand starts to see bigger markdown opportunity as you look at it from a year-over-year comparison perspective. We do believe that the Free People brand could partially offset some of those gains as they did have a little bit heavier inventory overhang and they're transitioning their product to some fresher product within the second quarter. We also do think that we could start to see some benefit from the fulfillment center as we now have closed our second -- our old facility in South Carolina completely, and we did experience deleverage in the second quarter of last year related to logistics and that fulfillment center transition. That also could contribute to some gross profit margin improvement in the second quarter."

While we probably have offered some things a little bit less expensive as well, our goal has always been to have a high/low assortment where basics are offered at very sharp prices and special pieces are offered at special prices, meaning that we can get more for those things. And that's the nature of, I think, the Urban and probably the Free People customer. The Anthro customer probably has a bit less of a range of high/low, but she still likes high/low. So I think it's across the board. We need some sharp opening prices for some basics, and we think certainly at the Urban brand we have those. Then we have -- we absolutely need, it's critical to have the special pieces, the special items of those things that she really wants, and you can then price those at less competitive prices.

And as we've said near term, the sort of metaphysical target is to double our revenue. That by no means is a top level. That is just something we're growing into. When we see her appetite for these home expansions, remember, she's buying this and has been responding to this mostly online and that is a digitally disadvantaged shopping experience to buy online. Yet despite that, the product in home has captured her heart. Seeing the way she's responded to footwear and the shoe salons was remarkable, and right now we're already trying to figure out ways to expand the stockroom so we can hold more footwear and support expanding the shoe salons. So these are when you think about them outside of our own category history and we look at her spend, and you have entire companies and industries built about the categories we're beginning to step into. So these are very scalable and very material businesses, and our brand connection, we figure out -- we need to figure out how to unlock and untap that potential."

I will begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 first quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share some of our thoughts concerning our second quarter and the remainder of fiscal year 2017.
Total company, or URBN, sales for the first quarter increased by 3% to a first quarter record of $763 million. This sales increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a 16% increase in Wholesale segment sales and a $9.5 million increase in non-comp sales, including the opening of 2 net new stores in the quarter and sales from the newly-acquired Vetri Family restaurants. Please note that unlike many other retailers, we are not on a 4-5-4 calendar, and therefore our fiscal 2017 first quarter did benefit from an extra day versus the prior comparable period resulting from leap year.
Within our Retail segment comps, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting a double-digit sales increase driven by an increase in sessions while conversion rate was flat and average order value slightly decreased. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and average unit selling price, while units per transaction were flat.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 2% at Urban Outfitters, was flat at the Anthropologie Group and was down 2% at Free People. Our URBN Retail segment comp was fairly consistent each month with March being the strongest and April being the weakest. Free People Wholesale segment sales delivered another strong quarter as sales rose 16% to $62 million. These results came from double-digit growth in specialty and department store doors.
Total URBN gross profit for the quarter increased 6% to $262 million. Gross profit rate improved by 100 basis points to 34.3%. The improvement in gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvement in the Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie Group brands' maintained margins with Urban Outfitters delivering significantly lower markdowns versus the previous year. Partially offsetting these improvements was a lower gross profit rate at the Free People brand primarily driven by lower maintained margins due to higher markdowns to clear slow-moving product.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 9% to $211 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 155 basis points to 27.7%. This SG&A deleverage was primarily due to an increase in marketing expense to support our customer acquisition and retention efforts, deleverage and direct store controllable expenses related to negative store comps and an increase in technology related expenses used to support our omnichannel initiatives.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 5% to $50 million with operating profit margin deleveraging by 55 basis points to 6.6%. Our tax rate for the quarter was 39.6% compared to 35.6% in the prior year. This increase is due to the ratio of certain foreign losses to global taxable profits in the first quarter. We are still planning our annual effective tax rate to be approximately 37% for the year and believe our fourth quarter tax rate will be lower than the annual planned tax rate. Net income for the quarter was $29.6 million or $0.25 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory decreased by 10% to $360 million. The reduction in inventory is due to a 10% reduction in Retail segment comp inventory at cost. The decrease in Retail segment comp inventory is due to improved inventory planning and control as the business continues to work towards managing to a lower weeks of supply. The reduction of inventory is not necessarily predictive of future sales growth as we are currently doing a nice job of getting faster turns out of our inventory as shown over previous quarters.
We ended the quarter with $306 million in cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, the company repurchased and retired 325,000 common shares for $11 million. We repurchased and retired a total of 15 million common shares in fiscal year 2016 for $465 million. We have 7 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors' share repurchase authorization. Additionally, during the first quarter, we paid down $75 million of our outstanding revolver, leaving $75 million currently outstanding. 
As we enter the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 24 net new stores for the year, excluding our food and beverage division. For the second quarter, we are planning 6 new Free People stores in North America, 2 new Anthropologie stores in North America and 1 new Urban Outfitters store in Europe. For the year, we are planning on opening 4 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe; 8 net new Anthropologie stores, including 2 in Europe; and 12 net new Free People stores. Additionally, we are expanding or relocating 4 existing Anthropologie stores in support of our new Anthropologie store format. As David McCreight will soon speak to you about, these expanded format stores give us a tremendous opportunity to please the customer more with a broader assortment in categories like home, beauty and intimates as well as the BHLDN wedding brand and the Terrain outdoor living brand. We are also planning on opening 3 new Vetri pizzerias and 1 café adjacent to an Anthropologie large format.
URBN's gross margin rate for the second quarter could improve slightly versus the prior year. This improvement could come from improved maintained margin driven largely by the Urban Outfitters brand, which could be partially offset by a maintained margin decline at the Free People brand to clear through slow-moving product. This improvement would require the current May sales trend to recover closer to where we are forecasting our business for the second quarter. Quarter-to-date, May sales have started out slower than what we delivered for the first quarter and slower than what we had originally planned at each of our brands.
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at the high end of a low single-digit rate for the second quarter. This increase would be driven by direct-to-consumer channel investments related to marketing and technology as well as store-related expenses to support our square footage growth, which is planned at approximately 5% for fiscal 2017. For the year, we believe SG&A could grow at a high mid-single-digit rate with the third quarter potentially coming in higher than the annual rate due to some large incentive compensation reversals in the prior year.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $170 million with approximately $10 million moving from fiscal 2016 into fiscal '17. The total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Finally, our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 37%. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to David McCreight, CEO of the Anthropologie Group and President of URBN."

I will begin my commentary with highlights from the first quarter Anthropologie Group performance and then provide a review of our long-term strategic growth initiatives.
The Anthropologie Group delivered flat Retail segment comparable sales for the quarter along with improved merchandise margins compared to the first quarter of last year. Strong double-digit growth in the expanded categories like home, beauty, intimates, Terrain and BHLDN helped to drive these results and were partially offset by declines in certain apparel categories. Although much has been written about the broad weakness in the apparel category, we believe we have the opportunity, regardless of industry trends, to improve the appeal of our assortment and find ways to delight her.
As discussed on previous calls, the Anthropologie apparel merchant and design team has been implementing new processes and procedures designed to provide more structure around the concept-to-customer approach, shorten the design calendar, reduce overall weeks of supply and improve product accuracy. These changes, modeled after Meg's excellent work within the Free People and Urban Outfitters merchant and design organizations, will emphasize key looks, offer better fabric variety, elevated decoration and a more strategic edit, which will be supported by improved in-store and digital presentations.
In this past quarter, the most complete example of the concept-to-customer approach was applied to one of our key apparel categories, dresses. We expanded the choices available in stores, created dress shops in 75 locations, built digital stories and mailed a journal focused on this category. Response to this distorted dress category outpaced our expectation with double-digit regular price comps in both stores and online. Additionally, during the quarter, our own brand apparel penetration increased significantly and we experienced strong sell-throughs in some items, well above historical performance, giving us confidence in this approach.
As often occurs in transition periods, it will take some time for the design merchant and planning teams to coalesce around our new approach, but we are encouraged by the early steps and see progress in how the apparel team is working together on future deliveries. Throughout the quarter, we took markdowns on less appealing spring apparel and exited the first quarter leaner than where we would have liked to be. Based on our learnings from spring, we've chased into what the customer responded to and look forward to the arrival of deliveries later this month.
Moving on to the successes we have experienced over the last year in our expansion categories, including home, accessories, beauty, BHLDN and Terrain. You may recall I often refer to the tremendous opportunity the Anthropologie Group has to grow our brand by capturing share of her spend in adjacent categories and services. Our vision has been to grow within our current customer's life stage and interests by strategically expanding into specific categories based on her purchase behavior.
We have spoken to you about the investments in the teams, marketing and delivery mechanisms in order to grow existing categories as well as to expand into these new categories. We have built a structure within the Anthropologie Group where these categories have become distinct businesses under the brand umbrella. A short 1.5 years since our Analyst Day, I remain just as convinced and even more excited about achieving the goal of doubling the group's revenue.
One of the largest contributors to our future growth plans is the home opportunity. Andrew and the home team's efforts across product, aesthetics, sourcing and marketing have been very well received by our customers. Each season, we have refined our aesthetic and tailored our offer. Successful inroads have been made into each of our target rooms and categories. We are steadily adapting our digital experience to the needs of a home shopper.
The spring home journal that you received in March was our best to date, both in terms of product assortment and creative execution. Units per order and average order value continue to climb. The response from our customers has given us momentum towards fall where we will launch our largest home offer ever, including a journal with more than 200 pages supported with digital marketing.
Similar to home, the accessories category was an untapped opportunity to build a deeper and more diverse relationship with the Anthropologie customer. We were aware of her level of spend, and we knew we had permission to participate in these categories. The right shopping experience and offer would present us with the ability to capture greater share. While the assortment is still developing, we've seen positive response to our new deliveries in shoes and jewelry, and we believe we will continue to show significant growth.
Another successful category expansion launch has been Catherine [ph] and her team's efforts in building a beauty business. While in the early days of development, we are ahead of where I expected to be at this stage. We're seeing fascinating trends in her response to our shopping experience and assortment. We continue to seek out unique offerings that appeal to her sensibilities and needs in skincare, color and fragrance. Based on the customers' positive response to our beauty shops within stores, we will be expanding this concept to over 120 communities this summer and look forward to further emphasis of beauty in our digital and social messaging.
Rounding out our category expansions are our 2 brands, BHLDN and Terrain. Both brands have been built around a unique and appealing product and experience. From helping make a special moment in someone's life more special to tapping into the garden's inspirational seasonal change, both brands are delivering a remarkably engaging experience to new and current customers. These efforts, when coupled with the synergies of the Anthropologie Group, have accelerated their growth.
The momentum of all of these categories and brand expansions has been achieved mostly through existing store base and direct-to-consumer channels. We believe to capture the full opportunity and reach the goal of doubling our revenue, we need to bring more of these products to her. As discussed over 18 months ago, in addition to a web presence, we needed to create an in-store experience to support these categories. The goal is to provide enough representation of the expanded assortments to become a destination for in-store purchases while driving her online where she can shop the broader assortment. Success will be measured by activating a larger assortment online so that the combined store and digital spend of the surrounding area grows.
We are proud to announce that during the first quarter, we opened our first 2 expanded footprint locations. The first in Portland, followed by Newport Beach. These locations are expansions of existing stores and now have approximately 2.5x more square footage than the typical Anthropologie store. This larger footprint provides us with the ability to present a broader offering in the expanded categories, including a petite shop, expanded jewelry and accessories, an intimates boutique, an 800-square-foot beauty shop, a full service shoe salon as well as over 6,000 square feet of home. Additionally, we have dramatically reduced the back of house in these locations to maximize the selling space and are supporting them with more frequent replenishments.
I was in each market before, during and after the reopenings to observe and evaluate the concept. I can tell you in my almost 30 years in retail, I have never seen such an enthusiastic customer response. She is traveling a greater distance, spending a longer time shopping in the store, shopping across multiple categories. We've seen this behavior from new, reactivated and existing customers. Average order value is up, units per transaction have increased and sales are exceeding our expectations. Even if the supporting data and results were not enough already to provide positive indication around proof-of-concept, one only needed to see the looks on our customers' faces or overhear their comments while gleefully shopping the new concept to know that we're headed in the right direction. And remember, many of these assortments are still developing.
I do hope you've had the chance, as Oona said, to watch the video available on our Investor Relations website of these stores. Our plans are to open 4 or more locations over the next 12 months. These locations will range from 20 to over 30,000 square feet and some will include Terrain, BHLDN and a dining experience.
Now for a quick update on my new role as President of URBN. As mentioned on the last call, continuing the growth of Anthropologie Group remains my key focus. But I am happy to report that since last we spoke, we have hired a leader for our international expansion plans. The new leadership role will be filled by Stefan Laban [ph], who will join us this summer. Stefan [ph] brings with him decades of experience expanding U.S. brand footprints in new markets across the world. He is highly respected by those that have worked with him, and we expect he will be a key strategic partner in growing the reach of our brands.
In closing, we believe we are headed in the right direction. We have a bold strategy for future growth. We have a line of sight on reenergizing the apparel business, an expanded category strategy of material scale that is ahead of schedule and early confirmation from our customers on the new expanded format stores. I would like to thank Dick, Meg and thousands of team members that make URBN such a creative and dynamic environment to work.
I will now pass the call over to Dick."

Congratulations on the Portland and Newport Beach store expansions. Both stores look amazing and customer response has been incredible. Sales in all categories of those stores are significantly ahead of plan, and customers have responded",1716,"Thank you, David. Congratulations on the Portland and Newport Beach store expansions. Both stores look amazing and customer response has been incredible. Sales in all categories of those stores are significantly ahead of plan, and customers have responded especially well to the expanded shoe and home assortments.
It's hard to over-emphasize how important these results are for the future of the brand and the company. Sales and testimonials have affirmed our strategy of giving our customer more choices and more product categories both in-store and online. It certainly gives us confidence to expand more stores across the U.S. These exceptional shopping experiences required well-orchestrated teamwork to create. So David, I thank you and the entire Anthropologie and shared service teams for a job very well done.
Next, let me discuss the Free People brand. As we've repeated many times, the Free People brand has also benefited from expanding its product categories. And like its sister brand, Free People has also seen success in opening expanded stores. Last year, Free People opened stores in Dallas and Denver with 5,000 square feet of selling space. These replaced smaller stores in both markets. The extra space was used to house expanded assortments of intimates, shoes, party dresses and FP Movement. Customer response to these additional categories has been very positive, and the brand intends to expand more of its smaller stores in select markets.
While expansion categories continued to perform well in the first quarter across all channels, response at retail to the core Free People apparel assortment was disappointing. The issue was less about having the correct fashion and more about having the correct distortion. The Free People merchant team played Q1 too safe and distorted their buy more to the known than to the new. Customers clearly wanted the new. As a result, total Retail segment comps in the quarter retreated by 2%. In addition, the team failed to react quickly enough to the retail sales miss-to-plan, so inventories grew and additional markdowns had to be taken.
On a more positive note, wholesale channel sales grew by 16% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Sales to both specialty and department store customers registered solid double-digit gains and all categories generated increases. Once again, expansion categories grew the fastest. Current wholesale bookings remain positive on a like-for-like basis, but the brand plans to manage future wholesale inventories more tightly given the current market turbulence. The team therefore anticipates good but somewhat slower wholesale channel growth for the remainder of the year.
In summary, after producing stellar results for 12 consecutive quarters, first quarter results of the Free People brand were good but not outstanding. I believe the team will make adjustments, including more rigorous inventory control and over the next few quarters will once again realize the kind of results we have come to expect from this fashion leader. I thank Meg, Sheila, Dave and their teams for their hard work and look forward to watching the progress of the brand this year.
Turning now to the Urban Outfitters brand. I'm happy to report that the rebuilding initiatives that began 2.5 years ago are now firmly established and driving positive results. For the quarter, total Retail segment comp sales increased in both North America and Europe. Please keep in mind that the brand remained highly promotional in the first quarter last year. In Q1 this year, regular price sales rose more than 6% on a comp basis, more than enough to offset the double-digit decrease in markdown sales. By category, women's apparel was strong; accessories gained momentum throughout the quarter; and the expanded categories: intimates, beauty, shoes, home decor, electronics and entertainment, all excelled. Comp sales of men's apparel and accessories were still negative in the quarter but made steady progress as the quarter progressed.
While delivering better comp and strong regular price sales, the brand also realized improved IMU and the lowest quarterly markdown rate in the past 10 years, which is as far back as our electronic records go. Together these factors created hundreds of basis points of merchandise margin improvement. Ending inventory on a weeks of supply basis was the leanest it's been in years, and merchandise scheduled to arrive in the second quarter shows additional IMU improvement. Thus, the team is enthusiastic about the opportunity to continue to deliver better merchandise margins in the second quarter and beyond.
During the quarter, the store teams further refined the shop-in-shop concepts to more accurately align product demand and space allocation. The shops also provided an easier shopping experience and clearer messaging for the customer. I believe the Urban stores look better and fresher today than they have in many years. Better product and better in-store experiences combine to drive improved conversion and fell just short of overcoming the high mid-single-digit decline in store traffic we experienced in Q1.
Meanwhile, all metrics in the direct-to-consumer channel remained positive. Sales and number of orders showed double-digit increases, while sessions, AOV and conversion posted strong gains as well. Across both channels, the teams were able to create compelling brand marketing messages, which led to increased omnichannel counts across all customer groups: new, active and reactivated.
In summary, the Urban team has made excellent progress in reinvigorating the brand over the last 2.5 years. Customers are responding to better product that has less redundancy within assortments; better product distortion by item, class and category; clear and more appropriate marketing with better imagery and a bigger social media presence; and cleaner, less cluttered stores that house a number of clearly defined shop-in-shops. These customer-facing improvements were accomplished by better back of house processes, more teamwork across functions, tighter controls and in some instances, better talent.
While everyone recognizes there is still much to be accomplished, tremendous effort on the part of the entire team has succeeded in turning this brand around. Congratulations to Trish, Meg and the teams on both sides of the Atlantic for orchestrating this success. I look forward to seeing continued progress in the quarters ahead.
Now let me say a few words about our customer spending habits across all brands and what it means to URBN. For many years now, we've repeated that the direct-to-consumer channel and certain product and service categories, such as home goods, intimates, beauty, entertainment and dining out, are growing and capturing a larger share of our customer's wallet. As for the apparel category, I believe she is still buying approximately the same number of items per year. But because of unit price deflation, her total annual spend on apparel is down on a year-over-year basis. This has been true for a number of years and it continued in the first quarter this year.
As a result, we believe it's important for URBN to continue to invest in the following areas: larger assortment and a higher penetration of proprietary products in all categories especially in the expanded ones; new and enhanced capabilities, including better marketing, to support the rapidly growing and changing direct-to-consumer channel; more technology to better know and understand the customer and allow for more efficient operations; expanding stores to house the larger assortments of non-apparel product; and controlled international growth, utilizing all of our channels of distribution. These investments are and will be focused in the areas of merchant and creative design talent, technology capabilities, both hard and soft marketing, logistics and data analytics.
There has been much written lately about the changes in our industry, so allow me to offer some thoughts about the macro environment in which we operate. Obviously, the retail industry is going through a rather painful period of rationalization. Rarely have I read so many negative articles about our industry. Unlike much of what has been written, I don't believe the customer is the problem. I think our customer is in relatively good shape. The problem, as I see it, is more of a supply issue, especially in the apparel category.
Simply put, America is over-stored and overstocked. We have approximately 10x more retail space per capita than our European counterparts and more direct-to-consumer choices, too. Rather than trying to differentiate their products and experiences, many retailers try to drive demand by offering constant and ever larger price promotions that erode not just the bottom line but brand equity as well. When that isn't enough, companies start closing stores in an attempt to rightsize their fleets.
The URBN brands have invested heavily in creative talent to make our products and shopping experiences unique and compelling so demand isn't dependent solely on price-driven promotions. The success of the Anthropologie larger format stores is one example of how to win through creativity. Also, fortunately for us, we have always been cautious, some have argued paranoid, about over-penetrating our brands. The careful, deliberate manner by which we grew the store base of all of our brands now serves us well.
There are few markets in which we have store redundancy. Our brands were early direct-to-consumer adopters. And while we continue to invest more in electronic shopping capabilities, we also strongly believe that bricks is synergistic with clicks and that a well-conceived and executed store strategy is a powerful competitive advantage. Another advantage for URBN brands is that most of our offerings consist of unique products. This is increasingly important in the age of comparison shopping via the Internet.
Finally, the URBN retail concepts have always been about offering an eclectic mix of multiple categories. Today, we're emphasizing this feature more than ever. Of course, this adds complexity and cost to our business model, but we do it because our customers respond positively, it differentiates our brands and it gives us flexibility to promote or demote categories as customer demand changes over time. For these reasons, I believe our brands are strategically well positioned to weather the current turbulence. As is true in any business, the best concepts are worthless without the right people to drive and execute them. I believe our teams are among the strongest and most creative in the industry and feel quite confident they will continue to deliver attractive results.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I extend my thanks and deep appreciation to all URBN associates around the world, and I thank our shareholders for their continued support.
Now I turn the call over for your questions."

So far in May, our Retail segment comp is lagging behind the first quarter trend, and I'm going to attribute that, as far as I can tell, to weather. If you had to -- if I had to say which -- what are the 3 biggest reasons, I'd say weather, weather and weather and then the follow-up reason to that might be the calendar. As you heard us say before, we're a 4-5-4 reporter -- not a 4-5-4 reporter. We're a monthly reporter, and as a result, we lost 1 Saturday in May. That's a big deal right now. It probably cost us about 2.5% in comp. But as the quarter goes on, that becomes negligible and will become meaningless. So we're not at all concerned about that. I would direct you to the weather in the first week of May. We had 6 out of 7 days of rain here in the mid-Atlantic and temperatures were somewhere between 10 and 20 degrees below normal. The differential that we're seeing between the comps on the West Coast where the weather has behaved relatively normally and the East Coast where it's been atrocious is up to almost 1,000 basis points, which is extremely unusual. So we believe that's one sign. Another sign is that up until, let's say, mid-April, the comps at the Urban brand in Europe versus North America were basically comparable. And then Europe warmed up and basically got the weather that we usually get, sunny and dry and warm, unusual for London. And we got the typical London weather, cool and rainy. We saw at that point a very large diversion between the comps in Europe and the comps in North America. Now there are some other factors that may have played into that, but I think the weather was the big driver. And so if you were to contact me 2 weeks from now when we think we're going to get some 80-degree-plus days here on the East Coast, I think I'd be in a better position to tell you where we think we're going to end up. But I can tell you that the merchants here are reasonably optimistic."

Relative to the opportunity in the second quarter, we do believe, as Dick said, if the May sales trend recovers back to something similar to what we saw in the first quarter, we can deliver gross profit margin improvement. The magnitude of that improvement will depend on where our sales trends land and where the customer delivers back from a product standpoint. That being said, I think what the drivers would be, would be continued improvement at the Urban Outfitters brand. You're correct that they don't have the same opportunity from a markdown perspective as they've seen over the last several quarters, but they still absolutely have markdown opportunity. In addition to that, the Urban Outfitters brand is seeing gains in IMU as well. The Anthropologie brand, I believe, also still has opportunity. I think the larger opportunity for them in the second quarter is IMU driven and a little bit of markdown opportunity. And then as they get into the back half of the year, the Anthropologie brand starts to see bigger markdown opportunity as you look at it from a year-over-year comparison perspective. We do believe that the Free People brand could partially offset some of those gains as they did have a little bit heavier inventory overhang and they're transitioning their product to some fresher product within the second quarter. We also do think that we could start to see some benefit from the fulfillment center as we now have closed our second -- our old facility in South Carolina completely, and we did experience deleverage in the second quarter of last year related to logistics and that fulfillment center transition. That also could contribute to some gross profit margin improvement in the second quarter."

And that's the nature of, I think, the Urban and probably the Free People customer. The Anthro customer probably has a bit less of a range of high/low, but she still likes high/low. So I think it's across the board. We need some sharp opening prices for some basics, and we think certainly at the Urban brand we have those. Then we have -- we absolutely need, it's critical to have the special pieces, the special items of those things that she really wants, and you can then price those at less competitive prices.

Yes, I talked about a lot of what I would call green shoots early in spring, and I think a number of those green shoots have proven to be correct. I see a lot of fashion excitement and newness out there. I think our Urban and Free People brands are the ones that typically get to those things quicker. The Anthropologie brand typically is not necessarily tied as much to the fashion moment and more to almost an internal fashion. So I think that we are seeing it in both Urban and Free People. I think as I look at the categories, departments and even classes in those brands, I see a lot of newness and fashion trends almost in every one of them. So I think there's just a lot out there. There's certainly enough, in my mind, to be driving apparel comps. So I like the fashion. I like where it's going. I think it gives us a lot of opportunity, so we're pleased with that.

When we see her appetite for these home expansions, remember, she's buying this and has been responding to this mostly online and that is a digitally disadvantaged shopping experience to buy online. Yet despite that, the product in home has captured her heart. Seeing the way she's responded to footwear and the shoe salons was remarkable, and right now we're already trying to figure out ways to expand the stockroom so we can hold more footwear and support expanding the shoe salons. So these are when you think about them outside of our own category history and we look at her spend, and you have entire companies and industries built about the categories we're beginning to step into. So these are very scalable and very material businesses, and our brand connection, we figure out -- we need to figure out how to unlock and untap that potential."

I will begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 record-setting second quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share some of our thoughts concerning our third quarter and the remaining -- the remainder of fiscal year 2017. 
Total company or URBN sales for the second quarter increased by 3% to a second quarter record of $891 million. This increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a 4% increase in Wholesale segment sales and a $12 million increase in non-comp sales, including the opening of 8 net new stores in the quarter and sales from the newly acquired Vetri Family restaurants. 
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting another double-digit sales gains driven by an increase in sessions and conversion rate, which more than offset the decrease in average order value. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and average unit selling price, while units per transaction were flat. 
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 5% at Urban Outfitters, with flat at Free People and the Anthropologie Group. Our URBN Retail segment comp was the strongest in July followed by June, with May being the weakest. 
Free People Wholesale segment sales delivered another solid quarter as sales rose 4% to $75 million. These results were driven by increased space at select department store doors to support our category expansion like FP Movement and growth in our European accounts. 
Now moving on to gross profit. Total URBN gross profit for the quarter increased 8% to $343 million. Gross profit rate improved by 179 basis points to 38.5%. The improvement in gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvement in the Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie Group brand maintained margins with both brands delivering higher initial markups and lower merchandise markdowns versus the previous year. Partially offsetting these improvements was a lower gross profit rate at the Free People Brad primarily driven by lower maintained margins due to higher markdowns to clear slow-moving product. 
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 5% to $224 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 48 basis points to 25.2%. This SG&A deleverage was primarily due to an increase in direct marketing and technology-related expenses to support our strong direct-to-consumer growth. Direct store controllable expenses also increased in the quarter in order to support our square footage growth of 4% in the quarter. 
Operating income for the quarter increased by 14% to $118 [ph] million with operating profit margin improving by 131 basis points to 13.3%. Our tax rate for the quarter was 35.5% compared to 35.2% in the prior year. Net income in the quarter was $77 million or $0.66 per diluted share, a new second quarter EPS record. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory decreased by 4% to $367 [ph] million. The reduction in inventory is due to a 4% reduction in Retail segment comp inventory at cost. The reduction of inventory is not necessarily predictive of future sales growth as we are currently doing a nice job of lowering our recent supply and getting faster turns out of our inventory, as a shown over previous quarters where our sales comp had outpaced our comp inventory growth. We ended the quarter with $328 million in cash and marketable securities. During the second quarter, we paid down $25 million of our outstanding revolver, leaving $50 million currently outstanding. 
As we enter the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 23 net new stores for the year, excluding our food and beverage division. For the third quarter, we are planning 6 new Anthropologie stores, including 1 new Anthropologie store in Europe; 2 new Urban Outfitters stores and 3 new Free People stores. For the year, we are planning on opening 3 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe; 7 net new Anthropologie stores, including 2 in Europe; and 13 net new Free People stores. For the full year fiscal 2017, we are also planning on opening 2 new Vetri pizzerias and 1 café adjacent to an Anthropologie large-format store. 
Now on the gross margin. We believe our third quarter gross margin rate could improve versus the prior year with that improvement in rate being slightly lower than the 142 basis points we achieved in the first half of the year. Our third quarter gross margin improvement could be largely driven by higher maintained margins at the Anthropologie Group and Urban Outfitters brand, which could be partially offset by declining gross profit rate at the Free People brand. Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a low double-digit rate for the third quarter. Please note that we recorded lower incentive-based and share-based compensation in the third quarter of the prior year, which is contributing to the increase in our SG&A growth rate for the third quarter of this year. For the year, we believe SG&A could grow at a high single-digit rate. We believe the growth will be driven by increased investment in marketing and technology expenses, hopefully helping to continue driving our double-digit during the consumer channel sales gains. Store-related expenses are also expected to increase in order to support our square footage growth, which is planned at approximately 5% for fiscal year 2017 capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $170 [ph] million. Total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new, relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center.  
Finally, we are still planning our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate to be approximately 37% for the year and believe our fourth quarter tax rate will be lower than the annual planned rate. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast, but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements. 
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Trish Donnelly, global CEO of the Urban Outfitters brand."

Both the North",1369,"Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. The Urban Outfitters global brand had a very exciting second quarter. We delivered record sales volume and drove a 5% Retail segment comp on top of the 4% comp increase from the previous year. Both the North American and European businesses contributed to the success, with Europe delivering solid comps despite the political backdrop in the U.K. Strong sales partnered with improvements in merchandise margins and the team's focus on expense management allowed us to deliver significant improvement in overall operating margin. 
During the quarter, the Urban Outfitters brand was able to achieve near record merchandise margins through tight inventory management and IMU focus, not to mention compelling trend right products, creative and easy to shop the visual presentations and stores and exceptional imagery with an easy to navigate user experience in our direct-to-consumer channel. The brand's strong partnership with our internal production team led by Chief Sourcing Officer Barbara Rozsas resulted in higher initial margins compared to prior years. Our attention to driving in developing a meaningful regular price business helped improve the global margin significantly. 
Now let me discuss in further detail the various initiatives contributing to the strong top line growth. The record volume in the quarter was driven by increases in regular price businesses across categories, geographies and channels. One of our because shifts in strategy across all merchandise categories has been our focus on exclusive products and offering our customer products he or she can get anywhere but Urban Outfitters. In addition to our own brand product, which as 100% proprietary and a majority of the total assortment, we worked with key brand partners such as Adidas, Wrangler and Fila on special makeups, exclusive styles and UO collaboration. The ability to work creatively and collaboratively with brands we admire who get Urban Outfitters and get our customer has been really rewarding and the response to our customers has been tremendous. We saw impressive growth in our own imported women's apparel and accessories businesses across a variety of categories. At the end of the quarter, over 90% of our women's apparel assortment was available only at Urban Outfitters. Today, more than ever, product differentiation is critical, not just as a traffic driver to both direct-to-consumer and stores, but more importantly, is an obligation we have to our core customer. Our customer looks to us for unique products and first to trend and exclusive product offering ensure her she won't be wearing something offered anywhere 
else. Globally, the brand also saw impressive growth in what we previously referred to as emerging categories, specifically intimates, home and beauty. Within intimates, we've had great response to our broad and undies program as well as our exclusive buys and colors in Calvin Klein. We're also seeing really nice traction in our lounge and dorm offering,  and we will continue to build upon this success as we've seen. 
In addition to intimates, we're seeing sizable growth and outside in our home division. This is an important category in the lives of our 18 to 28 year old customer, whether they're moving into their dorm room or their first apartment. The small space and on-campus home marketing campaigns and social posts were some of our most engaged in the quarter, averaging 6-figure customer likes on Instagram. Also during the quarter, we launched a home showroom in space 15 20 in Los Angeles, one of our large format stores. The showroom shopping experience is truly omnichannel and we'll continue to refine and support this initiative. 
With the majority of our direct-to-consumer traffic coming through mobile devices, the direct and retail experiences need to be seamless and URBN is committed to supporting this with the necessary team and resources. 
Our third emerging category, beauty, continue to see compounded comp growth and increase in penetration in the total business. Here, too, we recognize the importance of exclusivity and first to market and the beauty team has done a tremendous job curating our brand assortment with partners and brands around the world. The unique and different, even in beauty, resonates with our customers and will continue to build out the special offering. 
This brings us to a new emerging category, music, which has always in part of Urban Outfitters' DNA and product mix. Today, we continue to offering vinyl, turntables, cassettes and cassette players as well as wireless speakers and headphones with collaborators like Bang and Olufsen. 
In addition to the product side, and the music category, we're also committed to delivering the experience. Digitally, we've been building out our music video series, UO Live. With tens of thousands of subscribers and views, it gives us another platform on which to connect with our customer while supporting our favorite artists and bands. Our Urban Outfitters music Instagram is growing quickly with mixtape previews and vinyl giveaways, our most engaged customer interaction. 
And finally, our men's business. Although still not where we wanted to be, the progress around the regular priced business, particularly in a direct-to-consumer channel, is seeing great traction. We see a path to positive growth for the back half of the year, with strong and relevant product assortment, including own brand, branded, collaborations and exclusives, relevant and creative marketing strategies and easier to shop in-store visual merchandising set up. We've said from the beginning that the men's comp will follow women's, which is how it's actualizing. The leadership in men's design in merchandising, planning, story visuals and brand marketing has been laser-focused on our customer, on the assortment and on compelling pricing through very excited where the business is headed. 
In addition to our product and experience initiatives, we are in the process of globalizing our team. This change allows us to communicate be seamless global message and a consistent retail and direct-to-consumer experience while leveraging talent and creative assets across the globe. We are committed to pursuing long-term international growth, and this past quarter, we opened a new Urban Outfitters store in Netherlands, bringing our total store count in Europe and the U.K. to 44. In addition, we opened and Urban Outfitters concession within the Selfridge's flagship on Austin Street late in the quarter and are looking forward to seeing success year. 
On a global basis, I'm proud to say our brand saw improvements across all channels and all customer groups this quarter with new, retained and reactivated customer account increasing year-over-year. Another area where we've seen tremendous customer growth and audience engagement is in social media. Our Instagram followers exceeded the 5 million mark during the quarter, increasing 65% over the prior year, and we're now capturing over 200,000 new followers a month. In addition to our national Instagram account, our stores manage our local accounts, which accrued almost 7,000 followers and over 19 million makes in the quarter. Snapchat is important in our consumers' lives, and we're also seen fast growth year with viewership increasing 25% month over month. Urban Outfitters has called out in L2 July Digital IQ index for specialty retail as, ""the most prolific ground on the Snapchat platform, posting 6 times the index average with 83% featuring video content."" This channel has given us yet another relevant way to connect with our customers and engage in 2-way conversation. A great example of this occurred during LGBTQ Pride Month in June, where our Snapchat stories garnered close to 130,000 views. 
In the 24 months I've been with Urban Outfitters, I'm proud to say we have made great progress. And although there is still a lot accomplished, there have been a number of positives. The results of this past quarter could not have occurred without the exceptional leadership of the Urban Outfitters executive team, and I would like to thank each team member for their hard work, dedication and passion for the brand. Their focus on our customer and the collaborative culture the created for their teens and colleagues have allowed the quarter successes to materialize. And finally, a very special thank you to Meg, whose partnership is invaluable. Her love of Urban Outfitters and for our customers inspires the teams daily and her contributions to this quarter's success were critical. Thank you. 
I will now pass the call to Dick."
330706,375261018,1036078,"Urban Outfitters Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2016",2016-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Urban Outfitters, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Trish, and good afternoon, everyone. URBN produced a record sales and earnings per share in the second quarter with comparable demand accelerating sequentially. May is typically our biggest month for the quarter, but as we suggested on our May con",1860,"Thanks, Trish, and good afternoon, everyone. URBN produced a record sales and earnings per share in the second quarter with comparable demand accelerating sequentially. May is typically our biggest month for the quarter, but as we suggested on our May conference call, unseasonably cold weather in the eastern half of North America depressed and delayed apparel purchases. As a result, total Retail segment comparable sales in May were negative. Fortunately, the weather shifted in June and sales rebounded strongly. July sales jumped even higher, generating the best comps of the quarter. 
Given the weak start to Q2, we're very pleased our final sales number show a positive Retail segment comp, and we're delighted to report record second quarter earnings per share. The monthly sales curve was similar across all brands, but overall the results of very. 
So let me say a few words about each brand's performance. First, the Urban brand. As Trish just recorded, Urban produced a terrific quarter. All major product categories posted positive comp sales except men's, and a number of categories delivered double-digit comps. Urban's European business also experienced strong comp games with seemingly little impact on the business from the Brexit vote. Not only did the total Urban brand produced its best comps in 12 quarters, it also continue to deliver strong regular price sales; managed its leanest quarterly markdown rate as far back as brand records go; improved initial margins; administrate high inventory and expense controls; and created a flurry of outstanding marketing events and campaigns. All of these factors combined to create record second quarter sales and one of the most profitable second quarters in the brand's history. 
Brand momentum at the end of Q2 was powerful. Therefore, the team believes they will continue to please and excite customers with new fashion and new marketing campaigns in the second half. My congratulations go to Trish, Meg and the entire Urban Outfitters team on both sides of the Atlantic for planning and delivering an exceptional quarter.  I'm so proud of what the team has accomplished over the past 2 years. Urban has now regained its position as a fashion leader for young adults, and I couldn't be more excited for the brand's future. 
Turning your attention to Free People. In Q2, the brand posted flat Retail segment comps and a mid-single-digit increase in wholesale sales. The brand opened 5 new stores during the quarter and achieved total Retail segment revenue growth of 8%. Almost all product categories in the Retail segment delivered positive comp sales in the quarter with most of the gains driven by higher promotional activity. As we discussed on last quarter's call, Free People entered the second quarter with excess Retail segment inventory. The press aggressively cleared their stock during the quarter by taking additional markdowns, which lifted sales, but depressed margins. I'm pleased to report that comparable retail segment inventory at quarter's end fell by 8% on a year-over-year basis. Inventory is now more current and weeks of supply more in line with sales. As such, we believe the brand is positioned to deliver lower markdown rates in the second half than those experienced in Q2. Although the brand team has made significant progress in terms of inventory management, their goal is to further reduce the average weeks of supply. Looking forward, the brand is encouraged by some excellent early fall sign of its newest fashion offering, especially in this direct channel. Regular price sales in that channel are running nicely positive, but haven't been strong enough to overcome lower markdown sales and negative store sales, so total Retail segment sales are negative. The brand will continue to make adjustments to their assortments based on these early reads, but the team believes the Retail segment results, which are up against multiyear positive comparisons, could remain difficult in the back half. Meanwhile, the Free People Wholesale team continue to produce excellent quarterly results in spite of a difficult environment. The headwinds to growth in this channel have been well documented. Still, the team delivered a 4% increase in year-over-year sales in the quarter and 9% growth for the first half. This growth was driven by continued success and expanded categories such as FP Movement and significant growth in European businesses where quarterly sales almost doubled versus the same period last year. 
The team believes there is significant wholesale growth opportunity remaining in Europe. Looking ahead, timing issues where the wholesale shipments in the third and fourth quarters last year create easier comparisons for Q3 while Q4 is more difficult. In spite of this, falling holiday bookings are strong and the team believes they can return to double-digit growth for the back half of the year. I thank Meg, Sheila, Dave and Chrissy and the entire Free People team. Although not their finest results, the quarter marked a return to fundamental discipline that will benefit the brand going forward. Given the enormous creativity housed within the brand, I'm confident that the Free People will continue to delight its customers with fresh fashion and inspiring environment. I'll take this opportunity also to recognize and congratulate Sheila Harrington on her recent promotion to the role of the brand President, reporting to Meg. Sheila has been instrumental in growing the brand over her 13-year tenure at Free People, excluding extremely successful launches of all the Free People product extensions from intimates to Movement. Sheila, thank you for your many contributions and congratulations to you. 
Next, I'll speak to the Anthropologie brand. Although the brand reported a negative 2.5% comp for the quarter, there were numerous bright spots to report. Anthropologie Europe delivered positive comp sales. Again, we saw no change in customer's demand from the Brexit vote. Almost all Anthropologie product categories performed well in the quarter with 6 of 7 generating double-digit positive comps. Only women's apparel was negative. Due to exceptional inventory management, the brand was able to limit markdowns in the apparel category and decreased the total markdown rate on a year-over-year basis by more than 100 basis points. This decrease in markdowns in combination with very strong IMU improvement drove significant year-over-year increases in merchandise margins on both a rate and dollar basis. The result, in spite of negative overall comps, Anthropologie generated more operating profits in Q2 of this year than in the same period last year. 
Obviously, the team's focus is on turning the women's apparel business around, and I believe the brand is making slow but steady progress. Reaction to Anthropologie's apparel assortment on a comp basis improve sequentially in the quarter. Areas of strength include dresses, which registered strong double-digit comp gains and woven tops, which improves the season progress. The brand believes the apparel assortment will continue to evolve throughout the fall holiday season and feels positive about their assortments in a growing number of apparel classifications. Certainly, reenergizing this category is the brand's #1 immediate goal. 
Strong performance of the expanded categories such as home, beauty, BHLDN and Terrain continues to be a brand highlight. All expanded categories ahead of plan and are fueling the increases in the direct-to-consumer business and the stellar performance of the 2 new larger-format stores. Home is the most developed of these categories and continues to surprise on the upside. We're excited to see customer reaction to the September Home Journal, which will drop in mid-September and have 42% more pages than last year's book. The brand's beauty assortment is also connecting with the customer and show significant sales growth in both stores and online. By the holiday season, more than 130 Anthropologie stores will have a beauty shop-in-shop, up from 70 the prior year. The 2 younger brands, BHLDN and Terrain, which became part of the Anthropologie Group over the last 2 [ph] years, have benefited greatly from the ability to cross merchandise and leverage the Anthropologie Group's resources. Both have experienced significant revenue growth and positive comp sales. BHLDN has the potential to top $50 [ph] million in revenue this year and is quickly becoming our customers go-to destination for her special occasions. The long-term strategic importance of positive customer reaction to these product expansions and extensions, both in-store and online, can't be overstated. Nowhere is that reaction more clear than sales generated at the 2 newly expanded stores in Portland and Newport Beach. Last quarter, we reported on the phenomenal openings each of these larger-format stores had. Now 3 months later, both stores continue to exceed their sales plan and, importantly, for the quarter, both stores averaged higher sales per square foot than the average Anthropologie store. I think that's extraordinary. While 1 quarter's results do not confirm a trend, should this metric continue, the long-term implications for the brand would be found. Furthermore, the team believes there are many ways to enhance the assortment and experience of the stores and build sales even further. During the third quarter, Anthropologie plans to open 2 additional expanded stores, Walnut Creek and King of Prussia. The Palo Alto relocation and expansion is planned to open in the fourth quarter. My thanks go to David, Meg and the Anthropologie team for delivering an exceptionally profitable quarter, and I congratulate David and the team for successfully developing the Anthropologie expanded categories and larger-format stores. 
Before closing, I will briefly comment on trends in the market and summarize our accomplishments this quarter. Over the past several years, the complaint of lack of fashion has become common in the marketplace. I spoke to this subject on our conference call in March of this year. I actually said, I'm not predicting exactly when a change in fashion will occur, but that I saw more fashion excitement in spring than I've seen in quite a few years. I repeat those comments again as we move into fall, except I believe the change is now upon us and our customers are adapting to new looks and silhouettes as we speak. As in all such cycles, some customers and brands adopt newness faster than others, but the fact is there is currently an abundance of exciting fashion happening and this is very good for our brands, for URBN and for our industry as a whole. 
Now to summarize URBN's accomplishments in the second quarter. During the quarter, we generated record sales with a 1% increase in Retail segment comp sales and a 4% gain in wholesale sales and achieved these record sales with 4% Retail segment comp inventory decrease. We also drove strong record consumer sales in part by increasing our marketing expense, grew our year-over-year initial merchandise margins by almost 100 basis points, managed the markdowns of the lowest rate for any quarter in company history, delivered the highest maintained merchandise margin in recent history and earned $77 million in the quarter for a record $0.66 per share.
Finally, in closing, I thank our brand and shared service leaders and our 24,000 Associates worldwide for their inspiring dedication, drive and creativity. I also recognize and thank our many partners around the world. And finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued support. That concludes my prepared remarks. I now turn the call over to your questions."

And I think, Trish was a little reticent to talk about men's, but we're even seeing it in men's now in Urban. So I feel very strongly about Urban. As you know, we still have work to do, as I mentioned in the Anthropologie brand and in some of the apparel classifications, but we saw a nice sequential growth improvements there as well. And definitely, in the home categories and the intimate categories and basically all the other categories performed very well. And then Free People, as I said in my prepared remarks, we've gotten some very nice reads online in the new apparel offering.

I think that Urban is definitely benefiting from a lot of the initiatives they're doing, not just for the good fashion, but the social media work that they're doing and the marketing work they're doing. In July, they actually saw a positive comp store sales in North America and in Europe. They had positive comp store sales, so yes, I think you can make the difference. I do believe that we shouldn't get too negative on stores. I think that there's no question, there are too many stores in North America and we start to see some of those stores going away. Some of our competitors are closing stores that are reasonable rate and, of course, there was just Macy's announcement of closing of stores. So I think, you will continue to see a lot of stores close and go away, and I think, that's a positive thing for the industry and a positive thing for all the people, including the ones that are closing the stores. But I don't think it's a problem with stores per se. I think the store concept is still valid. What I see happening over time is just fewer stores, but probably the stores' larger and delivering more of a unique experience, which could complement their direct-to-consumer business. And I think that, that will be the winning combination. Also, if you don't mind, we're taking a second to talk about proprietary product, which was a question you asked last quarter and gave me a lot of reason to think about it. Like Trish said, this proprietary product, I think, is going to be one of the main drivers of differentiation in the marketplace going forward. As Trish said, almost 90% of the women's product was proprietary in the quarter, in Q2 with a Free People Wholesale and Free People retail, it's 100% and somewhere around 90%. And at Anthropologie, the women's apparel is somewhere around 80% proprietary. Our goal is to really have this proprietary product across all categories, not just in apparel. Currently, apparel is the highest penetration of proprietary products, but other categories like accessories and intimates, which are much less, are trending up. And we believe that over time, they will maybe not exceed apparel, but approach apparel. So our goal is to offer these experiences in stores that it's impossible for customers to get any other place than one of our brands."

As Dick alluded to earlier, all of the URBN will be focusing on how to be faster speed to market, use more predictive tools and resources and, overtime, lower inventories in total for the organization. As it relates to Anthropologie and the sequential growth, we did see that in Q2. However, when we look at the balance of the year, I wanted to remember that about 6 months ago, we launched wI think Meg sort of overhaul of the Anthropologie's vision for architects, our process, speed to market, the teams have changed and that's about 6 months ago.

330706,375261018,1036097,"Urban Outfitters Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2016",2016-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Urban Outfitters, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 record-setting second quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter.

I'll begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 record-setting second quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share some of our thoughts concerning our third quarter and the remaining -- remainder of fiscal year 2017. 
Total company or URBN sales for the second quarter increased by 3% to a second quarter record of $891 million. This increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a 4% increase in Wholesale segment sales and a $12 million increase in non-comp sales, including the opening of 8 net new stores in the quarter and sales from the newly acquired Vetri Family restaurants. 
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting another double-digit sales gain, driven by an increase in sessions and conversion rate, which more than offset the decrease in average order value. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and average unit selling price, while units per transaction were flat. 
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 5% at Urban Outfitters, was flat at Free People and the Anthropologie Group. Our URBN Retail segment comp was the strongest in July followed by June, with May being the weakest. 
Free People Wholesale segment sales delivered another solid quarter as sales rose 4% to $75 million. These results were driven by increased space at select department store doors to support our category expansion like FP Movement and growth in our European accounts. 
Now moving on to gross profit. Total URBN gross profit for the quarter increased 8% to $343 million. Gross profit rate improved by 179 basis points to 38.5%. The improvement in gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvement in the Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie Group brands maintained margins, with both brands delivering higher initial markups and lower merchandise markdowns versus the previous year. Partially offsetting these improvements was a lower gross profit rate at the Free People brad, primarily driven by lower maintained margins due to higher markdowns to clear slow-moving product. 
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 5% to $224 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 48 basis points to 25.2%. This SG&A deleverage was primarily due to an increase in direct marketing and technology-related expenses to support our strong direct-to-consumer growth. Direct store controllable expenses also increased in the quarter in order to support our square footage growth of 4% in the quarter. 
Operating income for the quarter increased by 14% to $118 million, with operating profit margin improving by 131 basis points to 13.3%. Our tax rate for the quarter was 35.5% compared to 35.2% in the prior year. Net income in the quarter was $77 million or $0.66 per diluted share, a new second quarter EPS record. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory decreased by 4% to $367 million. The reduction in inventory is due to a 4% reduction in Retail segment comp inventory at cost. The reduction of inventory is not necessarily predictive of future sales growth, as we are currently doing a nice job of lowering our weeks of supply and getting faster turns out of our inventory as shown over previous quarters where our sales comp had outpaced our comp inventory growth. We ended the quarter with $328 million in cash and marketable securities. During the second quarter, we paid down $25 million of our outstanding revolver, leaving $50 million currently outstanding. 
As we enter the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 23 net new stores for the year, excluding our food and beverage division. For the third quarter, we are planning 6 new Anthropologie stores, including 1 new Anthropologie store in Europe, 2 new Urban Outfitters stores and 3 new Free People stores. For the year, we are planning on opening 3 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe; 7 net new Anthropologie stores, including 2 in Europe; and 13 net new Free People stores. For the full year fiscal 2017, we are also planning on opening 2 new Vetri pizzerias and 1 café adjacent to an Anthropologie large-format store. 
Now on to gross margin. We believe our third quarter gross margin rate could improve versus the prior year with that improvement in rate being slightly lower than the 142 basis points we achieved in the first half of the year. Our third quarter gross margin improvement could be largely driven by higher maintained margins at the Anthropologie Group and Urban Outfitters brands, which could be partially offset by declining gross profit rate at the Free People brand. Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a low double-digit rate for the third quarter. Please note that we recorded lower incentive-based and share-based compensation in the third quarter of the prior year, which is contributing to the increase in our SG&A growth rate for the third quarter of this year. For the year, we believe SG&A could grow at a high single-digit rate. We believe the growth will be driven by increased investments in marketing and technology expenses, hopefully helping to continue driving our double-digit direct-to-consumer channel sales gains. Store-related expenses are also expected to increase in order to support our square footage growth, which is planned at approximately 5% for fiscal year 2017. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $170 million. Total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new, relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center. 
Finally, we are still planning our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate to be approximately 37% for the year and believe our fourth quarter tax rate will be lower than the annual planned rate. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast, but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements. 
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Trish Donnelly, global CEO of the Urban Outfitters brand."

The Urban Outfitters global brand had a very exciting second quarter. We delivered record sales volume and drove a 5% Retail segment comp on top of the 4% comp increase from the previous year. Both the North",1364,"Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. The Urban Outfitters global brand had a very exciting second quarter. We delivered record sales volume and drove a 5% Retail segment comp on top of the 4% comp increase from the previous year. Both the North American and European businesses contributed to the success, with Europe delivering a solid comp despite the political backdrop in the U.K. Strong sales, partnered with improvements in merchandise margins and the team's focus on expense management, allowed us to deliver significant improvements in overall operating margin. 
During the quarter, the Urban Outfitters brand was able to achieve near record merchandise margins through tight inventory management and IMU focus, not to mention compelling trend-right products, creative and easy to shop visual presentations in stores and exceptional imagery with an easy-to-navigate user experience in our direct-to-consumer channel. The brand's strong partnership with our internal production team led by Chief Sourcing Officer, Barbara Rozsas, resulted in higher initial margins compared to prior years. Our attention to driving and developing a meaningful regular price business help to improve the global margin significantly. 
Now let me discuss in further detail the various initiatives contributing to the strong top line growth. The record volume in the quarter was driven by increases in regular price businesses across categories, geographies and channels. One of our biggest shifts in strategy across all merchandise categories has been our focus on exclusive product and offering our customer products he or she can get anywhere but Urban Outfitters. In addition to our own brand product, which is a 100% proprietary and a majority of the total assortment, we worked with key brand partners such as Adidas, Wrangler and Fila on special makeups, exclusive styles and UO collaboration. The ability to work creatively and collaboratively with brands we admire, who get Urban Outfitters and get our customer has been really rewarding and the response to our customers has been tremendous. We saw impressive growth in our all important women's apparel and accessories businesses across a variety of categories. At the end of the quarter, over 90% of our women's apparel assortment was available only at Urban Outfitters. Today, more than ever, product differentiation is critical, not just as a traffic driver to both direct-to-consumer and stores, but more importantly, it's an obligation we have to our core customer. Our customer looks to us for unique products and first to trend and exclusive products offering to ensure her she won't be wearing something offered anywhere else. 
Globally, the brand also saw impressive growth in what we've previously referred to as emerging categories, specifically intimates, home and beauty. Within intimates, we've had great response to our bras and undies programs as well as our exclusive bodies and colors in Calvin Klein. We're also seeing really nice traction in our lounge and dorm offerings, and we will continue to build upon the successes we've seen. 
In addition to intimates, we're seeing sizable growth and upside in our home division. This is an important category in the lives of our 18- to 28-year-old core customer, whether they're moving into their dorm room or their first apartment. The small space and on-campus home marketing campaigns and social posts were some of our most engaged in the quarter, averaging 6-figure customer likes on Instagram. Also during the quarter, we launched a Home Showroom and Space 15 Twenty in Los Angeles, one of our large-format stores. The showroom shopping experience is truly omni-channel, and we'll continue to refine and support this initiative. 
With the majority of our direct-to-consumer traffic coming through mobile devices, the direct and retail experiences need to be seamless, and URBN is committed to supporting this with the necessary team and resources. 
Our third emerging category, beauty, continue to see compounded comp growth and increase in penetration to the total business. Here, too, we've recognized the importance of exclusivity and first to market, and the beauty team has done a tremendous job curating our brand right assortment with partners and brands around the world. The unique and different, even in beauty, resonates with our customers and will continue to build out this special offering. 
This brings us to a new emerging category, music, which has always been part of Urban Outfitters' DNA and product mix. Today, we continue to offer  vinyl, turntables, cassettes and cassette players as well as wireless speakers and headphones with collaborators like Bang & Olufsen. 
In addition to the product side of the music category, we're also committed to delivering the experience. Digitally, we've been building out our music video series, UO Live. With tens of thousands of subscribers and views, it gives us another platform on which to connect with our customer while supporting our favorite artists and bands. Our UrbanOutfittersMusic Instagram is growing quickly with Mixtape previews and vinyl giveaways, our most engaged customer interaction. 
And finally, our men's business. Although still not where we wanted to be, the progress around the regular price business, particularly in a direct-to-consumer channel, is seeing great traction. We see a path to positive growth for the back half of the year, with strong and relevant product assortments, including own brand, branded, collaborations and exclusives, relevant and creative marketing strategies and easier to shop in-store visual merchandising set up. We've said from the beginning that the men's comp will follow women's, which is how it's actualizing. The leadership in men's design, in merchandising, planning, store visuals and brand marketing has been laser-focused on our customer, on the assortments and on compelling pricing. We're very excited about where the business is headed. 
In addition to our product and experience initiatives, we are in the process of globalizing our team. This change allows us to communicate a seamless global message and a consistent retail and direct-to-consumer experience while leveraging talent and creative assets across the globe. We are committed to pursuing long-term international growth. And this past quarter, we opened a new Urban Outfitters store in Utrecht, Netherlands, bringing our total store count in Europe and the U.K. to 44. In addition, we opened an Urban Outfitters concession within the Selfridges flagship on Oxford Street late in the quarter, and we're looking forward to seeing success here. 
On a global basis, I'm proud to say our brand saw improvements across all channels and all customer groups this quarter with new, retained and reactivated customer accounts increasing year-over-year. Another area where we've seen tremendous customer growth and audience engagement is in social media. Our Instagram followers exceeded the 5 million mark during the quarter, increasing 65% over the prior year, and we're now capturing over 200,000 new followers a month. In addition to our national Instagram account, our stores managed our local accounts, which accrued almost 700,000 followers and over 19 million likes in the quarter. Snapchat is important in our consumers' lives, and we're also seeing fast growth here with viewership increasing 25% month-over-month. Urban Outfitters was called out in L2's July Digital IQ Index for specialty retail as, ""the most prolific brand on the Snapchat platform, posting 6 times the index average with 83% featuring video content."" This channel has given us yet another relevant way to connect with our customers and engage in 2-way conversations. A great example of this occurred during LGBTQ Pride Month in June, where our Snapchat stories garnered close to 130,000 views. 
In the 24 months I've been with Urban Outfitters, I'm proud to say we have made progress. And although there is still a lot accomplish, there have been a number of positives. The results this past quarter could not have occurred without the exceptional leadership of the Urban Outfitters executive team, and I would like to thank each team member for their hard work, dedication and passion for the brand. Their focus on our customer and the collaborative culture they have created for their teams and colleagues have allowed the quarter successes to materialize. And finally, a very special thank you to Meg, whose partnership is invaluable. Her love of Urban Outfitters and for our customer inspires the teams daily and her contributions to this quarter success were critical. Thank you. 
I will now pass the call to Dick."
330706,375261018,1036097,"Urban Outfitters Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2016",2016-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Urban Outfitters, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Trish, and good afternoon, everyone. URBN produced a record sales and earnings per share in the second quarter, with comparable demand accelerating sequentially. May is typically our biggest month of the quarter, but as we suggested on our May con",1859,"Thanks, Trish, and good afternoon, everyone. URBN produced a record sales and earnings per share in the second quarter, with comparable demand accelerating sequentially. May is typically our biggest month of the quarter, but as we suggested on our May conference call, unseasonably cold weather in the eastern half of North America depressed and delayed apparel purchases. As a result, total Retail segment comparable sales in May were negative. Fortunately, the weather shifted in June and sales rebounded strongly. July sales jump even higher, generating the best comps of the quarter. 
Given the weak start to Q2, we're very pleased our final sales number show a positive Retail segment comp, and we're delighted to report record second quarter earnings per share. The monthly sales curve was similar across all brands, but overall results vary. 
So let me say a few words about each brand's performance. First, the Urban brand. As Trish just reported, Urban produced a terrific quarter. All major product categories posted positive comp sales except men's, and a number of categories delivered double-digit comps. Urban's European business also experienced strong comp gains with seemingly little impact on the business from the Brexit vote. Not only did the total Urban brand produced its best comps in 12 quarters, it also continued to deliver strong regular price sales; managed its leanest quarterly markdown rate as far back as brand records go; improved initial margins; administrate high inventory and expense controls; and created a flurry of outstanding marketing events and campaigns. All of these factors combined to create record second quarter sales and one of the most profitable second quarters in the brand's history. 
Brand momentum at the end of Q2 was powerful. Therefore, the team believes they will continue to please and excite customers with new fashion and new marketing campaigns in the second half. My congratulations go to Trish, Meg and the entire Urban Outfitters team on both sides of the Atlantic for planning and delivering an exceptional quarter. I'm so proud of what the team has accomplished over the past 2 years. Urban has now regained its position as a fashion leader for young adults, and I couldn't be more excited for the brand's future. 
Turning your attention to Free People. In Q2, the brand posted flat Retail segment comps and a mid-single-digit increase in wholesale sales. The brand opened 5 new stores during the quarter and achieved total Retail segment revenue growth of 8%. Almost all product categories in the Retail segment delivered positive comp sales in the quarter, with most of the gains driven by higher promotional activity. As we discussed on last quarter's call, Free People entered the second quarter with excess Retail segment inventory. The brand aggressively cleared this stock during the quarter by taking additional markdowns, which lifted sales, but depressed margins. I'm pleased to report that comparable Retail segment inventory at quarter's end fell by 8% on a year-over-year basis. Inventory is now more current and weeks of supply more in line with sales. As such, we believe the brand is positioned to deliver lower markdown rates in the second half than those experienced in Q2. Although the brand team has made significant progress in terms of inventory management, their goal is to further reduce the average weeks of supply. Looking forward, the brand is encouraged by some excellent early fall sign of its newest fashion offering, especially in this direct channel. Regular price sales in that channel are running nicely positive, but haven't been strong enough to overcome lower markdown sales and negative store sales, so total Retail segment sales are negative. The brand will continue to make adjustments to their assortments based on these early reads, but the team believes that Retail segment results, which are up against multiyear positive comparisons, could remain difficult in the back half. Meanwhile, the Free People Wholesale team continue to produce excellent quarterly results in spite of a difficult environment. The headwinds to growth in this channel have been well documented. Still, the team delivered a 4% increase in year-over-year sales in the quarter and 9% growth for the first half. This growth was driven by continued success in expanding categories such as FP Movement and significant growth in European business, where quarterly sales almost doubled versus the same period last year. 
The team believes there is significant wholesale growth opportunity remaining in Europe. Looking ahead, timing issues with the wholesale shipments in the third and fourth quarters last year create easier comparisons for Q3 while Q4 is more difficult. In spite of this, fall and holiday bookings are strong and team believes they can return to double-digit growth for the back half of the year. I thank Meg, Sheila, Dave and Chrissy and the entire Free People team. Although not their finest financial results, the quarter marked a return to fundamental discipline that will benefit the brand going forward. Given the enormous creativity housed within the brand, I'm confident that the Free People will continue to delight its customers with fresh fashion and inspiring environments. I'll take this opportunity also to recognize and congratulate Sheila Harrington on her recent promotion to the role of brand president, reporting to Meg. Sheila has been instrumental in growing the brand over her 13-year tenure at Free People, including extremely successful launches of all of the Free People product extensions from intimates to Movement. Sheila, thank you for your many contributions and congratulations to you. 
Next, I'll speak to the Anthropologie brand. Although the brand reported a negative 2.5% comp for the quarter, there were numerous bright spots to report. Anthropologie Europe delivered positive comp sales. Again, we saw no change in customer demand from the Brexit vote. Almost all our Anthropologie product categories performed well in the quarter with 6 of 7 generating double-digit positive comps. Only women's apparel was negative. Due to exceptional inventory management, the brand was able to limit markdowns in the apparel category and decreased the total markdown rate on a year-over-year basis by more than 100 basis points. This decrease in markdowns, in combination with very strong IMU improvement, drove significant year-over-year increases in merchandise margins on both a rate and dollar basis. The result, in spite of negative overall comps, Anthropologie generated more operating profits in Q2 this year than in the same period last year. 
Obviously, the team's focus is on turning the women's apparel business around, and I believe the brand is making slow but steady progress. Reaction to Anthropologie's apparel assortment on a comp basis improved sequentially in the quarter. Areas of strength include dresses, which registered strong double-digit comp gains, and woven tops, which improved as the season progress. The brand believes the apparel assortment will continue to evolve throughout the fall and holiday seasons and feels positive about their assortments in a growing number of apparel classifications. Certainly, reenergizing this category is the brand's #1 immediate goal. 
Strong performance of the expanding categories such as home, beauty, BHLDN and Terrain continues to be a brand highlight. All expanded categories are ahead of plan and are fueling the increases in the direct-to-consumer business and the stellar performance of the 2 new larger-format stores. Home is the most developed of these categories and continues to surprise on the upside. We're excited to see customer reaction to the September Home Journal, which will drop in mid-September and have 42% more pages than last year's book. The brand's beauty assortment is also connecting with the customer and show significant sales growth in both stores and online. By the holiday season, more than 130 Anthropologie stores will have a beauty shop-in-shop, up from 70 the prior year. The 2 younger brands, BHLDN and Terrain, which became part of the Anthropologie Group over the last few years, have benefited greatly from the ability to cross merchandise and leverage the Anthropologie Group's resources. Both have experienced significant revenue growth and positive comp sales. BHLDN has the potential to top $50 million in revenue this year and is quickly becoming our customers go-to destination for her special occasion. The long-term strategic importance of positive customer reaction to these product expansions and extensions, both in-store and online, can't be overstated. Nowhere is that reaction more clear than sales generated at the 2 newly expanded stores in Portland and Newport Beach. Last quarter, we reported on the phenomenal openings each of these larger-format stores had. Now, 3 months later, both stores continue to exceed their sales plan and, importantly, for the quarter, both stores averaged higher sales per square foot than the average Anthropologie store. I think that's extraordinary. While 1 quarter's results do not confirm a trend, should this metric continue, the long-term implications for the brand would be profound. Furthermore, the team believes there are many ways to enhance the assortment and experience of the stores and build sales even further. During the third quarter, Anthropologie plans to open 2 additional expanded stores, Walnut Creek and King of Prussia. The Palo Alto relocation and expansion is planned to open in the fourth quarter. My thanks go to David, Meg and the Anthropologie team for delivering an exceptionally profitable quarter, and I congratulate David and the team for successfully developing the Anthropologie expanded categories and larger-format stores. 
Before closing, I will briefly comment on trends in the market and summarize our accomplishments this quarter. 
Over the past several years, the complaint of lack of fashion has become common in the marketplace. I spoke to this subject on our conference call in March of this year. I actually said I'm not predicting exactly when a change in fashion will occur, but that I saw more fashion excitement in spring than I've seen in quite a few years. I repeat those comments again as we move into fall, except I believe the change is now upon us, and our customers are adapting to new looks and silhouettes as we speak. As in all such cycles, some customers and brands adopt newness faster than others, but the fact is there's currently an abundance of exciting fashion happening, and this is very good for our brands, for URBN and for our industry as a whole. 
Now to summarize URBN's accomplishments in the second quarter. During the quarter, we generated record sales with a 1% increase in Retail segment comp sales and a 4% gain in Wholesale sales and achieved these record sales with 4% Retail segment comp inventory decrease. We also drove strong record consumer sales in part by increasing our marketing spend, grew our year-over-year initial merchandise margins by almost 100 basis points, managed the markdowns with the lowest rate for any quarter in company history, delivered the highest maintained merchandise margin in recent history and earned $77 million in the quarter for a record $0.66 per share.
Finally, in closing, I thank our brand and shared service leaders and our 24,000 associates worldwide for their inspiring dedication, drive and creativity. I also recognize and thank our many partners around the world. And finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued support. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I now turn the call over for your questions."

As you know, we still have work to do, as I mentioned, in the Anthropologie brand, in some of the apparel classifications, but we saw nice sequential growth improvements there as well. And definitely, in the home categories, in the intimate categories and basically all their other categories performed very well.

In July, they actually saw a positive comp store sales in North America and in Europe. They had positive comp store sales. So yes, I think you can make the difference. I do believe that we shouldn't get too negative on stores. I think that there's no question there are too many stores in North America, and we start to see some of those stores going away. Some of the -- our competitors are closing stores at a reasonable rate and, of course, there was just the Macy's announcement of closing stores. So I think that you will continue to see a lot of stores close and go away, and I think that's a positive thing for the industry and a positive thing for all the people, including the ones that are closing the stores. But I don't think it's a problem with stores per se. I think the store concept is still valid. What I see happening over time is just fewer stores, but probably the store's larger and delivering more of a unique experience, which should complement their direct-to-consumer business. And I think that, that will be the winning combination. Also, if you don't mind me taking a second to talk about proprietary product, which a question you asked last quarter and gave me a lot of reason to think about it. Like Trish said, this proprietary product, I think, is one -- going to be one of the main drivers of differentiation in the marketplace going forward. As Trish said, almost 90% of the women's product was proprietary in the -- in Q2. With Free People Wholesale and Free People Retail, it's 100% and somewhere around 90%. And at Anthropologie, the women's apparel is somewhere around 80% proprietary. Our goal is to really have this proprietary product across all categories, not just in apparel. Currently, apparel has the highest penetration of proprietary product, but other categories like accessories and intimates, which are much less, are trending up. And we believe that, over time, they will maybe not exceed apparel but approach apparel.

But mostly, the inventory level opportunity was in how we distorted the product and the opportunities and learning and where the customer's moving more forward. As Dick alluded to earlier, all of URBN will be focusing on how to be faster speed to market, use more predictive tools and resources and, over time, lower inventories in total for the organization. As it relates to Anthropologie and the sequential growth, we did see that in Q2. However, when we look at the balance of the year, I wanted to remember that about 6 months ago, we launched with Meg and Barb. It's sort of overhaul of the Anthropologie's vision for archetypes, our process, speed to market. The teams have changed, and that's about 6 months ago. And we expect fall and holiday to be sort of similar to Q2, where the company will look similar to Q2's results and expanded product categories will outpace apparel's growth, yet still see opportunities to show improved merchandise margin over the prior year. That's even with apparel being soft for the balance of the year relative to comps."

I'll begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 record-setting second quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share some of our thoughts concerning our third quarter and the remaining -- remainder of fiscal year 2017. 
Total company or URBN sales for the second quarter increased by 3% to a second quarter record of $891 million. This increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a 4% increase in Wholesale segment sales and a $12 million increase in noncomp sales, including the opening of 8 net new stores in the quarter and sales from the newly acquired Vetri Family restaurants. 
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting another double-digit sales gain, driven by an increase in sessions and conversion rate, which more than offset the decrease in average order value. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and average unit selling price while units per transaction were flat. 
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 5% at Urban Outfitters, was flat at Free People -- at the Anthropologie Group. Our URBN Retail segment comp was the strongest in July followed by June, with May being the weakest. 
Free People Wholesale segment sales delivered another solid quarter as sales rose 4% to $75 million. These results were driven by increased space at select department store doors to support our category expansion like FP Movement and growth in our European accounts. 
Now moving on to gross profit. Total URBN gross profit for the quarter increased 8% to $343 million. Gross profit rate improved by 179 basis points to 38.5%. The improvement in gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvement in the Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie Group brands maintained margins with both brands delivering higher initial mark-ups and lower merchandise markdowns versus the previous year. Partially offsetting these improvements was a lower gross profit rate at the Free People brand primarily driven by lower maintained margins due to higher markdowns to clear slow-moving product. 
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 5% to $224 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 48 basis points to 25.2%. This SG&A deleverage was primarily due to an increase in direct marketing and technology-related expenses to support our strong direct-to-consumer growth. Direct store controllable expenses also increased in the quarter in order to support our square footage growth of 4% in the quarter. 
Operating income for the quarter increased by 14% to $118 million with operating profit margin improving by 131 basis points to 13.3%. Our tax rate for the quarter was 35.5% compared to 35.2% in the prior year. Net income in the quarter was $77 million or $0.66 per diluted share, a new second quarter EPS record. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory decreased by 4% to $367 million. The reduction in inventory is due to a 4% reduction in Retail segment comp inventory at cost. The reduction of inventory is not necessarily predictive of future sales growth as we are currently doing a nice job of lowering our weeks of supply and getting faster turns out of our inventory as shown over previous quarters where our sales comp had outpaced our comp inventory growth. We ended the quarter with $328 million in cash and marketable securities. During the second quarter, we paid down $25 million of our outstanding revolver, leaving $50 million currently outstanding. 
As we enter the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 23 net new stores for the year, excluding our food and beverage division. For the third quarter, we are planning 6 new Anthropologie stores, including 1 new Anthropologie store in Europe, 2 new Urban Outfitters stores and 3 new Free People stores. For the year, we are planning on opening 3 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe; 7 net new Anthropologie stores, including 2 in Europe; and 13 net new Free People stores. For the full year fiscal 2017, we're also planning on opening 2 new Vetri pizzerias and 1 café adjacent to an Anthropologie large-format store. 
Now on to gross margin. We believe our third quarter gross margin rate could improve versus the prior year with that improvement in rate being slightly lower than the 142 basis points we achieved in the first half of the year. Our third quarter gross margin improvement could be largely driven by higher maintained margins at the Anthropologie Group and Urban Outfitters brands, which could be partially offset by declining gross profit rate at the Free People brand. Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a low double-digit rate for the third quarter. 
Please note that we recorded lower incentive-based and share-based compensation in the third quarter of the prior year, which is contributing to the increase in our SG&A growth rate for the third quarter of this year. For the year, we believe SG&A could grow at a high single-digit rate. We believe the growth will be driven by increased investment in marketing and technology expenses, hopefully helping to continue driving our double-digit direct-to-consumer channel sales gains. 
Store-related expenses are also expected to increase in order to support our square footage growth, which is planned at approximately 5% for fiscal year 2017. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $170 million. Total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new, relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center. 
Finally, we are still planning our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate to be approximately 37% for the year and believe our fourth quarter tax rate will be lower than the annual planned rate. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements. 
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Trish Donnelly, global CEO of the Urban Outfitters brand."

The Urban Outfitters global brand had a very exciting second quarter. We delivered record sales volume and drove a 5% Retail segment comp on top of the 4% comp increase from the previous year. Both the North",1352,"Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. The Urban Outfitters global brand had a very exciting second quarter. We delivered record sales volume and drove a 5% Retail segment comp on top of the 4% comp increase from the previous year. Both the North American and European businesses contributed to the success with Europe delivering a solid comp despite the political backdrop in the U.K. Strong sales partnered with improvements in merchandise margins and the team's focus on expense management allowed us to deliver significant improvements in overall operating margin. 
During the quarter, the Urban Outfitters brand was able to achieve near record merchandise margins through tight inventory management and IMU focus, not to mention compelling trend-right products, creative and easy-to-shop visual presentations in stores and exceptional imagery with an easy-to-navigate user experience in our direct-to-consumer channel. The brand's strong partnership with our internal production team, led by Chief Sourcing Officer Barbara Rozsas, resulted in higher initial margins compared to prior years. Our attention to driving and developing a meaningful regular price business helped improve the global margin significantly. 
Now let me discuss in further detail the various initiatives contributing to the strong top line growth. The record volume in the quarter was driven by increases in regular price businesses across categories, geographies and channels. One of our biggest shifts in strategy across all merchandise categories has been our focus on exclusive product and offering our customer products he or she can't get anywhere but Urban Outfitters. 
In addition to our own brand product, which is 100% proprietary and a majority of the total assortment, we worked with key brand partners such as Adidas, Wrangler and Fila on special makeups, exclusive styles and UO collaboration. The ability to work creatively and collaboratively with brands we admire who get Urban Outfitters and get our customer has been really rewarding, and the response to our customers has been tremendous. 
We saw impressive growth in our all-important women's apparel and accessories businesses across a variety of categories. At the end of the quarter, over 90% of our women's apparel assortment was available only at Urban Outfitters. Today more than ever, product differentiation is critical, not just as a traffic driver to both direct-to-consumer and stores, but more importantly, it's an obligation we have to our core customer. Our customer looks to us for unique products and first to trend, and exclusive products offerings ensure her she won't be wearing something offered anywhere else. 
Globally, the brand also saw impressive growth in what we've previously referred to as emerging categories, specifically intimates, home and beauty. Within intimates, we've had great response to our bras and undies programs as well as our exclusive bodies and colors in Calvin Klein. We're also seeing really nice traction in our lounge and dorm offerings, and we will continue to build upon the successes we've seen. 
In addition to intimates, we're seeing sizable growth and upside in our home division. This is an important category in the lives of our 18- to 28-year-old core customer, whether they're moving into their dorm room or their first apartment. The small space and on-campus home marketing campaigns and social posts were some of our most engaged in the quarter, averaging 6-figure customer likes on Instagram. Also during the quarter, we launched a Home Showroom in Space 15 Twenty in Los Angeles, one of our large-format stores. The showroom shopping experience is truly omnichannel, and we'll continue to refine and support this initiative. 
With the majority of our direct-to-consumer traffic coming through mobile devices, the direct and retail experiences need to be seamless, and URBN is committed to supporting this with the necessary team and resources. 
Our third emerging category, beauty, continues to see compounded comp growth and increase in penetration to the total business. Here, too, we recognize the importance of exclusivity and first to market, and the beauty team has done a tremendous job curating our brand-right assortment with partners and brands around the world. The unique and different, even in beauty, resonates with our customers and will continue to build out this special offering. 
This brings us to a new emerging category, music, which has always been part of Urban Outfitters' DNA and product mix. Today, we continue to offer  vinyl, turntables, cassettes and cassette players as well as wireless speakers and headphones with collaborators like Bang & Olufsen. 
In addition to the product side of the music category, we're also committed to delivering the experience. Digitally, we've been building out our music video series, UO Live. With tens of thousands of subscribers and views, it gives us another platform on which to connect with our customer while supporting our favorite artists and bands. Our urbanoutfittersmusic Instagram is growing quickly with Mixtape previews and vinyl giveaways our most engaged customer interactions. 
And finally, our men's business. Although still not where we want it to be, the progress around the regular price business, particularly in a direct-to-consumer channel, is seeing great traction. We see a path to positive growth for the back half of the year with strong and relevant product assortments, including own brand, branded, collaborations and exclusives, relevant and creative marketing strategies, and easier-to-shop in-store visual merchandising setups. 
We've said from the beginning that the men's comp will follow women's, which is how it's actualizing. The leadership in men's design, in merchandising, planning, store visuals and brand marketing has been laser-focused on our customer, on the assortment and on compelling pricing. We're very excited about where the business is headed. 
In addition to our product and experience initiatives, we are in the process of globalizing our team. This change allows us to communicate a seamless global message and a consistent retail and direct-to-consumer experience while leveraging talent and creative assets across the globe. We are committed to pursuing long-term international growth. And this past quarter, we opened a new Urban Outfitters store in Utrecht, Netherlands, bringing our total store count in Europe and the U.K. to 44. In addition, we opened an Urban Outfitters concession within the Selfridges flagship on Oxford Street late in the quarter, and we're looking forward to seeing success here. 
On a global basis, I'm proud to say our brand saw improvements across all channels in all customer groups this quarter with new, retained and reactivated customer accounts increasing year-over-year. Another area where we've seen tremendous customer growth and audience engagement is in social media. Our Instagram followers exceeded the 5 million mark during the quarter, increasing 65% over the prior year, and we're now capturing over 200,000 new followers a month. In addition to our national Instagram account, our stores managed our local accounts, which accrued almost 700,000 followers and over 19 million likes in the quarter. 
Snapchat is important in our consumers' lives, and we're also seeing fast growth here with viewership increasing 25% month-over-month. Urban Outfitters was called out in L2's July Digital IQ Index for specialty retail as, ""the most prolific brand on the Snapchat platform, posting 6 times the index average with 83% featuring video content."" This channel has given us yet another relevant way to connect with our customers and engage in 2-way conversations. A great example of this occurred during LGBTQ Pride Month in June, where our Snapchat stories garnered close to 130,000 views. 
In the 24 months I've been with Urban Outfitters, I'm proud to say we've made progress. And although there's still a lot accomplish, there have been a number of positives. The results this past quarter could not have occurred without the exceptional leadership of the Urban Outfitters executive team, and I would like to thank each team member for their hard work, dedication and passion for the brand. Their focus on our customer and the collaborative culture they've created for their teams and colleagues have allowed the quarter's successes to materialize. 
And finally, a very special thank you to Meg, whose partnership is invaluable. Her love of Urban Outfitters and for our customer inspires the teams daily and her contributions to this quarter's success were critical. Thank you. 
I will now pass the call to Dick."
330706,375261018,1036168,"Urban Outfitters Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2016",2016-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Urban Outfitters, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Trish, and good afternoon, everyone. URBN produced record sales and earnings per share in the second quarter with comparable demand accelerating sequentially. May is typically our biggest month of the quarter, but as we suggested on our May confer",1856,"Thanks, Trish, and good afternoon, everyone. URBN produced record sales and earnings per share in the second quarter with comparable demand accelerating sequentially. May is typically our biggest month of the quarter, but as we suggested on our May conference call, unseasonably cold weather in the eastern half of North America depressed and delayed apparel purchases. As a result, total Retail segment comparable sales in May were negative. Fortunately, the weather shifted in June and sales rebounded strongly. July sales jumped even higher, generating the best comps of the quarter. 
Given the weak start to Q2, we're very pleased our final sales number show a positive Retail segment comp, and we're delighted to report record second quarter earnings per share. The monthly sales curve was similar across all brands, but overall results varied. 
So let me say a few words about each brand's performance. First, the Urban brand. As Trish just reported, Urban produced a terrific quarter. All major product categories posted positive comp sales except men's, and a number of categories delivered double-digit comps. Urban's European business also experienced strong comp gains with seemingly little impact on the business from the Brexit vote. Not only did the total Urban brand produce its best comps in 12 quarters, it also continued to deliver strong regular price sales; managed its leanest quarterly markdown rate as far back as brand records go; improved initial margins; administrate high inventory and expense controls; and created a flurry of outstanding marketing events and campaigns. All of these factors combined to create record second quarter sales and one of the most profitable second quarters in the brand's history. 
Brand momentum at the end of Q2 was powerful. Therefore, the team believes they will continue to please and excite customers with new fashion and new marketing campaigns in the second half. 
My congratulations go to Trish, Meg and the entire Urban Outfitters team on both sides of the Atlantic for planning and delivering an exceptional quarter. I'm so proud of what the team has accomplished over the past 2 years. Urban has now regained its position as a fashion leader for young adults, and I couldn't be more excited for the brand's future. 
Turning your attention to Free People. In Q2, the brand posted flat Retail segment comps and a mid-single-digit increase in wholesale sales. The brand opened 5 new stores during the quarter and achieved total Retail segment revenue growth of 8%. Almost all product categories in the Retail segment delivered positive comp sales in the quarter with most of the gains driven by higher promotional activity. 
As we discussed on last quarter's call, Free People entered the second quarter with excess Retail segment inventory. The brand aggressively cleared this stock during the quarter by taking additional markdowns, which lifted sales but depressed margins. I'm pleased to report that comparable Retail segment inventory at quarter's end fell by 8% on a year-over-year basis. Inventory is now more current and weeks of supply more in line with sales. 
As such, we believe the brand is positioned to deliver lower markdown rates in the second half than those experienced in Q2. Although the brand team has made significant progress in terms of inventory management, their goal is to further reduce the average weeks of supply. 
Looking forward, the brand is encouraged by some excellent early fall sign of its newest fashion offering, especially in its direct channel. Regular price sales in that channel are running nicely positive but haven't been strong enough to overcome lower markdown sales and negative store sales, so total Retail segment sales are negative. The brand will continue to make adjustments to their assortments based on these early reads, but the team believes that Retail segment results, which are up against multiyear positive comparisons, could remain difficult in the back half. 
Meanwhile, the Free People Wholesale team continue to produce excellent quarterly results in spite of a difficult environment. The headwinds to growth in this channel have been well documented. Still, the team delivered a 4% increase in year-over-year sales in the quarter and 9% growth for the first half. This growth was driven by continued success in expanding categories such as FP Movement and significant growth in European business where quarterly sales almost doubled versus the same period last year. 
The team believes there is significant wholesale growth opportunity remaining in Europe. Looking ahead, timing issues with the wholesale shipments in the third and fourth quarters last year create easier comparisons for Q3 while Q4 is more difficult. In spite of this, fall and holiday bookings are strong and team believes they can return to double-digit growth for the back half of the year. I thank Meg, Sheila, Dave and Krissy and the entire Free People team. Although not their finest financial results, the quarter marked a return to fundamental discipline that will benefit the brand going forward. Given the enormous creativity housed within the brand, I'm confident that Free People will continue to delight its customers with fresh fashion and inspiring environments. 
I'll take this opportunity also to recognize and congratulate Sheila Harrington on her recent promotion to the role of brand president, reporting to Meg. Sheila has been instrumental in growing the brand over her 13-year tenure at Free People, including extremely successful launches of all of the Free People product extensions from intimates to Movement. Sheila, thank you for your many contributions and congratulations to you. 
Next, I'll speak to the Anthropologie brand. Although the brand reported a negative 2.5% comp for the quarter, there were numerous bright spots to report. Anthropologie Europe delivered positive comp sales. Again, we saw no change in customer demand from the Brexit vote. Almost all Anthropologie product categories performed well in the quarter with 6 of 7 generating double-digit positive comps. Only women's apparel was negative. 
Due to exceptional inventory management, the brand was able to limit markdowns in the apparel category and decrease the total markdown rate on a year-over-year basis by more than 100 basis points. This decrease in markdowns, in combination with very strong IMU improvement, drove significant year-over-year increases in merchandise margins on both a rate and dollar basis. The result, in spite of negative overall comps, Anthropologie generated more operating profits in Q2 this year than in the same period last year. 
Obviously, the team's focus is on turning the women's apparel business around, and I believe the brand is making slow but steady progress. Reaction to Anthropologie's apparel assortment on a comp basis improved sequentially in the quarter. Areas of strength include dresses, which registered strong double-digit comp gains, and woven tops, which improved as the season progressed. The brand believes the apparel assortment will continue to evolve throughout the fall and holiday seasons and feels positive about their assortments in a growing number of apparel classifications. Certainly, reenergizing this category is the brand's #1 immediate goal. 
Strong performance of the expanded categories, such as home, beauty, BHLDN and Terrain continues to be a brand highlight. All expanded categories are ahead of plan and are fueling the increases in the direct-to-consumer business and the stellar performance of the 2 new larger-format stores. 
Home is the most developed of these categories and continues to surprise on the upside. We're excited to see customer reaction to the September Home Journal, which will drop in mid-September and have 42% more pages than last year's book. 
The brand's beauty assortment is also connecting with the customer and shows significant sales growth in both stores and online. By the holiday season, more than 130 Anthropologie stores will have a beauty shop-in-shop, up from 70 the prior year. The 2 younger brands, BHLDN and Terrain, which became part of the Anthropologie Group over the last few years, have benefited greatly from the ability to cross merchandise and leverage the Anthropologie Group's resources. Both have experienced significant revenue growth and positive comp sales. 
BHLDN has the potential to top $50 million in revenue this year and is quickly becoming our customer's go-to destination for her special occasion. The long-term strategic importance of positive customer reaction to these product expansions and extensions, both in-store and online, can't be overstated. 
Nowhere is that reaction more clear than sales generated at the 2 newly expanded stores in Portland and Newport Beach. Last quarter, we reported on the phenomenal openings each of these larger-format stores had. Now, 3 months later, both stores continue to exceed their sales plan and, importantly, for the quarter, both stores average higher sales per square foot than the average Anthropologie store. I think that's extraordinary. While 1 quarter's results do not confirm a trend, should this metric continue, the long-term implications for the brand would be profound. Furthermore, the team believes there are many ways to enhance the assortment and experience of these stores and build sales even further. 
During the third quarter, Anthropologie plans to open 2 additional expanded stores: Walnut Creek and King of Prussia. The Palo Alto relocation and expansion is planned to open in the fourth quarter. 
My thanks go to David, Meg and the Anthropologie team for delivering an exceptionally profitable quarter, and I congratulate David and the team for successfully developing the Anthropologie expanded categories and larger-format stores. 
Before closing, I will briefly comment on trends in the market and summarize our accomplishments this quarter. Over the past several years, the complaint of lack of fashion has become common in the marketplace. I spoke to this subject on our conference call in March of this year. I actually said I'm not predicting exactly when a change in fashion will occur but that I saw more fashion excitement in spring than I've seen in quite a few years. I repeat those comments again as we move into fall, except I believe the change is now upon us, and our customers are adapting to new looks and silhouettes as we speak. As in all such cycles, some customers and brands adopt newness faster than others, but the fact is there's currently an abundance of exciting fashion happening, and this is very good for our brands, for URBN and for our industry as a whole. 
Now to summarize URBN's accomplishments in the second quarter. During the quarter, we generated record sales with a 1% increase in Retail segment comp sales and a 4% gain in Wholesale sales and achieved these record sales with 4% Retail segment comp inventory decrease. We also drove strong record consumer sales in part by increasing our marketing spend, grew our year-over-year initial merchandise margins by almost 100 basis points, managed the markdowns to the lowest rate for any quarter in company history, delivered the highest maintained merchandise margin in recent history and earned $77 million in the quarter for a record $0.66 per share.
Finally, in closing, I thank our brand and shared service leaders and our 24,000 associates worldwide for their inspiring dedication, drive and creativity. I also recognize and thank our many partners around the world. And finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued support. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I now turn the call over for your questions."

As I said in my opening statement, there was a weather factor, and I think there was depressed demand in May. And we saw a lot of that demand come back in both June and July, but we did see sequential progress in demand over those 3 months. And I attribute that to much better planning on the Urban front this year than last year, stronger product assortments in every major classification. And I think Trish was a little reticent to talk about men's, but we're even seeing it in men's now in Urban. So I feel very strongly about Urban. As you know, we still have work to do, as I mentioned, in the Anthropologie brand, in some of the apparel classifications, but we saw nice sequential growth improvements there as well. And definitely, in the home categories, in the intimate categories and basically all their other categories performed very well. And then -- and Free People, as I said in my prepared remarks, we've gotten some very nice reads online in the new apparel offerings. Some of the other businesses are softer than we want, and we're making adjustments in those categories. So I think that we've got a lot of momentum going into Q3, particularly in the Urban business. It's pretty strong, and congratulations to Trish and Meg and her team for really engineering that."

I think that Urban is definitely benefiting from a lot of the initiatives they're doing, not just the good fashion but the social media work that they're doing and the marketing work they're doing. In July, they actually saw a positive comp store sales in North America and in Europe. They had positive comp store sales. So yes, I think you can make the difference. I do believe that we shouldn't get too negative on stores. I think that there's no question there are too many stores in North America, and we start to see some of those stores going away. Some of the -- our competitors are closing stores at a reasonable rate and, of course, there was just the Macy's announcement of closing stores. So I think that you will continue to see a lot of stores close and go away, and I think that's a positive thing for the industry and a positive thing for all the people, including the ones that are closing the stores. But I don't think it's a problem with stores, per se. I think the store concept is still valid. What I see happening over time is just fewer stores but probably the store is larger and delivering more of a unique experience, which should complement [ph] their direct-to-consumer business. And I think that, that'll be the winning combination. Also, if you don't mind me taking a second to talk about proprietary product, which is a question you asked last quarter and gave me a lot of reason to think about it. Like Trish said, this proprietary product, I think, is one -- going to be one of the main drivers of differentiation in the marketplace going forward. As Trish said, almost 90% of the women's product was proprietary in the -- in Q2. With Free People Wholesale and Free People Retail, it's 100% and somewhere around 90%. And at Anthropologie, the women's apparel is somewhere around 80% proprietary. Our goal is to really have this proprietary product across all categories, not just in apparel. Currently, apparel is the highest penetration of proprietary product, but other categories like accessories and intimates, which are much less, are trending up. And we believe that, over time, they will, maybe not exceed apparel but approach apparel. So our goal is to offer these experiences in stores that it's impossible for customers to get any other place than one of our brands."

But mostly the inventory level opportunity was in how we distorted the product and the opportunities in learning and where the customer is moving more forward. As Dick alluded to earlier, all of URBN will be focusing on how to be faster speed to market, use more predictive tools and resources and, over time, lower inventories in total for the organization. As it relates to Anthropologie and the sequential growth, we did see that in Q2. However, when we look at the balance of the year, I wanted to remember that about 6 months ago we launched with Meg and Barb a sort of overhaul of Anthropologie's vision for archetypes, our process, speed to market. The teams have changed, and that's about 6 months ago. And we expect fall and holiday to be sort of similar to Q2 where the company will look similar to Q2's results and expanded product categories will outpace apparel's growth yet still see opportunities to show improved merchandise margin over the prior year. That's even with apparel being soft for the balance of the year relative to comps."

It also gets around the customer and her appetite for the brand. And like all of the URBN brands, product category expansions have been a wonderful opportunity for us. The first -- it's only been 3 months, but she certainly seems to be enjoying the experience and the product offer, and we're still working through and learning how to operate and maximize in an opportunity. As Dick said, we believe with what's going on in the digital environment that it's more important that offer -- our offer be -- not only will our offer be compelling but the in-store experience be compelling. And we think these are very experiential, including what Dave Ziel's team is adding in terms of dining and every -- all these product categories in our new service selling model. We're opening, hopefully, 3 more this year. We have slated loosely 4 to 5 the following year. And if these results were to continue, we'd hope to see what this also activates the broader assortments online, which will blur both. So we're, again, very early in stages in terms of time, and the categories have lots of upside. But like you intimated, we think this is a very healthy sign from our customer acknowledgment of the strategy."

I'll begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 record-setting second quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share some of our thoughts concerning our third quarter and the remaining -- remainder of fiscal year 2017. 
Total company or URBN sales for the second quarter increased by 3% to a second quarter record of $891 million. This increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a 4% increase in Wholesale segment sales and a $12 million increase in noncomp sales, including the opening of 8 net new stores in the quarter and sales from the newly acquired Vetri Family restaurants. 
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting another double-digit sales gain, driven by an increase in sessions and conversion rate, which more than offset the decrease in average order value. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and average unit selling price while units per transaction were flat. 
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 5% at Urban Outfitters, was flat at Free People -- at the Anthropologie Group. Our URBN Retail segment comp was the strongest in July followed by June, with May being the weakest. 
Free People Wholesale segment sales delivered another solid quarter as sales rose 4% to $75 million. These results were driven by increased space at select department store doors to support our category expansion like FP Movement and growth in our European accounts. 
Now moving on to gross profit. Total URBN gross profit for the quarter increased 8% to $343 million. Gross profit rate improved by 179 basis points to 38.5%. The improvement in gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvement in the Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie Group brands maintained margins with both brands delivering higher initial mark-ups and lower merchandise markdowns versus the previous year. Partially offsetting these improvements was a lower gross profit rate at the Free People brand primarily driven by lower maintained margins due to higher markdowns to clear slow-moving product. 
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 5% to $224 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 48 basis points to 25.2%. This SG&A deleverage was primarily due to an increase in direct marketing and technology-related expenses to support our strong direct-to-consumer growth. Direct store controllable expenses also increased in the quarter in order to support our square footage growth of 4% in the quarter. 
Operating income for the quarter increased by 14% to $118 million with operating profit margin improving by 131 basis points to 13.3%. Our tax rate for the quarter was 35.5% compared to 35.2% in the prior year. Net income in the quarter was $77 million or $0.66 per diluted share, a new second quarter EPS record. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory decreased by 4% to $367 million. The reduction in inventory is due to a 4% reduction in Retail segment comp inventory at cost. The reduction of inventory is not necessarily predictive of future sales growth as we are currently doing a nice job of lowering our weeks of supply and getting faster turns out of our inventory as shown over previous quarters where our sales comp had outpaced our comp inventory growth. We ended the quarter with $328 million in cash and marketable securities. During the second quarter, we paid down $25 million of our outstanding revolver, leaving $50 million currently outstanding. 
As we enter the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 23 net new stores for the year, excluding our food and beverage division. For the third quarter, we are planning 6 new Anthropologie stores, including 1 new Anthropologie store in Europe, 2 new Urban Outfitters stores and 3 new Free People stores. For the year, we are planning on opening 3 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe; 7 net new Anthropologie stores, including 2 in Europe; and 13 net new Free People stores. For the full year fiscal 2017, we're also planning on opening 2 new Vetri pizzerias and 1 café adjacent to an Anthropologie large-format store. 
Now on to gross margin. We believe our third quarter gross margin rate could improve versus the prior year with that improvement in rate being slightly lower than the 142 basis points we achieved in the first half of the year. Our third quarter gross margin improvement could be largely driven by higher maintained margins at the Anthropologie Group and Urban Outfitters brands, which could be partially offset by declining gross profit rate at the Free People brand. Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a low double-digit rate for the third quarter. 
Please note that we recorded lower incentive-based and share-based compensation in the third quarter of the prior year, which is contributing to the increase in our SG&A growth rate for the third quarter of this year. For the year, we believe SG&A could grow at a high single-digit rate. We believe the growth will be driven by increased investment in marketing and technology expenses, hopefully helping to continue driving our double-digit direct-to-consumer channel sales gains. 
Store-related expenses are also expected to increase in order to support our square footage growth, which is planned at approximately 5% for fiscal year 2017. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $170 million. Total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new, relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center. 
Finally, we are still planning our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate to be approximately 37% for the year and believe our fourth quarter tax rate will be lower than the annual planned rate. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements. 
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Trish Donnelly, global CEO of the Urban Outfitters brand."

The Urban Outfitters global brand had a very exciting second quarter. We delivered record sales volume and drove a 5% Retail segment comp on top of the 4% comp increase from the previous year. Both the North",1352,"Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. The Urban Outfitters global brand had a very exciting second quarter. We delivered record sales volume and drove a 5% Retail segment comp on top of the 4% comp increase from the previous year. Both the North American and European businesses contributed to the success with Europe delivering a solid comp despite the political backdrop in the U.K. Strong sales partnered with improvements in merchandise margins and the team's focus on expense management allowed us to deliver significant improvements in overall operating margin. 
During the quarter, the Urban Outfitters brand was able to achieve near record merchandise margins through tight inventory management and IMU focus, not to mention compelling trend-right products, creative and easy-to-shop visual presentations in stores and exceptional imagery with an easy-to-navigate user experience in our direct-to-consumer channel. The brand's strong partnership with our internal production team, led by Chief Sourcing Officer Barbara Rozsas, resulted in higher initial margins compared to prior years. Our attention to driving and developing a meaningful regular price business helped improve the global margin significantly. 
Now let me discuss in further detail the various initiatives contributing to the strong top line growth. The record volume in the quarter was driven by increases in regular price businesses across categories, geographies and channels. One of our biggest shifts in strategy across all merchandise categories has been our focus on exclusive product and offering our customer products he or she can't get anywhere but Urban Outfitters. 
In addition to our own brand product, which is 100% proprietary and a majority of the total assortment, we worked with key brand partners such as Adidas, Wrangler and Fila on special makeups, exclusive styles and UO collaboration. The ability to work creatively and collaboratively with brands we admire who get Urban Outfitters and get our customer has been really rewarding, and the response to our customers has been tremendous. 
We saw impressive growth in our all-important women's apparel and accessories businesses across a variety of categories. At the end of the quarter, over 90% of our women's apparel assortment was available only at Urban Outfitters. Today more than ever, product differentiation is critical, not just as a traffic driver to both direct-to-consumer and stores, but more importantly, it's an obligation we have to our core customer. Our customer looks to us for unique products and first to trend, and exclusive products offerings ensure her she won't be wearing something offered anywhere else. 
Globally, the brand also saw impressive growth in what we've previously referred to as emerging categories, specifically intimates, home and beauty. Within intimates, we've had great response to our bras and undies programs as well as our exclusive bodies and colors in Calvin Klein. We're also seeing really nice traction in our lounge and dorm offerings, and we will continue to build upon the successes we've seen. 
In addition to intimates, we're seeing sizable growth and upside in our home division. This is an important category in the lives of our 18- to 28-year-old core customer, whether they're moving into their dorm room or their first apartment. The small space and on-campus home marketing campaigns and social posts were some of our most engaged in the quarter, averaging 6-figure customer likes on Instagram. Also during the quarter, we launched a Home Showroom in Space 15 Twenty in Los Angeles, one of our large-format stores. The showroom shopping experience is truly omnichannel, and we'll continue to refine and support this initiative. 
With the majority of our direct-to-consumer traffic coming through mobile devices, the direct and retail experiences need to be seamless, and URBN is committed to supporting this with the necessary team and resources. 
Our third emerging category, beauty, continues to see compounded comp growth and increase in penetration to the total business. Here, too, we recognize the importance of exclusivity and first to market, and the beauty team has done a tremendous job curating our brand-right assortment with partners and brands around the world. The unique and different, even in beauty, resonates with our customers and will continue to build out this special offering. 
This brings us to a new emerging category, music, which has always been part of Urban Outfitters' DNA and product mix. Today, we continue to offer  vinyl, turntables, cassettes and cassette players as well as wireless speakers and headphones with collaborators like Bang & Olufsen. 
In addition to the product side of the music category, we're also committed to delivering the experience. Digitally, we've been building out our music video series, UO Live. With tens of thousands of subscribers and views, it gives us another platform on which to connect with our customer while supporting our favorite artists and bands. Our urbanoutfittersmusic Instagram is growing quickly with Mixtape previews and vinyl giveaways our most engaged customer interactions. 
And finally, our men's business. Although still not where we want it to be, the progress around the regular price business, particularly in a direct-to-consumer channel, is seeing great traction. We see a path to positive growth for the back half of the year with strong and relevant product assortments, including own brand, branded, collaborations and exclusives, relevant and creative marketing strategies, and easier-to-shop in-store visual merchandising setups. 
We've said from the beginning that the men's comp will follow women's, which is how it's actualizing. The leadership in men's design, in merchandising, planning, store visuals and brand marketing has been laser-focused on our customer, on the assortment and on compelling pricing. We're very excited about where the business is headed. 
In addition to our product and experience initiatives, we are in the process of globalizing our team. This change allows us to communicate a seamless global message and a consistent retail and direct-to-consumer experience while leveraging talent and creative assets across the globe. We are committed to pursuing long-term international growth. And this past quarter, we opened a new Urban Outfitters store in Utrecht, Netherlands, bringing our total store count in Europe and the U.K. to 44. In addition, we opened an Urban Outfitters concession within the Selfridges flagship on Oxford Street late in the quarter, and we're looking forward to seeing success here. 
On a global basis, I'm proud to say our brand saw improvements across all channels in all customer groups this quarter with new, retained and reactivated customer accounts increasing year-over-year. Another area where we've seen tremendous customer growth and audience engagement is in social media. Our Instagram followers exceeded the 5 million mark during the quarter, increasing 65% over the prior year, and we're now capturing over 200,000 new followers a month. In addition to our national Instagram account, our stores managed our local accounts, which accrued almost 700,000 followers and over 19 million likes in the quarter. 
Snapchat is important in our consumers' lives, and we're also seeing fast growth here with viewership increasing 25% month-over-month. Urban Outfitters was called out in L2's July Digital IQ Index for specialty retail as, ""the most prolific brand on the Snapchat platform, posting 6 times the index average with 83% featuring video content."" This channel has given us yet another relevant way to connect with our customers and engage in 2-way conversations. A great example of this occurred during LGBTQ Pride Month in June, where our Snapchat stories garnered close to 130,000 views. 
In the 24 months I've been with Urban Outfitters, I'm proud to say we've made progress. And although there's still a lot accomplish, there have been a number of positives. The results this past quarter could not have occurred without the exceptional leadership of the Urban Outfitters executive team, and I would like to thank each team member for their hard work, dedication and passion for the brand. Their focus on our customer and the collaborative culture they've created for their teams and colleagues have allowed the quarter's successes to materialize. 
And finally, a very special thank you to Meg, whose partnership is invaluable. Her love of Urban Outfitters and for our customer inspires the teams daily and her contributions to this quarter's success were critical. Thank you. 
I will now pass the call to Dick."
330706,375261018,1036360,"Urban Outfitters Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2016",2016-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Urban Outfitters, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Trish, and good afternoon, everyone. URBN produced record sales and earnings per share in the second quarter with comparable demand accelerating sequentially. May is typically our biggest month of the quarter, but as we suggested on our May confer",1856,"Thanks, Trish, and good afternoon, everyone. URBN produced record sales and earnings per share in the second quarter with comparable demand accelerating sequentially. May is typically our biggest month of the quarter, but as we suggested on our May conference call, unseasonably cold weather in the eastern half of North America depressed and delayed apparel purchases. As a result, total Retail segment comparable sales in May were negative. Fortunately, the weather shifted in June and sales rebounded strongly. July sales jumped even higher, generating the best comps of the quarter. 
Given the weak start to Q2, we're very pleased our final sales number show a positive Retail segment comp, and we're delighted to report record second quarter earnings per share. The monthly sales curve was similar across all brands, but overall results varied. 
So let me say a few words about each brand's performance. First, the Urban brand. As Trish just reported, Urban produced a terrific quarter. All major product categories posted positive comp sales except men's, and a number of categories delivered double-digit comps. Urban's European business also experienced strong comp gains with seemingly little impact on the business from the Brexit vote. Not only did the total Urban brand produce its best comps in 12 quarters, it also continued to deliver strong regular price sales; managed its leanest quarterly markdown rate as far back as brand records go; improved initial margins; administrate high inventory and expense controls; and created a flurry of outstanding marketing events and campaigns. All of these factors combined to create record second quarter sales and one of the most profitable second quarters in the brand's history. 
Brand momentum at the end of Q2 was powerful. Therefore, the team believes they will continue to please and excite customers with new fashion and new marketing campaigns in the second half. 
My congratulations go to Trish, Meg and the entire Urban Outfitters team on both sides of the Atlantic for planning and delivering an exceptional quarter. I'm so proud of what the team has accomplished over the past 2 years. Urban has now regained its position as a fashion leader for young adults, and I couldn't be more excited for the brand's future. 
Turning your attention to Free People. In Q2, the brand posted flat Retail segment comps and a mid-single-digit increase in wholesale sales. The brand opened 5 new stores during the quarter and achieved total Retail segment revenue growth of 8%. Almost all product categories in the Retail segment delivered positive comp sales in the quarter with most of the gains driven by higher promotional activity. 
As we discussed on last quarter's call, Free People entered the second quarter with excess Retail segment inventory. The brand aggressively cleared this stock during the quarter by taking additional markdowns, which lifted sales but depressed margins. I'm pleased to report that comparable Retail segment inventory at quarter's end fell by 8% on a year-over-year basis. Inventory is now more current and weeks of supply more in line with sales. 
As such, we believe the brand is positioned to deliver lower markdown rates in the second half than those experienced in Q2. Although the brand team has made significant progress in terms of inventory management, their goal is to further reduce the average weeks of supply. 
Looking forward, the brand is encouraged by some excellent early fall sign of its newest fashion offering, especially in its direct channel. Regular price sales in that channel are running nicely positive but haven't been strong enough to overcome lower markdown sales and negative store sales, so total Retail segment sales are negative. The brand will continue to make adjustments to their assortments based on these early reads, but the team believes that Retail segment results, which are up against multiyear positive comparisons, could remain difficult in the back half. 
Meanwhile, the Free People Wholesale team continue to produce excellent quarterly results in spite of a difficult environment. The headwinds to growth in this channel have been well documented. Still, the team delivered a 4% increase in year-over-year sales in the quarter and 9% growth for the first half. This growth was driven by continued success in expanding categories such as FP Movement and significant growth in European business where quarterly sales almost doubled versus the same period last year. 
The team believes there is significant wholesale growth opportunity remaining in Europe. Looking ahead, timing issues with the wholesale shipments in the third and fourth quarters last year create easier comparisons for Q3 while Q4 is more difficult. In spite of this, fall and holiday bookings are strong and team believes they can return to double-digit growth for the back half of the year. I thank Meg, Sheila, Dave and Krissy and the entire Free People team. Although not their finest financial results, the quarter marked a return to fundamental discipline that will benefit the brand going forward. Given the enormous creativity housed within the brand, I'm confident that Free People will continue to delight its customers with fresh fashion and inspiring environments. 
I'll take this opportunity also to recognize and congratulate Sheila Harrington on her recent promotion to the role of brand president, reporting to Meg. Sheila has been instrumental in growing the brand over her 13-year tenure at Free People, including extremely successful launches of all of the Free People product extensions from intimates to Movement. Sheila, thank you for your many contributions and congratulations to you. 
Next, I'll speak to the Anthropologie brand. Although the brand reported a negative 2.5% comp for the quarter, there were numerous bright spots to report. Anthropologie Europe delivered positive comp sales. Again, we saw no change in customer demand from the Brexit vote. Almost all Anthropologie product categories performed well in the quarter with 6 of 7 generating double-digit positive comps. Only women's apparel was negative. 
Due to exceptional inventory management, the brand was able to limit markdowns in the apparel category and decrease the total markdown rate on a year-over-year basis by more than 100 basis points. This decrease in markdowns, in combination with very strong IMU improvement, drove significant year-over-year increases in merchandise margins on both a rate and dollar basis. The result, in spite of negative overall comps, Anthropologie generated more operating profits in Q2 this year than in the same period last year. 
Obviously, the team's focus is on turning the women's apparel business around, and I believe the brand is making slow but steady progress. Reaction to Anthropologie's apparel assortment on a comp basis improved sequentially in the quarter. Areas of strength include dresses, which registered strong double-digit comp gains, and woven tops, which improved as the season progressed. The brand believes the apparel assortment will continue to evolve throughout the fall and holiday seasons and feels positive about their assortments in a growing number of apparel classifications. Certainly, reenergizing this category is the brand's #1 immediate goal. 
Strong performance of the expanded categories, such as home, beauty, BHLDN and Terrain continues to be a brand highlight. All expanded categories are ahead of plan and are fueling the increases in the direct-to-consumer business and the stellar performance of the 2 new larger-format stores. 
Home is the most developed of these categories and continues to surprise on the upside. We're excited to see customer reaction to the September Home Journal, which will drop in mid-September and have 42% more pages than last year's book. 
The brand's beauty assortment is also connecting with the customer and shows significant sales growth in both stores and online. By the holiday season, more than 130 Anthropologie stores will have a beauty shop-in-shop, up from 70 the prior year. The 2 younger brands, BHLDN and Terrain, which became part of the Anthropologie Group over the last few years, have benefited greatly from the ability to cross merchandise and leverage the Anthropologie Group's resources. Both have experienced significant revenue growth and positive comp sales. 
BHLDN has the potential to top $50 million in revenue this year and is quickly becoming our customer's go-to destination for her special occasion. The long-term strategic importance of positive customer reaction to these product expansions and extensions, both in-store and online, can't be overstated. 
Nowhere is that reaction more clear than sales generated at the 2 newly expanded stores in Portland and Newport Beach. Last quarter, we reported on the phenomenal openings each of these larger-format stores had. Now, 3 months later, both stores continue to exceed their sales plan and, importantly, for the quarter, both stores average higher sales per square foot than the average Anthropologie store. I think that's extraordinary. While 1 quarter's results do not confirm a trend, should this metric continue, the long-term implications for the brand would be profound. Furthermore, the team believes there are many ways to enhance the assortment and experience of these stores and build sales even further. 
During the third quarter, Anthropologie plans to open 2 additional expanded stores: Walnut Creek and King of Prussia. The Palo Alto relocation and expansion is planned to open in the fourth quarter. 
My thanks go to David, Meg and the Anthropologie team for delivering an exceptionally profitable quarter, and I congratulate David and the team for successfully developing the Anthropologie expanded categories and larger-format stores. 
Before closing, I will briefly comment on trends in the market and summarize our accomplishments this quarter. Over the past several years, the complaint of lack of fashion has become common in the marketplace. I spoke to this subject on our conference call in March of this year. I actually said I'm not predicting exactly when a change in fashion will occur but that I saw more fashion excitement in spring than I've seen in quite a few years. I repeat those comments again as we move into fall, except I believe the change is now upon us, and our customers are adapting to new looks and silhouettes as we speak. As in all such cycles, some customers and brands adopt newness faster than others, but the fact is there's currently an abundance of exciting fashion happening, and this is very good for our brands, for URBN and for our industry as a whole. 
Now to summarize URBN's accomplishments in the second quarter. During the quarter, we generated record sales with a 1% increase in Retail segment comp sales and a 4% gain in Wholesale sales and achieved these record sales with 4% Retail segment comp inventory decrease. We also drove strong record consumer sales in part by increasing our marketing spend, grew our year-over-year initial merchandise margins by almost 100 basis points, managed the markdowns to the lowest rate for any quarter in company history, delivered the highest maintained merchandise margin in recent history and earned $77 million in the quarter for a record $0.66 per share.
Finally, in closing, I thank our brand and shared service leaders and our 24,000 associates worldwide for their inspiring dedication, drive and creativity. I also recognize and thank our many partners around the world. And finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued support. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I now turn the call over for your questions."

As I said in my opening statement, there was a weather factor, and I think there was depressed demand in May. And we saw a lot of that demand come back in both June and July, but we did see sequential progress in demand over those 3 months. And I attribute that to much better planning on the Urban front this year than last year, stronger product assortments in every major classification. And I think Trish was a little reticent to talk about men's, but we're even seeing it in men's now in Urban. So I feel very strongly about Urban. As you know, we still have work to do, as I mentioned, in the Anthropologie brand, in some of the apparel classifications, but we saw nice sequential growth improvements there as well. And definitely, in the home categories, in the intimate categories and basically all their other categories performed very well. And then -- and Free People, as I said in my prepared remarks, we've gotten some very nice reads online in the new apparel offerings. Some of the other businesses are softer than we want, and we're making adjustments in those categories. So I think that we've got a lot of momentum going into Q3, particularly in the Urban business. It's pretty strong, and congratulations to Trish and Meg and her team for really engineering that."

I think that Urban is definitely benefiting from a lot of the initiatives they're doing, not just the good fashion but the social media work that they're doing and the marketing work they're doing. In July, they actually saw a positive comp store sales in North America and in Europe. They had positive comp store sales. So yes, I think you can make the difference. I do believe that we shouldn't get too negative on stores. I think that there's no question there are too many stores in North America, and we start to see some of those stores going away. Some of the -- our competitors are closing stores at a reasonable rate and, of course, there was just the Macy's announcement of closing stores. So I think that you will continue to see a lot of stores close and go away, and I think that's a positive thing for the industry and a positive thing for all the people, including the ones that are closing the stores. But I don't think it's a problem with stores, per se. I think the store concept is still valid. What I see happening over time is just fewer stores but probably the store is larger and delivering more of a unique experience, which should complement [ph] their direct-to-consumer business. And I think that, that'll be the winning combination. Also, if you don't mind me taking a second to talk about proprietary product, which is a question you asked last quarter and gave me a lot of reason to think about it. Like Trish said, this proprietary product, I think, is one -- going to be one of the main drivers of differentiation in the marketplace going forward. As Trish said, almost 90% of the women's product was proprietary in the -- in Q2. With Free People Wholesale and Free People Retail, it's 100% and somewhere around 90%. And at Anthropologie, the women's apparel is somewhere around 80% proprietary. Our goal is to really have this proprietary product across all categories, not just in apparel. Currently, apparel is the highest penetration of proprietary product, but other categories like accessories and intimates, which are much less, are trending up. And we believe that, over time, they will, maybe not exceed apparel but approach apparel. So our goal is to offer these experiences in stores that it's impossible for customers to get any other place than one of our brands."

But mostly the inventory level opportunity was in how we distorted the product and the opportunities in learning and where the customer is moving more forward. As Dick alluded to earlier, all of URBN will be focusing on how to be faster speed to market, use more predictive tools and resources and, over time, lower inventories in total for the organization. As it relates to Anthropologie and the sequential growth, we did see that in Q2. However, when we look at the balance of the year, I wanted to remember that about 6 months ago we launched with Meg and Barb a sort of overhaul of Anthropologie's vision for archetypes, our process, speed to market. The teams have changed, and that's about 6 months ago. And we expect fall and holiday to be sort of similar to Q2 where the company will look similar to Q2's results and expanded product categories will outpace apparel's growth yet still see opportunities to show improved merchandise margin over the prior year. That's even with apparel being soft for the balance of the year relative to comps."

This obviously assumes that the Urban Outfitters brand continues with the strong momentum that they have right now, that Anthropologie posts a similar performance to what they delivered in the second quarter, and Free People delivers sequential improvement in their markdown rate in the third quarter from where they landed the second quarter due to inventory being in a better position. But by line item, the improved MMU would be through improved initial mark-up at both the Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters brands and potentially lower markdowns at all 3 of our brands for the third quarter."

I'll begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 record-setting second quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share some of our thoughts concerning our third quarter and the remaining -- remainder of fiscal year 2017. 
Total company or URBN sales for the second quarter increased by 3% to a second quarter record of $891 million. This increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a 4% increase in Wholesale segment sales and a $12 million increase in noncomp sales, including the opening of 8 net new stores in the quarter and sales from the newly acquired Vetri Family restaurants. 
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting another double-digit sales gain, driven by an increase in sessions and conversion rate, which more than offset the decrease in average order value. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and average unit selling price while units per transaction were flat. 
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 5% at Urban Outfitters, was flat at Free People -- at the Anthropologie Group. Our URBN Retail segment comp was the strongest in July followed by June, with May being the weakest. 
Free People Wholesale segment sales delivered another solid quarter as sales rose 4% to $75 million. These results were driven by increased space at select department store doors to support our category expansion like FP Movement and growth in our European accounts. 
Now moving on to gross profit. Total URBN gross profit for the quarter increased 8% to $343 million. Gross profit rate improved by 179 basis points to 38.5%. The improvement in gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvement in the Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie Group brands maintained margins with both brands delivering higher initial mark-ups and lower merchandise markdowns versus the previous year. Partially offsetting these improvements was a lower gross profit rate at the Free People brand primarily driven by lower maintained margins due to higher markdowns to clear slow-moving product. 
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 5% to $224 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 48 basis points to 25.2%. This SG&A deleverage was primarily due to an increase in direct marketing and technology-related expenses to support our strong direct-to-consumer growth. Direct store controllable expenses also increased in the quarter in order to support our square footage growth of 4% in the quarter. 
Operating income for the quarter increased by 14% to $118 million with operating profit margin improving by 131 basis points to 13.3%. Our tax rate for the quarter was 35.5% compared to 35.2% in the prior year. Net income in the quarter was $77 million or $0.66 per diluted share, a new second quarter EPS record. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory decreased by 4% to $367 million. The reduction in inventory is due to a 4% reduction in Retail segment comp inventory at cost. The reduction of inventory is not necessarily predictive of future sales growth as we are currently doing a nice job of lowering our weeks of supply and getting faster turns out of our inventory as shown over previous quarters where our sales comp had outpaced our comp inventory growth. We ended the quarter with $328 million in cash and marketable securities. During the second quarter, we paid down $25 million of our outstanding revolver, leaving $50 million currently outstanding. 
As we enter the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 23 net new stores for the year, excluding our food and beverage division. For the third quarter, we are planning 6 new Anthropologie stores, including 1 new Anthropologie store in Europe, 2 new Urban Outfitters stores and 3 new Free People stores. For the year, we are planning on opening 3 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe; 7 net new Anthropologie stores, including 2 in Europe; and 13 net new Free People stores. For the full year fiscal 2017, we're also planning on opening 2 new Vetri pizzerias and 1 café adjacent to an Anthropologie large-format store. 
Now on to gross margin. We believe our third quarter gross margin rate could improve versus the prior year with that improvement in rate being slightly lower than the 142 basis points we achieved in the first half of the year. Our third quarter gross margin improvement could be largely driven by higher maintained margins at the Anthropologie Group and Urban Outfitters brands, which could be partially offset by declining gross profit rate at the Free People brand. Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a low double-digit rate for the third quarter. 
Please note that we recorded lower incentive-based and share-based compensation in the third quarter of the prior year, which is contributing to the increase in our SG&A growth rate for the third quarter of this year. For the year, we believe SG&A could grow at a high single-digit rate. We believe the growth will be driven by increased investment in marketing and technology expenses, hopefully helping to continue driving our double-digit direct-to-consumer channel sales gains. 
Store-related expenses are also expected to increase in order to support our square footage growth, which is planned at approximately 5% for fiscal year 2017. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $170 million. Total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new, relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center. 
Finally, we are still planning our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate to be approximately 37% for the year and believe our fourth quarter tax rate will be lower than the annual planned rate. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements. 
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Trish Donnelly, global CEO of the Urban Outfitters brand."

The Urban Outfitters global brand had a very exciting second quarter. We delivered record sales volume and drove a 5% Retail segment comp on top of the 4% comp increase from the previous year. Both the North",1352,"Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. The Urban Outfitters global brand had a very exciting second quarter. We delivered record sales volume and drove a 5% Retail segment comp on top of the 4% comp increase from the previous year. Both the North American and European businesses contributed to the success with Europe delivering a solid comp despite the political backdrop in the U.K. Strong sales partnered with improvements in merchandise margins and the team's focus on expense management allowed us to deliver significant improvements in overall operating margin. 
During the quarter, the Urban Outfitters brand was able to achieve near record merchandise margins through tight inventory management and IMU focus, not to mention compelling trend-right products, creative and easy-to-shop visual presentations in stores and exceptional imagery with an easy-to-navigate user experience in our direct-to-consumer channel. The brand's strong partnership with our internal production team, led by Chief Sourcing Officer Barbara Rozsas, resulted in higher initial margins compared to prior years. Our attention to driving and developing a meaningful regular price business helped improve the global margin significantly. 
Now let me discuss in further detail the various initiatives contributing to the strong top line growth. The record volume in the quarter was driven by increases in regular price businesses across categories, geographies and channels. One of our biggest shifts in strategy across all merchandise categories has been our focus on exclusive product and offering our customer products he or she can't get anywhere but Urban Outfitters. 
In addition to our own brand product, which is 100% proprietary and a majority of the total assortment, we worked with key brand partners such as Adidas, Wrangler and Fila on special makeups, exclusive styles and UO collaboration. The ability to work creatively and collaboratively with brands we admire who get Urban Outfitters and get our customer has been really rewarding, and the response to our customers has been tremendous. 
We saw impressive growth in our all-important women's apparel and accessories businesses across a variety of categories. At the end of the quarter, over 90% of our women's apparel assortment was available only at Urban Outfitters. Today more than ever, product differentiation is critical, not just as a traffic driver to both direct-to-consumer and stores, but more importantly, it's an obligation we have to our core customer. Our customer looks to us for unique products and first to trend, and exclusive products offerings ensure her she won't be wearing something offered anywhere else. 
Globally, the brand also saw impressive growth in what we've previously referred to as emerging categories, specifically intimates, home and beauty. Within intimates, we've had great response to our bras and undies programs as well as our exclusive bodies and colors in Calvin Klein. We're also seeing really nice traction in our lounge and dorm offerings, and we will continue to build upon the successes we've seen. 
In addition to intimates, we're seeing sizable growth and upside in our home division. This is an important category in the lives of our 18- to 28-year-old core customer, whether they're moving into their dorm room or their first apartment. The small space and on-campus home marketing campaigns and social posts were some of our most engaged in the quarter, averaging 6-figure customer likes on Instagram. Also during the quarter, we launched a Home Showroom in Space 15 Twenty in Los Angeles, one of our large-format stores. The showroom shopping experience is truly omnichannel, and we'll continue to refine and support this initiative. 
With the majority of our direct-to-consumer traffic coming through mobile devices, the direct and retail experiences need to be seamless, and URBN is committed to supporting this with the necessary team and resources. 
Our third emerging category, beauty, continues to see compounded comp growth and increase in penetration to the total business. Here, too, we recognize the importance of exclusivity and first to market, and the beauty team has done a tremendous job curating our brand-right assortment with partners and brands around the world. The unique and different, even in beauty, resonates with our customers and will continue to build out this special offering. 
This brings us to a new emerging category, music, which has always been part of Urban Outfitters' DNA and product mix. Today, we continue to offer vinyl, turntables, cassettes and cassette players as well as wireless speakers and headphones with collaborators like Bang & Olufsen. 
In addition to the product side of the music category, we're also committed to delivering the experience. Digitally, we've been building out our music video series, UO Live. With tens of thousands of subscribers and views, it gives us another platform on which to connect with our customer while supporting our favorite artists and bands. Our urbanoutfittersmusic Instagram is growing quickly with Mixtape previews and vinyl giveaways our most engaged customer interactions. 
And finally, our men's business. Although still not where we want it to be, the progress around the regular price business, particularly in a direct-to-consumer channel, is seeing great traction. We see a path to positive growth for the back half of the year with strong and relevant product assortments, including own brand, branded, collaborations and exclusives, relevant and creative marketing strategies, and easier-to-shop in-store visual merchandising setups. 
We've said from the beginning that the men's comp will follow women's, which is how it's actualizing. The leadership in men's design, in merchandising, planning, store visuals and brand marketing has been laser-focused on our customer, on the assortment and on compelling pricing. We're very excited about where the business is headed. 
In addition to our product and experience initiatives, we are in the process of globalizing our team. This change allows us to communicate a seamless global message and a consistent retail and direct-to-consumer experience while leveraging talent and creative assets across the globe. We are committed to pursuing long-term international growth. And this past quarter, we opened a new Urban Outfitters store in Utrecht, Netherlands, bringing our total store count in Europe and the U.K. to 44. In addition, we opened an Urban Outfitters concession within the Selfridges flagship on Oxford Street late in the quarter, and we're looking forward to seeing success here. 
On a global basis, I'm proud to say our brand saw improvements across all channels in all customer groups this quarter with new, retained and reactivated customer accounts increasing year-over-year. Another area where we've seen tremendous customer growth and audience engagement is in social media. Our Instagram followers exceeded the 5 million mark during the quarter, increasing 65% over the prior year, and we're now capturing over 200,000 new followers a month. In addition to our national Instagram account, our stores managed our local accounts, which accrued almost 700,000 followers and over 19 million likes in the quarter. 
Snapchat is important in our consumers' lives, and we're also seeing fast growth here with viewership increasing 25% month-over-month. Urban Outfitters was called out in L2's July Digital IQ Index for specialty retail as, ""the most prolific brand on the Snapchat platform, posting 6 times the index average with 83% featuring video content."" This channel has given us yet another relevant way to connect with our customers and engage in 2-way conversations. A great example of this occurred during LGBTQ Pride Month in June, where our Snapchat stories garnered close to 130,000 views. 
In the 24 months I've been with Urban Outfitters, I'm proud to say we've made progress. And although there's still a lot accomplish, there have been a number of positives. The results this past quarter could not have occurred without the exceptional leadership of the Urban Outfitters executive team, and I would like to thank each team member for their hard work, dedication and passion for the brand. Their focus on our customer and the collaborative culture they've created for their teams and colleagues have allowed the quarter's successes to materialize. 
And finally, a very special thank you to Meg, whose partnership is invaluable. Her love of Urban Outfitters and for our customer inspires the teams daily and her contributions to this quarter's success were critical. Thank you. 
I will now pass the call to Dick."
330706,375261018,1037652,"Urban Outfitters Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2016",2016-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Urban Outfitters, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Trish, and good afternoon, everyone. URBN produced record sales and earnings per share in the second quarter with comparable demand accelerating sequentially. May is typically our biggest month of the quarter, but as we suggested on our May confer",1856,"Thanks, Trish, and good afternoon, everyone. URBN produced record sales and earnings per share in the second quarter with comparable demand accelerating sequentially. May is typically our biggest month of the quarter, but as we suggested on our May conference call, unseasonably cold weather in the eastern half of North America depressed and delayed apparel purchases. As a result, total Retail segment comparable sales in May were negative. Fortunately, the weather shifted in June and sales rebounded strongly. July sales jumped even higher, generating the best comps of the quarter. 
Given the weak start to Q2, we're very pleased our final sales number show a positive Retail segment comp, and we're delighted to report record second quarter earnings per share. The monthly sales curve was similar across all brands, but overall results varied. 
So let me say a few words about each brand's performance. First, the Urban brand. As Trish just reported, Urban produced a terrific quarter. All major product categories posted positive comp sales except men's, and a number of categories delivered double-digit comps. Urban's European business also experienced strong comp gains with seemingly little impact on the business from the Brexit vote. Not only did the total Urban brand produce its best comps in 12 quarters, it also continued to deliver strong regular price sales; managed its leanest quarterly markdown rate as far back as brand records go; improved initial margins; administrate high inventory and expense controls; and created a flurry of outstanding marketing events and campaigns. All of these factors combined to create record second quarter sales and one of the most profitable second quarters in the brand's history. 
Brand momentum at the end of Q2 was powerful. Therefore, the team believes they will continue to please and excite customers with new fashion and new marketing campaigns in the second half. 
My congratulations go to Trish, Meg and the entire Urban Outfitters team on both sides of the Atlantic for planning and delivering an exceptional quarter. I'm so proud of what the team has accomplished over the past 2 years. Urban has now regained its position as a fashion leader for young adults, and I couldn't be more excited for the brand's future. 
Turning your attention to Free People. In Q2, the brand posted flat Retail segment comps and a mid-single-digit increase in wholesale sales. The brand opened 5 new stores during the quarter and achieved total Retail segment revenue growth of 8%. Almost all product categories in the Retail segment delivered positive comp sales in the quarter with most of the gains driven by higher promotional activity. 
As we discussed on last quarter's call, Free People entered the second quarter with excess Retail segment inventory. The brand aggressively cleared this stock during the quarter by taking additional markdowns, which lifted sales but depressed margins. I'm pleased to report that comparable Retail segment inventory at quarter's end fell by 8% on a year-over-year basis. Inventory is now more current and weeks of supply more in line with sales. 
As such, we believe the brand is positioned to deliver lower markdown rates in the second half than those experienced in Q2. Although the brand team has made significant progress in terms of inventory management, their goal is to further reduce the average weeks of supply. 
Looking forward, the brand is encouraged by some excellent early fall sign of its newest fashion offering, especially in its direct channel. Regular price sales in that channel are running nicely positive but haven't been strong enough to overcome lower markdown sales and negative store sales, so total Retail segment sales are negative. The brand will continue to make adjustments to their assortments based on these early reads, but the team believes that Retail segment results, which are up against multiyear positive comparisons, could remain difficult in the back half. 
Meanwhile, the Free People Wholesale team continue to produce excellent quarterly results in spite of a difficult environment. The headwinds to growth in this channel have been well documented. Still, the team delivered a 4% increase in year-over-year sales in the quarter and 9% growth for the first half. This growth was driven by continued success in expanding categories such as FP Movement and significant growth in European business where quarterly sales almost doubled versus the same period last year. 
The team believes there is significant wholesale growth opportunity remaining in Europe. Looking ahead, timing issues with the wholesale shipments in the third and fourth quarters last year create easier comparisons for Q3 while Q4 is more difficult. In spite of this, fall and holiday bookings are strong and team believes they can return to double-digit growth for the back half of the year. I thank Meg, Sheila, Dave and Krissy and the entire Free People team. Although not their finest financial results, the quarter marked a return to fundamental discipline that will benefit the brand going forward. Given the enormous creativity housed within the brand, I'm confident that Free People will continue to delight its customers with fresh fashion and inspiring environments. 
I'll take this opportunity also to recognize and congratulate Sheila Harrington on her recent promotion to the role of brand president, reporting to Meg. Sheila has been instrumental in growing the brand over her 13-year tenure at Free People, including extremely successful launches of all of the Free People product extensions from intimates to Movement. Sheila, thank you for your many contributions and congratulations to you. 
Next, I'll speak to the Anthropologie brand. Although the brand reported a negative 2.5% comp for the quarter, there were numerous bright spots to report. Anthropologie Europe delivered positive comp sales. Again, we saw no change in customer demand from the Brexit vote. Almost all Anthropologie product categories performed well in the quarter with 6 of 7 generating double-digit positive comps. Only women's apparel was negative. 
Due to exceptional inventory management, the brand was able to limit markdowns in the apparel category and decrease the total markdown rate on a year-over-year basis by more than 100 basis points. This decrease in markdowns, in combination with very strong IMU improvement, drove significant year-over-year increases in merchandise margins on both a rate and dollar basis. The result, in spite of negative overall comps, Anthropologie generated more operating profits in Q2 this year than in the same period last year. 
Obviously, the team's focus is on turning the women's apparel business around, and I believe the brand is making slow but steady progress. Reaction to Anthropologie's apparel assortment on a comp basis improved sequentially in the quarter. Areas of strength include dresses, which registered strong double-digit comp gains, and woven tops, which improved as the season progressed. The brand believes the apparel assortment will continue to evolve throughout the fall and holiday seasons and feels positive about their assortments in a growing number of apparel classifications. Certainly, reenergizing this category is the brand's #1 immediate goal. 
Strong performance of the expanded categories, such as home, beauty, BHLDN and Terrain continues to be a brand highlight. All expanded categories are ahead of plan and are fueling the increases in the direct-to-consumer business and the stellar performance of the 2 new larger-format stores. 
Home is the most developed of these categories and continues to surprise on the upside. We're excited to see customer reaction to the September Home Journal, which will drop in mid-September and have 42% more pages than last year's book. 
The brand's beauty assortment is also connecting with the customer and shows significant sales growth in both stores and online. By the holiday season, more than 130 Anthropologie stores will have a beauty shop-in-shop, up from 70 the prior year. The 2 younger brands, BHLDN and Terrain, which became part of the Anthropologie Group over the last few years, have benefited greatly from the ability to cross merchandise and leverage the Anthropologie Group's resources. Both have experienced significant revenue growth and positive comp sales. 
BHLDN has the potential to top $50 million in revenue this year and is quickly becoming our customer's go-to destination for her special occasion. The long-term strategic importance of positive customer reaction to these product expansions and extensions, both in-store and online, can't be overstated. 
Nowhere is that reaction more clear than sales generated at the 2 newly expanded stores in Portland and Newport Beach. Last quarter, we reported on the phenomenal openings each of these larger-format stores had. Now, 3 months later, both stores continue to exceed their sales plan and, importantly, for the quarter, both stores average higher sales per square foot than the average Anthropologie store. I think that's extraordinary. While 1 quarter's results do not confirm a trend, should this metric continue, the long-term implications for the brand would be profound. Furthermore, the team believes there are many ways to enhance the assortment and experience of these stores and build sales even further. 
During the third quarter, Anthropologie plans to open 2 additional expanded stores: Walnut Creek and King of Prussia. The Palo Alto relocation and expansion is planned to open in the fourth quarter. 
My thanks go to David, Meg and the Anthropologie team for delivering an exceptionally profitable quarter, and I congratulate David and the team for successfully developing the Anthropologie expanded categories and larger-format stores. 
Before closing, I will briefly comment on trends in the market and summarize our accomplishments this quarter. Over the past several years, the complaint of lack of fashion has become common in the marketplace. I spoke to this subject on our conference call in March of this year. I actually said I'm not predicting exactly when a change in fashion will occur but that I saw more fashion excitement in spring than I've seen in quite a few years. I repeat those comments again as we move into fall, except I believe the change is now upon us, and our customers are adapting to new looks and silhouettes as we speak. As in all such cycles, some customers and brands adopt newness faster than others, but the fact is there's currently an abundance of exciting fashion happening, and this is very good for our brands, for URBN and for our industry as a whole. 
Now to summarize URBN's accomplishments in the second quarter. During the quarter, we generated record sales with a 1% increase in Retail segment comp sales and a 4% gain in Wholesale sales and achieved these record sales with 4% Retail segment comp inventory decrease. We also drove strong record consumer sales in part by increasing our marketing spend, grew our year-over-year initial merchandise margins by almost 100 basis points, managed the markdowns to the lowest rate for any quarter in company history, delivered the highest maintained merchandise margin in recent history and earned $77 million in the quarter for a record $0.66 per share.
Finally, in closing, I thank our brand and shared service leaders and our 24,000 associates worldwide for their inspiring dedication, drive and creativity. I also recognize and thank our many partners around the world. And finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued support. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I now turn the call over for your questions."

I think that Urban is definitely benefiting from a lot of the initiatives they're doing, not just the good fashion but the social media work that they're doing and the marketing work they're doing. In July, they actually saw a positive comp store sales in North America and in Europe. They had positive comp store sales. So yes, I think you can make the difference. I do believe that we shouldn't get too negative on stores. I think that there's no question there are too many stores in North America, and we start to see some of those stores going away. Some of the -- our competitors are closing stores at a reasonable rate and, of course, there was just the Macy's announcement of closing stores. So I think that you will continue to see a lot of stores close and go away, and I think that's a positive thing for the industry and a positive thing for all the people, including the ones that are closing the stores. But I don't think it's a problem with stores per se. I think the store concept is still valid. What I see happening over time is just fewer stores, but probably the store is larger and delivering more of a unique experience, which should complement their direct-to-consumer business. And I think that, that will be the winning combination. Also, if you don't mind me taking a second to talk about proprietary product, which a question you asked last quarter and gave me a lot of reason to think about it. Like Trish said, this proprietary product, I think, is one -- going to be one of the main drivers of differentiation in the marketplace going forward. As Trish said, almost 90% of the women's product was proprietary in the -- in Q2. With Free People Wholesale and Free People Retail, it's 100% and somewhere around 90%. And at Anthropologie, the women's apparel is somewhere around 80% proprietary. Our goal is to really have this proprietary product across all categories, not just in apparel. Currently, apparel is the highest penetration of proprietary product, but other categories like accessories and intimates, which are much less, are trending up. And we believe that, over time, they will maybe not exceed apparel but approach apparel. So our goal is to offer these experiences in stores that it's impossible for customers to get any other place than one of our brands."

But mostly, the inventory level opportunity was in how we distorted the product and the opportunities in learning and where the customer is moving more forward. As Dick alluded to earlier, all of URBN will be focusing on how to be faster speed to market, use more predictive tools and resources and, over time, lower inventories in total for the organization. As it relates to Anthropologie and the sequential growth, we did see that in Q2. However, when we look at the balance of the year, I wanted to remember that about 6 months ago, we launched with Meg and Barb. It's sort of overhaul of the Anthropologie's vision for archetypes, our process, speed to market. The teams have changed, and that's about 6 months ago. And we expect fall and holiday to be sort of similar to Q2, where the company will look similar to Q2's results and expanded product categories will outpace apparel's growth, yet still see opportunities to show improved merchandise margin over the prior year. That's even with apparel being soft for the balance of the year relative to comps."

I will begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 third quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter, then I will share some of our thoughts concerning our fourth quarter.Total company or URBN sa",1248,"Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 third quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter, then I will share some of our thoughts concerning our fourth quarter.
Total company or URBN sales for the third quarter increased by 5% to a third quarter record of $862 million. This sales increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a 30% increase in Wholesale segment sales and a $12 million increase in noncomp sales, including the opening of 12 net new stores in the quarter and sales from the newly acquired Vetri Family restaurants.
Please keep in mind that the third quarter last year was negatively impacted by approximately $9 million of wholesale shipments that slipped into the fourth quarter due to delays at our recently opened East Coast fulfillment center.
Additionally, please note that foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales growth by approximately 120 basis points in the quarter.
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting another double-digit sales gain, driven by an increase in sessions and conversion rate, which more than offset a decrease in average order value. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased average unit selling price and a slight decrease in transactions, both of which were partially offset by an increase in units per transaction.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 5.2% at Urban Outfitters, while Free People and Anthropologie were down 1.5% and 2.7%, respectively. Our URBN Retail segment comp was strongest in September followed by October, with August being the weakest.
Free People Wholesale segment sales delivered another solid quarter as sales rose 30% to $77.5 million. As noted earlier, the quarter year-on-year sales growth rate benefited from approximately $9 million of shipments moving out of last year's third quarter into last year's fourth quarter. If you were to adjust last year's number for these shipments, our Wholesale segment growth would have been 13% in this year's third quarter. These results were driven by increased space at select department stores to support our category expansions like shoes and FP Movement.
Now moving on to gross profit. Total URBN gross profit for the quarter increased 4% to $300 million. Gross profit rate declined by 15 basis points to 34.8%. The reduction in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased penetration of the direct-to-consumer channel resulting in increased customer delivery and overall logistics expense rates.
Within gross profit, maintained margin for the quarter was relatively flat versus last year with initial markup, or IMU, coming in lower on a year-over-year basis and markdowns coming in favorable on a year-over-year basis, essentially offsetting each other. IMU was lower due to the increased penetration of the Wholesale segment sales at Free People, which carries a lower IMU versus our Retail segment. IMU in our Retail segment increased due to improvements at each of our brands. Markdowns were favorable due to lower markdowns at the Urban Outfitters brand, which was partially offset by higher markdowns at the Anthropologie and Free People brands. Despite well-controlled inventory, Anthropologie was not able to hold their markdowns flat this quarter due to their challenging women's apparel performance.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 10.5% to $230 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 143 basis points to 26.6%. This SG&A deleverage was partially due to one-time legal settlements, which accounted for approximately 20% of our year-over-year growth or almost 50 basis points of deleverage. The remaining increase in SG&A primarily related to an increase in direct store controllable expenses. A large portion of these expenses were due to several large-format Anthropologie stores recently opened or opened in the quarter. While we are extremely pleased with the top line performance of these stores, we have invested a considerable amount to ensure the hiring, training and overall execution of these stores were second to none. Many of these expenses, preopening and initial staffing levels, we believe we can reduce and leverage in the upcoming year through improved control and planning based on our current years [ph] learnings.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 12% to $70 million, with operating profit margin declining by 158 basis points to 8.2%. Our tax rate for the quarter was 33.5% compared to 35.3% in the prior year. The improvement in the quarterly tax rate was due to the ratio of foreign taxable losses to global taxable profits in the year.
Net income for the quarter was $47 million or $0.40 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory increased by 3% to $454 million. The increase in inventory is primarily due to an increase in noncomp inventory to support our new and expanded stores. Our Retail segment inventory comp was up 1% at cost [ph] with both Anthropologie and Free People well controlled and appropriately negative.
Urban Outfitters inventory ended just slightly higher than where we would have liked it to be. We ended the quarter with $265 million in cash and marketable securities.
During the quarter, we repurchased and retired 1 million common shares for $35 million, leaving 6 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors authorization. Additionally during the quarter, we paid down the remaining $50 million on our outstanding revolver, completing full repayment of the $150 million this fiscal year.
As we enter the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 23 net new stores for the year, excluding our food and beverage division. For the fourth quarter, we are planning 4 net new stores, including 1 new Urban Outfitters store in North America, 1 new Anthropologie store in the U.K, 2 Anthropologie closures in North America due to lease expiration and 4 new Free People stores and 1 closure due to lease expiration. The planned fourth quarter openings will result in the following store changes for the year: 3 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe; 7 net new Anthropologie stores, including 2 in Europe; and 13 net new Free People stores.
For fiscal 2017, we also opened 2 new Vetri pizzerias and 1 café adjacent to an Anthropologie large-format store.
Now on to gross margin. We believe our fourth quarter gross margin rate could decrease versus the prior year primarily due to higher markdowns. These markdowns could be driven by higher markdowns at Anthropologie related to their women's apparel performance and slightly higher markdowns at Urban Outfitters related to marginally higher inventory.
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a mid-single-digit rate for the fourth quarter. This increase would be largely driven by increased store-related expenses to support our noncomp store-based growth.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $160 million. [ph] Total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new, relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Finally, we are still planning our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate to be approximately 36% for the year and believe our fourth quarter tax rate will be lower than our annual planned rate. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Sheila Harrington, President of the Free People brand."

Today, I will discuss a few highlights from Free People's third quarter performance and then review the progress of the brand, [ph] the brand has made on our strategic growth initiative. In total, the Free People brand grew revenues by 16% this past quarter. The brand's strongest growth came from our Wholesale business segment, which delivered a 30% increase. When normalized for last year's operational challenges in our distribution center, the growth is still a strong 13% increase. This growth was driven by strength in our core apparel collection, increased business with online partnerships, along with a growth in expanded categories, including Movement, intimates and shoes, both domestic and in Europe. A double-digit increase in forward bookings makes us feel confident in the health of our wholesale business.
I would like to congratulate Krissy Meehan-Mashinsky as well as the entire Wholesale team in leading this brand expansion. 
Free People's Retail segment sales grew by 6% in the quarter through the opening of 3 new stores, partially offset by a negative 1.5% comp.
During the quarter, August was our weakest comp, reflecting a difficult seasonal transition. As we clear [ph] to the product and began flowing newer fashion into our stores and our direct-to-consumer channel, our business showed significant improvement with both September and October delivering positive Retail segment comps. While the store showed improvement as the quarter progressed, the direct-to-consumer channel led the way with double-digit regular priced comps, fueled -- fueling a positive direct-to-consumer comp for the quarter.
The customer clearly has reacted positively to our women's apparel's fall fashion online, and we believe this momentum can continue into the fourth quarter. We reacted to those [ph] by taking appropriate markdowns and are flowing in increased levels of product freshness through the holiday season.
Now I would like to discuss our progress on our long-term strategic growth initiatives.
We remain focused on improving our website overall shopping experience. We launched a new web platform for our direct-to-consumer channel in the first quarter of this year and have seen the benefits of this initiative. The site's load time is faster, we have streamlined our checkout process and enhanced our search capabilities, to name a few of the benefits, of which we believe has helped to improve our website conversion. Additionally, in September, we have launched the iOS shopping app in both the U.K. and China. Over 15,000 users have downloaded the app in China, and sales through the app already represent 45% of demand within this region. With our customers' growing affinity for mobile devices, we believe these types of investments are critical to our future success. While technology is considerably a part of the shopping experience, Free People's delivery of creativity and inspirational imagery has always been a cornerstone to our success. The social team has continued to raise level of engaging content, including videos, photographic imagery and collaboration. This resulted in over 3 million Instagram followers at 30% increase over last year.
Finally and extremely important for our long-term growth is the progress the brand has made in our new and expanded categories. The brand launched beauty and wellness online in July with a carefully curated assortment focused on natural, cruelty-free products, including makeup, skincare and self [Indiscernible].
Early customer reads have been positive. Movement and beauty collectively accounted for 20% of the growth in the direct-to-consumer channel during the third quarter. Additionally, our expanded categories are featured in our larger retail store location. We opened 3 larger format locations in the quarter, 2 of which are new locations, Honolulu and Charlotte, and 1 of which was a relocation and expansion of our store in King of Prussia mall. The King of Prussia store now houses all expanded categories, including beauty, in just over 6,000 selling square feet. The store has become a true brand-defining destination, incorporating the touch and spirit of Free People.
In closing, I am proud of the team's ability to react quickly and create positive momentum as the quarter progressed. This is a testament to the creativity and [indiscernible] I would like to thank the entire Free People team for their inspiration and dedication. Additionally, a sincere thank you to Meg Hayne for her passion, encouragement and the relentless pursuit of excellence for the brand. While the brand has grown significantly over the past several years, we believe there's more opportunity ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Dick."

Sheila, congratulations to you, Meg and the Free People team on the terrific progress you've made with your apparel assortment. Your design and merchant teams did an excellent job of interpreting the fashion trends. Had it not been for difficult seasonal transition in August, Free People comp sales would've been nicely positive in Q3. I believe the improved fashion, coupled with better inventory control, should allow the Free People brand to enjoy a positive holiday season. Good work, Sheila, and thanks for your leadership.
Now let me turn to a discussion around 2 of the retail topics I find most interesting, the shift in channel demand and the shift in fashion silhouette, and discuss how these changes have impacted our brands in the third quarter.
The diversions in demand by channel that we witnessed over the past few years continued in Q3 this year. In general, the digital channel outperformed, stores lagged and Wholesale delivered strong growth.
In the store channel, physical shopping visits, as reported by industry groups, continue to be down on a year-over-year basis. Overall traffic fell by mid-single digits in Q3 for the second consecutive year. With several notable exceptions, our brands comp store sales echoed this traffic pattern and were negative in almost all regions by all store types: mall, lifestyle centers and freestanding. Lower comp store sales at the Anthropologie and Free People brand in Q3 were driven primarily by fewer transactions and lower AUR. There were, however, a few bright spots in store channel performance. The Urban brand produced positive store comps in North America and Europe, and the Anthropologie brand registered positive comps in Europe, and the recently opened larger format stores continued to exceed expectations and deliver sales per square foot greater than the Anthro average. That said, URBN store comps were negative in Q3.
The direct-to-consumer channel, on the other hand, delivered strong double-digit sales growth in the quarter. Both traffic measured in sessions and total number of orders received grew at double-digit rates, and total conversion improved as well. Within the digital world, customers continue to migrate from desktop to mobile as preferred method of interaction. Mobile devices now account for almost 2/3 of total company digital sessions. The strength in the digital channel more than offset the weakness in stores, with total Retail segment comp sales increasing by 1% in the third quarter. The disparity in channel results demonstrates that the consumers' affinity for digital shopping continues to grow. Her expectations around functionality and service levels in this channel are also growing. This is why we continue to make significant investments in personnel and technology that will expand our online assortments, enhance and personalize the digital experience, give us more insight into customer preferences and permit us to deliver orders faster and more reliably. Improving our capabilities in the digital channel is one of our strategic priorities.
The third channel is Wholesale. In Q3, the Free People Wholesale business reported a 30% spike in sales. But as Frank and Sheila both explained earlier, this year's results benefited from shipping delays last year. Adjusting for this anomaly, Wholesale still produced solid gains across all customer types: specialty store, department store and e-commerce retailers. During the quarter, we also saw a shift in fashion silhouette that I've alluded to in prior calls begin to strengthen. This emerging trend, which seems to have its roots in Europe, is not impacting all brands equally. Predictably, younger, more fashion-forward customers are adopting these new looks more readily. So in Q3, the Urban and Free People brands benefited from the shift, while the Anthropologie brand did not.
In the fashion industry, times of rapid change likely see when silhouette shift offer the greatest opportunities but also pose the greatest risks.
Now let me turn your attention to the Anthropologie brand, where third quarter top line results were very similar to Q2. Total Retail segment comp sales landed at negative 3% in the quarter with weakness in stores more than offsetting the growth in direct-to-consumer sales. The comp shortfall was driven entirely by the apparel category. All other product categories and sub-brands delivered positive Retail segment comps. The expanded categories of home, beauty, BHLDN and Terrain performed particularly well.
We expected to see more progress in the apparel category, but customer response to fall assortments was lackluster. This led to higher markdowns versus the prior year period even though inventories, which ended down 3%, were tightly controlled. While we could see modest comp sales improvement in Q4 over Q3 rate, we believe apparel sales on a year-over-year basis will likely remain difficult and weigh on total Anthropologie comps and margins for the holiday season.
Transitions in fashion silhouette are never linear or easy to predict. As the customer becomes more comfortable with a different silhouette and our merchants become comfortable presenting her with more newness, we expect better results. I believe we will begin to see improvement in customer reactions to the apparel offerings with our 2017 spring/summer deliveries.
Despite the apparel issues, we remain confident the emotional bonds between the brand and our customers remain strong. She is responding enthusiastically to all of our expanded categories, especially our newly expanded home assortment. Reaction to the 200-page Home Journal [ph] mailed to customers in September exceeded plans significantly, so the home team is expanding the assortment further and plans to mail another home journal in [ph] spring.
Other expansion categories experienced double-digit comp sales as well. During the third quarter, BHLDN opened 2 new shop-in-shop locations and launched a series of omnichannel marketing initiatives, which resulted in strong store and digital sales gains. The beauty category expanded into 65 additional stores during the quarter, and the Terrain brand continue to benefit from inclusion into the Anthropologie Group.
During the quarter, Terrain launched several cross marketing initiatives and opened its first shop-in-shop in the new Walnut Creek [ph] Anthropologie store. And in early November, Terrain launched 10 holiday trim [ph] shop-in-shops in core Anthropologie stores.
In Q3, Anthropologie opened 2 additional larger format locations: Walnut Creek, [ph] California and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. To date, sales at these stores are running nicely ahead of projections, which strengthens our confidence in the brand, the strategy of opening larger stores and the strategy of expanding product categories. The largest stores have also helped to build expanded category demand in the digital channel. This past weekend, the brand opened another larger format store in the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto. Besides an expanded assortment of home products, shoes, accessories and beauty products, the Palo Alto store also offers a full assortment of BHLDN wedding gowns and occasion dresses and Terrain outdoor living products and decor. The store also provides customers with a Terrain Café [ph] for casual dining. Customer reaction has been fantastic, with weekend sales coming in 33% above plan.
During the quarter, Anthropologie was the second of our brands to migrate to our new digital platform. This platform allows for improved response time, a better card and checkout experience and vastly improved user visibility across all screen sizes. After being installed for 1 month, the brand has seen a 40% improvement in user load time and a double-digit increase in conversion. The URBN brand plans to migrate to this platform early next year.
I want to congratulate David, Meg and the Anthropologie, BHLDN and Terrain teams for their successes in growing the expanded categories, in launching the larger format stores and in producing strong digital channel growth. These important achievements continue to strengthen an already powerful brand.
Turning now to Urban Outfitter results in Q3, the brand delivered a terrific quarter. Total Retail segment comp sales grew by over 5%, driven by a double-digit increase in direct-to-consumer sales and positive store comps in both North America and Europe. Impressively, all product categories delivered strong regular priced comps in the period. A year ago, I referred to the stable foundation the brand had rebuilt from which they could grow. I'm pleased to report they are now delivering this growth, doing so by creating compelling, trend-right product through internal designs and third-party collaborations, by producing differentiated and engaging shopping environments, both in stores and online, by elevating creative imagery and social engagement and by executing exceptional marketing campaigns.
Looking at results by category. Women's apparel and accessories were both strong. The expanded categories, intimates, beauty, home decor and tech, all continue to excel. And for the first time in 8 quarters, men's apparel delivered a positive comp as well. Furthermore, the brand grew its male customer base by 17% on a year-over-year basis.
The Urban brand also realized improved IMU and lower markdowns versus the prior year, which drove 200 basis points of improvement in merchandise margins on top of impressive increases last year. In the last 2 quarters, the URBN brand has delivered an historic low markdown rate. While we may see a slight uptick in the fourth quarter, we believe markdown rates could improve even more as we execute initiatives to increase inventory turns and decrease weeks of supply.
This year, the URBN store teams have further refined the shop-in-shop concepts first introduced in August 2015. These concept shops allow for a larger assortments of expanded category products and more accurately align product demand by category with space allocation. The stores look and feel dramatically different and now provide a clear engaging shopping experience. The customer has responded to these changes. During the quarter, in spite of negative store traffic on a macro level, the brand experienced higher store  traffic counts and positive comps across all regions for the first time in 13 quarters. Meanwhile, third quarter metrics in the direct-to-consumer channel remained strongly positive with sessions, sales and number of orders all showing  double-digit increases and customer frequency up as well. Our customer file continues to grow with double-digit increases in new, retained and reactivated customers.
Across both channels, the teams created compelling brand marketing messages. Our social media team continue to drive significant engagement with particularly strong year-over-year increases in Instagram and Pinterest, which were up 60% and 44%, respectively. The brand now enjoys more than 6 million Instagram followers, and many are highly interactive.
The marketing team worked on many notable social campaigns in the quarter, with the Justin Bieber launch registering as our brand's largest social reach to date. UO launched an exclusive product collaboration with Bieber for his Purpose Tour [ph] in August. This was a timed launched in stores and online: first in London, then in New York City and then in Los Angeles. Long lines formed at Urban stores globally to purchase Purpose Tour paraphernalia. Customers were highly engaged on social and registered 237 million Twitter impressions for this event, and the exclusive product, Cola, [ph] received impressive coverage from influencers, digital and print outlets.
In summary, the URBN brand is enjoying considerable success. The brand is once again the destination for their core customer. It's [ph] in-stores, online and via social media, the customer is engaged with the brand like never before. Congratulations to Trish, Meg and their teams on both sides of the Atlantic for orchestrating this remarkable achievement.

The extra and extended categories are performing extremely well, so I really don't think it's a problem with stores per se. I think the real problem is that there are just too many stores in North America. And I think what you see day in and day out are reports people either reducing their store count or going out of business altogether, which I believe over the long term will reduce the store count and bring the supply and demand back in line. With that, I guess the answered your question is I think we're doing things just about right. We're opening a few stores and it's very selective. We're very diligent in making sure the pro forma is work. And when we go into re-up and we have to find a new lease, we're being diligent about the perhaps downward pressure on sales and looking for rents that are either a little bit lower or very close to what still would be making money.

I will begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 third quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter, then I will share some of our thoughts concerning our fourth quarter.Total company or URBN sa",1245,"Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 third quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter, then I will share some of our thoughts concerning our fourth quarter.
Total company or URBN sales for the third quarter increased by 5% to a third quarter record of $862 million. This sales increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a 30% increase in Wholesale segment sales and a $12 million increase in noncomp sales, including the opening of 12 net new stores in the quarter and sales from the newly acquired Vetri Family restaurants.
Please keep in mind that the third quarter last year was negatively impacted by approximately $9 million of wholesale shipments that slipped into the fourth quarter due to delays at our recently opened East Coast fulfillment center.
Additionally, please note that foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales growth by approximately 120 basis points in the quarter.
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting another double-digit sales gain, driven by an increase in sessions and conversion rate, which more than offset a decrease in average order value. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased average unit selling price and a slight decrease in transactions, both of which were partially offset by an increase in units per transaction.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 5.2% at Urban Outfitters, while Free People and Anthropologie were down 1.5% and 2.7%, respectively. Our URBN Retail segment comp was strongest in September followed by October, with August being the weakest.
Free People Wholesale segment sales delivered another solid quarter as sales rose 30% to $77.5 million. As noted earlier, the quarter year-on-year sales growth rate benefited from approximately $9 million of shipments moving out of last year's third quarter into last year's fourth quarter. If you were to adjust last year's number for these shipments, our Wholesale segment growth would have been 13% in this year's third quarter. These results were driven by increased space at select department stores to support our category expansions like shoes and FP Movement.
Now moving on to gross profit. Total URBN gross profit for the quarter increased 4% to $300 million. Gross profit rate declined by 15 basis points to 34.8%. The reduction in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased penetration of the direct-to-consumer channel resulting in increased customer delivery and overall logistics expense rates.
Within gross profit, maintained margin for the quarter was relatively flat versus last year with initial markup, or IMU, coming in lower on a year-over-year basis and markdowns coming in favorable on a year-over-year basis, essentially offsetting each other. IMU was lower due to the increased penetration of the Wholesale segment sales at Free People, which carries a lower IMU versus our Retail segment. IMU in our Retail segment increased due to improvements at each of our brands. Markdowns were favorable due to lower markdowns at the Urban Outfitters brand, which was partially offset by higher markdowns at the Anthropologie and Free People brands. Despite well-controlled inventory, Anthropologie was not able to hold their markdowns flat this quarter due to their challenging women's apparel performance.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 10.5% to $230 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 143 basis points to 26.6%. This SG&A deleverage was partially due to one-time legal settlements, which accounted for approximately 20% of our year-over-year growth or almost 50 basis points of deleverage. The remaining increase in SG&A primarily related to an increase in direct store controllable expenses. A large portion of these expenses were due to several large-format Anthropologie stores recently opened or opened in the quarter. While we are extremely pleased with the top line performance of these stores, we have invested a considerable amount to ensure the hiring, training and overall execution of these stores were second to none. Many of these expenses, preopening and initial staffing levels, we believe we can reduce and leverage in the upcoming year through improved control and planning based on our current years learnings.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 12% to $70 million, with operating profit margin declining by 158 basis points to 8.2%. Our tax rate for the quarter was 33.5% compared to 35.3% in the prior year. The improvement in the quarterly tax rate was due to the ratio of foreign taxable losses to global taxable profits in the year.
Net income for the quarter was $47 million or $0.40 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory increased by 3% to $454 million. The increase in inventory is primarily due to an increase in noncomp inventory to support our new and expanded stores. Our Retail segment inventory comp was up 1% at cost with both Anthropologie and Free People well controlled and appropriately negative.
Urban Outfitters inventory ended just slightly higher than where we would have liked it to be. We ended the quarter with $265 million in cash and marketable securities.
During the quarter, we repurchased and retired 1 million common shares for $35 million, leaving 6 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors authorization. Additionally during the quarter, we paid down the remaining $50 million on our outstanding revolver, completing full repayment of the $150 million this fiscal year.
As we enter the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 23 net new stores for the year, excluding our food and beverage division. For the fourth quarter, we are planning 4 net new stores, including 1 new Urban Outfitters store in North America, 1 new Anthropologie store in the U.K, 2 Anthropologie closures in North America due to lease expiration and 4 new Free People stores and 1 closure due to lease expiration. The planned fourth quarter openings will result in the following store changes for the year: 3 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe; 7 net new Anthropologie stores, including 2 in Europe; and 13 net new Free People stores.
For fiscal 2017, we also opened 2 new Vetri pizzerias and 1 café adjacent to an Anthropologie large-format store.
Now on to gross margin. We believe our fourth quarter gross margin rate could decrease versus the prior year primarily due to higher markdowns. These markdowns could be driven by higher markdowns at Anthropologie related to their women's apparel performance and slightly higher markdowns at Urban Outfitters related to marginally higher inventory.
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a mid-single-digit rate for the fourth quarter. This increase would be largely driven by increased store-related expenses to support our noncomp store-based growth.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $160 million. Total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new, relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Finally, we are still planning our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate to be approximately 36% for the year and believe our fourth quarter tax rate will be lower than our annual planned rate. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Sheila Harrington, President of the Free People brand."

Today, I will discuss a few highlights from Free People's third quarter performance and then review the progress of the brand, the brand has made on our strategic growth initiative. In total, the Free People brand grew revenues by 16% this past quarter. The brand's strongest growth came from our Wholesale business segment, which delivered a 30% increase. When normalized for last year's operational challenges in our distribution center, the growth is still a strong 13% increase. This growth was driven by strength in our core apparel collection, increased business with online partnerships, along with a growth in expanded categories, including Movement, intimates and shoes, both domestic and in Europe. A double-digit increase in forward bookings makes us feel confident in the health of our wholesale business.
I would like to congratulate Krissy Meehan-Mashinsky as well as the entire Wholesale team in leading this brand expansion. 
Free People's Retail segment sales grew by 6% in the quarter through the opening of 3 new stores, partially offset by a negative 1.5% comp.
During the quarter, August was our weakest comp, reflecting a difficult seasonal transition. As we clear to the product and began flowing newer fashion into our stores and our direct-to-consumer channel, our business showed significant improvement with both September and October delivering positive Retail segment comps. While the store showed improvement as the quarter progressed, the direct-to-consumer channel led the way with double-digit regular priced comps, fueled -- fueling a positive direct-to-consumer comp for the quarter.
The customer clearly has reacted positively to our women's apparel's fall fashion online, and we believe this momentum can continue into the fourth quarter. We reacted to those reads by taking appropriate markdowns and are flowing in increased levels of product freshness through the holiday season.
Now I would like to discuss our progress on our long-term strategic growth initiatives.
We remain focused on improving our website overall shopping experience. We launched a new web platform for our direct-to-consumer channel in the first quarter of this year and have seen the benefits of this initiative. The site's load time is faster, we have streamlined our checkout process and enhanced our search capabilities, to name a few of the benefits, of which we believe has helped to improve our website conversion. Additionally, in September, we have launched the iOS shopping app in both the U.K. and China. Over 15,000 users have downloaded the app in China, and sales through the app already represent 45% of demand within this region. With our customers' growing affinity for mobile devices, we believe these types of investments are critical to our future success. While technology is considerably a part of the shopping experience, Free People's delivery of creativity and inspirational imagery has always been a cornerstone to our success. The social team has continued to raise level of engaging content, including videos, photographic imagery and collaboration. This resulted in over 3 million Instagram followers at 30% increase over last year.
Finally and extremely important for our long-term growth is the progress the brand has made in our new and expanded categories. The brand launched beauty and wellness online in July with a carefully curated assortment focused on natural, cruelty-free products, including makeup, skincare and [indiscernible].
Early customer reads have been positive. Movement and beauty collectively accounted for 20% of the growth in the direct-to-consumer channel during the third quarter. Additionally, our expanded categories are featured in our larger retail store location. We opened 3 larger format locations in the quarter, 2 of which are new locations, Honolulu and Charlotte, and 1 of which was a relocation and expansion of our store in King of Prussia mall. The King of Prussia store now houses all expanded categories, including beauty, in just over 6,000 selling square feet. The store has become a true brand-defining destination, incorporating the touch and spirit of Free People.
In closing, I am proud of the team's ability to react quickly and create positive momentum as the quarter progressed. This is a testament to their creativity and nimbleness. I would like to thank the entire Free People team for their inspiration and dedication. Additionally, a sincere thank you to Meg Hayne for her passion, encouragement and the relentless pursuit of excellence for the brand. While the brand has grown significantly over the past several years, we believe there's more opportunity ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Dick."

Sheila, congratulations to you, Meg and the Free People team on the terrific progress you've made with your apparel assortment. Your design and merchant teams did an excellent job of interpreting the fashion trends. Had it not been for difficult seasonal transition in August, Free People comp sales would've been nicely positive in Q3. I believe the improved fashion, coupled with better inventory control, should allow the Free People brand to enjoy a positive holiday season. Good work, Sheila, and thanks for your leadership.
Now let me turn to a discussion around 2 of the retail topics I find most interesting, the shift in channel demand and the shift in fashion silhouette, and discuss how these changes have impacted our brands in the third quarter.
The diversions in demand by channel that we witnessed over the past few years continued in Q3 this year. In general, the digital channel outperformed, stores lagged and Wholesale delivered strong growth.
In the store channel, physical shopping visits, as reported by industry groups, continue to be down on a year-over-year basis. Overall traffic fell by mid-single digits in Q3 for the second consecutive year. With several notable exceptions, our brands comp store sales echoed this traffic pattern and were negative in almost all regions by all store types: mall, lifestyle centers and freestanding. Lower comp store sales at the Anthropologie and Free People brand in Q3 were driven primarily by fewer transactions and lower AUR. There were, however, a few bright spots in store channel performance. The Urban brand produced positive store comps in North America and Europe, and the Anthropologie brand registered positive comps in Europe, and the recently opened larger format stores continued to exceed expectations and deliver sales per square foot greater than the Anthro average. That said, URBN store comps were negative in Q3.
The direct-to-consumer channel, on the other hand, delivered strong double-digit sales growth in the quarter. Both traffic measured in sessions and total number of orders received grew at double-digit rates, and total conversion improved as well. Within the digital world, customers continue to migrate from desktop to mobile as preferred method of interaction. Mobile devices now account for almost 2/3 of total company digital sessions. The strength in the digital channel more than offset the weakness in stores, with total Retail segment comp sales increasing by 1% in the third quarter. The disparity in channel results demonstrates that the consumers' affinity for digital shopping continues to grow. Her expectations around functionality and service levels in this channel are also growing. This is why we continue to make significant investments in personnel and technology that will expand our online assortments, enhance and personalize the digital experience, give us more insight into customer preferences and permit us to deliver orders faster and more reliably. Improving our capabilities in the digital channel is one of our strategic priorities.
The third channel is Wholesale. In Q3, the Free People Wholesale business reported a 30% spike in sales. But as Frank and Sheila both explained earlier, this year's results benefited from shipping delays last year. Adjusting for this anomaly, Wholesale still produced solid gains across all customer types: specialty store, department store and e-commerce retailers. During the quarter, we also saw a shift in fashion silhouette that I've alluded to in prior calls begin to strengthen. This emerging trend, which seems to have its roots in Europe, is not impacting all brands equally. Predictably, younger, more fashion-forward customers are adopting these new looks more readily. So in Q3, the Urban and Free People brands benefited from the shift, while the Anthropologie brand did not.
In the fashion industry, times of rapid change likely see when silhouette shift offer the greatest opportunities but also pose the greatest risks.
Now let me turn your attention to the Anthropologie brand, where third quarter top line results were very similar to Q2. Total Retail segment comp sales landed at negative 3% in the quarter with weakness in stores more than offsetting the growth in direct-to-consumer sales. The comp shortfall was driven entirely by the apparel category. All other product categories and sub-brands delivered positive Retail segment comps. The expanded categories of home, beauty, BHLDN and Terrain performed particularly well.
We expected to see more progress in the apparel category, but customer response to fall assortments was lackluster. This led to higher markdowns versus the prior year period even though inventories, which ended down 3%, were tightly controlled. While we could see modest comp sales improvement in Q4 over Q3 rate, we believe apparel sales on a year-over-year basis will likely remain difficult and weigh on total Anthropologie comps and margins for the holiday season.
Transitions in fashion silhouette are never linear or easy to predict. As the customer becomes more comfortable with a different silhouette and our merchants become comfortable presenting her with more newness, we expect better results. I believe we will begin to see improvement in customer reactions to the apparel offerings with our 2017 spring/summer deliveries.
Despite the apparel issues, we remain confident the emotional bonds between the brand and our customers remain strong. She is responding enthusiastically to all of our expanded categories, especially our newly expanded home assortment. Reaction to the 200-page home journal mailed to customers in September exceeded plans significantly, so the home team is expanding the assortment further and plans to mail another home journal in spring.
Other expansion categories experienced double-digit comp sales as well. During the third quarter, BHLDN opened 2 new shop-in-shop locations and launched a series of omnichannel marketing initiatives, which resulted in strong store and digital sales gains. The beauty category expanded into 65 additional stores during the quarter, and the Terrain brand continue to benefit from inclusion into the Anthropologie Group.
During the quarter, Terrain launched several cross marketing initiatives and opened its first shop-in-shop in the new Walnut Creek Anthropologie store. And in early November, Terrain launched 10 holiday trim shop-in-shops in core Anthropologie stores.
In Q3, Anthropologie opened 2 additional larger format locations: Walnut Creek, California and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. To date, sales at these stores are running nicely ahead of projections, which strengthens our confidence in the brand, the strategy of opening larger stores and the strategy of expanding product categories. The largest stores have also helped to build expanded category demand in the digital channel. This past weekend, the brand opened another larger format store in the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto. Besides an expanded assortment of home products, shoes, accessories and beauty products, the Palo Alto store also offers a full assortment of BHLDN wedding gowns and occasion dresses and Terrain outdoor living products and decor. The store also provides customers with a Terrain café for casual dining. Customer reaction has been fantastic, with weekend sales coming in 33% above plan.
During the quarter, Anthropologie was the second of our brands to migrate to our new digital platform. This platform allows for improved response time, a better card and checkout experience and vastly improved user visibility across all screen sizes. After being installed for 1 month, the brand has seen a 40% improvement in user load time and a double-digit increase in conversion. The URBN brand plans to migrate to this platform early next year.
I want to congratulate David, Meg and the Anthropologie, BHLDN and Terrain teams for their successes in growing the expanded categories, in launching the larger format stores and in producing strong digital channel growth. These important achievements continue to strengthen an already powerful brand.
Turning now to Urban Outfitter results in Q3, the brand delivered a terrific quarter. Total Retail segment comp sales grew by over 5%, driven by a double-digit increase in direct-to-consumer sales and positive store comps in both North America and Europe. Impressively, all product categories delivered strong regular priced comps in the period. A year ago, I referred to the stable foundation the brand had rebuilt from which they could grow. I'm pleased to report they are now delivering this growth, doing so by creating compelling, trend-right product through internal designs and third-party collaborations, by producing differentiated and engaging shopping environments, both in stores and online, by elevating creative imagery and social engagement and by executing exceptional marketing campaigns.
Looking at results by category. Women's apparel and accessories were both strong. The expanded categories, intimates, beauty, home decor and tech, all continue to excel. And for the first time in 8 quarters, men's apparel delivered a positive comp as well. Furthermore, the brand grew its male customer base by 17% on a year-over-year basis.
The Urban brand also realized improved IMU and lower markdowns versus the prior year, which drove 200 basis points of improvement in merchandise margins on top of impressive increases last year. In the last 2 quarters, the URBN brand has delivered an historic low markdown rate. While we may see a slight uptick in the fourth quarter, we believe markdown rates could improve even more as we execute initiatives to increase inventory turns and decrease weeks of supply.
This year, the URBN store teams have further refined the shop-in-shop concepts first introduced in August 2015. These concept shops allow for a larger assortments of expanded category products and more accurately align product demand by category with space allocation. The stores look and feel dramatically different and now provide a clear engaging shopping experience. The customer has responded to these changes. During the quarter, in spite of negative store traffic on a macro level, the brand experienced higher store  traffic counts and positive comps across all regions for the first time in 13 quarters. Meanwhile, third quarter metrics in the direct-to-consumer channel remained strongly positive with sessions, sales and number of orders all showing  double-digit increases and customer frequency up as well. Our customer file continues to grow with double-digit increases in new, retained and reactivated customers.
Across both channels, the teams created compelling brand marketing messages. Our social media team continue to drive significant engagement with particularly strong year-over-year increases in Instagram and Pinterest, which were up 60% and 44%, respectively. The brand now enjoys more than 6 million Instagram followers, and many are highly interactive.
The marketing team worked on many notable social campaigns in the quarter, with the Justin Bieber launch registering as our brand's largest social reach to date. UO launched an exclusive product collaboration with Bieber for his Purpose Tour in August. This was a timed launched in stores and online: first in London, then in New York City and then in Los Angeles. Long lines formed at Urban stores globally to purchase Purpose Tour paraphernalia. Customers were highly engaged on social and registered 237 million Twitter impressions for this event, and the exclusive product collab received impressive coverage from influencers, digital and print outlets.
In summary, the URBN brand is enjoying considerable success. The brand is once again the destination for their core customer. In-stores, online and via social media, the customer is engaged with the brand like never before. Congratulations to Trish, Meg and their teams on both sides of the Atlantic for orchestrating this remarkable achievement.
Before I turn the call over for your questions, I want to recognize and thank our 26,000 associates worldwide, including our teams in North America and Europe. I thank our wholesale partners, domestic and international, and our many vendors and suppliers. Lastly, I extend my thanks to our many shareholders for their continued support.

So I think that each of the brands has a different customer segment that will adapt to the shift at different times in different levels. It's always a difficult thing to judge how much of the old and how much of the new based on how many customers you have that are more advanced and how many you have that are less advanced. So -- but the overall point that I'm trying to make, a, besides the fact that there is a shift going on and in progress is in the long term, it's incredibly positive for fashion retailers."

With that being said and given the general not uncertainty but sort of for we are in the stage of the curve, we're making certain to enter spring lean in apparel in particular, so that we can read and react, as Dick and Frank alluded to, thinking about ways that we can speed our turn and reduce markdowns for spring."

That's the goal. If you look at the overage to last year, again, it's light. But if you look at the inventory overage against a 3-year average, we're still way under historic -- where we've been historically. So we're dealing with it and look forward to Q4."

No, I don't think that -- first of all, you know we have one of the leanest store fleets in the industry, and I don't think there's any way we can consider ourselves over stored.

As far as the Anthropologie large-format stores are concerned, I think we're -- it's been proven that it was a very good idea. The extra and extended categories are performing extremely well, so I don't -- I really don't think it's a problem with stores per se. I think the real problem is that there are just too many stores in North America. And I think what you see day in and day out are reports of people either reducing their store count or going out of business altogether, which I believe over the long term will reduce the store count and bring the supply and demand back in line. With that, I guess the answer to your question is I think we're doing things just about right. We're opening a few stores, and it's very selective. We're very diligent in making sure the pro formas work. And when we go into re-op and we have to find a new lease, we're being diligent about the perhaps downward pressure on sales and looking for rents that are either a little bit lower or very close to what still would be making money. So I think we're right on track there, and I look forward in 2 or 3 or even 4 years when I think you're going to see significantly fewer stores across the country and the supply of apparel product decrease."

Total company or URBN sales for the third quarter increased by 5% to a third quarter record of $862 million. This sales increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a 30% increase in Wholesale segment sales and a $12 million increase in noncomp sales, including the opening of 12 net new stores in the quarter and sales from the newly acquired Vetri Family restaurants.
Please keep in mind that the third quarter last year was negatively impacted by approximately $9 million of wholesale shipments that slipped into the fourth quarter due to delays at our recently opened East Coast fulfillment center.
Additionally, please note that foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales growth by approximately 120 basis points in the quarter.
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting another double-digit sales gain, driven by an increase in sessions and conversion rate, which more than offset a decrease in average order value. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased average unit selling price and a slight decrease in transactions, both of which were partially offset by an increase in units per transaction.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 5.2% at Urban Outfitters, while Free People and Anthropologie were down 1.5% and 2.7%, respectively. Our URBN Retail segment comp was strongest in September followed by October, with August being the weakest.
Free People Wholesale segment sales delivered another solid quarter as sales rose 30% to $77.5 million. As noted earlier, the quarter year-on-year sales growth rate benefited from approximately $9 million of shipments moving out of last year's third quarter into last year's fourth quarter. If you were to adjust last year's number for these shipments, our Wholesale segment growth would have been 13% in this year's third quarter. These results were driven by increased space at select department stores to support our category expansions like shoes and FP Movement.
Now moving on to gross profit. Total URBN gross profit for the quarter increased 4% to $300 million. Gross profit rate declined by 15 basis points to 34.8%. The reduction in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased penetration of the direct-to-consumer channel resulting in increased customer delivery and overall logistics expense rates.
Within gross profit, maintained margin for the quarter was relatively flat versus last year with initial markup, or IMU, coming in lower on a year-over-year basis and markdowns coming in favorable on a year-over-year basis, essentially offsetting each other. IMU was lower due to the increased penetration of the Wholesale segment sales at Free People, which carries a lower IMU versus our Retail segment. IMU in our Retail segment increased due to improvements at each of our brands. Markdowns were favorable due to lower markdowns at the Urban Outfitters brand, which was partially offset by higher markdowns at the Anthropologie and Free People brands. Despite well-controlled inventory, Anthropologie was not able to hold their markdowns flat this quarter due to their challenging women's apparel performance.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 10.5% to $230 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 143 basis points to 26.6%. This SG&A deleverage was partially due to onetime legal settlements, which accounted for approximately 20% of our year-over-year growth or almost 50 basis points of deleverage. The remaining increase in SG&A primarily related to an increase in direct store controllable expenses. A large portion of these expenses were due to several large-format Anthropologie stores recently opened or opened in the quarter. While we are extremely pleased with the top line performance of these stores, we have invested a considerable amount to ensure the hiring, training and overall execution of these stores were second to none. Many of these expenses, preopening and initial staffing levels, we believe we can reduce and leverage in the upcoming year through improved control and planning based on our current year's learnings.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 12% to $70 million, with operating profit margin declining by 158 basis points to 8.2%. Our tax rate for the quarter was 33.5% compared to 35.3% in the prior year. The improvement in the quarterly tax rate was due to the ratio of foreign taxable losses to global taxable profits in the year.
Net income for the quarter was $47 million or $0.40 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory increased by 3% to $454 million. The increase in inventory is primarily due to an increase in noncomp inventory to support our new and expanded stores. Our Retail segment inventory comp was up 1% at cost with both Anthropologie and Free People well controlled and appropriately negative.
Urban Outfitters inventory ended just slightly higher than where we would have liked it to be. We ended the quarter with $265 million in cash and marketable securities.
During the quarter, we repurchased and retired 1 million common shares for $35 million, leaving 6 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors authorization. Additionally during the quarter, we paid down the remaining $50 million on our outstanding revolver, completing full repayment of the $150 million this fiscal year.
As we enter the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 23 net new stores for the year, excluding our food and beverage division. For the fourth quarter, we are planning 4 net new stores, including 1 new Urban Outfitters store in North America, 1 new Anthropologie store in the U.K, 2 Anthropologie closures in North America due to lease expiration and 4 new Free People stores and 1 closure due to lease expiration. The planned fourth quarter openings would result in the following store changes for the year: 3 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe; 7 net new Anthropologie stores, including 2 in Europe; and 13 net new Free People stores.
For fiscal 2017, we also opened 2 new Vetri pizzerias and 1 café adjacent to an Anthropologie large-format store.
Now on to gross margin. We believe our fourth quarter gross margin rate could decrease versus the prior year primarily due to higher markdowns. These markdowns could be driven by higher markdowns at Anthropologie related to their women's apparel performance and slightly higher markdowns at Urban Outfitters related to marginally higher inventory.
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a mid-single-digit rate for the fourth quarter. This increase would be largely driven by increased store-related expenses to support our noncomp store-based growth.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $160 million. Total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new, relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Finally, we are still planning our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate to be approximately 36% for the year and believe our fourth quarter tax rate will be lower than our annual planned rate. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Sheila Harrington, President of the Free People brand."

Today, I will discuss a few highlights from Free People's third quarter performance and then review the progress of the brand -- the brand has made on our strategic growth initiative. In total, the Free People brand grew revenues by 16% this past quarter. The brand's strongest growth came from our Wholesale business segment, which delivered a 30% increase. When normalized for last year's operational challenges in our distribution center, the growth was still a strong 13% increase. This growth was driven by strength in our core apparel collection, increased business with online partnerships, along with the growth in expanded categories, including Movement, intimates and shoes, both domestic and in Europe. A double-digit increase in forward bookings makes us feel confident in the health of our wholesale business.
I would like to congratulate Krissy Meehan-Mashinsky as well as the entire Wholesale team in leading this brand expansion. 
Free People's Retail segment sales grew by 6% in the quarter through the opening of 3 new stores, partially offset by a negative 1.5% comp.
During the quarter, August was our weakest comp, reflecting a difficult seasonal transition. As we cleared through the product and began flowing newer fashion into our stores and our direct-to-consumer channel, our business showed significant improvement with both September and October delivering positive Retail segment comps. While the store showed improvement as the quarter progressed, the direct-to-consumer channel led the way with double-digit regular priced comps, fueled -- fueling a positive direct-to-consumer comp for the quarter.
The customer clearly has reacted positively to our women's apparel fall fashion online, and we believe this momentum can continue into the fourth quarter. We reacted to those reads by taking appropriate markdowns and are flowing in increased levels of product freshness through the holiday season.
Now I would like to discuss our progress on our long-term strategic growth initiatives.
We remain focused on improving our website overall shopping experience. We launched a new web platform for our direct-to-consumer channel in the first quarter of this year and have seen the benefits of this initiative. The site's load time is faster. We have streamlined our checkout process and enhanced our search capabilities, to name a few of the benefits, of which we believe has helped to improve our website conversion. Additionally, in September, we have launched the iOS shopping app in both the U.K. and China. Over 15,000 users have downloaded the app in China, and sales through the app already represent 45% of demand within this region. With our customers' growing affinity for our mobile devices, we believe these types of investments are critical to our future success. While technology is considerably a part of the shopping experience, Free People's delivery of creativity and inspirational imagery has always been a cornerstone to our success. The social team has continued to raise the level of engaging content, including videos, photographic imagery and collaborations. This resulted in over 3 million Instagram followers, a 30% increase over last year.
Finally and extremely important for our long-term growth, is the progress the brand has made in our new and expanded categories. The brand launched beauty and wellness online in July with a carefully curated assortment focused on natural, cruelty-free products, including makeup, skincare and supplements.
Early customer reads have been positive. Movement and Beauty collectively accounted for 20% of the growth in the direct-to-consumer channel during the third quarter. Additionally, our expanded categories are featured in our larger retail store location. We opened 3 larger format locations in the quarter, 2 of which are new locations, Honolulu and Charlotte, and 1 of which was a relocation and expansion of our store in King of Prussia mall. The King of Prussia store now houses all expanded categories, including beauty, in just over 6,000 selling square feet. The store has become a true brand-defining destination, incorporating the touch and spirit of Free People.
In closing, I am proud of the team's ability to react quickly and create positive momentum as the quarter progressed. This is a testament to their creativity and nimbleness. I would like to thank the entire Free People team for their inspiration and dedication. Additionally, a sincere thank you to Meg Hayne for her passion, encouragement and the relentless pursuit of excellence for the brand. While the brand has grown significantly over the past several years, we believe there's more opportunity ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Dick."

Sheila, congratulations to you, Meg and the Free People team on the terrific progress you've made with your apparel assortment. Your design and merchant teams did an excellent job of interpreting the fashion trends. Had it not been for a difficult seasonal transition in August, Free People comp sales would've been nicely positive in Q3. I believe the improved fashion, coupled with better inventory control, should allow the Free People brand to enjoy a positive holiday season. Good work, Sheila, and thanks for your leadership.
Now let me turn to a discussion around 2 of the retail topics I find most interesting, the shift in channel demand and the shift in fashion silhouette, and discuss how these changes have impacted our brands in the third quarter.
The divergence in demand by channel that we've witnessed over the past few years continued in Q3 this year. In general, the digital channel outperformed, stores lagged and Wholesale delivered strong growth.
In the store channel, physical shopping visits, as reported by industry groups, continue to be down on a year-over-year basis. Overall traffic fell by mid-single digits in Q3 for the second consecutive year. With several notable exceptions, our brands' comp store sales echoed this traffic pattern and were negative in almost all regions and by all store types: mall, lifestyle centers and freestanding. Lower comp store sales at the Anthropologie and Free People brand in Q3 were driven primarily by fewer transactions and lower AUR. There were, however, a few bright spots in store channel performance. The Urban brand produced positive store comps in North America and Europe, and the Anthropologie brand registered positive comps in Europe, and the recently opened larger format stores continued to exceed expectations and deliver sales per square foot greater than the Anthro average. That said, URBN store comps were negative in Q3.
The direct-to-consumer channel, on the other hand, delivered strong double-digit sales growth in the quarter. Both traffic measured in sessions and total number of orders received grew at double-digit rates, and total conversion improved as well. Within the digital world, customers continue to migrate from desktop to mobile as a preferred method of interaction. Mobile devices now account for almost 2/3 of total company digital sessions. The strength in the digital channel more than offset the weakness in stores, with total Retail segment comp sales increasing by 1% in the third quarter. The disparity in channel results demonstrates that the consumers' affinity for digital shopping continues to grow. Her expectations around functionality and service levels in this channel are also growing. This is why we continue to make significant investments in personnel and technology that will expand our online assortments, enhance and personalize the digital experience, give us more insight into customer preferences and permit us to deliver orders faster and more reliably. Improving our capabilities in the digital channel is one of our strategic priorities.
The third channel is Wholesale. In Q3, the Free People Wholesale business reported a 30% spike in sales. But as Frank and Sheila both explained earlier, this year's results benefited from shipping delays last year. Adjusting for this anomaly, Wholesale still produced solid gains across all customer types: specialty store, department store and e-commerce retailers. During the quarter, we also saw a shift in fashion silhouette that I've alluded to on prior calls begin to strengthen. This emerging trend, which seems to have its roots in Europe, is not impacting all brands equally. Predictably, younger, more fashion-forward customers are adopting these new looks more readily. So in Q3, the Urban and Free People brands benefited from the shift, while the Anthropologie brand did not.
In the fashion industry, times of rapid change like we see when silhouettes shift offer the greatest opportunities but also pose the greatest risks.
Now let me turn your attention to the Anthropologie brand, where third quarter top line results were very similar to Q2. Total Retail segment comp sales landed at negative 3% in the quarter with weakness in stores more than offsetting the growth in direct-to-consumer sales. The comp shortfall was driven entirely by the apparel category. All other product categories and sub-brands delivered positive Retail segment comps. The expanded categories of home, beauty, BHLDN and Terrain performed particularly well.
We expected to see more progress in the apparel category, but customer response to fall assortments was lackluster. This led to higher markdowns versus the prior year period even though inventories, which ended down 3%, were tightly controlled. While we could see modest comp sales improvement in Q4 over Q3 rate, we believe apparel sales on a year-over-year basis will likely remain difficult and weigh on total Anthropologie comps and margins for the holiday season.
Transitions in fashion silhouette are never linear or easy to predict. As a customer becomes more comfortable with a different silhouette and our merchants become comfortable presenting her with more newness, we expect better results. I believe we will begin to see improvement in customer reaction to the apparel offerings with our 2017 spring/summer deliveries.
Despite the apparel issues, we remain confident the emotional bonds between the brand and our customers remain strong. She is responding enthusiastically to all of our expanded categories, especially our newly expanded home assortment. Reaction to the 200-page Home journal mailed to customers in September exceeded plan significantly, so the Home team is expanding the assortment further and plans to mail another Home journal in spring.
Other expansion categories experienced double-digit comp sales as well. During the third quarter, BHLDN opened 2 new shop-in-shop locations and launched a series of omnichannel marketing initiatives, which resulted in strong store and digital sales gains. The beauty category expanded into 65 additional stores during the quarter, and the Terrain brand continued to benefit from inclusion into the Anthropologie Group.
During the quarter, Terrain launched several cross marketing initiatives and opened its first shop-in-shop in the new Walnut Creek Anthropologie store. And in early November, Terrain launched 10 holiday trim shop-in-shops in core Anthropologie stores.
In Q3, Anthropologie opened 2 additional larger format locations: Walnut Creek, California and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. To date, sales at these stores are running nicely ahead of projections, which strengthens our confidence in the brand, the strategy of opening larger stores and the strategy of expanding product categories. The largest stores have also helped to build expanded category demand in the digital channel. This past weekend, the brand opened another larger format store in the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto. Besides an expanded assortment of home products, shoes, accessories and beauty products, the Palo Alto store also offers a full assortment of BHLDN wedding gowns and occasion dresses and Terrain outdoor living products and decor. The store also provides customers with a Terrain café for casual dining. Customer reaction has been fantastic, with weekend sales coming in 33% above plan.
During the quarter, Anthropologie was the second of our brands to migrate to our new digital platform. This platform allows for improved response time, a better cart and checkout experience and vastly improved user visibility across all screen sizes. After being installed for 1 month, the brand has seen a 40% improvement in user load time and a double-digit increase in conversion. The URBN brand plans to migrate to this platform early next year.
I want to congratulate David, Meg and the Anthropologie, BHLDN and Terrain teams for their successes in growing the expanded categories, in launching the larger format stores and in producing strong digital channel growth. These important achievements continue to strengthen an already powerful brand.
Turning now to Urban Outfitter results in Q3, the brand delivered a terrific quarter. Total Retail segment comp sales grew by over 5%, driven by a double-digit increase in direct-to-consumer sales and positive store comps in both North America and Europe. Impressively, all product categories delivered strong regular priced comps in the period. A year ago, I referred to the stable foundation the brand had rebuilt from which they could grow. I'm pleased to report they are now delivering this growth, doing so by creating compelling, trend-right product through internal designs and third-party collaborations, by producing differentiated and engaging shopping environments, both in stores and online, by elevating creative imagery and social engagement and by executing exceptional marketing campaigns.
Looking at results by category. Women's apparel and accessories were both strong. The expanded categories, intimates, beauty, home decor and tech, all continue to excel. And for the first time in 8 quarters, men's apparel delivered a positive comp as well. Furthermore, the brand grew its male customer base by 17% on a year-over-year basis.
The Urban brand also realized improved IMU and lower markdowns versus the prior year, which drove 200 basis points of improvement in merchandise margins on top of impressive increases last year. In the last 2 quarters, the URBN brand has delivered an historic low markdown rate. While we may see a slight uptick in the fourth quarter, we believe markdown rates could improve even more as we execute initiatives to increase inventory turns and decrease weeks of supply.
This year, the URBN store teams have further refined the shop-in-shop concepts first introduced in August 2015. These concept shops allow for larger assortments of expanded category products and more accurately align product demand by category with space allocation. The stores look and feel dramatically different and now provide a clear engaging shopping experience. The customer has responded to these changes. During the quarter, in spite of negative store traffic on a macro level, the brand experienced higher store  traffic counts and positive comps across all regions for the first time in 13 quarters. Meanwhile, third quarter metrics in the direct-to-consumer channel remain strongly positive with sessions, sales and number of orders all showing  double-digit increases and customer frequency up as well. Our customer file continues to grow with double-digit increases in new, retained and reactivated customers.
Across both channels, the teams created compelling brand marketing messages. Our social media team continued to drive significant engagement with particularly strong year-over-year increases in Instagram and Pinterest, which were up 60% and 44%, respectively. The brand now enjoys more than 6 million Instagram followers, and many are highly interactive.
The marketing team worked on many notable social campaigns in the quarter, with a Justin Bieber launch registering as our brand's largest social reach to date. UO launched an exclusive product collaboration with Bieber for his Purpose Tour in August. This was a timed launched in stores and online: first in London, then in New York City and then in Los Angeles. Long lines formed at Urban stores globally to purchase Purpose Tour paraphernalia. Customers were highly engaged on social and registered 237 million Twitter impressions for this event, and the exclusive product collab received impressive coverage from influencers, digital and print outlets.
In summary, the Urban brand is enjoying considerable success. The brand is once again the destination for their core customer. In-stores, online and via social media, the customer is engaged with the brand like never before. Congratulations to Trish, Meg and their teams on both sides of the Atlantic for orchestrating this remarkable achievement.
Before I turn the call over for your questions, I want to recognize and thank our 26,000 associates worldwide, including our teams in North America and Europe. I thank our wholesale partners, domestic and international, and our many vendors and suppliers. Lastly, I extend my thanks to our many shareholders for their continued support.

So -- but the overall point that I'm trying to make, a, besides the fact that there is a shift going on and in progress is that in the long term, it's incredibly positive for fashion retailers."

But relative to IMU, we are looking for some improvement there. Unfortunately right now, based on the current plan, we do believe that markdowns could cause the fourth quarter gross profit margin to be down similar to what we saw -- similar to the decrease of what we saw in the third quarter. And that's going to be -- could be largely driven by increased markdown rate at the Anthropologie brand based on their current performance at women's apparel division."

No, I don't think that -- first of all, you know we have one of the leanest store fleets in the industry, and I don't think there's any way we can consider ourselves over stored.

The extra and extended categories are performing extremely well, so I don't -- I really don't think it's a problem with stores per se. I think the real problem is that there are just too many stores in North America. And I think what you see day in and day out are reports of people either reducing their store count or going out of business altogether, which I believe over the long term will reduce the store count and bring the supply and demand back in line. With that, I guess the answer to your question is I think we're doing things just about right. We're opening a few stores, and it's very selective. We're very diligent in making sure the pro formas work. And when we go in to re-up and we have to sign a new lease, we're being diligent about the perhaps downward pressure on sales and looking for rents that are either a little bit lower or very close to what still would be making money. So I think we're right on track there.

I will begin my commentary discussing our fiscal 2017 third quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter, then I will share some of our thoughts concerning our fourth quarter.
Total company or URBN sales for the third quarter increased by 5% to a third quarter record of $862 million. This sales increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a 30% increase in Wholesale segment sales and a $12 million increase in noncomp sales, including the opening of 12 net new stores in the quarter and sales from the newly acquired Vetri Family restaurants.
Please keep in mind that the third quarter last year was negatively impacted by approximately $9 million of wholesale shipments that slipped into the fourth quarter due to delays at our recently opened East Coast fulfillment center.
Additionally, please note that foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales growth by approximately 120 basis points in the quarter.
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting another double-digit sales gain, driven by an increase in sessions and conversion rate, which more than offset a decrease in average order value. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased average unit selling price and a slight decrease in transactions, both of which were partially offset by an increase in units per transaction.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 5.2% at Urban Outfitters, while Free People and Anthropologie were down 1.5% and 2.7%, respectively. Our URBN Retail segment comp was strongest in September followed by October, with August being the weakest.
Free People Wholesale segment sales delivered another solid quarter as sales rose 30% to $77.5 million. As noted earlier, the quarter year-on-year sales growth rate benefited from approximately $9 million of shipments moving out of last year's third quarter into last year's fourth quarter. If you were to adjust last year's number for these shipments, our Wholesale segment growth would have been 13% in this year's third quarter. These results were driven by increased space at select department stores to support our category expansions like shoes and FP Movement.
Now moving on to gross profit. Total URBN gross profit for the quarter increased 4% to $300 million. Gross profit rate declined by 15 basis points to 34.8%. The reduction in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased penetration of the direct-to-consumer channel resulting in increased customer delivery and overall logistics expense rates.
Within gross profit, maintained margin for the quarter was relatively flat versus last year with initial markup, or IMU, coming in lower on a year-over-year basis and markdowns coming in favorable on a year-over-year basis, essentially offsetting each other. IMU was lower due to the increased penetration of the Wholesale segment sales at Free People, which carries a lower IMU versus our Retail segment. IMU in our Retail segment increased due to improvements at each of our brands. Markdowns were favorable due to lower markdowns at the Urban Outfitters brand, which was partially offset by higher markdowns at the Anthropologie and Free People brands. Despite well-controlled inventory, Anthropologie was not able to hold their markdowns flat this quarter due to their challenging women's apparel performance.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 10.5% to $230 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 143 basis points to 26.6%. This SG&A deleverage was partially due to onetime legal settlements, which accounted for approximately 20% of our year-over-year growth or almost 50 basis points of deleverage. The remaining increase in SG&A primarily related to an increase in direct store controllable expenses. A large portion of these expenses were due to several large-format Anthropologie stores recently opened or opened in the quarter. While we are extremely pleased with the top line performance of these stores, we have invested a considerable amount to ensure the hiring, training and overall execution of these stores were second to none. Many of these expenses, preopening and initial staffing levels, we believe we can reduce and leverage in the upcoming year through improved control and planning based on our current year's learnings.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 12% to $70 million, with operating profit margin declining by 158 basis points to 8.2%. Our tax rate for the quarter was 33.5% compared to 35.3% in the prior year. The improvement in the quarterly tax rate was due to the ratio of foreign taxable losses to global taxable profits in the year.
Net income for the quarter was $47 million or $0.40 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory increased by 3% to $454 million. The increase in inventory is primarily due to an increase in noncomp inventory to support our new and expanded stores. Our Retail segment inventory comp was up 1% at cost with both Anthropologie and Free People well controlled and appropriately negative.
Urban Outfitters inventory ended just slightly higher than where we would have liked it to be. We ended the quarter with $265 million in cash and marketable securities.
During the quarter, we repurchased and retired 1 million common shares for $35 million, leaving 6 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors authorization. Additionally during the quarter, we paid down the remaining $50 million on our outstanding revolver, completing full repayment of the $150 million this fiscal year.
As we enter the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning to open a total of approximately 23 net new stores for the year, excluding our food and beverage division. For the fourth quarter, we are planning 4 net new stores, including 1 new Urban Outfitters store in North America, 1 new Anthropologie store in the U.K, 2 Anthropologie closures in North America due to lease expiration and 4 new Free People stores and 1 closure due to lease expiration. The planned fourth quarter openings would result in the following store changes for the year: 3 net new Urban Outfitters stores, including 1 in Europe; 7 net new Anthropologie stores, including 2 in Europe; and 13 net new Free People stores.
For fiscal 2017, we also opened 2 new Vetri pizzerias and 1 café adjacent to an Anthropologie large-format store.
Now on to gross margin. We believe our fourth quarter gross margin rate could decrease versus the prior year primarily due to higher markdowns. These markdowns could be driven by higher markdowns at Anthropologie related to their women's apparel performance and slightly higher markdowns at Urban Outfitters related to marginally higher inventory.
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a mid-single-digit rate for the fourth quarter. This increase would be largely driven by increased store-related expenses to support our noncomp store-based growth.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are planned at approximately $160 million. Total spend for fiscal 2017 is primarily driven by new, relocated and expanded stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Finally, we are still planning our fiscal year 2017 annual effective tax rate to be approximately 36% for the year and believe our fourth quarter tax rate will be lower than our annual planned rate. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Sheila Harrington, President of the Free People brand."

Today, I will discuss a few highlights from Free People's third quarter performance and then review the progress of the brand -- the brand has made on our strategic growth initiative. In total, the Free People brand grew revenues by 16% this past quarter. The brand's strongest growth came from our Wholesale business segment, which delivered a 30% increase. When normalized for last year's operational challenges in our distribution center, the growth was still a strong 13% increase. This growth was driven by strength in our core apparel collection, increased business with online partnerships, along with the growth in expanded categories, including Movement, intimates and shoes, both domestic and in Europe. A double-digit increase in forward bookings makes us feel confident in the health of our wholesale business.
I would like to congratulate Krissy Meehan-Mashinsky as well as the entire Wholesale team in leading this brand expansion. 
Free People's Retail segment sales grew by 6% in the quarter through the opening of 3 new stores, partially offset by a negative 1.5% comp.
During the quarter, August was our weakest comp, reflecting a difficult seasonal transition. As we cleared through the product and began flowing newer fashion into our stores and our direct-to-consumer channel, our business showed significant improvement with both September and October delivering positive Retail segment comps. While the store showed improvement as the quarter progressed, the direct-to-consumer channel led the way with double-digit regular priced comps, fueled -- fueling a positive direct-to-consumer comp for the quarter.
The customer clearly has reacted positively to our women's apparel fall fashion online, and we believe this momentum can continue into the fourth quarter. We reacted to those reads by taking appropriate markdowns and are flowing in increased levels of product freshness through the holiday season.
Now I would like to discuss our progress on our long-term strategic growth initiatives.
We remain focused on improving our website overall shopping experience. We launched a new web platform for our direct-to-consumer channel in the first quarter of this year and have seen the benefits of this initiative. The site's load time is faster. We have streamlined our checkout process and enhanced our search capabilities, to name a few of the benefits, of which we believe has helped to improve our website conversion. Additionally, in September, we have launched the iOS shopping app in both the U.K. and China. Over 15,000 users have downloaded the app in China, and sales through the app already represent 45% of demand within this region. With our customers' growing affinity for our mobile devices, we believe these types of investments are critical to our future success. While technology is considerably a part of the shopping experience, Free People's delivery of creativity and inspirational imagery has always been a cornerstone to our success. The social team has continued to raise the level of engaging content, including videos, photographic imagery and collaborations. This resulted in over 3 million Instagram followers, a 30% increase over last year.
Finally and extremely important for our long-term growth, is the progress the brand has made in our new and expanded categories. The brand launched beauty and wellness online in July with a carefully curated assortment focused on natural, cruelty-free products, including makeup, skincare and supplements.
Early customer reads have been positive. Movement and Beauty collectively accounted for 20% of the growth in the direct-to-consumer channel during the third quarter. Additionally, our expanded categories are featured in our larger retail store location. We opened 3 larger format locations in the quarter, 2 of which are new locations, Honolulu and Charlotte, and 1 of which was a relocation and expansion of our store in King of Prussia mall. The King of Prussia store now houses all expanded categories, including beauty, in just over 6,000 selling square feet. The store has become a true brand-defining destination, incorporating the touch and spirit of Free People.
In closing, I am proud of the team's ability to react quickly and create positive momentum as the quarter progressed. This is a testament to their creativity and nimbleness. I would like to thank the entire Free People team for their inspiration and dedication. Additionally, a sincere thank you to Meg Hayne for her passion, encouragement and the relentless pursuit of excellence for the brand. While the brand has grown significantly over the past several years, we believe there's more opportunity ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Dick."

Sheila, congratulations to you, Meg and the Free People team on the terrific progress you've made with your apparel assortment. Your design and merchant teams did an excellent job of interpreting the fashion trends. Had it not been for a difficult seasonal transition in August, Free People comp sales would've been nicely positive in Q3. I believe the improved fashion, coupled with better inventory control, should allow the Free People brand to enjoy a positive holiday season. Good work, Sheila, and thanks for your leadership.
Now let me turn to a discussion around 2 of the retail topics I find most interesting, the shift in channel demand and the shift in fashion silhouette, and discuss how these changes have impacted our brands in the third quarter.
The divergence in demand by channel that we've witnessed over the past few years continued in Q3 this year. In general, the digital channel outperformed, stores lagged and Wholesale delivered strong growth.
In the store channel, physical shopping visits, as reported by industry groups, continue to be down on a year-over-year basis. Overall traffic fell by mid-single digits in Q3 for the second consecutive year. With several notable exceptions, our brands' comp store sales echoed this traffic pattern and were negative in almost all regions and by all store types: mall, lifestyle centers and freestanding. Lower comp store sales at the Anthropologie and Free People brand in Q3 were driven primarily by fewer transactions and lower AUR. There were, however, a few bright spots in store channel performance. The Urban brand produced positive store comps in North America and Europe, and the Anthropologie brand registered positive comps in Europe, and the recently opened larger format stores continued to exceed expectations and deliver sales per square foot greater than the Anthro average. That said, URBN store comps were negative in Q3.
The direct-to-consumer channel, on the other hand, delivered strong double-digit sales growth in the quarter. Both traffic measured in sessions and total number of orders received grew at double-digit rates, and total conversion improved as well. Within the digital world, customers continue to migrate from desktop to mobile as a preferred method of interaction. Mobile devices now account for almost 2/3 of total company digital sessions. The strength in the digital channel more than offset the weakness in stores, with total Retail segment comp sales increasing by 1% in the third quarter. The disparity in channel results demonstrates that the consumers' affinity for digital shopping continues to grow. Her expectations around functionality and service levels in this channel are also growing. This is why we continue to make significant investments in personnel and technology that will expand our online assortments, enhance and personalize the digital experience, give us more insight into customer preferences and permit us to deliver orders faster and more reliably. Improving our capabilities in the digital channel is one of our strategic priorities.
The third channel is Wholesale. In Q3, the Free People Wholesale business reported a 30% spike in sales. But as Frank and Sheila both explained earlier, this year's results benefited from shipping delays last year. Adjusting for this anomaly, Wholesale still produced solid gains across all customer types: specialty store, department store and e-commerce retailers. During the quarter, we also saw a shift in fashion silhouette that I've alluded to on prior calls begin to strengthen. This emerging trend, which seems to have its roots in Europe, is not impacting all brands equally. Predictably, younger, more fashion-forward customers are adopting these new looks more readily. So in Q3, the Urban and Free People brands benefited from the shift, while the Anthropologie brand did not.
In the fashion industry, times of rapid change like we see when silhouettes shift offer the greatest opportunities but also pose the greatest risks.
Now let me turn your attention to the Anthropologie brand, where third quarter top line results were very similar to Q2. Total Retail segment comp sales landed at negative 3% in the quarter with weakness in stores more than offsetting the growth in direct-to-consumer sales. The comp shortfall was driven entirely by the apparel category. All other product categories and sub-brands delivered positive Retail segment comps. The expanded categories of home, beauty, BHLDN and Terrain performed particularly well.
We expected to see more progress in the apparel category, but customer response to fall assortments was lackluster. This led to higher markdowns versus the prior year period even though inventories, which ended down 3%, were tightly controlled. While we could see modest comp sales improvement in Q4 over Q3 rate, we believe apparel sales on a year-over-year basis will likely remain difficult and weigh on total Anthropologie comps and margins for the holiday season.
Transitions in fashion silhouette are never linear or easy to predict. As a customer becomes more comfortable with a different silhouette and our merchants become comfortable presenting her with more newness, we expect better results. I believe we will begin to see improvement in customer reaction to the apparel offerings with our 2017 spring/summer deliveries.
Despite the apparel issues, we remain confident the emotional bonds between the brand and our customers remain strong. She is responding enthusiastically to all of our expanded categories, especially our newly expanded home assortment. Reaction to the 200-page Home journal mailed to customers in September exceeded plan significantly, so the Home team is expanding the assortment further and plans to mail another Home journal in spring.
Other expansion categories experienced double-digit comp sales as well. During the third quarter, BHLDN opened 2 new shop-in-shop locations and launched a series of omnichannel marketing initiatives, which resulted in strong store and digital sales gains. The beauty category expanded into 65 additional stores during the quarter, and the Terrain brand continued to benefit from inclusion into the Anthropologie Group.
During the quarter, Terrain launched several cross marketing initiatives and opened its first shop-in-shop in the new Walnut Creek Anthropologie store. And in early November, Terrain launched 10 holiday trim shop-in-shops in core Anthropologie stores.
In Q3, Anthropologie opened 2 additional larger format locations: Walnut Creek, California and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. To date, sales at these stores are running nicely ahead of projections, which strengthens our confidence in the brand, the strategy of opening larger stores and the strategy of expanding product categories. The largest stores have also helped to build expanded category demand in the digital channel. This past weekend, the brand opened another larger format store in the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto. Besides an expanded assortment of home products, shoes, accessories and beauty products, the Palo Alto store also offers a full assortment of BHLDN wedding gowns and occasion dresses and Terrain outdoor living products and decor. The store also provides customers with a Terrain café for casual dining. Customer reaction has been fantastic, with weekend sales coming in 33% above plan.
During the quarter, Anthropologie was the second of our brands to migrate to our new digital platform. This platform allows for improved response time, a better cart and checkout experience and vastly improved user visibility across all screen sizes. After being installed for 1 month, the brand has seen a 40% improvement in user load time and a double-digit increase in conversion. The URBN brand plans to migrate to this platform early next year.
I want to congratulate David, Meg and the Anthropologie, BHLDN and Terrain teams for their successes in growing the expanded categories, in launching the larger format stores and in producing strong digital channel growth. These important achievements continue to strengthen an already powerful brand.
Turning now to Urban Outfitter results in Q3, the brand delivered a terrific quarter. Total Retail segment comp sales grew by over 5%, driven by a double-digit increase in direct-to-consumer sales and positive store comps in both North America and Europe. Impressively, all product categories delivered strong regular priced comps in the period. A year ago, I referred to the stable foundation the brand had rebuilt from which they could grow. I'm pleased to report they are now delivering this growth, doing so by creating compelling, trend-right product through internal designs and third-party collaborations, by producing differentiated and engaging shopping environments, both in stores and online, by elevating creative imagery and social engagement and by executing exceptional marketing campaigns.
Looking at results by category. Women's apparel and accessories were both strong. The expanded categories, intimates, beauty, home decor and tech, all continue to excel. And for the first time in 8 quarters, men's apparel delivered a positive comp as well. Furthermore, the brand grew its male customer base by 17% on a year-over-year basis.
The Urban brand also realized improved IMU and lower markdowns versus the prior year, which drove 200 basis points of improvement in merchandise margins on top of impressive increases last year. In the last 2 quarters, the URBN brand has delivered an historic low markdown rate. While we may see a slight uptick in the fourth quarter, we believe markdown rates could improve even more as we execute initiatives to increase inventory turns and decrease weeks of supply.
This year, the URBN store teams have further refined the shop-in-shop concepts first introduced in August 2015. These concept shops allow for larger assortments of expanded category products and more accurately align product demand by category with space allocation. The stores look and feel dramatically different and now provide a clear engaging shopping experience. The customer has responded to these changes. During the quarter, in spite of negative store traffic on a macro level, the brand experienced higher store  traffic counts and positive comps across all regions for the first time in 13 quarters. Meanwhile, third quarter metrics in the direct-to-consumer channel remain strongly positive with sessions, sales and number of orders all showing  double-digit increases and customer frequency up as well. Our customer file continues to grow with double-digit increases in new, retained and reactivated customers.
Across both channels, the teams created compelling brand marketing messages. Our social media team continued to drive significant engagement with particularly strong year-over-year increases in Instagram and Pinterest, which were up 60% and 44%, respectively. The brand now enjoys more than 6 million Instagram followers, and many are highly interactive.
The marketing team worked on many notable social campaigns in the quarter, with a Justin Bieber launch registering as our brand's largest social reach to date. UO launched an exclusive product collaboration with Bieber for his Purpose Tour in August. This was a timed launched in stores and online: first in London, then in New York City and then in Los Angeles. Long lines formed at Urban stores globally to purchase Purpose Tour paraphernalia. Customers were highly engaged on social and registered 237 million Twitter impressions for this event, and the exclusive product collab received impressive coverage from influencers, digital and print outlets.
In summary, the Urban brand is enjoying considerable success. The brand is once again the destination for their core customer. In-stores, online and via social media, the customer is engaged with the brand like never before. Congratulations to Trish, Meg and their teams on both sides of the Atlantic for orchestrating this remarkable achievement.
Before I turn the call over for your questions, I want to recognize and thank our 26,000 associates worldwide, including our teams in North America and Europe. I thank our wholesale partners, domestic and international, and our many vendors and suppliers. Lastly, I extend my thanks to our many shareholders for their continued support. I'm grateful for the opportunity to lead the URBN community.
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to your questions."

How big a shift is this? Are we going fully back to kind of tight on top, bigger on bottom? And at that point, you had stepped into it quickly and aggressively.

So I think that each of the brands has a different customer segment that will adapt to the shift at different times and at different levels. It's always a difficult thing to judge how much of the old and how much of the new based on how many customers you have that are more advanced and how many you have that are less advanced. So -- but the overall point that I'm trying to make, a, besides the fact that there is a shift going on and in progress is that in the long term, it's incredibly positive for fashion retailers."

The extra and extended categories are performing extremely well, so I don't -- I really don't think it's a problem with stores per se. I think the real problem is that there are just too many stores in North America. And I think what you see day in and day out are reports of people either reducing their store count or going out of business altogether, which I believe over the long term will reduce the store count and bring the supply and demand back in line. With that, I guess the answer to your question is I think we're doing things just about right. We're opening a few stores, and it's very selective. We're very diligent in making sure the pro formas work. And when we go in to re-up and we have to sign a new lease, we're being diligent about the perhaps downward pressure on sales and looking for rents that are either a little bit lower or very close to what still would be making money. So I think we're right on track there.

Dana, to your first question. Well generally, when we've looked forward at the line, and Dick was referring to, is we saw a presentation from our own brand team that put together, continued to push the merchants and their thinking about proportions and silhouettes. Really nice combinations of fabrics and prints, the stories are coming together and more distinct. We think we have the creative team aligned, as Meg has talked about, our concept to customer and working on our storytelling. We think with the merchants' eyes starting to see and adjust, that we'll be able to buy and adapt more confidently. Is it late spring? Is it summer? Is it transfer fall? We're not certain. Again, she'll let us know. To your question on the expanded categories, it really is an exciting one and a thrilling place to be because when you work at URBN, we're thinking about growth and always thinking about our customer. And we have made -- Dick and Frank have been tremendously supportive of helping us begin to expand the offer like they have with all brands in order to meet the lifestyle and life stage potential of each brands. And so we're looking at these. The vagaries and trends in fashion is knowing that the brand remains incredibly strong. Like we've said, customer metrics are super strong. She's just buying less apparel and apparel at a lower price. And as that cycle turns back, and you combine then we come out of the apparel cycle in a positive shape and you add to it the power of the other expanded categories, we think it could really become a very nice inflection point. When you think about the strength of the in-store experience and then what we're investing in, in digital as well. So we're excited to see apparel regain momentum in the future as we look at it over the cycle of the coming seasons."
