We disclosed a great deal of news yesterday afternoon, including the filing of our Form 10-K. We'll do our best to briefly summarize our 2015 results as well as update you on the progress we were making in our Anadarko Basin assets and our plans for 2016.  As always, we will leave ample time to take your specific questions at the end. 
These are the challenging times for the energy sector. More than a year ago now, we grew concerned about lower for longer commodity prices and took aggressive steps to strengthen our hedge book, reduce investment levels, rightsize our workforce and preserve margins by slashing cost across the business. These efforts were evident in our fourth quarter results and our outlook for improved cost and expenses in 2016. With the challenges presented in 2016, we must remain vigilant in our pursuit of lower costs and improved efficiencies.
We continue to adapt to our near-term business strategies to preserve the health of the company and ensure we are in the best possible position to not only whether 2016, but to emerge with improved margins and a readiness to compete and win when commodity prices ultimately strengthen. I'm confident that we have the people, the plan and the assets to get it done. 
Our priorities and outlined in our 2016 outlook released last night are crystal clear. Number one, preserve liquidity. We reduced activity levels and better aligned our investment plans with cash flow expectations. You will see that our 2016 budget is down more than 50% from last year, and we have migrated the lion's share of our capital to the Anadarko Basin where returns are more resilient today.
Our second priority is the HBP STACK. STACK is the primary asset with the industry-leading with and send in any possible long-term commodity price scenario. It's critical that we retain our acreage and continue to push toward full field development where we are confident that the returns will continue to get better. 
Third, reduce operating expenses and preserve margins. This is a continuation of the solid progress we made in 2015. You can see from yesterday's guidance that 2016 LOE and G&A expenses are projected to be down significantly, and we're looking for other avenues to safety reduce expenses.
And fourth, we're commencing a process to sell nontraditional assets. We've had a number of inbound calls and progressed some of those discussions. However, none to date have results in any transactions. These discussions have encouraged us to launch a more organized effort to, gain price discovery and ultimately transact on select assets. Although we have a desire to sell assets, we are not alone in that wish. We recognize that this market will quickly become saturated with stress sellers. Cross needs from a potential sale would improve our financial flexibility and allow for opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions and acceleration in the Anadarko Basin activity if oil prices rally or to simply manage our short-term borrowing levels.
I can assure you that our people from the office to the field are focused on the line  to execute these 4 priorities. A little later on the call, I'll provide more details in our 2016 outlook. But first, let me cover our 2015 highlights. 
2015 was a great year for Newfield and our stockholders as we continued a multiyear streak solid execution against our targets and delivered on our key objectives. Now to the highlights. Early 2015, we recapitalized our company and took proactive steps to reduce leverage and enhance liquidity. When coupled with our strong hedge position, these measures helped to offset the negative impact of low commodity prices and differentiated our balance sheet for many others in our peer group. The strong financial footing allowed us to successfully execute our game plan. 
Our 2015 game plan was certainly simplified. Capital investments were reduced by about 25% over 2014, and we were laser-focused on our exciting Anadarko Basin drilling programs where we saw improving drilling and completion costs throughout the year.
In 2015, each of our focus areas exceeded our beginning-of- year production forecast, and we beat our guidance, which was raised twice during the year. 
Production was driven by SCOOP and STACK, which achieved a record fourth quarter net production average of about 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. From a start-up, less than 4 years ago, SCOOP and STACK that they comprise nearly half of our total company production and over half of the total proved reserves of. We took aggressive steps to reduce domestic LOE, and our per unit expenses down by more than 25% compared to 2014. 
We acted quickly to address G&A and took action in 2015 and early 2016 that will reduce our headcount by more than 20%. These measures equate to an estimated $45 million per year savings in 2016 gross G&A. 
Our Anadarko Basin proved reserves increased 50% to 269 million barrels of oil equivalent, positive addition sell partially offset significant price-related revisions. Total company proved reserves decreased about 20% year-over-year to 509 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which, about 2/3 are approved and developed. 
Prove reserve additions during the year equates to reserve replacement ratio of approximately 180% or 350%, depending on the inclusion or exclusion of positive revisions. There's a detailed accounting and cost incurred in reserve additions and revisions in our release and our 10-K.
Let's move on to a summary of our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Our production in the fourth quarter was above guidance at 14.9 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which, 47% was oil and nearly 2/3 were liquids. Fourth quarter domestic production was at the top end of guidance at 13.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our Anadarko Basin production beat our forecast levels by nearly 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Excluded several items listed in our release, our net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter would have been $50 million or $0.30 per share on revenues of $362 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $289 million.
Our about $500 million in incremental revenues in 2015 and helped to underpin our cash flow. We estimate an additional $365 million in hedge revenues over the next 2 years at current streak prices.
Our 2015 production was 56 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which 5.4 million barrels came in from our China assets. Adjusted net income for 2015 would have been $164 million or $1.02 per share when excluding unrealized losses on commodity derivatives, the premium call notes and impairments.
Revenues for 2015 were approximately $1.6 billion and consolidated net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was approximately $1.2 billion.
Let's talk about 2016 and the key objectives in our new term business plan. As I said in my opening comments, 2016 is all about preservation of liquidity, holding our STACK acreage and finding creative ways to improve margins in the low oil price environment. We have a deep high quality and economically resilient inventory to attack today in the Anadarko Basin and this is the centerpiece of our 2016 plan.
Our total capital budget is $625 million to $675 million, down more than 50% at the midpoint from 2015.
There's a pie chart on Slide 8 in our @NFX publication that depicts our plant investments by region.
By unit production basis, our outlook for cash operating cost has improved and can be attributed to the following: our domestic lease operating expenses on a unit production basis are expected to be more than 15% below 2015. As we focus our investments in the Anadarko Basin, the benefits are increasingly more apparent in our margins BV's lease operating and transportation expenses here are just over $5 per BOE, the lowest in our liquids portfolio. As SCOOP and STACK production growth offsets declines in areas with higher operating expenses and lower realize prices, we expect to see continued improvements in our margins.
As I mentioned earlier, our gross G&A expense is expected to be $45 million lower than 2015, and we continue to look for ways to reduce G&A and streamline our operations.
Despite the large cut in our capital investments, our 2016 domestic production is expected to be relatively flat with 2015 at about 50 million barrels of oil equivalent. The China are expected to total 4.3 million barrels of oil equivalent and no addition -- additional investments or plan to China. 
About 80% of our 2016 budget is planned for the Anadarko Basin, so this is where I will focus the remainder of our discussion. SCOOP is currently in active development and we are drilling wells from common patch using shared production facilities and accessing markets through established midstream infrastructures. SCOOP about $200 million over 2016 investment. 
Within our SCOOP program, we will focus largely on SCOOP oil and the Springer Shale in both nonoperated and operated areas. We continue to see good spring results and benefit from the fact that much spring inventory is already HBP-ed. 
STACK investments, which totaled about $300 million in 2016, will be focused on HBP-ing our acreage and ensuring that we hold this premier asset for future development. Today, about 50% of our acreage is held by production. We expect to invest 50 million to 80 million land cost in the Anadarko Basin, largely in the STACK area. We are confident that our returns will further improve as we transition to a full fuel development.
There are some stress in our @NFX publication that our reference today starting with Slide 12. Here, notice that we are now reporting our well performance on a 3-stream basis. We made this change for a few simple reasons: first, it's better disclosure and reports actual volumes by product from plant settlements and eliminates the need to estimate NGLs; second, our type curve is 3 stream and it makes comparisons to our average expectations much easier.
On Slide 14, notice the significant improvements we are seeing in low productivity. This illustration chronicles sst well performance by year and clearly shows improvements we have made through optimize completions and targeting. Here, we show all 77 wells drilled to date plotted against our type curve by year and all information is on a 3 stream basis. We will continue this practice going forward.
Last year, we raised our 3 STACK type curve by about 20% from 800 MBoe to 950 MBoe to reflect data from large wells. Our 2015 wells are performing well above that type curve today. 
As we've said, our STACK type curve represents a play average across a vast area. History tells us there will be variability in individual results over a large area where all hydrocarbon faces are present, and we remain very encouraged by the consistency of the well results over the last 3-plus years.
On Slide 13, we results from Newfield and industry wells throughout the STACK area. We're confident and the play continues to grow. Today, there are more than 30 rigs running and about 350 total wells have been drilled and completed today. There are an additional 100 wells permitting. We have leading position in the oil window and are benefiting from technology, service center infrastructure and the science being done by large high-quality operators all around us.
In 2015, we expanded our footprint and extended our acreage position to North and West where we are seeing high levels of industry activity today. In addition to the primary Meramec and Woodford targets, we have additional perspective arises that we and the industry will be testing in the future. We have thousands of perspective wells in inventory and realize the importance of holding our acreage for the future benefit of our stockholders.
We continue to see improvements in our drilling efficiencies on Slide 15, which are completed cost per lateral foot and the progress we've made over the last several years. Our cost per foot have come by targeting the most effective drilling zones, improvements and penetration rates through changes and bid designs as well as the drilling fluid and motor optimizations. For more participation in the wells built by others, we know that our results are industry-leading. 
Our best-in-class SXL wells are drilled and completed for about $750 per gross per interval, including facilities. We expect that our 2016 wells will cost about $725 for gross per foot. Well cost across our acreage will vary and the reasons very important to understand.
First, drilling depths ranch  for more than 12,000 feet to less than 8,000 feet. Second, in some eras to the north and west, we are optimal acquired to a fixed rate and this adds about 3 quarters of a million dollars or so to completed well cost. 
And next, about 1/3 of our total wells in 2016 will be XL wells, 5,000-foot lateral. We plan to test XL wells this year to better understand the economics of XL wells, while holding acreage that would not allow for the drilling of SXL wells. Several of our peers in the area have seen solid results from XL wells, and we intend to continue to deliver the same.
And finally, we continue to tinker with our completions to find the most optimal design for future development. We're deploying zipper fracs, diverging agents, higher fluid and propping concentrations and using both hybrid and slick water simulations across the Anadarko Basin. We're very encouraged by the strong performance in 2015 wells and the improvements that have improved over the last several years. These ongoing experimentations will create variability in both well cost and production performance. 
Although the STACK joint program provides industry-leading returns at today's oil prices, it's more important for you to understand where we are headed. We envision significantly lower well cost once we move into full field development.
On Slide 15, we contrast in difference in -- in today's cost with what we internally refer to our vision well. We have a line of sight on completed well cost, including facilities as well as $6 million in future something. 
On the left side of Slide 16, we outlined our 2016 assumptions for staff well cost, operating expenses, our average in working revenue interest. To the right of these assumptions, we show pre-tax rates of return using a variety of well cost and commodity prices. You can see the impact that a 5-dollar move in oil or $0.5 million reduction in completed well cost has on our returns.
We're taking steps to secure take away and attractive markets for our growing Anadarko Basin. As of today, we are beginning to move STACK oil by pipe to Cushing, Oklahoma. By midyear, we expect that 100% of our production will be on pipe to Cushing. This is a high-quality crude and expect our differential will ultimately be about $2.50 of NYMEX, WTI. You'll see improved differentials in our guidance today. We remain very encouraged with the continuing progress we are making in the Anadarko Basin and will be happy to discuss additional details with you during Q&A.
Let me close with a summary on the remaining investments in our 2016 CapEx. We plan to run a single rig in the Williston Basin through midyear and expect to complete 12 to 15 wells this year. Our most recent wells have been drilled and completed for just under $5 million, including facilities. 
In the Eagle Ford, we will invest solely to our outside operated program into area and this constitutes about $28 million. Although these teams have done an outstanding job to enhance economics, we simply must shift our limited capital towards the Anadarko Basin and our HBP needs.
We also expect to invest about $23 million in 2 joint ventures that we have recently signed last year, one in the and the other in the Central Basin and the Uinta. In each of these a significant portion of our interest is carried, our rationale is very simple. Number one, demonstrate recent advancements in drilling and completions at better understanding of the economics and offset firm transportation and remind commitments at that are negatively impacting our cost structure today. In the Arkoma Basin, we want to introduce some of the was with superior early, results, on production and cost savings. Newfield is the operator of both ventures.
Once again, as for dialing into our call today and for your interest and investment in Newfield Exploration. We are fortunate that Premier assets in the Anadarko Basin, and we are actively driving down our well cost and improving returns. Our priorities are very clear today. They are centered around preserving liquidity, maintaining a strong balance sheet to weather a very challenging period the fall prices. We know the importance of polling our Anadarko Basin acreage to drilling and retaining these important asset for our future growth. I'm confident that we have a sound near-term business plans to not only survive but to emerge a leaner, better focused and more profitable company. 
That concludes our prepared remarks this morning, and we'll now take your questions."

We haven't put any new information out, seeing go back and pick up the results that we put forward. The type of spacing, that we've tested, remember these are generally, wells drilled on either side of these lines. So in Oklahoma, got to be 440 feet off, so the tighter spacing the priest had in STACK is about 880 feet, and we won't be able to build below that until we drill on actual spacing pilot on a DSU. So at this point, that's the tightest we're going to get until we HBP situation satisfied. 
And then within that day, there were multiple tests. Woodford, Woodford Meramec, Upper Meramec, Lower Meramec and a variety of different offset distances I would tell you that it's a relatively loose data set at this point, and I wouldn't draw any huge conclusions from it, but everything is positive. All the wells continue to perform at or above type cover. We saw no negative effects of the tighter spacing, so we're very, very encouraged in terms of thinking about what the ultimate spacing might be and we continue to think that we'll have multiple layers, ultimately to be developed. 
I will point out that some of our high-quality peers in the area that have already gotten HBP acreage have some high density pilots planned and will be watching with great interest. It's easy to see what they're thinking and frankly, they're thinking is in line with our thinking in terms of the number of horizons and the ability to space well-stocked into 48  wells for Verizon-type level."

The numbers were referencing relative to the current footprint. So 50% HBP. The core, the original STACK acreage where we drilled when we look at that map and you will actually see that, that's pretty well peppered. So we'll have a lot of activity moving north and then, ultimately, Northwest over time. We would expect to end '16 at around 65% or so with the reduced capital program. HBP-ed, we would expect '17 to move up in the 75% to 80% range, assuming a continuation of same. I think, ultimately, we'll keep you posted as we go. We're picking up incremental acreage on Prolink, so there'll be some noise from period to period in terms of what the actual acreage account is. But I think those are pretty good numbers.

Frankly, our view is that since we're going to protect our assets and protect the investment of our stakeholders, stockholders, we're going to keep all viable options on the table to preserve and enterprise and I said that in the earlier comments. Our buyers come, as you know, over the years. So we've the entire transformation of the company has been toward asset sales. We've talked about moving that process along. I think the shift from noncore assets into the SCOOP and STACK assets in the Anadarko Basin makes sense. We've been on that in the last 3 or 4 years and we'll continue but we sold $2.6 billion of assets over the last 5 years, including just under 100 million of assets that nobody heard about in 2015. So it's been an important part of the game plan, and I think that we'll continue to be prudent in that regard. And I think that the broader question that you are probably asking, we've seen peers accessing the capital markets. We do understand the rationale.

So I -- the first thing we have been rotating into the Anadarko Basin over the course of the last 3 years, just given the scale and scope of the asset portfolio that we put together there. And the results being post I mentioned that we sold 2.6 billion of what we call nonstrategic assets over the last 5 years that helped fund our transformation including building those positions that we love dearly today. 
Our focus has to remain on HBP-ing the STACK acreage. We've got most of the SCOOP taken cared of. We have some there as indicated in 2016, but it's mostly about focusing on getting STACK HBP-ed and putting us in a position so in 2017, we can start some of the tighter spacing pile in the move towards development, which was one of our targets we talked about during the course of 2015. We want to remain opportunistic, obviously, relative to opportunities that will come up from time to time. In those care areas and we want to will to take advantage of it. You saw us at 20,000 acres in the core of SCOOP and STACK in '15 and it's my hope that we'll see additional opportunities; like that, developed in 2016 on the road ahead. We want to keep Newfield strong and in a position to act. Ultimately, relative to what we call nonstrategic assets, we've said consistently over the last couple of years. It's not a question of if. It's a question of when. I think our team broadly. That means all of the folks who work and manage assets understand that we're making smart decisions for the business in the intermediate long-term. And I think that they've shown the ability to deliver results. So as we make those decisions, we'll shed assets in the air is if we get an attractive price, and we will have that cash available to -- for the all of the above strategy that i kind of outlined in the Anadarko Basin. If we don't see a good price, we're fortunate because the steps taken last year and results posted in 2015 that we don't have to do anything. I can in that regard, we will be patient to make sure that if we sell an asset, it's in a price that we'll be proud to tell you about. The stimulus for us has been inbound calls and people know that we have quality assets an we've been open saying that at some point in time we'll let them go.

Dry gas wells in the Arkoma several years ago half after the financial crisis will be moved from gas to oil in terms of our focus. And we wanted to go back and see if we can apply those and how to translate it in terms of spot the TV times and cost. So we drilled 5 or 6 wells there now and just promoted basis. I think the exciting part was the very first well was drilled in half the time in the program that's willing have the time of the best-in-class well drilled 5 years earlier. So that was a real shop into our main that the productivity at the well, we'll update you with these programs later in their just to give you the early returns in that well. The productivity of that well is the best in the field. So that gives us visibility in that dry gas asset there in the Arkoma that had gas prices down to $2.50, $2.75 before this to hang around $35 to 40-dollar range. We can go back to work drilling gas wells and not losing sleep over it. That's kind of exciting. At the same time, it probably tells you that lower for longer natural gas is going to be around for a while. The other side of that in the Uinta, that's oil, and we have the same learnings that we've taken, both the Anadarko Basin, the Williston Basin and Eagle Ford. And we put a team together and they've been working for the last year or so, is seen to deliver the sub $5 million cost in the Williston and their challenge is to go to the Uinta Basin to improve we can do it there too. So the first part of this is to go back and we're drilling faster, can we drill and complete the was much more cost-effectively?

We disclosed a great deal of news yesterday afternoon, including the filing of our Form 10-K. We'll do our best to briefly summarize our 2015 results as well as update you on the progress we're making in our Anadarko Basin assets and our plans for 2016. As always, we will leave ample time to take your specific questions at the end. 
These are indeed challenging times for the energy sector. More than a year ago now, we grew concerned about lower-for-longer commodity prices and took aggressive steps to strengthen our hedge book, reduce investment levels, rightsize our workforce and preserve margins by slashing cost across the business. These efforts were evident in our fourth quarter results and our outlook for improved costs and expenses in 2016. With the challenges presented in 2016, we must remain vigilant in our pursuit of lower cost and improved efficiencies. We continue to adapt to our near-term business strategies to preserve the health of the company and ensure we are in the best possible position to not only weather 2016, but to emerge with improved margins and a readiness to compete and win when commodity prices ultimately strengthen. I'm confident that we have the people, the plan and the assets to get it done. 
Our priorities, as outlined in our 2016 outlook released last night, are crystal clear. Number one, preserve liquidity. We reduced activity levels and better aligned our investment plans with cash flow expectations. You will see that our 2016 budget is down more than 50% from last year. And we have migrated the lion's share of our capital to the Anadarko Basin, where returns are more resilient today.
Our second priority is the HBP STACK. STACK is a premier asset with industry-leading returns under any plausible long-term commodity price scenario. It's critical that we retain our acreage and continue to push toward full field development, where we are confident that the returns will continue to get better. 
Third, reduce operating expenses and preserve margins. This is a continuation of the solid progress we made in 2015. You can see from yesterday's guidance that 2016 LOE and G&A expenses are projected to be down significantly, and we're looking for other avenues to safely reduce expenses.
And fourth, we're commencing a process to sell additional nonstrategic assets. We've had a number of inbound calls and progressed some of those discussions; however, none to date had resulted in a transaction. These discussions have encouraged us to launch a more organized effort to gain price discovery and ultimately transact on select assets. Although we have a desire to sell assets, we are not alone in that wish. We recognize that this market could quickly become saturated with distressed sellers. 
Proceeds from a potential sale would improve our financial flexibility and allow for opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions and acceleration in the Anadarko Basin activity if oil prices rally or to simply manage our short-term borrowing levels. I can assure you that our people from the office to the field are focused and aligned to execute these 4 priorities. A little later on the call, I'll provide more details in our 2016 outlook. But first, let me cover our 2015 highlights. 2015 was a great year for Newfield and its stockholders as we continued a multiyear streak of solid execution against our targets and delivered on our key objectives. 
Now to the highlights. Early 2015, we recapitalized our company and took proactive steps to reduce leverage and enhance liquidity. When coupled with our strong hedge position, these measures helped to offset the negative impact of low commodity prices and differentiated our balance sheet from many others in our peer group. The strong financial footing allowed us to successfully execute our game plan. 
Our 2015 game plan was certainly simplified. Capital investments were reduced by about 25% over 2014, and we were laser-focused on our exciting Anadarko Basin drilling programs, where we saw improving drilling and completion costs throughout the year. In 2015, each of our focus areas exceeded our beginning-of-year production forecast, and we beat our guidance, which was raised twice during the year. 
Production was driven by SCOOP and STACK, which achieved a record fourth quarter net production average of about 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. From a startup less than 4 years ago, SCOOP and STACK today comprise nearly half of our total company production and over half of the total proved reserves. 
We took aggressive steps to reduce domestic LOE and our per unit expenses down by more than 25% compared to 2014. We acted quickly to address G&A and took action in 2015 and early 2016 that have reduced our headcount by more than 20%. These measures equate to an estimated $45 million per year savings in 2016 gross G&A. 
Our Anadarko Basin proved reserves increased 50% to 269 million barrels of oil equivalent. Positive additions helped partially offset significant price-related revisions. Total company proved reserves decreased about 20% year-over-year to 509 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which about 2/3 are proved developed. Proved reserve additions during the year equated to reserve replacement ratio of approximately 180% or 350%, depending on the inclusion or exclusion of positive revisions. There's a detailed accounting and cost incurred in reserve additions and revisions in our release and our 10-K.
Let's move on to a summary of our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Our production in the fourth quarter was above guidance at 14.9 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which 47% was oil and nearly 2/3 were liquids. Fourth quarter domestic production was at the top end of the guidance at 13.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our Anadarko Basin production beat our forecast levels by nearly 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Excluding several items listed in our release, our net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter would have been $50 million or $0.30 per share on revenues of $362 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $289 million. Our hedges added about $500 million in incremental revenues in 2015 and helped to underpin our cash flow. We estimate an additional $365 million in hedged revenues over the next 2 years at current strip prices.
Our 2015 production was 56 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which 5.4 million barrels came in from our China assets. Adjusted net income for 2015 would have been $164 million or $1.02 per share when excluding unrealized losses on commodity derivatives, the premium to call notes and impairments. Revenues for 2015 were approximately $1.6 billion, and consolidated net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was approximately $1.2 billion.
Let's talk about 2016 and the key objectives in our near-term business plan. As I said in my opening comments, 2016 is all about preservation of liquidity, holding our STACK acreage and finding creative ways to improve margins in a low oil price environment. We have a deep, high-quality and economically resilient inventory to attack today in the Anadarko Basin, and this is the centerpiece of our 2016 plan. Our total capital budget is $625 million to $675 million, down more than 50% at the midpoint from 2015.  There's a pie chart on Slide 8 in our @NFX publication that depicts our planned investments by region.
On a unit of production basis, our outlook for cash operating cost has improved and can be attributed to the following. Our domestic lease operating expenses on a unit production basis are expected to be more than 15% below 2015. As we focus our investments in the Anadarko Basin, the benefits are increasingly more apparent in our margins. Lease operating and transportation expenses here are just over $5 per BOE, the lowest in our liquids portfolio. As SCOOP and STACK production growth offsets declines in areas with higher operating expenses and lower realized prices, we expect to see continued improvements in our margins. As I mentioned earlier, our gross G&A expense is expected to be $45 million lower than 2015, and we continue to look for ways to reduce G&A and streamline our operations.
Despite the large cut in our capital investments, our 2016 domestic production is expected to be relatively flat with 2015 at about 50 million barrels of oil equivalent. The China liftings are expected to total 4.3 million barrels of oil equivalent and no addition -- additional investments are planned in China. 
About 80% of our 2016 budget is planned for the Anadarko Basin. So this is where I will focus the remainder of our discussion. SCOOP is currently in active development, and we're drilling wells from common patch using shared production facilities and accessing markets through established midstream infrastructure. SCOOP constitutes about $200 million over 2016 investments. 
Within our SCOOP program, we will focus largely on SCOOP oil and the Springer Shale in both nonoperated and operated areas. We continue to see good Springer results and benefit from the fact that much of our prospective Springer inventory is already HBP-ed. 
STACK investments, which totaled about $300 million in 2016, will be focused on HBP-ing our acreage and ensuring that we hold this premier asset for future development. Today, about 50% of our acreage is held by production. We expect to invest $50 million to $80 million in land cost in the Anadarko Basin, largely in the STACK area. We are confident that our returns will further improve as we transition to full field development.
There are some slides in our @NFX publication that I'll reference today starting with Slide 12. Here notice that we are now reporting our well performance on a 3-stream basis. We made this change for a few simple reasons. First, it's better disclosure and reports actual volumes by product from planned settlements and eliminates the need to estimate NGLs. Second, our type curve is 3 stream, and it makes comparisons to our average expectations much easier.
On Slide 14, notice the significant improvements we are seeing in well productivity. This illustration chronicles stat well performance by year and clearly shows the improvements we have made through optimized completions and targeting. Here we show all 77 wells drilled to date plotted against our type curve by year. And all the information is on a 3-stream basis. We will continue this practice going forward.
Last year, we raised our 3-stream STACK type curve by about 20% from 800 MBoe to 950 MBoe to reflect data from large [indiscernible] wells. Our 2015 wells are performing well above the type curve today. 
As we've said, our STACK type curve represents a play average across a vast area. History tells us there will be variability in individual well results over a large area, where all hydrocarbon phases are present. And we remain very encouraged by the consistency of the well results over the last 3-plus years.
On Slide 13, we plot results from Newfield and industry wells throughout the STACK area. We're confident and the play continues to grow. Today, there are more than 30 rigs running and about 350 total wells have been drilled and completed to date. There are an additional 100 wells permitting. We have been asked a leading position in the oil window and are benefiting from technology, service sector infrastructure and the science being done by large, high-quality operators all around us.
In 2015, we expanded our footprint and extended our acreage position to the north and west where we are seeing high levels of industry activity today. In addition to the primary Meramec and Woodford targets, we have additional prospective horizons that we and industry will be testing in the future. We have thousands of prospective wells in inventory and realize the importance of holding our acreage for the future benefit of our stockholders.
We continue to see improvements in our drilling efficiencies on Slide 15, which are out completed cost per lateral foot and the progress we've made over the last several years. Lower cost per foot have come by targeting the most effective drilling zones, improvements in penetration rates through changes in bid designs as well as drilling fluid and motor optimizations. From our participation in the wells drilled by others, we know that our results are industry leading. Our best-in-class SXL wells are drilled and completed for about $750 per gross perforated interval, including facilities. We expect that our 2016 wells will cost about $725 per gross perforated foot. 
Well cost across our acreage will vary and the reasons are very important to understand. First, drilling depths range from more than 12,000 feet to less than 8,000 feet. Second, in some areas to the north and the west, we are often required to set an extra casing string, and this adds about $0.75 million or so to completed well cost. And next, about 1/3 of our total wells in 2016 will be XL wells, 5,000-foot lateral lengths. We plan to test XL wells this year to better understand the economics of XL wells, while holding acreage that would not allow for the drilling of SXL wells. Several of our peers in the area have seen solid results from XL wells, and we intend to continue to deliver the same.
And finally, we continue to tinker with our completions to find the most optimal design for future development. We're employing zipper fracs, diverting agents, higher fluid and proppant concentrations and using both hybrid and slickwater fracture stimulations across the Anadarko Basin. We're very encouraged by the strong performance in the 2015 wells and the improvements that have accrued over the last several years. These ongoing experimentations will create variability in both well cost and production performance. 
Although the STACK joint program provides industry-leading returns at today's oil prices, it's more important for you to understand where we're headed. We envision significantly lower well cost once we move into full field development.  On Slide 15, we contrast in difference in today's cost with what we internally refer to our vision well. We have a line of sight on completed well cost, including facilities as well as $6 million in future development. 
On the left side of Slide 16, we outline our 2016 assumptions for STACK well cost, operating expenses and our average working and net revenue interest. To the right of these assumptions, we show pre-tax rates of return using a variety of well costs and commodity prices. You can see the impact that a $5 move in oil or $0.5 million reduction in completed well cost has on our returns.
We've taken steps to secure takeaway in attractive markets for our growing Anadarko Basin volumes. As of today, we're beginning to move STACK oil by pipe to Cushing, Oklahoma. By midyear, we expect that 100% of our production will be on pipe to Cushing. This is a high-quality crude, and we expect our differential will ultimately be about $2.50 of NYMEX, WTI. You will see improved differentials in our guidance today. We remain very encouraged with the continuing progress we are making in the Anadarko Basin, and we'll be happy to discuss additional details with you during Q&A.
Let me close with a summary on the remaining investments in our 2016 CapEx. We plan to run a single rig in the Williston Basin through midyear and expect to complete 12 to 15 wells this year. Our most recent wells have been drilled and completed for just under $5 million, including facilities. 
In the Eagle Ford, we will invest solely through our outside operated program in the Fashing area, and this constitutes about $28 million. Although these teams have done an outstanding job to enhance economics, we simply must shift our limited capital towards the Anadarko Basin and our HBP needs.
We also expect to invest about $23 million in 2 joint ventures that we have recently signed last year, one in the Arkoma and the other in the Central Basin of the Uinta. In each of these matters, a significant portion of our interest is carried. Our rationale is fairly simple: one, demonstrate recent advancements in drilling and completions, get a better understanding of play economics; and offset firm transportation and refirement commitments that are negatively impacting our cost structure today. In the Arkoma Basin, we've already drilled several of the wells with superior early results on production and cost savings. Newfield is the operator of both ventures.
So once again, thanks for dialing into our call today and for your interest and investment in Newfield Exploration. We are fortunate to have premier assets in the Anadarko Basin, and we are actively driving down our well cost and improving returns. Our priorities are very clear today. They are centered around preserving liquidity, maintaining a strong balance sheet to weather a very challenging period of low oil prices. We know the importance of holding our Anadarko Basin acreage to drilling and retaining this important asset for our future growth. I'm confident that we have a sound near-term business plan to not only survive but to emerge as a leaner, better focused and more profitable company. 
That concludes our prepared remarks this morning, and we'll now take your questions."

So you can go back and pick up the results that we've put forth. The tighter spacing, that we've tested, remember, these are generally wells drilled on either side of lease lines. So in Oklahoma, you've got to be 440 feet off. So the tighter spacing that we've tested in STACK responds at about 880 feet, and we won't be able to go below that until we drill on actual spacing pilot on a DSU. So at this point, that's the tightest we're going to get till we get our HBP situation satisfied. And then within that, Dave, there were multiple tests. Woodford-Woodford, Woodford-Meramec, Upper Meramec, Lower Meramec and a variety of different offset distances. I would tell you that it's a relatively loose data set at this point, and I wouldn't draw any huge conclusions from it. But everything is positive. All the wells continue to perform at or above type cover. We saw no negative effects of the tighter spacing. So we're very, very encouraged in terms of thinking about what the ultimate spacing might be, and we continue to think that we'll have multiple layers ultimately to be developed. I will point out that some of our high-quality peers in the area that have already gotten HBP acreage have some high-density pilots planned, and we'll be watching with great interest. It's easy to see what they're thinking. And frankly, their thinking is in line with our thinking in terms of the number of horizons and the ability to space wells out in the 4 to 8 wells per horizon type level."

The numbers we're referencing are relative to the current footprint. So 50% HBP. The core, the original STACK acreage where we drilled, when you look at that map and the added effects, you'll actually see that, that's been pretty well peppered. So we'll have a lot of activity moving north and then ultimately northwest over time. We would expect to end '16 at around 65% or so with the reduced capital program, HBP-ed.

It's my 33rd year in the business. There've been 4 major events. So that means every 8 years or so, we go through one of these periods. What bothers us most about the current period is it embodies part of '86, part of '98, part of 2008, so it's serious. And frankly, I think the industry, some of the people that have taken steps in that regard are doing so probably because they see the environment is equally challenging. Frankly, our view is that since we're going to protect our assets and protect the investment of our stakeholders, stockholders, we're going to keep all viable options on the table to preserve health of the enterprise. And I said that in the earlier comments. Our bias, as you know, over the years, we've funded the entire transformation of the company has been towards the asset sales. And we've talked about moving that process along. I think the shift from noncore assets into the SCOOP and STACK assets in the Anadarko Basin makes sense. We've been on that path for the last 3 or 4 years, and we'll continue. But we sold $2.6 billion of assets over the last 5 years, including just under $100 million of assets that nobody heard about in 2015. So it's been an important part of the game plan, and I think that we'll continue to be prudent in that regard. And I think that the broader question that you're probably asking, we've seen peers accessing the capital markets. We do understand the rationale. We can see the need to enhance liquidity, manage debt levels. We've reduced our capital spend back towards cash flow, and I think we're overtaking the prudent steps that we can. But part of being prudent is you always keep the options on the table to preserve balance sheet strength, and that move allows us to execute our near-term plan. It's critical to us in '15. It'll be critical to us again in '16. So I think that's kind of my long-winded view. But again, '86 was bad. '98, '99 were no fun. 2008, no fun absolutely. 2014, 2015. Now we're into 2016, might be the worst of them all. Well, Dave, if it's not, we're going to be in the adequate position to step on the accelerator on the ride up. But we want to see positive movement in the markets before we step on the accelerator."

So I [indiscernible] the first thing we have been rotating into the Anadarko Basin over the course of the last 3 years, just given the scale and scope of the asset portfolio that we put together there and the results being posted. I mentioned that we sold 2.6 billion of what we call nonstrategic assets over the last 5 years that helped fund our transformation, including building those positions that we love dearly today. Our focus has to remain on HBP-ing the STACK acreage. We've got most of the SCOOP taken care of. We do have some wells planned there and as indicated in 2016. But it's mostly about focusing on getting STACK HBP-ed and putting us in a position, so in 2017, we can start some of the tighter spacing pilots and a move towards development, which was one of our targets that we talked about during the course of 2015. We want to remain opportunistic, obviously, relative to opportunities that will come up from time-to-time in those care areas, and we want to will to take advantage of it. You saw us at 20,000 acres in the core of SCOOP and STACK in '15, and it's my hope that we'll see additional opportunities like that develop in 2016 on the road ahead. And we want to keep Newfield strong and in a position to act. Ultimately, relative to what we call nonstrategic assets, we've said consistently over the last couple of years, it's not a question of if. It's just a question of when, I think, our team broadly. That means all of the folks who work and manage assets understand that we're making smart decisions for the business in the intermediate and long term. And I think that they've shown the ability to deliver results in that area. So as we make those decisions, we'll shed assets in areas if we get an attractive price, and we'll have that cash available to -- for the all of the above strategy that I kind of outlined in the Anadarko Basin. If we don't see a good price, we're fortunate, because the steps taken last year and results posted in 2015 that we don't have to do anything. I think in that regard, we'll be patient to make sure that if we sell an asset, it's in a price that we'll be proud to tell you about. The stimulus for us has been inbound calls, and people know we have quality assets, and we've been open about saying that at some point in time, we'll let them go. I said clearly in the script that we have lots of discussions on lots of assets. We're just telling you about it now that it probably means that show up with your best number or expect to participate in the process. That's the polite translation to what we said today."

We want to be able to see that sustain itself before we make any additional adjustments to the type curve. But in general, if you look at all of the wells, since there's 50-some-odd wells, if I'm remembering correctly, in that curve, everything -- every bit of it's tracking at or above the type curve.

So I'll use the Arkoma as a basis for the discussion, as we've not started drilling in the Uinta, but I'll give some color there as well. So the team had the idea it that -- we've learned a lot since we stopped drilling dry gas wells in the Arkoma several years ago half after the financial crisis. We moved from gas to oil in terms of our focus. And we wanted to go back and see if we could apply those learnings on how to translate it in terms of spud the TD times and cost. So we drilled 5 or 6 wells there now on a just promoted basis. I think the exciting part was the very first well in the program was drilled in half the time of the best-in-class well drilled 5 years earlier. So that was a real shot in the arm. And then the productivity of the well, we'll update you with these programs later in the year. But just to give you the early returns in that well, productivity of that well is the best in the field. So that gives us visibility in that dry gas asset there in the Arkoma that had gas prices down in the $2.50, $2.75 range if oil decides to hang around $35, $40 range. We could go back to work drilling gas wells and not losing sleep over it. That's kind of exciting. At the same time, it probably tells you that lower-for-longer natural gas is going to be around for a while. The other side of that on the Uinta, that's oil, and we had the same learnings that we've taken both from the Anadarko Basin, the Williston Basin and Eagle Ford. And we've put a team together, and they've been working for the last year or so. It seems they've delivered the sub-$5 million cost in the Williston. And their challenge is to go to the Uinta Basin and prove we can do it there too. So the first part of this is to go back and we're drilling faster, can we drill and complete the well much more cost effectively. We know what the produceability is out there. We got lots of good production. We just need to drive the cost down. And on the other side of it, we've got some commitments to refiners, so this gives us an opportunity to demonstrate the economic value of the asset, continue to advance the learning curve and satisfy the requirements to move oil to the area refiners. So it's kind of win-win-win proposition in that regard. We'll start the drilling on that program here sometime in the second quarter."

If we get the double benefit, if you will, multiple factors working for us, then you could see an uplift. But I think the -- excuse me, with 4, 5 years of producing history now, the actual production characteristics of the target reservoirs are pretty well understood. You need to calibrate based on where the wells are located so that you know that you've got where you are in the phase envelope. Most of our acreage is in the oil window. There's a wet gas condensate window. There'll be a volatile oil window. Generally, the volatile oil window is very narrow. They'll grade ultimately into dry gas, so there'll be a large area of dry gas as you move west and southwest away from us. When you talk to Newfield, you're talking about oil window play largely. We do have some exposure in volatile oil and wet gas condensate regime, but we don't have any dry gas exposure at this stage."

We disclosed a great deal of news yesterday afternoon, including the filing of our Form 10-K. We'll do our best to briefly summarize our 2015 results as well as update you on the progress we're making in our Anadarko Basin assets and our plans for 2016. As always, we will leave ample time to take your specific questions at the end. 
These are indeed challenging times for the energy sector. More than a year ago now, we grew concerned about lower-for-longer commodity prices and took aggressive steps to strengthen our hedge book, reduce investment levels, rightsize our workforce and preserve margins by slashing cost across the business. These efforts were evident in our fourth quarter results and our outlook for improved costs and expenses in 2016. With the challenges presented in 2016, we must remain vigilant in our pursuit of lower cost and improved efficiencies. We continue to adapt to our near-term business strategies to preserve the health of the company and ensure we are in the best possible position to not only weather 2016, but to emerge with improved margins and a readiness to compete and win when commodity prices ultimately strengthen. I'm confident that we have the people, the plan and the assets to get it done. 
Our priorities, as outlined in our 2016 outlook released last night, are crystal clear. Number one, preserve liquidity. We reduced activity levels and better aligned our investment plans with cash flow expectations. You will see that our 2016 budget is down more than 50% from last year. And we have migrated the lion's share of our capital to the Anadarko Basin, where returns are more resilient today.
Our second priority is the HBP STACK. STACK is a premier asset with industry-leading returns under any plausible long-term commodity price scenario. It's critical that we retain our acreage and continue to push toward full field development, where we are confident that the returns will continue to get better. 
Third, reduce operating expenses and preserve margins. This is a continuation of the solid progress we made in 2015. You can see from yesterday's guidance that 2016 LOE and G&A expenses are projected to be down significantly, and we're looking for other avenues to safely reduce expenses.
And fourth, we're commencing a process to sell additional nonstrategic assets. We've had a number of inbound calls and progressed some of those discussions; however, none to date had resulted in a transaction. These discussions have encouraged us to launch a more organized effort to gain price discovery and ultimately transact on select assets. Although we have a desire to sell assets, we are not alone in that wish. We recognize that this market could quickly become saturated with distressed sellers. 
Proceeds from a potential sale would improve our financial flexibility and allow for opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions and acceleration in the Anadarko Basin activity if oil prices rally or to simply manage our short-term borrowing levels. I can assure you that our people from the office to the field are focused and aligned to execute these 4 priorities. A little later on the call, I'll provide more details in our 2016 outlook. But first, let me cover our 2015 highlights. 2015 was a great year for Newfield and its stockholders as we continued a multiyear streak of solid execution against our targets and delivered on our key objectives. 
Now to the highlights. Early 2015, we recapitalized our company and took proactive steps to reduce leverage and enhance liquidity. When coupled with our strong hedge position, these measures helped to offset the negative impact of low commodity prices and differentiated our balance sheet from many others in our peer group. The strong financial footing allowed us to successfully execute our game plan. 
Our 2015 game plan was certainly simplified. Capital investments were reduced by about 25% over 2014, and we were laser-focused on our exciting Anadarko Basin drilling programs, where we saw improving drilling and completion costs throughout the year. In 2015, each of our focus areas exceeded our beginning-of-year production forecast, and we beat our guidance, which was raised twice during the year. 
Production was driven by SCOOP and STACK, which achieved a record fourth quarter net production average of about 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. From a startup less than 4 years ago, SCOOP and STACK today comprise nearly half of our total company production and over half of the total proved reserves. 
We took aggressive steps to reduce domestic LOE and our per unit expense is down by more than 25% compared to 2014. We acted quickly to address G&A and took action in 2015 and early 2016 that have reduced our headcount by more than 20%. These measures equate to an estimated $45 million per year savings in 2016 gross G&A. 
Our Anadarko Basin proved reserves increased 50% to 269 million barrels of oil equivalent. Positive additions helped partially offset significant price-related revisions. Total company proved reserves decreased about 20% year-over-year to 509 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which about 2/3 are proved developed. Proved reserve additions during the year equated to reserve replacement ratio of approximately 180% or 350%, depending on the inclusion or exclusion of positive revisions. There's a detailed accounting and cost incurred in reserve additions and revisions in our release and our 10-K.
Let's move on to a summary of our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Our production in the fourth quarter was above guidance at 14.9 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which 47% was oil and nearly 2/3 were liquids. Fourth quarter domestic production was at the top end of the guidance at 13.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our Anadarko Basin production beat our forecast levels by nearly 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Excluding several items listed in our release, our net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter would have been $50 million or $0.30 per share on revenues of $362 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $289 million. Our hedges added about $500 million in incremental revenues in 2015 and helped to underpin our cash flow. We estimate an additional $365 million in hedged revenues over the next 2 years at current strip prices.
Our 2015 production was 56 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which 5.4 million barrels came in from our China assets. Adjusted net income for 2015 would have been $164 million or $1.02 per share when excluding unrealized losses on commodity derivatives, the premium to call notes and impairments. Revenues for 2015 were approximately $1.6 billion, and consolidated net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was approximately $1.2 billion.
Let's talk about 2016 and the key objectives in our near-term business plan. As I said in my opening comments, 2016 is all about preservation of liquidity, holding our STACK acreage and finding creative ways to improve margins in a low oil price environment. We have a deep, high-quality and economically resilient inventory to attack today in the Anadarko Basin, and this is the centerpiece of our 2016 plan. Our total capital budget is $625 million to $675 million, down more than 50% at the midpoint from 2015.  There's a pie chart on Slide 8 in our @NFX publication that depicts our planned investments by region.
On a unit of production basis, our outlook for cash operating cost has improved and can be attributed to the following. Our domestic lease operating expenses on a unit production basis are expected to be more than 15% below 2015. As we focus our investments in the Anadarko Basin, the benefits are increasingly more apparent in our margins. Lease operating and transportation expenses here are just over $5 per BOE, the lowest in our liquids portfolio. As SCOOP and STACK production growth offsets declines in areas with higher operating expenses and lower realized prices, we expect to see continued improvements in our margins. As I mentioned earlier, our gross G&A expense is expected to be $45 million lower than 2015, and we continue to look for ways to reduce G&A and streamline our operations.
Despite the large cut in our capital investments, our 2016 domestic production is expected to be relatively flat with 2015 at about 50 million barrels of oil equivalent. The China liftings are expected to total 4.3 million barrels of oil equivalent and no addition -- additional investments are planned in China. 
About 80% of our 2016 budget is planned for the Anadarko Basin. So this is where I will focus the remainder of our discussion. SCOOP is currently in active development, and we're drilling wells from common pads using shared production facilities and accessing markets through established midstream infrastructure. SCOOP constitutes about $200 million over 2016 investments. 
Within our SCOOP program, we will focus largely on SCOOP oil and the Springer Shale in both nonoperated and operated areas. We continue to see good Springer results and benefit from the fact that much of our prospective Springer inventory is already HBP-ed. 
STACK investments, which totaled about $300 million in 2016, will be focused on HBP-ing our acreage and ensuring that we hold this premier asset for future development. Today, about 50% of our acreage is held by production. We expect to invest $50 million to $80 million in land cost in the Anadarko Basin, largely in the STACK area. We are confident that our returns will further improve as we transition to full field development.
There are some slides in our @NFX publication that I'll reference today starting with Slide 12. Here notice that we are now reporting our well performance on a 3-stream basis. We made this change for a few simple reasons. First, it's better disclosure and reports actual volumes by product from point settlements and eliminates the need to estimate NGLs. Second, our type curve is 3 stream, and it makes comparisons to our average expectations much easier.
On Slide 14, notice the significant improvements we are seeing in well productivity. This illustration chronicles stat well performance by year and clearly shows the improvements we have made through optimized completions and targeting. Here we show all 77 wells drilled to date plotted against our type curve by year. And all the information is on a 3-stream basis. We will continue this practice going forward.
Last year, we raised our 3-stream STACK type curve by about 20% from 800 MBoe to 950 MBoe to reflect data from large [indiscernible] wells. Our 2015 wells are performing well above the type curve today. 
As we've said, our STACK type curve represents a play average across a vast area. History tells us there will be variability in individual well results over a large area, where all hydrocarbon phases are present. And we remain very encouraged by the consistency of the well results over the last 3-plus years.
On Slide 13, we plot results from Newfield and industry wells throughout the STACK area. We're confident and the play continues to grow. Today, there are more than 30 rigs running and about 350 total wells have been drilled and completed to date. There are an additional 100 wells permitting. We have amassed a leading position in the oil window and are benefiting from technology, service sector infrastructure and the science being done by large, high-quality operators all around us.
In 2015, we expanded our footprint and extended our acreage position to the north and west where we are seeing high levels of industry activity today. In addition to the primary Meramec and Woodford targets, we have additional prospective horizons that we in industry will be testing in the future. We have thousands of prospective wells in inventory and realize the importance of holding our acreage for the future benefit of our stockholders.
We continue to see improvements in our drilling efficiencies on Slide 15, we show our completed cost per lateral foot and the progress we've made over the last several years. Lower cost per foot have come by targeting the most effective drilling zones, improvements in penetration rates through changes in bid designs as well as drilling fluid and motor optimizations. From our participation in the wells drilled by others, we know that our results are industry leading. Our best-in-class SXL wells are drilled and completed for about $750 per gross perforated interval, including facilities. We expect that our 2016 wells will cost about $725 per gross perforated foot. 
Well cost across our acreage will vary and the reasons are very important to understand. First, drilling depths range from more than 12,000 feet to less than 8,000 feet. Second, in some areas to the north and the west, we are often required to set an extra casing string, and this adds about $0.75 million or so to completed well cost. And next, about 1/3 of our total wells in 2016 will be XL wells, 5,000-foot lateral lengths. We plan to test XL wells this year to better understand the economics of XL wells, while holding acreage that would not allow for the drilling of SXL wells. Several of our peers in the area have seen solid results from XL wells, and we intend to continue to deliver the same.
And finally, we continue to tinker with our completions to find the most optimal design for future development. We're employing zipper fracs, diverting agents, higher fluid and proppant concentrations and using both hybrid and slickwater fracture stimulations across the Anadarko Basin. We're very encouraged by the strong performance in the 2015 wells and the improvements that have accrued over the last several years. These ongoing experimentations will create variability in both well cost and production performance. 
Although the STACK joint program provides industry-leading returns at today's oil prices, it's more important for you to understand where we're headed. We envision significantly lower well cost once we move into full field development.  On Slide 15, we contrast in difference in today's cost with what we internally refer to our vision well. We have a line of sight on completed well cost, including facilities as low as $6 million in future development. 
On the left side of Slide 16, we outline our 2016 assumptions for STACK well cost, operating expenses and our average working and net revenue interest. To the right of these assumptions, we show pre-tax rates of return using a variety of well costs and commodity prices. You can see the impact that a $5 move in oil or $0.5 million reduction in completed well cost has on our returns.
We've taken steps to secure takeaway in attractive markets for our growing Anadarko Basin volumes. As of today, we're beginning to move STACK oil by pipe to Cushing, Oklahoma. By midyear, we expect that 100% of our production will be on pipe to Cushing. This is a high-quality crude, and we expect our differential will ultimately be about $2.50 off NYMEX. WTI -- you will see improved differentials in our guidance today. We remain very encouraged with the continuing progress we are making in the Anadarko Basin, and we'll be happy to discuss additional details with you during Q&A.
Let me close with a summary on the remaining investments in our 2016 CapEx. We plan to run a single rig in the Williston Basin through midyear and expect to complete 12 to 15 wells this year. Our most recent wells have been drilled and completed for just under $5 million, including facilities. 
In the Eagle Ford, we will invest solely through our outside operated program in the Fashing area, and this constitutes about $28 million. Although these teams have done an outstanding job to enhance economics, we simply must shift our limited capital towards the Anadarko Basin and our HBP needs.
We also expect to invest about $23 million in 2 joint ventures that we have recently signed last year, one in the Arkoma and the other in the Central Basin of the Uinta. In each of these ventures, a significant portion of our interest is carried. Our rationale is fairly simple: one, demonstrate recent advancements in drilling and completions, gain better understanding of play economics; and offset firm transportation and refinement commitments that are negatively impacting our cost structure today. In the Arkoma Basin, we've already drilled several of the wells with superior early results on production and cost savings. Newfield is the operator of both ventures.
So once again, thanks for dialing into our call today and for your interest and investment in Newfield Exploration. We are fortunate to have premier assets in the Anadarko Basin, and we are actively driving down our well cost and improving returns. Our priorities are very clear today. They are centered around preserving liquidity, maintaining a strong balance sheet to weather a very challenging period of low oil prices. We know the importance of holding our Anadarko Basin acreage to drilling and retaining this important asset for our future growth. I'm confident that we have a sound near-term business plan to not only survive but to emerge as a leaner, better focused and more profitable company. 
That concludes our prepared remarks this morning, and we'll now take your questions."

So you can go back and pick up the results that we've put forth. The tighter spacing that we've tested, remember, these are generally wells drilled on either side of lease lines. So in Oklahoma, you've got to be 440 feet off. So the tighter spacing that we've tested in STACK responds at about 880 feet, and we won't be able to go below that until we drill on actual spacing pilot on a DSU. So at this point, that's the tightest we're going to get till we get our HBP situation satisfied. And then within that, Dave, there were multiple tests. Woodford-Woodford, Woodford-Meramec, Upper Meramec, Lower Meramec and a variety of different offset distances. I would tell you that it's a relatively loose data set at this point, and I wouldn't draw any huge conclusions from it. But everything is positive. All the wells continue to perform at or above type curve. We saw no negative effects of the tighter spacing. So we're very, very encouraged in terms of thinking about what the ultimate spacing might be, and we continue to think that we'll have multiple layers ultimately to be developed. I will point out that some of our high-quality peers in the area that have already gotten HBP acreage have some high-density pilots planned, and we'll be watching with great interest. It's easy to see what they're thinking. And frankly, their thinking is in line with our thinking in terms of the number of horizons and the ability to space wells out in the 4 to 8 wells per horizon type level."

The core, the original STACK acreage where we drilled, when you look at that map and the added effects, you'll actually see that, that's been pretty well peppered. So we'll have a lot of activity moving north and then ultimately northwest over time. We would expect to end '16 at around 65% or so with the reduced capital program, HBP-ed. We would expect '17 to move up in the 75%, 80% range, assuming a continuation of same. I think ultimately, we'll keep you posted as we go. We're picking up incremental acreage on poolings. So there'll be some noise from period-to-period in terms of what the actual acreage account is. But I think those are pretty good numbers. So 50% at year end, 65-ish at year-end '16, 75-ish at year-end '17 is what we're thinking right now."

It's my 33rd year in the business. There've been 4 major events. So that means every 8 years or so, we go through one of these periods. What bothers us most about the current period is it embodies part of '86, part of '98, part of 2008, so it's serious. And frankly, I think the industry, some of the people that have taken steps in that regard are doing so probably because they see the environment is equally challenging. Frankly, our view is that since we're going to protect our assets and protect the investment of our stakeholders, stockholders, we're going to keep all viable options on the table to preserve health of the enterprise. And I said that in the earlier comments. Our bias, as you know, over the years, we've funded the entire transformation of the company has been towards the asset sales. And we've talked about moving that process along. I think the shift from noncore assets into the SCOOP and STACK assets in the Anadarko Basin makes sense. We've been on that path for the last 3 or 4 years, and we'll continue. But we sold $2.6 billion of assets over the last 5 years, including just under $100 million of assets that nobody heard about in 2015. So it's been an important part of the game plan, and I think that we'll continue to be prudent in that regard. And I think that the broader question that you're probably asking, we've seen peers accessing the capital markets. We do understand the rationale. We can see the need to enhance liquidity, manage debt levels. We've reduced our capital spend back towards cash flow, and I think we're taking all the prudent steps that we can. But part of being prudent is you always keep all the options on the table to preserve balance sheet strength, and that's what allows us to execute our near-term plan. It's critical to us in '15. It'll be critical to us again in '16. So I think that's kind of my long-winded view. But again, '86 was bad. '98, '99 were no fun. 2008, no fun absolutely. 2014, 2015. Now we're into 2016, might be the worst of them all."

So I [indiscernible] the first thing we have been rotating into the Anadarko Basin over the course of the last 3 years, just given the scale and scope of the asset portfolio that we put together there and the results being posted. I mentioned that we sold 2.6 billion of what we call nonstrategic assets over the last 5 years that helped fund our transformation, including building those positions that we love dearly today. Our focus has to remain on HBP-ing the STACK acreage. We've got most of the SCOOP taken care of. We do have some wells planned there and as indicated in 2016. But it's mostly about focusing on getting STACK HBP-ed and putting us in a position, so in 2017, we can start some of the tighter spacing pilots and a move towards development, which was one of our targets that we talked about during the course of 2015. We want to remain opportunistic, obviously, relative to opportunities that will come up from time-to-time in those core areas, and we want to will to take advantage of it. You saw us at 20,000 acres in the core of SCOOP and STACK in '15, and it's my hope that we'll see additional opportunities like that develop in 2016 on the road ahead. And we want to keep Newfield strong and in a position to act. Ultimately, relative to what we call nonstrategic assets, we've said consistently over the last couple of years, it's not a question of if. It's just a question of when. I think, our team broadly -- that means all of the folks who work and manage assets -- understand that we're making smart decisions for the business in the intermediate and long term. And I think that they've shown the ability to deliver results in that area. So as we make those decisions, we'll shed assets in areas if we get an attractive price, and we'll have that cash available to -- for the all of the above strategy that I kind of outlined in the Anadarko Basin. If we don't see a good price, we're fortunate, because the steps taken last year and results posted in 2015 that we don't have to do anything. I think in that regard, we'll be patient to make sure that if we sell an asset, it's in a price that we'll be proud to tell you about. The stimulus for us has been inbound calls, and people know we have quality assets, and we've been open about saying that at some point in time, we'll let them go. I said clearly in the script that we have lots of discussions on lots of assets. We're just telling everybody now that it probably means that show up with your best number or expect to participate in the process. That's the polite translation to what we said today."

So I'll use the Arkoma as a basis for the discussion, as we've not started drilling in the Uinta, but I'll give some color there as well. So the team had the idea it that -- we've learned a lot since we stopped drilling dry gas wells in the Arkoma several years ago after the financial crisis. We moved from gas to oil in terms of our focus. And we wanted to go back and see if we could apply those learnings on how to translate it in terms of spud the TD times and cost. So we drilled 5 or 6 wells there now on a just promoted basis. I think the exciting part was the very first well in the program was drilled in half the time of the best-in-class well drilled 5 years earlier. So that was a real shot in the arm. And then the productivity of the well, we'll update you with these programs later in the year. But just to give you the early returns in that well, productivity of that well is the best in the field. So that gives us visibility in that dry gas asset there in the Arkoma that had gas prices down in the $2.50, $2.75 range if oil decides to hang around $35, $40 range. We could go back to work drilling gas wells and not losing sleep over it. That's kind of exciting. At the same time, it probably tells you that lower-for-longer natural gas is going to be around for a while. The other side of that on the Uinta, that's oil, and we had the same learnings that we've taken both from the Anadarko Basin, the Williston Basin and Eagle Ford. And we've put a team together, and they've been working for the last year or so. The teams that delivered the sub-$5 million cost in the Williston. And their challenge is to go to the Uinta Basin and prove we can do it there too. So the first part of this is to go back -- can we drill them faster, can we drill and complete the well much more cost effectively. We know what the producibility is out there. We got lots of good production. We just need to drive the cost down. And on the other side of it, we've got some commitments to refiners, so this gives us an opportunity to demonstrate the economic value of the asset, continue to advance the learning curve and satisfy the requirements to move oil to the area refiners. So it's kind of win-win-win proposition in that regard. We'll start the drilling on that program here sometime in the second quarter."

If we get the double benefit, if you will, multiple factors working for us, then you could see an uplift. But I think the -- excuse me, with 4, 5 years of producing history now, the actual production characteristics of the target reservoirs are pretty well understood. You need to calibrate based on where the wells are located so that you know that you've got where you are in the phase envelope. Most of our acreage is in the oil window. There's a wet gas condensate window. There'll be a volatile oil window. Generally, the volatile oil window is very narrow. They'll grade ultimately into dry gas, so there'll be a large area of dry gas as you move west and southwest away from us. When you talk to Newfield, you're talking about oil window play largely. We do have some exposure in volatile oil and wet gas condensate regime, but we don't have any dry gas exposure at this stage."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2016 is well underway and it's hard to believe that we're already through the first quarter. Although oil prices have strengthened some since we last gathered in this call in February, th",2796,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 
2016 is well underway and it's hard to believe that we're already through the first quarter. Although oil prices have strengthened some since we last gathered in this call in February, this still remained challenging times. Our near-term business plan was designed to meet both today's challenges and tomorrow's opportunities, and we the key objective that we've laid out in our last call still hold. 
The plan was designed to preserve the health of the company and ensure that we are positioned to not only weather 2016, but to emerge of improved margins and a readiness to compete and win when commodity prices ultimately strengthened.
Our 2016 business plan has 4-key objectives, and I'll provide a brief a progress report on each before calling our financial and operating results.
Our first priority is to preserve liquidity. It has taken several decisive steps to ensure our balance sheet remained strong. We issued equity in February to ensure that we have the capital to navigate today's challenges and to bridge to 2018 when we expect to be in full field development in STACK. 
We greatly reduced our 2016 activity levels and closely aligned capital investments with cash flow expectations. We hydrated our investments and the Anadarko Basin as receiving of our capital today. And we hedged aggressively in late 2014 and recently modified those positions to capture financial gains and to take advantage of recent strength in oil prices.
Our second priority is the HBP STACK. It's imperative that we hold our STACK acreage by production and continue to drive down costs as we push rapidly toward full field development. We're making great strides and progress today as we HBP the north and northeast portions of our STACK acreage, and we remain highly encouraged with the consistency of our well results. By year-end, we expect to be about 65% held by production.
Our third priority, reduce operating expenses and preserve margins. We have taken significant steps over the last year to improve our cost structure. Our first quarter domestically softening expense was down nearly 40% year-over-year on a per BOE basis, and we expect to reduce our full year 2016 G&A by nearly $50 million when compared to last year, excluding one-time cost. 
We're focused on margin improvement today across the company. In Ford, we launched a formal process to sell additional nonstrategic assets. We've engaged several priorities on our behalf and expect to have additional information to share with you later this year. But with the continued success we're having in an Anadarko Basin, we still believe that the addition of assets as you the best interest of our shareholders despite the recent move in oil prices and the strength of our balance sheet.
Proceeds from the additional sales will refine our portfolio, improve our financial flexibility, manage short-term borrowings, allow for the capture of opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions and/or accelerate our Anadarko Basin program.
We are executing well in delivering on our business plan throughout the organization today. 
In yesterday's release, you will see we beat the midpoint of our guidance by about 500,000 barrels equivalent, and we raised our production estimate for the year by about 1 million barrels.
It's important to note the gas production in our guidance is unchanged and the increase was related to liquids production. 
Our production beat in the quarter was attributed to outperformance in both of the Anadarko Basin and in the Williston Basin. Although we talked most frequently about SCOOP and STACK, our single rate program in the Williston Basin continues to deliver some very impressive results along the mine. In fact, production in the Williston hit an all-time high for us in the quarter. And as a slide, @NFX if you would likely find some of the interest. 
Let's briefly cover our first quarter results.  Our domestic production in the first quarter was above the midpoint of guidance by about 500,000 barrels at 13.5 million barrels oil equivalent. Total company production was 15.2 million  barrels of oil equivalent, of which, 46% was oil and nearly 2/3 liquids. 
Excluding several items listed in our release, our net loss for the quarter would have been 16 million or $0.09 per share on revenues of $284 million.
Our net cash provided by operating activities but for changes and operating assets and liabilities was $170 million. We recently permit the remainder of our hedges that were not previously permitized. These actions is actually locked in a gain of about $14 per barrel. 
We entered into the new swap positions in the second half of '16 and the first half of '17 on a like volume of oil. These were done in the low to mid-40s per barrel. 
And considering the $14 per barrel gain on the volumes and the new swabs, we will essentially receive revenues during these periods based on a WTI price of about $55 per barrel. This is an illustration in @NFX that helps explain these recent derivative transactions.
Let's spend the remainder of our call today on the operating plans for the remainder of the year and the significant progress we are making to drill and complete more efficient wells. As previously mentioned, our first quarter 2016 volumes are stronger-than-expected, led by the Williston and Anadarko Basins. As a result, we today raised our full year expectations by about 1 million barrels of oil equivalent. 
Our new guidance for 2016 domestic production is 50 million to 52 million barrels of oil equivalent. In our China, our field continues to produce near peak rates, and the expected national decline has been slower to materialize than expected. 
We also increased our expectations for China production by about 200,000 barrels for the year due to discontinued outperformance of the field.
China listings are expected to total 4.5 million barrels of oil equivalent and no significant new investments are planned.
Our capital budget for the year remains $625 million to $675 million. As we said at the beginning of the year, our investments are heavily weighted to the first half of the year. We entered 2016 with 9 France-Presse running in the Anadarko Basin as further activity has tapered, and we are running less than half the spreads today and are on schedule with our drilling and completion program for 2016. 
Included in our capital plans for this year are 2 new spacing pilots in STACK. Due to the efficiency gains are delivering at Anadarko Basin, we were able to swap this into our current budget out that -- outlook of $625 million to $675 million.
We're planning to drill and fill wells from 2 separate paths to test grader well densities. In addition, we are participating in at least 1 outside spacing pilots in STACK.
Gathering early in-fill spacing pilot data is key to finding the optimal full field development. We expect that these pilots will commence production late this year and add nearly 1 million barrels of oil equivalent of incremental volumes in 2017.
Our SCOOP program is in development and continues to deliver very strong results. We're running 2 rigs in active development. Year-to-date, we have commenced production from a new SCOOP oil pad, and the 5 wells achieved average rates of nearly 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, each of which, 80% was liquids. 
In the Springer Play, we turned a new well of sales of approximately 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which, 81% was oil, 90% was liquid. 
In STACK, we're running 3 rigs today and have drilled more than 100 wells to date or about 1/4 of the industry's 400 wells. Our net daily production for the Anadarko Basin is near 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day currently. 
We remained very encouraged that for more than 4 years of higher activity in the Anadarko Basin, we are seeing very consistent performance in our wells. Of the 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 35% is black oil. This is what we modeled years ago and still holding true. 
With high levels of activity today in the Anadarko Basin, we have significant outside interest in wells drilled by our peers. Some of these wells have large IPs with large natural gas cuts. This outside interest will cause our overall commodity mix to change a percent or 2 from quarter-to-quarter, but understand that our operating results in the basin are in line with our previous forecast and had been very consistent. 
I'll also add that across our 315,000-acre position, from that idea that I talked about 5 years ago and the work from the team, our all-in cost cumulatively is less than $2,000 per acre. Exciting asset in core foundational asset that will certainly shareholders well for many years to come.
As we drove the hold of our acreage by production across this 3,000-plus square-mile area, we will continue to see well results at or above our type curve in all portions of the field. 
Our HBP machine in STACK has been focused primarily in the northern portion of our acreage over the last 6 was. There are a couple of very important slides in @NFX today. 
The first is Slide #7, which shows the 24 months that we've built in the north to northeast. 12 of which are new wells, and we provided 30, 60 and 90-day average production rates for all of these wells and plotted the 24 north wells against our type curve on Slide 9. We're highly encouraged that these wells are performing above our 950 MBoe type curve with production out through 120 days.
A little history before moving on. The concept for STACK and our early leasing program was conceived more than 5 years ago. Since that time, we've assembled in excess of 225,000 net acres in the STACK play. The quality technology work that was done to get us started has worked into one of the most active plays in North America, and we have peer companies, well-respected peer companies active across the areas as well. I'd like to recognize our talented technical team for outlining what they believe at the time to be a commercially viable oil window in STACK. The fact that we're drilling wells in the northern edge of this defined boundary our same wells performed above our average type curve is fantastic news. That's a product of outstanding technical work. 
Although history tells us there will be variability in individual well results over vast area where all hydrocarbon bases are present, we are seeing type curve of better results in all areas today.
We're early in optimizing our completion practices and tailoring our completion cocktails to best match the reservoir in plays changes across the acreage, but you will notice better 60 and 90-day average rates for the newer batch of wells. We're encouraged with our results, and we are making great strides to drive down well cost and improve the asset for future rates of return. 
Let's about our gains and drilling efficiencies now we continue to lead the industry. On Slide 8, we show the progression of our days to depth for a 10,000-foot Super Extended Laterals. Here are some fun facts. There in our most recent best-in-class SXL well in STACK was drilled in 8 days is among the best SXL wells drilled in our portfolio and likely in the industry. 
Woodford to sharing completed well cost and production data from Helen once we have it. Year-to-date, our SXL wells in STACK are being drilled in an average time of 17 days. Our peers and outside operator wells where we have the direct working interest were averaging about 30 days for a comparable well. That's about twice our average days to depth in 2016. 
We have lots of questions on 5,000-foot laterals or 10,000-foot laterals and which one is better. Actually, we enjoy the question and can easily answer it with a single word, scoreboard. When our team can drill in SXL well in half the time of our peers and hope 2 sections in HBP mode, the answer is pretty obvious to us. Our cost per completed foot is about $690 compared to the best short laterals we can find at about $750 per foot. 
We have seen the economic benefits of SXL wells in the Eagle Ford, the Williston Basin, the Granite Wash, the, and in SCOOP. The same benefits are carrying through in STACK when we compare wells drilled and completed similarly.
That said, we build a handful of short laterals today on single section leases and we have about 20 planned for the year. We have a more detailed update later this year regarding XL performance. 
Our Williston STACK today are far more efficient and our economics continue to improve. Our efficiency gains are coming through a combination of reduced drilling days, more efficient completion practices, optimized profit loads and reduced service costs. Importantly, we estimate that more than half our cost reductions will be sustainable when oil prices strengthen and service cost ultimately increase.
There are several factors in the combine to drill an SXL well in 8 to 10 days. In short, we are effectively managing sub-surface hazards and rapidly solving problems when they do arise. 
Common challenges in STACK include lost circulation, hole stability underneath and additional casing string on portions or acreage to the north and west. We have made significant improvements in our MOD systems and wellbore hydraulics, and we are getting our wells done faster and more cost-effectively. Each one we drill is treated as a specific project and its receives its own specific design. This attention to every detail has led to our superior results.
Our best-in-class SXL well, the, has recently been drilled and completed for about $690 per gross completed interval. Or a completed well cost with facilities included of about $6.9 million. The well has called out on Slide 6 and compares very favorably to the $7.3 million well budgeted for 2016.
Our team has been applying much of the cost savings from building back and to completions as we continue to seek the most optimal design for future development. It is important to understand that we are not simply trying to maximize an IP rate from the first well in the section. We are testing various profit loads and sand sizes along with fluid types and volumes to arrive at best design for our long-term development plan. Additionally, we continue to drill our HBP wells along these line boundaries as opposed to targeting initial low on localized DSU sweet spots for maximum IP and headline results. We are in this for the long term and want to ensure that we preserve the most efficient full field development for the future. 
With the recent modifications, we are, today, pumping about 60% more with $300,000 less in total cost. In addition, just simply having lower sand and pressure pumping cost, we have effectively employed super fracs, sleeves, dissolvable plugs, diverters, tighter spacing and progressions, higher concentrations and use both crosslegged and hybrid faster stimulations. That's a mouthful. 
In short, our optimizing every conceivable variable to our best answer to create the most long-term value for our shareholders as we develop this premier asset. 
One thing, however, is becoming obvious from our completion trials to date. Higher profit loads are making the positive impact on our production rates and EURs. 
2 years ago, we were pumping less than 1,000 pounds per foot. Last year's design was about 1,500 pounds per foot on average and included the recent completion on Slide 6. 
Our most recent designs include up to 20 400 pounds per foot and are just now following recent fracture stimulation. 
We're optimizing early floats to protect the reservoir and maximize liquids recovery.  We will have more to share with you on these developments later this year. 
We're very encouraged by the strong performance and the consistency we are seeing in our wells after more than 4 years of intense drilling activity. We have drilled 4 more wells in this play than any other operator. We have the experience, the learning curve and the team in place to continue leading in this exciting development. We know that there are significant deficiencies and still to be captured and our highly confident in our ability to deliver future SXL development wells for less than $6 million, including facilities.
That concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We appreciate your interest in our company and your investment in Newfield Exploration. I'm confident that our near-term business plan is sound and that we are executing well along the path that will make us a better, more efficient and profitable company in the future.

We said that we expect when development mode, there's probably another $1 million or so that just do combined efficiencies and the development operation that could come out of the well.

That's not our game. We're about optimizing the development, maximizing that present value. So everything we do is set in that context.
We would expect that first priority, get the acreage HBP. We've been clear. We've got a drilling advantage. We protect 2 sections with every well. Long laterals have been in every one of these major plays that we've been in if you're about intermediate and long-term value. If you're playing the game to capture ground and flip it, then you tell different stories. And I think some of you guys have been confused by people that are nothing but interlopers. I'll be glad when interlopers are gone and we're left with solid companies that are applying for the long term. We're almost there. It's a different give. This is a big boy game and the time for those guys is fast getting into the rearview mirror. So as far as performance uplift, 5 to 10, we're going to drill the 20 wells. We'll do our workmanlike manner in terms of the technical analysis. We will show you the results. All the work that we've done to date shows about a 1.8 to 2 factor when you think about the 5,000 foot versus the 10,000-foot. I would put that, that's too close to call. And then in our math, the cost advantage and the time advantage translates to return advantage. So thanks for giving me a moment to a bit on the , but we feel pretty strong that we're doing the right thing. As far as the number of sounds, we sent consistently since the beginning of the play that we thought there were probably 3 to 5 horizons of interest. I think we still believe that today. I didn't get a chance to see their information, you said they're talking about 5 in the Meramec. Are you asking can I see that there could be 5 in the Meramec? The answer is yes. At those age, we know it's all saturated from the course that we've got early in the exploitation aspiration phase, assessment phase, if you will, the play that it's oil saturated. We haven't drilled any wells there, but clearly, it's a target horizon that you would expect to be producible. And I expect we and the industry will find some time to test that in the course the Woodson has already been proven. So there's a lot of work yet to be done to actually refine the vertical dimension of how tight you can stack the individual layers, but I expect that we'll gather a lot of data in the industry over the next couple of years and we'll give you that answer. I know the early pilots are generally in 150 to 175-foot range, if I'm recollecting correctly in terms of offset vertical dimension that the companies are testing, and I think our early test will be in line with that testing assumption as well. So I think that's -- hopefully, that covers all 3 of your questions."

So the first thing is what we've said this we've had the amazing consistency across the acreage, so that's the first thing and that's true. So we don't see huge variability. In fact, I think we've said the last 2 or 3 years that terms and when you look at P 10 P 90 ratios as a description of the distribution, this play from right out of the shape is the first 10 wells to date is one of the tightest P 10 P 90 ratios of anything that we've participated in or evaluated, that's first thing.  There is a difference by vintage on the wells. So again, we've been very methodical about how we reverse things. So the first suite of wells and the assessment phase drove across the acreage we completed identically. So you go back in the record 2 or 3 years ago and you can see that we talked about that on a number of the calls. We did that for the very recent that you asked. Did we see any material geologic variability as we moved across the acreage? And the conclusion was no. And now we've moved into optimizing completion. So completion is the first plays and the easy wins, if you will. We're taking the per clusters from 125 feet down to 50 to 75, and I think we've tested as low as 35, I believe, if my memory serves me right. That's all been done over the last 2, 2.5 years. And the fact that we pushed from 125 to 75 to 50 tells you that we were seeing positive economic uplift and we've now incorporated that into the design. And Gary, John, George in our drilling completion teams today are working on profit load and that's kind of been the focus. And again, we took measurable, methodical steps across large batches of wells. Now it's hard for you to diagnose this externally and no, we're not going to get a road map that to everybody out there. But we know wish wells and we've done one work on. And we can see you got the group of 1,000-pound per foot wells, and we've got 1,500 pound per foot wells, we've got 2,400 pound per foot wells, and that's all about establishing what the optimal completion recipe is going to be and optimizing on the economics. And I think the sincerest expression of all of this resource is questionably continued to ask from a lot of you guys. We felt with the 950 MBoe type curve, but over the last course of last 1.5 years, all the wells have continued to track and plot above the type curve, and that's after more than 100 wells have been drilled completed. That is nothing short of phenomenal. So for those that want to understand the play and see it as it is, it's not too hard. For those that want to tell other stories, they're running out of bullets. So [indiscernible]it's almost empty."

Certainly, we're -- imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so somebody's doing something novel and unique and creative that improves the returns, we'll adopt it tomorrow, okay. That's first thing. I think the easiest way for you to see what we see in terms of looking into the future and dreaming a little bit is the Williston Basin is a great example. And our team is regularly drilling, and completing and equipping wells in the Williston Basin. It's somewhere depths 10,000-foot laterals today for less than $5 million.  So if you want an example of what the team does, team Newfield and team Newfield's processes, there you go. And we're going to translate those over to the STACK play as we move into development. And we frankly believe we'll be transitioning into development in 2017, so that road ahead is not as far into the future as it was when we started. I got a question on the call about not going out and specifically targeting zones the -- we believe might have the highest productivity or the well result. We're actually continuing to stay very disciplined in drilling our wells just inside leased lines, and that's part of our HBP mode. It leaves all of the ground. I'd like to make this point in Kim's earlier question. When we get this thing HBP-ed, we're going to have data across the entire footprint and we'll have a couple of miles between these wells that has been untouched. So when we decide what the optimal development plan is going forward, we've got virgin ground. And a lot of times, these resource plays, when you don't have large contiguous positions like we have here and able to control large facets of ground, that you're not able to efficiently develop in that regard. So I think this play has the potential of being the best and most efficient development that the industry has delivered yet. And Newfield's going to be right up in the front of that line where we should be."

So that tells you something the elements  is just outside of the top 20. I think the composite production from those 5 wells spread out over that 4 or 5-month time frame was in excess of 60 million cubic feet a day. So to give you a feel for that, I think we've drilled out there historically 300-plus wells. I think we had 150 million gross production back at the beginning of 2015. We drilled 5 wells and added over 50 million cubic feet a day. And the best part of it is those wells were drilled and completed in less than half the time of the best well that was drilled 5 years previously. So pretty exciting. And again, it demonstrates of the learning organization and that the team and process matter. And so we proved that the concept. We know there's a lot of value in the Arkoma. We love having 170,000-acre HBP asset there. And the right plays in time when it make sense, then we've got a gas option, we'll exercise it."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2016 is well underway, and it's hard to believe that we're already through the first quarter. Although oil prices have strengthened some since we last gathered in this call in February, t",2819,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 
2016 is well underway, and it's hard to believe that we're already through the first quarter. Although oil prices have strengthened some since we last gathered in this call in February, these still remain challenging times. Our near-term business plan was designed to meet both today's challenges and tomorrow's opportunities, and the key objectives that we laid out in our last calls still hold.  The plan was designed to preserve the health of the company and ensure that we are positioned to not only weather 2016 but to emerge of improved margins and a readiness to compete and win when commodity prices ultimately strengthened.
Our 2016 business plan has 4-key objectives, and I'll provide a brief progress report on each before covering our financial and operating results.
Our first priority is to preserve liquidity. We have taken several decisive steps to ensure our balance sheet remain strong. We issued equity in February to ensure that we have the capital to navigate today's challenges and to bridge to 2018 when we expect to be in full field development in STACK. 
We greatly reduced our 2016 activity levels and closely aligned capital investments with cash flow expectations. We hydrated our investments, and the Anadarko Basin is receiving a majority of our capital today. And we hedged aggressively in late 2014 and recently modified those positions to capture financial gains and to take advantage of recent strength in oil prices.
Our second priority is the HBP STACK. It's imperative that we hold our STACK acreage by production and continue to drive down cost as we push rapidly toward full field development. We're making great strides and progress today as we HBP the north and northeast portions of our STACK acreage, and we remain highly encouraged with the consistency of our well results. By year-end, we expect to be about 65% held by production.
Our third priority, reduce operating expenses and preserve margins. We have taken significant steps over the last year to improve our cost structure. Our first quarter domestically lease operating expense was down nearly 40% year-over-year on a per-BOE basis, and we expect to reduce our full year 2016 G&A by nearly $50 million when compared to last year, excluding onetime cost. 
We're focused on margin improvement today across the company, and for it we have launched a formal process to sell additional nonstrategic assets. We've engaged several parties on our behalf and expect to have additional information to share with you later this year. With the continued success we're having in the Anadarko Basin, we still believe that the addition of asset sales are in the best interest of our shareholder, despite the recent move in oil prices and the strength of our balance sheet.
Proceeds from the additional sales will refine our portfolio, improve our financial flexibility, manage short-term borrowings, allow for the capture of opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions and/or accelerate our Anadarko Basin program.  
We are executing well and delivering on our business plan throughout the organization today.  In yesterday's release, you will see we beat the midpoint of our guidance by about 500,000 barrels equivalent, and we've raised our production estimate for the year by about 1 million barrels.  It's important to note the gas production in our guidance is unchanged, and the increase was related to liquids production. 
Our production beat in the quarter was attributed to outperformance in both of the Anadarko Basin and in the Williston Basin. Although we talked most frequently about SCOOP and STACK, our single-rig program in the Williston Basin continues to deliver some very impressive results along the Nesson Anticline. In fact, production in the Williston hit an all-time high for us in the quarter, and there is a slide, @NFX, you would likely find some of this of interest. 
Let's briefly cover our first quarter results.  Our domestic production in the first quarter was above the midpoint of guidance by about 500,000 barrels at 13.5 million barrels oil equivalent. Total company production was 15.2 million  barrels of oil equivalent, of which 46% was oil and nearly 2/3 liquids.  
Excluding several items listed in our release, our net loss for the quarter would have been $16 million or $0.09 per share on revenues of $284 million.  Our net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $170 million. We recently permitized the remainder of our hedges that were not previously permitized. These actions essentially locked in a gain of about $14 per barrel.  We entered into the new swap positions in the second half of '16 and in the first half of '17 on a like volume of oil. These swaps were done in the low- to mid-40s per barrel.  And considering the $14 per barrel gain on the permitized volumes and the new swaps, we will essentially receive revenues during these periods based on a WTI price of about $55 per barrel. There is an illustration in @NFX that helps explain these recent derivative transactions.
Let's spend the remainder of our call today on the operating plans for the remainder of the year and the significant progress we are making to drill and complete more efficient wells. 
As previously mentioned, our first quarter 2016 volumes were stronger-than-expected, led by the Williston and Anadarko basins. As a result, we today raised our full year expectations by about 1 million barrels of oil equivalent. 
Our new guidance for 2016 domestic production is 50 million to 52 million barrels of oil equivalent. In our China, our Pearl field continues to produce near-peak rates, and the expected national decline has been slowered to materialize than expected.  We also increased our expectations for China production by about 200,000 barrels for the year due to discontinued outperformance of the Pearl field.  China lifting are expected to total 4.5 million barrels of oil equivalent and no significant new investments are planned.
Our capital budget for the year remains $625 million to $675 million. As we said at the beginning of the year, our investments are heavily weighted to the first half of the year. We entered 2016 with 9 frac spreads running in the Anadarko Basin as flurry of activity has tapered, and we are running less than half the spreads today and are on schedule with our drilling and completion program for 2016. 
Included in our capital plans for this year are 2 new in-fill spacing pilots in STACK. Due to the efficiency gains we're delivering in Anadarko Basin, we were able to swap this into our current budget outlook of $625 million to $675 million.  We are planning to drill in-fill wells from 2 separate pads to test grader well densities. In addition, we are participating in at least one outside-operated spacing pilots in STACK.  Gathering early in-fill spacing pilot data is key to planning the optimal full field development. We expect that these pilots will commence production late this year and add nearly 1 million barrels of oil equivalent of incremental volumes in 2017.
Our SCOOP program is in development and continues to deliver very strong results. We're running 2 rigs in active development. Year-to-date, we have commenced production from a new SCOOP oil pad, and the 5 wells achieved average rates of nearly 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day each, of which 80% was liquids. 
In the Springer Play, we turned a new well of sales of approximately 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 81% was oil, 90% was liquid. 
In STACK, we're running 3 rigs today and have drilled more than 100 wells to-date or about 1/4 of industry's 400 wells. Our net daily production for the Anadarko Basin is nearly 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day currently. 
We remain very encouraged after more than 4 years of high activity in the Anadarko Basin and are seeing very consistent performance from our wells. Of the 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 35% is black oil. This is what we modeled years ago, and it still holding true. 
With high levels of activity today in the Anadarko Basin, we have significant outside interest in wells drilled by our peers. Some of these wells have large IPs with large natural gas cuts. This outside interest will cause our overall commodity mix to change 1% or 2% from quarter-to-quarter. But understand that our operating results in the basin are in line with our previous forecast and have been very consistent. 
I'll also add that across our 315,000-acre position, from that idea that I talked about 5 years ago and the work from the team, our all-in cost cumulatively is less than $2,000 per acre. Exciting asset and core foundational asset that'll certainly fill in our shareholders' wealth for many years to come.
As we drill to hold our acreage by production across this 3,000-plus square-mile area, we will continue to see well results at or above our type curve in all portions of the field.  Our HBP machine in STACK has been focused primarily in the northern portion of our acreage over the last 6 months. There are a couple of very important slides in @NFX today. 
The first is at Slide #7, which shows the 24 wells that we've drilled to the north and northeast, 12 of which are new wells. We've provided 30-, 60- and 90-day average production rates for all of these wells and part of the 24 north wells against our type curve on Slide 9. We're highly encouraged that these wells are performing above our 950 MBoe type curve with production out through 120 days.
A separate little history here before moving on. The concept for STACK in our early leasing program was conceived more than 5 years ago. Since that time, we've assembled in excess of 225,000 net acres in the STACK play. The quality technical work that was done to get us started has morphed into one of the most active plays in North America. And we have peer companies, well-respected peer companies active across the area as well. I'd like to recognize our talented technical team for outlining what they believed at the time to be a commercially viable oil window in STACK. The fact that we are drilling wells in the northern edge of this defined boundary our saying those wells perform above our average type curve is fantastic news. That's a product of outstanding technical work.  Although history tells us there will be variability in individual well results over vast area where all hydrocarbon phases are present, we are seeing type curve of better results in all areas today.
We're early in optimizing our completion practices and tailoring our completion cocktails to best match the reservoir and phase changes across the acreage. But you will notice better 60- and 90-day average rates for the newer batch of wells. We're encouraged with our results, and we are making great strides to drive down well cost and improve the outlook for future rates of return. 
Let's talk about our gains and drilling efficiencies and how we continue to lead the industry. On Slide 8, we show the progression of our days to depth for a 10,000-foot Super Extended Laterals. Here are some fun facts. The Helen, our most recent best-in-class SXL well in STACK, was drilled in 8 days and is among the best SXL wells drilled in our portfolio and likely in the industry.  We look forwarding to sharing completed well costs and production data from Helen, once we have it. 
Year-to-date, our SXL wells in STACK are being drilled at an average time of 17 days. Our peers' and outside-operated wells, where we have the direct working interest, are averaging about 30 days for a comparable well. That's about twice our average days to depth in 2016. 
We have lots of questions on 5,000-foot laterals versus 10,000-foot laterals and which one is better. Actually, we enjoy the question and can easily answer it with a single word, scoreboard. When our team can drill an SXL well in half the time of our peers and hope 2 sections in HBP mode, the answer is pretty obvious to us. Our cost per completed foot is about $690 compared to the best short laterals we can find at about $750 per foot. 
We have seen the economic benefits of SXL wells in the Eagle Ford, the Williston Basin, the Granite Wash, the Arkoma and in SCOOP. The same benefits are carrying through in STACK, when we compare wells drilled and completed similarly.  That said, we've drilled a handful of short laterals today on single-section leases, and we have about 20 planned for the year. We have a more detailed update later this year regarding XL performance. 
Our well in STACK today are far more efficient and our economics continued to improve. Our efficiency gains are coming through a combination of reduced drilling days, more efficient completion practices, optimized proppant loads and reduced service costs. Importantly, we estimate that more than half our cost reductions will be sustainable when oil prices strengthen and service cost ultimately increase.
There are several factors in the combine to drill an SXL well in 8 to 10 days. In short, we are effectively managing sub-surface hazards and rapidly solving problems when they do arise. 
Common challenges in STACK include: lost circulation, hole stability in the need for an additional casing string on portions of our acreage to the north and west. We have made significant improvements in our mud systems and wellbore hydraulics, and we are getting our wells done faster and more cost-effectively. Each well we drill is treated as a specific project and it receives its own specific design. This attention to every detail has led to our superior results.
Our best-in-class SXL well, the Vickie, has recently been drilled and completed for about $690 per gross completed interval or a completed well cost with facilities included of about $6.9 million. The Vickie well was called out on Slide 6 and compares very favorably to the $7.3 million wealth budgeted for 2016.
Our team has been applying much of the cost savings from drilling back and to completions as we continue to seek the most optimal design for future development. It is important to understand that we are not simply trying to maximize an IP rate from the first well intersection. We are testing various proppant loads and sand sizes along with fluid types and volumes to arrive at best design for our long-term development plan. Additionally, we continue to drill our HBP wells along lease line boundaries as opposed to targeting the initial well on localized DSU sweet spots for maximum IP and headline results. We are in this for the long term, and we want to ensure that we preserve the most efficient full field development for the future. 
With the recent modifications, we are today pumping about 60% more proppant for $300,000 less in total cost. In addition, to simply having lower sand and pressure pumping cost, we have effectively employed zipper fracs, toe sleeves, dissolvable plugs, diverters, tighter stage-pacing and perforations, higher pumping concentrations and use both cross-linked and hybrid fracture stimulations. That's a mouthful. 
In short, we're optimizing every conceivable variable to allow with a best answer to create the most long-term value for our shareholders as we develop this premier asset. 
One thing, however, is becoming obvious from our completion trials to-date. Higher proppant loads are making a positive impact on our production rates and EURs. 
2 years ago, we were pumping less than 1,000 pounds per foot. Last year's design was about 1,500 pounds per foot on average and included the recent JR Barton completion on Slide 6.  Our most recent designs include up to 2,400 pounds per foot and are just climbing up now following recent fracture stimulation.  We're optimizing early floats to protect the reservoir and maximize liquids recovery.  We will have more to share with you on these developments later this year. 
We're very encouraged by the strong performance and the consistency we are seeing in our wells after more than 4 years of intense drilling activity. We have drilled far more wells in this play than any other operator. We have the experience, the learning curve and the team in place to continue leading this exciting development. We know that there are significant efficiencies still to be captured and are highly confident in our ability to deliver future SXL development wells for less than $6 million, including facilities.
That concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We appreciate your interest in our company and your investment in Newfield Exploration. I'm confident that our near-term business plan is sound and that we are executing well along a path that will make us a better, more efficient and profitable company in the future.

That's not our game. We're about optimizing the development and maximizing that present value. So everything we do is set in that context.  We would expect that first priority, get the acreage HBP. We've been clear. We've got a drilling advantage. We protect 2 sections with every well. Long laterals have been the answer in every one of these major plays that we've been in, if you're about intermediate and long-term value. If you're playing the game to capture ground and flip it, then you tell different stories. And I think some of you guys have been confused by people that are nothing but interlopers. I'll be glad when interlopers are gone and we're left with solid companies that are playing for the long term. We're almost there. It's a different game. This is a big-boy game, and the time for those guys is fast getting into the rearview mirror. So as far as performance uplift 5 to 10, we're going to drill the 20 wells. We'll do our workmanlike manner in terms of the technical analysis and we'll show you the results. All the work that we've done to-date shows about a 1.8 to 2 factor when you think about the 5,000-foot versus the 10,000-foot. I would put that as too close to call, and then in our math, the cost advantage and the time advantage translates to return advantage. So thanks for giving me a moment to -- it's about a bit on the die-drive, but we feel pretty strong that we're doing the right thing. As far as the number of zones, we've said consistently since the beginning of the play that we thought there were probably 3 to 5 horizons of interest. I think we still believe that today. Devon didn't get a chance to see their information. You said they're talking about 5 in the Meramec. Are you asking can I see that there could be 5 in the Meramec? The answer is yes. The Osage, we know it's oil-saturated from the cores that we got early in the exploitation exploration phase, assessment phase, if you will, of the play that it's oil-saturated. We haven't drilled any wells there, but clearly, it's a target horizon that you would expect to be producible. And I expect that we and industry will find some time to test that. And of course, the Woodford has already been proven. So there is a lot of work yet to be done to actually refine the vertical dimension of how tight you can spec -- can stack the individual layers, but I expect that we'll gather a lot of data, we and the industry, over the next couple of years and give you that answer. I know the early pilots are generally in 150- to 175-foot range, if I'm recollecting correctly in terms of offset vertical dimension that the companies are testing, and I think our early tests will be in line with that testing assumption as well. So I think that's -- hopefully, that covers all 3 of your questions."

So the first thing is -- what we've said is that we've had amazing consistency across the acreage. So that's the first thing, and that's true. So we don't see huge variability. In fact, I think we've said the last 2 to 3 years that in terms of when you look at P10/P90 ratios as a description of the distribution, this play from right out of the chute it's first 10 wells to-date is one of the tightest P10/P90 ratios of anything that we've participated in or evaluated. That's first thing.  There is a difference by vintage on the wells. So again, we've been very methodical about how we refer things. So the first suite of wells and the assessment phase drilled across the acreage, we completed identically. So you can go back in the record 2 or 3 years ago and you can see that we talked about that on a number of the calls. We did that for the very reason that you asked did we see any material geologic variability as we moved across the acreage. And the conclusion was, no. And now we've moved into optimizing completion. So completion is the first phase of the easy wins, if you will. We're taking the perk clusters from 125 feet down to 50 to 75, and I think we've tested as low as 35, I believe, if my memory serves me right. That's all been done over the last 2, 2.5 years. And the fact that we pushed from 125 to 75 to 50 tells you that we were seeing positive economic uplift, and we've now incorporated that into the design. And then Gary, John, George and our drilling completion teams today are working on proppant load, and that's kind of been the focus. And again, we took measurable, methodical steps across large batches of wells. Now it's hard for you to diagnose this externally, and no, we're not going to give the road map out to everybody out there. But we know which wells we've done what work on. And we can see you've got a group of 1,000 pound-per-foot wells and we got 1,500 pound-per-foot wells, we got 2,400 pound-per-foot wells, and that's all about establishing what the optimal completion recipe is going to be and optimizing on the economics. And I think the sincerest expression of all of those results is the question we continue to get asked from a lot of you guys. We've held with the 950 MBoe type curve, but over the course of the last 1 year, 1.5 years, all the wells have continued to track and plough above the type curve, and that's after more than 100 wells have been drilled and completed. Now that is nothing short of phenomenal. So for those that want to understand the play and see it as it is, it's not too hard. For those that want to tell other stories, they're running out of bullets. Their guns are almost empty."

So we'll test it. Industry will test it. We've got good wells right up to that area, but it is a -- less than 5% of the total acreage block is represented in that eastern area on a net basis.

So somebody's doing something novel and unique and creative that improves the returns, we'll adopt it tomorrow. Okay, that's first thing. I think the easiest way for you to see what we see in terms of looking into the future and dreaming a little bit is the Williston Basin is a great example. And our team is regularly drilling and completing and equipping wells in the Williston Basin. It's somewhere depths 10,000-foot laterals today for less than $5 million.  So if you want an example of what the team does, team Newfield and team Newfield's processes, there you go. And we're going to translate those over to the STACK play as we move into development. And we frankly believe we'll be transitioning into development in 2017 so that, that road ahead is not as far into the future as it was when we started. And then I touched on the call about not going out and specifically targeting zones that we believe might have the highest productivity or this year's well result. We are actually continuing to stay very disciplined in drilling our wells just inside leased lines. And that's part of our HBP mode. It leaves all of the ground. I'd like to make this point in Kim's earlier question. When we get this thing HBP-ed, we're going to have data across the entire footprint and we'll have a couple of miles between these wells that has been untouched. So when we decide what the optimal development plan is going forward, we've got virgin ground. And a lot of times, these resource plays. When you don't have large contiguous positions like we have here and able to control large facets of ground, but you're not able to efficiently develop in that regard. So I think this play has the potential of being the best and most efficient development that industry has delivered yet, and Newfield's going to be right up at the front of that line, where we should be."

So again, those that love 5,000-foot wells tells you that our team can go over and do that in STACK just as easily. So what you can count on with Newfield is we're going to drill the most economic wells and we're going to maximize value. That's what we do every day. We don't play this game for the short term. It's an intermediate long-term game, and we make decisions accordingly. So if you think about it that way when you're looking at our data, our information, you will be in sync with us.

Four of the 5 are in the top shortlist all-time wells drilled in the Arkoma, and -- I mean, in the top 10. So that tells you something. The other one is just outside of the top 20. I think the composite production from those 5 wells spread out over that 4- or 5-month time frame was in excess of 60 million cubic feet a day. So to give you a feel for that, I think we've drilled out there historically 300-plus wells. I think we had 150 million gross production back at the beginning of 2015. We drilled 5 wells and added over 50 million cubic feet a day. And the best part of it is those wells were drilled and completed in less than half the time of the best well that was drilled 5 years previously. So pretty exciting. And again, it demonstrates the learning organization and that team and process matter. And so we proved the concept. We know there's a lot of value in the Arkoma.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2016 is well underway, and it's hard to believe that we're already through the first quarter. Although oil prices have strengthened some since we last gathered in this call in February, t",2831,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 
2016 is well underway, and it's hard to believe that we're already through the first quarter. Although oil prices have strengthened some since we last gathered in this call in February, these still remain challenging times. Our near-term business plan was designed to meet both today's challenges and tomorrow's opportunities, and the key objectives that we laid out in our last calls still hold.  The plan was designed to preserve the health of the company and ensure that we are positioned to not only weather 2016 but to emerge with improved margins and a readiness to compete and win when commodity prices ultimately strengthened.
Our 2016 business plan has 4-key objectives, and I'll provide a brief progress report on each before covering our financial and operating results.
Our first priority is to preserve liquidity. We have taken several decisive steps to ensure our balance sheet remains strong. We issued equity in February to ensure that we had the capital to navigate today's challenges and to bridge to 2018 when we expect to be in full field development in STACK. 
We greatly reduced our 2016 activity levels and closely aligned capital investments with cash flow expectations. We high-graded our investments, and the Anadarko Basin is receiving a majority of our capital today. And we hedged aggressively in late 2014 and recently modified those positions to capture financial gains and to take advantage of recent strength in oil prices.
Our second priority is the HBP STACK. It's imperative that we hold our STACK acreage by production and continue to drive down cost as we push rapidly toward full field development. We're making great strides and progress today, as we HBP the north and northeast portions of our STACK acreage, and we remain highly encouraged with the consistency of our well results. By year end, we expect to be about 65% held by production.
Our third priority, reduce operating expenses and preserve margins. We have taken significant steps over the last year to improve our cost structure. Our first quarter domestically lease operating expense was down nearly 40% year-over-year on a per-BOE basis, and we expect to reduce our full year 2016 G&A by nearly $50 million when compared to last year, excluding onetime cost. 
We're focused on margin improvement today across the company. And fourth, we've launched a formal process to sell additional nonstrategic assets. We've engaged several parties on our behalf and expect to have additional information to share with you later this year. With the continued success we're having in the Anadarko Basin, we still believe that the addition of asset sales are in the best interest of our shareholder, despite the recent move in oil prices and the strength of our balance sheet.
Proceeds from the additional sales will refine our portfolio, improve our financial flexibility, manage short-term borrowings, allow for the capture of opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions and/or accelerate our Anadarko Basin program.  
We are executing well and delivering on our business plan throughout the organization today. In yesterday's release, you will see we beat the midpoint of our guidance by about 500,000 barrels equivalent, and we've raised our production estimate for the year by about 1 million barrels.  It's important to note the gas production in our guidance is unchanged, and the increase was related to liquids production. 
Our production beat in the quarter was attributed to outperformance in both of the Anadarko Basin and in the Williston Basin. Although we talked most frequently about SCOOP and STACK, our single-rig program in the Williston Basin continues to deliver some very impressive results along the Nesson Anticline. In fact, production in the Williston hit an all-time high for us in the quarter. And there is a slide in the @NFX if you would likely find some of this of interest. 
Let's briefly cover our first quarter results. Our domestic production in the first quarter was above the midpoint of guidance by about 500,000 barrels at 13.5 million barrels oil equivalent. Total company production was 15.2 million  barrels of oil equivalent, of which 46% was oil and nearly 2/3 liquids.  
Excluding several items listed in our release, our net loss for the quarter would have been $16 million or $0.09 per share on revenues of $284 million.  Our net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $170 million. We recently permitized the remainder of our hedges that were not previously permitized. These actions essentially locked in a gain of about $14 per barrel.  We entered into the new swap positions in the second half of '16 and in the first half of '17 on a like volume of oil. These swaps were done in the low to mid-40s per barrel.  And considering the $14 per barrel gain on the permitized volumes and the new swaps, we will essentially receive revenues during these periods based on a WTI price of about $55 per barrel. There is an illustration in @NFX that helps explain these recent derivative transactions.
Let's spend the remainder of our call today on the operating plans for the remainder of the year and the significant progress we are making to drill and complete more efficient wells. 
As previously mentioned, our first quarter 2016 volumes were stronger than expected, led by the Williston and Anadarko Basins. As a result, we today raised our full year expectations by about 1 million barrels of oil equivalent. 
Our new guidance for 2016 domestic production is 50 million to 52 million barrels of oil equivalent. In China, our Pearl field continues to produce near peak rates, and the expected natural decline has been slower to materialize than expected.  We also increased our expectations for China production by about 200,000 barrels for the year due to discontinued outperformance of the Pearl field.  China lifting are expected to total 4.5 million barrels of oil equivalent, and no significant new investments are planned.
Our capital budget for the year remains $625 million to $675 million. As we said at the beginning of the year, our investments are heavily weighted to the first half of the year. We entered 2016 with 9 frac spreads running in the Anadarko Basin. This flurry of activity has tapered, and we are running less than half the spreads today and are on schedule with our drilling and completion program for 2016. 
Included in our capital plans for this year are 2 new infill spacing pilots in STACK. Due to the efficiency gains we're delivering in the Anadarko Basin, we were able to slot this into our current budget outlook of $625 million to $675 million.  We are planning to drill infill wells from 2 separate pads to test greater well densities. In addition, we are participating in at least one outside-operated spacing pilots in STACK. Gathering early infill spacing pilot data is key to planning the optimal full field development. We expect that these pilots will commence production late this year and add nearly 1 million barrels of oil equivalent of incremental volumes in 2017.
Our SCOOP program is in development and continues to deliver very strong results. We're running 2 rigs in active development. Year-to-date, we have commenced production from a new SCOOP oil pad; and the 5 wells achieved average rates of nearly 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day each, of which 80% was liquids. 
In the Springer Play, we turned a new well to sales of approximately 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 81% was oil and 90% was liquid. 
In STACK, we're running 3 rigs today and have drilled more than 100 wells to date or about 1/4 of industry's 400 wells. Our net daily production for the Anadarko Basin is nearly 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day currently. 
We remain very encouraged after more than 4 years of high activity in the Anadarko Basin and are seeing very consistent performance from our wells. Of the 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 35% is black oil. This is what we modeled years ago, and it still holding true. 
With high levels of activity today in the Anadarko Basin, we have significant outside interest in wells drilled by our peers. Some of these wells have large IPs with large natural gas cuts. This outside interest will cause our overall commodity mix to change 1% or 2% from quarter-to-quarter. But understand that our operating results in the basin are in line with our previous forecast and have been very consistent. 
I'll also add that across our 315,000-acre position, from that idea that I talked about 5 years ago and the work from the team, our all-in cost cumulatively is less than $2,000 per acre, exciting asset and core foundational asset that'll serve Newfield and our shareholders well for many years to come.
As we drill to hold our acreage by production across this 3,000-plus square-mile area, we will continue to see well results at or above our type curve in all portions of the field.  Our HBP machine in STACK has been focused primarily in the northern portion of our acreage over the last 6 months. There are a couple of very important slides in @NFX today. 
The first is at Slide #7, which shows the 24 wells that we've drilled to the north and northeast, 12 of which are new wells. We've provided 30-, 60- and 90-day average production rates for all of these wells and part of the 24 north wells against our type curve on Slide 9. We're highly encouraged that these wells are performing above our 950 MBoe type curve, with production out through 120 days.
Let's talk a little history here before moving on. The concept for STACK in our early leasing program was conceived more than 5 years ago. Since that time, we've assembled in excess of 225,000 net acres in the STACK play. The quality technical work that was done to get us started has morphed into one of the most active plays in North America. And we have peer companies, well-respected peer companies active across the area as well. I'd like to recognize our talented technical team for outlining what they believed at the time to be a commercially viable oil window in STACK. The fact that we are drilling wells on the northern edge of this defined boundary and are seeing those wells perform above our average type curve is fantastic news. That's a product of outstanding technical work.  Although history tells us there will be variability in individual well results over vast area where all hydrocarbon phases are present, we are seeing type curve or better results in all areas today.
We're early in optimizing our completion practices and tailoring our completion cocktails to best match the reservoir and phase changes across the acreage. But you will notice better 60- and 90-day average rates for the newer batch of wells. We're encouraged with our results, and we are making great strides to drive down well cost and improve the outlook for future rates of return. 
Let's talk about our gains and drilling efficiencies and how we continue to lead the industry. On Slide 8, we show the progression of our days to depth for a 10,000-foot super extended laterals. Here are some fun facts. The Helen, our most recent best-in-class SXL well in STACK, was drilled in 8 days and is among the best SXL wells drilled in our portfolio and likely in the industry.  We look forward to sharing completed well costs and production data from Helen once we have it. 
Year-to-date, our SXL wells in STACK are being drilled at an average time of 17 days. Our peers' and outside-operated wells where we have the direct working interest are averaging about 30 days for a comparable well. That's about twice our average days to depth in 2016. 
We get lots of questions on 5,000-foot laterals versus 10,000-foot laterals and which one is better. Actually, we enjoy the question and can easily answer it with a single word, scoreboard. When our team can drill an SXL well in half the time of our peers and hold 2 sections in HBP mode, the answer is pretty obvious to us. Our cost per completed foot is about $690 compared to the best short laterals we can find, at about $750 per foot. 
We have seen the economic benefits of SXL wells in the Eagle Ford, the Williston Basin, the Granite Wash, the Arkoma and in SCOOP. The same benefits are carrying through in STACK, when we compare wells drilled and completed similarly.  That said, we've drilled a handful of short laterals today on single-section leases, and we have about 20 planned for the year. We'll have a more detailed update later this year regarding XL performance. 
Our wells in STACK today are far more efficient, and our economics continue to improve. Our efficiency gains are coming through a combination of reduced drilling days, more efficient completion practices, optimized proppant loads and reduced service costs. Importantly, we estimate that more than half our cost reductions will be sustainable when oil prices strengthen and service cost ultimately increase.
There are several factors that combine to drill an SXL well in 8 to 10 days. In short, we are effectively managing subsurface hazards and rapidly solving problems when they do arise. 
Common challenges in STACK include lost circulation, hole stability and the need for an additional casing string on portions of our acreage to the north and west. We have made significant improvements in our mud systems and wellbore hydraulics, and we are getting our wells down faster and more cost-effectively. Each well we drill is treated as a specific project, and it receives its own specific design. This attention to every detail has led to our superior results.
Our best-in-class SXL well, the Vickie, has recently been drilled and completed for about $690 per gross completed interval for a completed well cost with facilities included of about $6.9 million. The Vickie well is called out on Slide 6 and compares very favorably to the $7.3 million well budgeted for 2016.
Our team has been applying much of the cost savings from drilling back into completions, as we continue to seek the most optimal design for future development. It is important to understand that we are not simply trying to maximize an IP rate from the first well in a section. We are testing various proppant loads and sand sizes along with fluid types and volumes to arrive at the best design for our long-term development plan. Additionally, we continue to drill our HBP wells along lease line boundaries as opposed to targeting the initial well on localized DSU sweet spots for maximum IP and headline results. We are in this for the long term, and we want to ensure that we preserve the most efficient full field development for the future. 
With the recent modifications, we are today pumping about 60% more proppant for $300,000 less in total cost. In addition to simply having lower sand and pressure pumping cost, we have effectively employed zipper fracs, toe sleeves, dissolvable plugs, diverters, tighter stage pacing and perforations, higher pumping concentrations and use both cross-linked and hybrid fracture stimulations. That's a mouthful. 
In short, we're optimizing every conceivable variable to arrive at the best answer to create the most long-term value for our shareholders as we develop this premier asset. 
One thing, however, is becoming obvious from our completion trials to date. Higher proppant loads are making a positive impact on our production rates and EURs. 
2 years ago, we were pumping less than 1,000 pounds per foot. Last year's design was about 1,500 pounds per foot on average and included the recent JR Barton completion on Slide 6.  Our most recent designs include up to 2,400 pounds per foot and are just cleaning up now following recent fracture stimulation.  We're optimizing early flow to protect the reservoir and maximize liquids recovery.  We will have more to share with you on these developments later this year. 
We're very encouraged by the strong performance and the consistency we are seeing in our wells after more than 4 years of intense drilling activity. We have drilled far more wells in this play than any other operator. We have the experience, the learning curve and the team in place to continue leading this exciting development. We know that there are significant efficiencies still to be captured and are highly confident in our ability to deliver future SXL development wells for less than $6 million, including facilities.
That concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We appreciate your interest in our company and your investment in Newfield Exploration. I'm confident that our near-term business plan is sound and that we are executing well along a path that will make us a better, more efficient and profitable company in the future.

That's not our game. We're about optimizing the development and maximizing net present value. So everything we do is set in that context.  We would expect that first priority get the acreage HBP. We've been clear. We've got a drilling advantage. We protect 2 sections with every well. Long laterals have been the answer in every one of these major plays that we've been in, if you're about intermediate and long-term value. If you're playing the game to capture ground and flip it, then you tell different stories. And I think some of you guys have been confused by people that are nothing but interlopers. I'll be glad when interlopers are gone and we're left with solid companies that are playing for the long term. We're almost there. It's a different game. This is a big-boy game, and the time for those guys is fast getting into the rearview mirror. So as far as performance uplift, 5 to 10. We're going to drill the 20 wells. We'll do our workman-like manner in terms of the technical analysis, and we'll show you the results. All the work that we've done to date shows about a 1.8 to 2 factor when you think about the 5,000 foot versus the 10,000 foot. I would put that as too close to call, and then in our math, the cost advantage and the time advantage translates to return advantage. So thanks for giving me a moment to spout a bit off a diatribe. But we feel pretty strong that we're doing the right thing. As far as the number of zones, we've said consistently since the beginning of the play that we thought there were probably 3 to 5 horizons of interest. I think we still believe that today. Devon -- I didn't get a chance to see their information. You said they're talking about 5 in the Meramec. Are you asking can I see that there could be 5 in the Meramec? The answer is yes. The Osage, we know is  oil saturated from the cores that we got early in the exploitation -- exploration phase, assessment phase, if you will, of the play that it's oil saturated. We haven't drilled any wells there, but clearly, it's a target horizon that you would expect to be producible. And I expect we and the industry will find some time to test that. And of course, the Woodford has already been proven. So there is a lot of work yet to be done to actually refine the vertical dimension of how tightly you can stack the individual layers. But I expect that we'll gather a lot of data, we and the industry, over the next couple of years and give you that answer. I know the early pilots are generally in 150- to 175-foot range, if I'm recollecting correctly in terms of offset vertical dimension that the companies are testing. And I think our early tests will be in line with that testing assumption as well. So I think that's -- hopefully, that covers all 3 of your questions."

So the first thing is, what we've said is that we've had amazing consistency across the acreage. That's the first thing, and that's true. We don't see huge variability. In fact, I think we've said the last 2 to 3 years that in terms of when you look at P10/P90 ratios as a description of the distribution, this play from right out of the chute, the first 10 wells to date, has one of the tightest P10/P90 ratios of anything that we've participated in or evaluated. That's first thing.  There is a difference by vintage on the wells. And again, we've been very methodical about how we've approached things. The first suite of wells in the assessment phase drilled across the acreage we completed identically. So you can go back in the record 2 or 3 years ago and you can see that we talked about that on a number of the calls. We did that for the very reason that you asked: Did we see any material geologic variability as we moved across the acreage. And the conclusion was no. And now we've moved into optimizing completion. So completion is the first phase of the easy wins, if you will. We're taking the perf clusters from 125 feet down to 50 to 75, and I think we've tested as low as 35, I believe, if my memory serves me right. That's all been done over the last 2, 2.5 years. And the fact that we pushed from 125 to 75 to 50 tells you that we were seeing positive economic uplift, and we've now incorporated that into the design. And then Gary, John, George and our drilling completion teams today are working on proppant load, and that's kind of been the focus. And again, we took measurable, methodical steps across large batches of wells. Now it's hard for you to diagnose this externally, and no, we're not going to give the road map out to everybody out there. But we know which wells we've done what work on. And we can see -- we've got a group of 1,000 pound-per-foot wells, and we got 1,500 pound-per-foot wells, and we got 2,400 pound-per-foot wells. And that's all about establishing what the optimal completion recipe is going to be and optimizing on the economics. And I think the sincerest expression of all of those results is the question we continue to get asked from a lot of you guys. We've held with the 950 MBoe type curve, but over the last -- course of the last 1 year, 1.5 years, all the wells have continued to track and plot above the type curve, and that's after more than 100 wells have been drilled and completed. That is nothing short of phenomenal. So for those that want to understand the play and see it as it is, it's not too hard. For those that want to tell other stories, they're running out of bullets. Their guns are almost empty."

So we'll test it. Industry will test it. We've got good wells right up to that area, but it is a -- less than 5% of the total acreage block is represented in that eastern area on a net basis.

I think the easiest way for you to see what we see in terms of looking into the future and dreaming a little bit is the Williston Basin is a great example. Our team is regularly drilling and completing and equipping wells in the Williston Basin at similar depths 10,000-foot laterals today for less than $5 million.  So if you want an example of what the team does, team Newfield and team Newfield's processes, there you go. And we're going to translate those over to the STACK play as we move into development. And we frankly believe we'll be transitioning into development in 2017. So that road ahead is not as far into the future as it was when we started. And then I touched on the call about not going out and specifically targeting zones that we believe might have the highest productivity or this splashiest well result. We're actually continuing to stay very disciplined and drilling our wells just inside leased lines. And that's part of our HBP mode. It leaves all of the ground. I meant to make this point in Kim's earlier question. When we get this thing HBP-ed, we're going to have data across the entire footprint, and we'll have a couple of miles between these wells that has been untouched. So when we decide what the optimal development plan is going forward, we've got virgin ground. And a lot of times, these resource plays when you don't have large contiguous positions like we have here and able to control large facets of ground that you're not able to efficiently develop in that regard. So I think this play has the potential of being the best and most efficient development that industry has delivered yet, and Newfield's going to be right up to the front of that line, where we should be."

Four of the 5 are in the top shortlist of all-time wells drilled in the Arkoma -- I mean, in the top 10. So that tells you something. The other one is just outside of the top 20. I think the composite production from those 5 wells spread out over that 4- or 5-month time frame was in excess of 60 million cubic feet a day. So to give you a feel for that, I think we've drilled out there historically 300-plus wells. I think we had 150 million gross production back at the beginning of 2015. We drilled 5 wells and added over 50 million cubic feet a day. And the best part of it is those wells were drilled and completed in less than half the time of the best well that was drilled 5 years previously. So pretty exciting. And again, it demonstrates the learning organization and that team and process matter. And so we proved the concept. We know there's a lot of value in the Arkoma. We love having a 170,000-acre HBP asset there. And in the right place and time when it make sense then we've got a gas option, we'll exercise it."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2016 is well underway, and it's hard to believe that we're already through the first quarter. Although oil prices have strengthened some since we last gathered in this call in February, t",2831,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 
2016 is well underway, and it's hard to believe that we're already through the first quarter. Although oil prices have strengthened some since we last gathered in this call in February, these still remain challenging times. Our near-term business plan was designed to meet both today's challenges and tomorrow's opportunities, and the key objectives that we laid out in our last calls still hold.  The plan was designed to preserve the health of the company and ensure that we are positioned to not only weather 2016 but to emerge with improved margins and a readiness to compete and win when commodity prices ultimately strengthened.
Our 2016 business plan has 4-key objectives, and I'll provide a brief progress report on each before covering our financial and operating results.
Our first priority is to preserve liquidity. We have taken several decisive steps to ensure our balance sheet remains strong. We issued equity in February to ensure that we had the capital to navigate today's challenges and to bridge to 2018 when we expect to be in full field development in STACK. 
We greatly reduced our 2016 activity levels and closely aligned capital investments with cash flow expectations. We high-graded our investments, and the Anadarko Basin is receiving a majority of our capital today. And we hedged aggressively in late 2014 and recently modified those positions to capture financial gains and to take advantage of recent strength in oil prices.
Our second priority is the HBP STACK. It's imperative that we hold our STACK acreage by production and continue to drive down cost as we push rapidly toward full field development. We're making great strides and progress today, as we HBP the north and northeast portions of our STACK acreage, and we remain highly encouraged with the consistency of our well results. By year end, we expect to be about 65% held by production.
Our third priority, reduce operating expenses and preserve margins. We have taken significant steps over the last year to improve our cost structure. Our first quarter domestically lease operating expense was down nearly 40% year-over-year on a per-BOE basis, and we expect to reduce our full year 2016 G&A by nearly $50 million when compared to last year, excluding onetime cost. 
We're focused on margin improvement today across the company. And fourth, we've launched a formal process to sell additional nonstrategic assets. We've engaged several parties on our behalf and expect to have additional information to share with you later this year. With the continued success we're having in the Anadarko Basin, we still believe that the addition of asset sales are in the best interest of our shareholder, despite the recent move in oil prices and the strength of our balance sheet.
Proceeds from the additional sales will refine our portfolio, improve our financial flexibility, manage short-term borrowings, allow for the capture of opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions and/or accelerate our Anadarko Basin program.  
We are executing well and delivering on our business plan throughout the organization today. In yesterday's release, you will see we beat the midpoint of our guidance by about 500,000 barrels equivalent, and we've raised our production estimate for the year by about 1 million barrels.  It's important to note the gas production in our guidance is unchanged, and the increase was related to liquids production. 
Our production beat in the quarter was attributed to outperformance in both of the Anadarko Basin and in the Williston Basin. Although we talked most frequently about SCOOP and STACK, our single-rig program in the Williston Basin continues to deliver some very impressive results along the Nesson Anticline. In fact, production in the Williston hit an all-time high for us in the quarter. And there is a slide in the @NFX if you would likely find some of this of interest. 
Let's briefly cover our first quarter results. Our domestic production in the first quarter was above the midpoint of guidance by about 500,000 barrels at 13.5 million barrels oil equivalent. Total company production was 15.2 million  barrels of oil equivalent, of which 46% was oil and nearly 2/3 liquids.  
Excluding several items listed in our release, our net loss for the quarter would have been $16 million or $0.09 per share on revenues of $284 million.  Our net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $170 million. We recently permitized the remainder of our hedges that were not previously permitized. These actions essentially locked in a gain of about $14 per barrel.  We entered into the new swap positions in the second half of '16 and in the first half of '17 on a like volume of oil. These swaps were done in the low to mid-40s per barrel.  And considering the $14 per barrel gain on the permitized volumes and the new swaps, we will essentially receive revenues during these periods based on a WTI price of about $55 per barrel. There is an illustration in @NFX that helps explain these recent derivative transactions.
Let's spend the remainder of our call today on the operating plans for the remainder of the year and the significant progress we are making to drill and complete more efficient wells. 
As previously mentioned, our first quarter 2016 volumes were stronger than expected, led by the Williston and Anadarko Basins. As a result, we today raised our full year expectations by about 1 million barrels of oil equivalent. 
Our new guidance for 2016 domestic production is 50 million to 52 million barrels of oil equivalent. In China, our Pearl field continues to produce near peak rates, and the expected natural decline has been slower to materialize than expected.  We also increased our expectations for China production by about 200,000 barrels for the year due to discontinued outperformance of the Pearl field.  China lifting are expected to total 4.5 million barrels of oil equivalent, and no significant new investments are planned.
Our capital budget for the year remains $625 million to $675 million. As we said at the beginning of the year, our investments are heavily weighted to the first half of the year. We entered 2016 with 9 frac spreads running in the Anadarko Basin. This flurry of activity has tapered, and we are running less than half the spreads today and are on schedule with our drilling and completion program for 2016. 
Included in our capital plans for this year are 2 new infill spacing pilots in STACK. Due to the efficiency gains we're delivering in the Anadarko Basin, we were able to slot this into our current budget outlook of $625 million to $675 million.  We are planning to drill infill wells from 2 separate pads to test greater well densities. In addition, we are participating in at least one outside-operated spacing pilots in STACK. Gathering early infill spacing pilot data is key to planning the optimal full field development. We expect that these pilots will commence production late this year and add nearly 1 million barrels of oil equivalent of incremental volumes in 2017.
Our SCOOP program is in development and continues to deliver very strong results. We're running 2 rigs in active development. Year-to-date, we have commenced production from a new SCOOP oil pad; and the 5 wells achieved average rates of nearly 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day each, of which 80% was liquids. 
In the Springer Play, we turned a new well to sales of approximately 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 81% was oil and 90% was liquid. 
In STACK, we're running 3 rigs today and have drilled more than 100 wells to date or about 1/4 of industry's 400 wells. Our net daily production for the Anadarko Basin is nearly 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day currently. 
We remain very encouraged after more than 4 years of high activity in the Anadarko Basin and are seeing very consistent performance from our wells. Of the 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 35% is black oil. This is what we modeled years ago, and it still holding true. 
With high levels of activity today in the Anadarko Basin, we have significant outside interest in wells drilled by our peers. Some of these wells have large IPs with large natural gas cuts. This outside interest will cause our overall commodity mix to change 1% or 2% from quarter-to-quarter. But understand that our operating results in the basin are in line with our previous forecast and have been very consistent. 
I'll also add that across our 315,000-acre position, from that idea that I talked about 5 years ago and the work from the team, our all-in cost cumulatively is less than $2,000 per acre, exciting asset and core foundational asset that'll serve Newfield and our shareholders well for many years to come.
As we drill to hold our acreage by production across this 3,000-plus square-mile area, we will continue to see well results at or above our type curve in all portions of the field.  Our HBP machine in STACK has been focused primarily in the northern portion of our acreage over the last 6 months. There are a couple of very important slides in @NFX today. 
The first is at Slide #7, which shows the 24 wells that we've drilled to the north and northeast, 12 of which are new wells. We've provided 30-, 60- and 90-day average production rates for all of these wells and part of the 24 north wells against our type curve on Slide 9. We're highly encouraged that these wells are performing above our 950 MBoe type curve, with production out through 120 days.
Let's talk a little history here before moving on. The concept for STACK in our early leasing program was conceived more than 5 years ago. Since that time, we've assembled in excess of 225,000 net acres in the STACK play. The quality technical work that was done to get us started has morphed into one of the most active plays in North America. And we have peer companies, well-respected peer companies active across the area as well. I'd like to recognize our talented technical team for outlining what they believed at the time to be a commercially viable oil window in STACK. The fact that we are drilling wells on the northern edge of this defined boundary and are seeing those wells perform above our average type curve is fantastic news. That's a product of outstanding technical work.  Although history tells us there will be variability in individual well results over vast area where all hydrocarbon phases are present, we are seeing type curve or better results in all areas today.
We're early in optimizing our completion practices and tailoring our completion cocktails to best match the reservoir and phase changes across the acreage. But you will notice better 60- and 90-day average rates for the newer batch of wells. We're encouraged with our results, and we are making great strides to drive down well cost and improve the outlook for future rates of return. 
Let's talk about our gains and drilling efficiencies and how we continue to lead the industry. On Slide 8, we show the progression of our days to depth for a 10,000-foot super extended laterals. Here are some fun facts. The Helen, our most recent best-in-class SXL well in STACK, was drilled in 8 days and is among the best SXL wells drilled in our portfolio and likely in the industry.  We look forward to sharing completed well costs and production data from Helen once we have it. 
Year-to-date, our SXL wells in STACK are being drilled at an average time of 17 days. Our peers' and outside-operated wells where we have the direct working interest are averaging about 30 days for a comparable well. That's about twice our average days to depth in 2016. 
We get lots of questions on 5,000-foot laterals versus 10,000-foot laterals and which one is better. Actually, we enjoy the question and can easily answer it with a single word, scoreboard. When our team can drill an SXL well in half the time of our peers and hold 2 sections in HBP mode, the answer is pretty obvious to us. Our cost per completed foot is about $690 compared to the best short laterals we can find, at about $750 per foot. 
We have seen the economic benefits of SXL wells in the Eagle Ford, the Williston Basin, the Granite Wash, the Arkoma and in SCOOP. The same benefits are carrying through in STACK, when we compare wells drilled and completed similarly.  That said, we've drilled a handful of short laterals today on single-section leases, and we have about 20 planned for the year. We'll have a more detailed update later this year regarding XL performance. 
Our wells in STACK today are far more efficient, and our economics continue to improve. Our efficiency gains are coming through a combination of reduced drilling days, more efficient completion practices, optimized proppant loads and reduced service costs. Importantly, we estimate that more than half our cost reductions will be sustainable when oil prices strengthen and service cost ultimately increase.
There are several factors that combine to drill an SXL well in 8 to 10 days. In short, we are effectively managing subsurface hazards and rapidly solving problems when they do arise. 
Common challenges in STACK include lost circulation, hole stability and the need for an additional casing string on portions of our acreage to the north and west. We have made significant improvements in our mud systems and wellbore hydraulics, and we are getting our wells down faster and more cost-effectively. Each well we drill is treated as a specific project, and it receives its own specific design. This attention to every detail has led to our superior results.
Our best-in-class SXL well, the Vickie, has recently been drilled and completed for about $690 per gross completed interval for a completed well cost with facilities included of about $6.9 million. The Vickie well is called out on Slide 6 and compares very favorably to the $7.3 million well budgeted for 2016.
Our team has been applying much of the cost savings from drilling back into completions, as we continue to seek the most optimal design for future development. It is important to understand that we are not simply trying to maximize an IP rate from the first well in a section. We are testing various proppant loads and sand sizes along with fluid types and volumes to arrive at the best design for our long-term development plan. Additionally, we continue to drill our HBP wells along lease line boundaries as opposed to targeting the initial well on localized DSU sweet spots for maximum IP and headline results. We are in this for the long term, and we want to ensure that we preserve the most efficient full field development for the future. 
With the recent modifications, we are today pumping about 60% more proppant for $300,000 less in total cost. In addition to simply having lower sand and pressure pumping cost, we have effectively employed zipper fracs, toe sleeves, dissolvable plugs, diverters, tighter stage pacing and perforations, higher pumping concentrations and use both cross-linked and hybrid fracture stimulations. That's a mouthful. 
In short, we're optimizing every conceivable variable to arrive at the best answer to create the most long-term value for our shareholders as we develop this premier asset. 
One thing, however, is becoming obvious from our completion trials to date. Higher proppant loads are making a positive impact on our production rates and EURs. 
2 years ago, we were pumping less than 1,000 pounds per foot. Last year's design was about 1,500 pounds per foot on average and included the recent JR Barton completion on Slide 6.  Our most recent designs include up to 2,400 pounds per foot and are just cleaning up now following recent fracture stimulation.  We're optimizing early flow to protect the reservoir and maximize liquids recovery.  We will have more to share with you on these developments later this year. 
We're very encouraged by the strong performance and the consistency we are seeing in our wells after more than 4 years of intense drilling activity. We have drilled far more wells in this play than any other operator. We have the experience, the learning curve and the team in place to continue leading this exciting development. We know that there are significant efficiencies still to be captured and are highly confident in our ability to deliver future SXL development wells for less than $6 million, including facilities.
That concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We appreciate your interest in our company and your investment in Newfield Exploration. I'm confident that our near-term business plan is sound and that we are executing well along a path that will make us a better, more efficient and profitable company in the future.

I'll be glad when interlopers are gone and we're left with solid companies that are playing for the long term. We're almost there. It's a different game. This is a big-boy game, and the time for those guys is fast getting into the rearview mirror. So as far as performance uplift, 5 to 10. We're going to drill the 20 wells. We'll do our workman-like manner in terms of the technical analysis, and we'll show you the results. All the work that we've done to date shows about a 1.8 to 2 factor when you think about the 5,000 foot versus the 10,000 foot. I would put that as too close to call, and then in our math, the cost advantage and the time advantage translates to return advantage. So thanks for giving me a moment to spout a bit off a diatribe. But we feel pretty strong that we're doing the right thing. As far as the number of zones, we've said consistently since the beginning of the play that we thought there were probably 3 to 5 horizons of interest. I think we still believe that today. Devon -- I didn't get a chance to see their information. You said they're talking about 5 in the Meramec. Are you asking can I see that there could be 5 in the Meramec? The answer is yes. The Osage, we know is  oil saturated from the cores that we got early in the exploitation -- exploration phase, assessment phase, if you will, of the play that it's oil saturated. We haven't drilled any wells there, but clearly, it's a target horizon that you would expect to be producible. And I expect we and the industry will find some time to test that. And of course, the Woodford has already been proven. So there is a lot of work yet to be done to actually refine the vertical dimension of how tightly you can stack the individual layers. But I expect that we'll gather a lot of data, we and the industry, over the next couple of years and give you that answer. I know the early pilots are generally in 150- to 175-foot range, if I'm recollecting correctly in terms of offset vertical dimension that the companies are testing. And I think our early tests will be in line with that testing assumption as well. So I think that's -- hopefully, that covers all 3 of your questions."

So that really is -- it gives you kind of a footprint of how the acreage position was built. So when we're HBP-ing, we're taking into account the remaining term on leases. And generally, each of the areas that we've moved into were picked up sequentially after those early test results. So we've driven mostly by the remaining term on the leases at this stage. As the HBP percentage climbs and we transition the development, then we'll be making those decisions on where the highest returns and the best development areas are and put those at the front of the line."

Not to beat a dead horse, but there've been a couple of questions on the variation of results through the acreage.

But is there any way that you can do any kind of an apples-to-apples comparison to kind of dissect the geology? And when you're in a full develop -- well, you are in development mode.

So the first thing is, what we've said is that we've had amazing consistency across the acreage. That's the first thing, and that's true. We don't see huge variability. In fact, I think we've said the last 2 to 3 years that in terms of when you look at P10/P90 ratios as a description of the distribution, this play from right out of the chute, the first 10 wells to date, has one of the tightest P10/P90 ratios of anything that we've participated in or evaluated. That's first thing.  There is a difference by vintage on the wells. And again, we've been very methodical about how we've approached things. The first suite of wells in the assessment phase drilled across the acreage we completed identically. So you can go back in the record 2 or 3 years ago and you can see that we talked about that on a number of the calls. We did that for the very reason that you asked: Did we see any material geologic variability as we moved across the acreage. And the conclusion was no. And now we've moved into optimizing completion. So completion is the first phase of the easy wins, if you will. We're taking the perf clusters from 125 feet down to 50 to 75, and I think we've tested as low as 35, I believe, if my memory serves me right. That's all been done over the last 2, 2.5 years. And the fact that we pushed from 125 to 75 to 50 tells you that we were seeing positive economic uplift, and we've now incorporated that into the design. And then Gary, John, George and our drilling completion teams today are working on proppant load, and that's kind of been the focus. And again, we took measurable, methodical steps across large batches of wells. Now it's hard for you to diagnose this externally, and no, we're not going to give the road map out to everybody out there. But we know which wells we've done what work on. And we can see -- we've got a group of 1,000 pound-per-foot wells, and we got 1,500 pound-per-foot wells, and we got 2,400 pound-per-foot wells. And that's all about establishing what the optimal completion recipe is going to be and optimizing on the economics. And I think the sincerest expression of all of those results is the question we continue to get asked from a lot of you guys. We've held with the 950 MBoe type curve, but over the last -- course of the last 1 year, 1.5 years, all the wells have continued to track and plot above the type curve, and that's after more than 100 wells have been drilled and completed. That is nothing short of phenomenal. So for those that want to understand the play and see it as it is, it's not too hard. For those that want to tell other stories, they're running out of bullets. Their guns are almost empty."

I think that you can probably see the logic of waiting to test that later in the program as we get our drilling efficiencies down because the way you make that area work are by having the most efficient, lowest-cost wells. So we'll test it. Industry will test it. We've got good wells right up to that area, but it is a -- less than 5% of the total acreage block is represented in that eastern area on a net basis.

So if somebody's doing something novel and unique and creative that improves the returns, we'll adopt it tomorrow. Okay, that's first thing. I think the easiest way for you to see what we see in terms of looking into the future and dreaming a little bit is the Williston Basin is a great example. Our team is regularly drilling and completing and equipping wells in the Williston Basin at similar depths 10,000-foot laterals today for less than $5 million.  So if you want an example of what the team does, team Newfield and team Newfield's processes, there you go. And we're going to translate those over to the STACK play as we move into development. And we frankly believe we'll be transitioning into development in 2017. So that road ahead is not as far into the future as it was when we started. And then I touched on the call about not going out and specifically targeting zones that we believe might have the highest productivity or this splashiest well result. We're actually continuing to stay very disciplined and drilling our wells just inside leased lines. And that's part of our HBP mode. It leaves all of the ground. I meant to make this point in Kim's earlier question. When we get this thing HBP-ed, we're going to have data across the entire footprint, and we'll have a couple of miles between these wells that has been untouched. So when we decide what the optimal development plan is going forward, we've got virgin ground. And a lot of times, these resource plays when you don't have large contiguous positions like we have here and able to control large facets of ground that you're not able to efficiently develop in that regard. So I think this play has the potential of being the best and most efficient development that industry has delivered yet, and Newfield's going to be right up to the front of that line, where we should be."

Four of the 5 are in the top shortlist of all-time wells drilled in the Arkoma -- I mean, in the top 10. So that tells you something. The other one is just outside of the top 20. I think the composite production from those 5 wells spread out over that 4- or 5-month time frame was in excess of 60 million cubic feet a day. So to give you a feel for that, I think we've drilled out there historically 300-plus wells. I think we had 150 million gross production back at the beginning of 2015. We drilled 5 wells and added over 50 million cubic feet a day. And the best part of it is those wells were drilled and completed in less than half the time of the best well that was drilled 5 years previously. So pretty exciting.

Upon closing, proceeds from the sales will replenish our cash balance and we'll be available to fund our acceleration of activities in the Anadarko Basin at the right time. Newfield continues to high grade its asset base.
Well, it's certainly been a very busy summer. Here at home, we work duly diligence on our recent STACK acquisition, which we have now successfully closed. And several weeks ago, we issued an interim update released to raise our production guidance and highlight the continued advancement we are making as we HBP our primary STACK position. 
In addition to the energy conference scheduled over the last 2 months, which was quite heavy, we were able to catch up with many of you on the road and various discussions along the way. We didn't get the chance to see you recently, simply know that our near term objectives are very da well-defined. 
Number one, HBP our STACK play, number two, maintain us from balance sheet; number three, sell our that strategic asset; and four, ready the organization for the timely acceleration of our top tier development in SCOOP and STACK and the commodity prices provide the right signals. 
Certainly, proceeds from today's announced asset sale give us this flexibility. We continue to deliver outstanding results and our performance is differentiating the Newfield story. Since we recently issued an interim update in last night's earnings release, and @NFX is full details, we will focus our call this morning on what's new and leave ample time at the end to address any specific questions that you have. 
So let's get started with a brief summary of our second quarter financial and operating results. Our domestic production in the second quarter was 13.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, and total company production was 15.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which, 45% was oil and 63% was liquids. 
This was slightly ahead of the projection we gave you in our June update in our interim update release. In the second quarter, we had a loss of $3.36 per share, which included the impact of the ceiling test write-down derivative losses in G&A expenses associated with our restructuring of the organization. Excluding these items, net income for the second quarter was $64 million or $0.32 per share on revenues of $381 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $306 million and discretionary cash flow from operations was $228 million. 
Our interest rate cash flow compared very favorably to Street estimates for the second quarter. Our cash operating expenses for the second quarter stated on a unit-of-production basis were below guidance. Year-over-year, his operating expenses is down about 25%. This is a nice combination of high volumes and the great strides we've taken to improve our cost structures throughout the organization. 
Our domestic LOE for the second quarter was $3.37 per BOE, down another 4% from the first quarter of the year. As always, we updated our guidance numbers @NFX for the third quarter and full year.
For the second quarter, we had $12 million or $0.06 per share in one-time G&A expense associated with the restructuring and the continuing requirements we're making in our organization. We're estimating additional one-time cost of $18 million for the remainder of the year with about half expected in the third quarter.
Important to note are some very healthy trends under way in our consolidated structure. I guess, we're spending a moment to highlight a few of them for you. First, our lower LOE is being driven primarily by SCOOP and STACK. Our recurring lease operating expense in the Anadarko Basin is currently less than $2 per BOE, the lowest of all of our operating regions. Since this is our fastest growing region, we are seeing improving LOE cost on a consolidated basis. 
With the lion's share of our capital being allocated to Anadarko Basin, production on the remaining operating regions is on decline. As high cost areas naturally declined and our growth accelerates in the Anadarko Basin, we expect to see continued positive trends in our margins. Upon closing the sale of the Eagle Ford in South Texas assets, we should see further improvement in our consolidated cash operating costs on a unit-of-production basis. 
Our differentials to both NYMEX, WTI and Henry hub were improving as well. This is a direct result of the shift under way in our production mix by basin. Our lowest oil prices, the Uinta Basin; our highest is STACK and we expect continued favorable trends revenue per BOE going forward. 
Lastly, this list the positive trends is reduced SG&A expense, something that has been under way since the oil price guide in the second half of 2014. We moved early and aggressively to reposition Newfield for the prospect that oil could remain lower for longer. These tough decisions have paid off. We consolidated our Denver, Tulsa and Houston offices and realigned a more efficient to work force into the Woodlands. We anticipate that these steps will result in more than $60 million in annualized savings in 2017 forward or about 30% less SG&A expense than in 2014.
As I mentioned earlier, STACK is driving our improved oil price utilizations. Our new STACK oil pipeline is operational, and we have seen great market demand for this high-quality barrel. 
Our most recent batch sales have sold for NYMEX, WTI plus about $0.50 per barrel, so even after transportation expense we are netting NYMEX less than $2.50 per barrel. So potentially, all of our oil production in STACK should be fully on pipe during the third quarter.
On the balance sheet, we'll see we ended the quarter with $165 million cash on hand, both closing of our recent STACK acquisition. The proceeds from the sales of our Eagle Ford and conventional South Texas gas property will replenish our cash balance and more than bridge any deficit between our cash flow and planning investments in 2016 and 2017. 
Let's talk in more detail now about Anadarko Basin. STACK has certainly a great number of headlines recently and is one of a few select areas in the country that has seen an increasing rig count in the face of low commodity prices. Industry activity has led to the drilling of more than 500 STACK wells today with consistent results across a multicounty area. 
This expensive well-controlled, along with our more than 100-plus operated STACK wells today, provide us with heightened confidence in the size of this prolific resource. The depth and quality of our prospect inventory and its ability to drive corporate growth and production in reserves well into the future. 
Recent transactions in STACK have been extremely competitive and valuations for undeveloped acreage have been very strong. Our legacy acreage position in Kingfisher in Canadian County is now sandwiched between recent 1 billion-plus transactions and undeveloped acreage values of $15,000 to more than $20,000 per acre. 
In this business, there is significant value created by identifying an unseen opportunity and funding a large-scale resource play. Even post closing of our recent STACK acquisition, our oil and acreage cost in STACK totaled less than $3,000 per acre. Our low-entry  cost should be reduced our full cycle rates of return as we drove thousands of development wells over the next few decades. 
Where we top tier acreage position in STACK, and it's detailed on Page 9  @NFX, and there are several key things to note about this acreage. First, our acreage is third largely continuous and lends itself to a very efficient future development. In HBP mode, we've largely drilled lease line 9 peers purposely leaving nearly 2 miles of undeveloped ground between our initial wells. 
This will be ideal for proper intel spacing into the future. The contiguous nature of our acreage will allow for more than 2/3 of future wells to be Super Extended Laterals or SXLs. We have proven time and again that SXLs our the most efficient way to develop a resource plays. 
Second, we have exposure to all hydrocarbon phases across our acreage. As we transition from dry gas in the Canada field and move North and East you entered the oil window, which is what we originally targeted when our leasing began here 5 years ago. Today, we have solid representation to the West where we are confident that you EURs and gas content both moe significantly higher. For us, it's about rate of return. Well cost are lower in the oil window as gas content increases to the West, the EURs also rise. It all has a great ROR, and we are very fortunate to be represented across the entirety of the STACK play today. 
Oklahoma, more specifically, the Anadarko Basin, provides commodity, diversity adoption entity. Once HBP-ed, we will have the flexibility to target the right commodity at the right time. And third, we can now see the end of HBP and are planning for a full field development. We expect that our legacy acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties will be about 95% held by production by year-end 2016. For much of the last 12 months, we've been  primarily drilling the old acreage in the Northern and Eastern portions of our acreage. 
Although we have continued to see very consistent results, I can assure you we are looking forward to the hydrating and drilling locations during the future development phase. 
Newfield and others are pressing forward with several important pilots in STACK. We are all working to understand the optimal spacing for our future development wells. Fortunately, we show working interest in many of the pilots conducted today. We're accumulating a great deal of information from both our operating pilots and outside operated pilots where we own interest. 
By early next year, we should know a great deal more in terms of thinking about the development phase. 
At @NFX, we show recent 24-hour production results from our new raptor x pilot, which just commenced pilot. As you see on Page 10, this pilot includes 4 wells and is drilled due to test a 12 well spacing configuration, 2 layers in the Meramec, upper and lower. With wells drilling approximately 880 feet apart, the Raptor-X is showing strong early results. 24-hour production rates range between 1,400 and 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We are very encouraged with these early results, but as one of our completion engineers stated, bad things show fast, but good things take time. 
We will continue to watch these results over the next several months to draw meaningful conclusions to aid in our future development decisions. 
Our Chlouber Pilot is currently drilling with 5  intel wells spaced 1,050 feet apart to test a 10-well configuration in the Meramec, upper and lower, 2 horizons. Following the clobber, we will commence the Dorothy pilot in  the fourth quarter. The Dorothy will include 4 wells to test 5,000-foot laterals. 
Our planned spacing between wells will be 1,050 feet, simulating 5  wells in a single Meramec horizon. We expect to have information to share with you early next year. Today, we've released information on about 100 STACK wells. This is a very large sample. In fact, the largest in the industry. Our longest producing wells have now been online for 4 years or more. 
Newfield is founder the plays more operated well dated than any other player. And looking at the long-term production for our wells to date, we see a performance to our previous 950,000 BOE average type curve. Today, we raise the EUR on our average type curve by 15% to 1.1 million barrels [indiscernible]  Equivalent for our unbounded wells on our Legacy acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties. 
Let may be clear. This new average type curve is reflected of only our legacy acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties, which constitutes nearly 200,000 net acres where we have significant well control and long-term production data. 
Clearly, as we move to the west in, we expect that these areas will likely have a different hydrocarbon composition and likely a different type curve.  As we gather additional information from our operated wells here in 2017, we will share results and update you on our expectations. For now, there's lots of information from our peers who are having great success in, and we look forward to wells in this area very soon. 
Regardless of where we're drilling STACK, we know that targeting and geology will continue to be extremely important. In addition, completion design and size will contribute to EUR. But the simple issue for us will be how do we maximize our rate of return across the play for decades to come? We will continue to work the issues and navigate to the optimal completion. It's early. We don't have all the answers, but we're very encouraged about what  we have seen. 
We continue to make great strides operationally to improve efficiencies in both drilling and completion. We are firm believers today that larger profit and fluid volumes are both leading to higher EURs and improve production performance. Today's type curve increase is not merely a reflection of larger completions. We've only recently begun testing the larger sand and fluid concentrations, and we will continue to gather more information on the road ahead.
As we learn more about the sub-surface across a very large area, we will adjust our completion jobs to create the best recovery, highest returns and maximum net present value. Today, we're more proper than we deployed in 2014, early 2015. And testing a combination across length and hybrid fraction simulations. Our goal is pretty simple, arrive at the best rate of return for development and create the most long-term value for our shareholders. 
We know that there's significant efficiencies still to be captured and are highly confident in our ability to deliver additional efficiencies and development. In fact, a recent best-in-class well was drilled and completed for less than $6 million gross. We've been working behind-the-scenes over the last several years to prepare the full field development in STACK. Although many of these initiatives not benefit us today, they will be hugely instrumental in the future. 
Here are some of the things that we've been doing in STACK. We have carefully placed for our HBP wells. Our baseline pairs of HBP wells have left the acreage in the best decision for future drilling and development optimization of well placements. We have nearly 2 miles of virgin surface and sub-surface acreage between about 1/3 of our HBP wells drilled to date. We've made significant investments in an extensive water infrastructure network that will allow us to efficiently source, move, store and recycle water during our upcoming development operations. 
We work to develop on expandable natural gas gathering and processing system with our partner, Mark West. Newfield and Others are today considering a new open season on several proposed pipeline projects in STACK that will add 750 million cubic feet a day of takeaway in 2019 and beyond. We are confident that the infrastructure will be there to timely match our growth outlook from the basin.
Lastly, we're actively permitting for full field development and preparing for high levels of activity in the future. We expected about 2/3 per wells next year in STACK will be development wells drilled from common taps. We look forward to continuing to drive down cost, exploite operational efficiencies and improve our margins.
As mentioned earlier, we close in our recent acquisition of acreage in STACK. This was a great fit for us with about half of the acreage overlapping our legacy STACK, acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties and the remainder gives us a solid representation to the west. 
In addition to the Raptor-X pilot, we had 4 additional wells have recently commenced production. These wells are outlined on Page 9 in @NFX. The rates in these wells were impressive and range from about 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day to more than 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Each of these wells has strongly liquids rates between 80% and 90% of the total production. We have additional wells planned in these areas for later this year. 
With  strong results in STACK, we plan to increase activity in the second half of the year, and we will look for additional opportunities as we enter 2017. We today announced the revised production outlook in capital budget for 2016. We plan to keep the rig active under new STACK acreage and are quickening pace in days to is supporting us the ability to drill additional wells this year with the same rig count. 
The beginning of your plant called for the drilling of about 50 wells in STACK. Today, we estimate that we will drill more than 60 wells in 2016, including our pilots. 
Our new guidance for 2016 domestic production is 53 million to 54.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Recall that we've now raised guidance 3x due to superior operational results year-to-date, and we are now including volumes associated with our recent STACK acquisition and additional planned activity in the second half of 2016. 
In China, our peer field continues to produce near peak rates and expect the natural has been slower to materialize than forecast. We also increased our expectations for China due to discontinued outperformance. In fact, our guidance for 2016 is now about 700,000 barrels ahead of our beginning end-of-the-year projection. 
Our second half estimate for this year reflects our expectations for natural decline as well as the timing of liftings. Pearl continues to produce near peak rates over 25,000 barrels of oil per day. 
China liftings in 2016 expected to total about 5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Combined, total company production for 2016 is now expected to be 58 million to 59.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. 
Our production guidance today includes our Eagle Ford in South Texas properties through year end. Upon closing of these sales in late September, we plan to again  update our production guidance for the year.
Our capital budget for the year is now $700 million to $750 million. There's a helpful table in today's @NFX publication that reconciles our budget back to the original $625 million to $675 million beginning of year plan. 
Our increased capital budget is supported by an improved outlook for 2016 cash flow from our legacy production as well as anticipated 2016 investments in our recently acquired STACK assets. In addition, we now have better clarity around the asset sales, proceeds and timing. 
In current commodity prices, we expect that our capital spending will exceed cash flow by less than $100 million. Again, proceeds from the plant nonstrategic asset sales should be an effective tool in managing our debt levels and maintaining a superior capital structure.
So that includes our prepared remarks this morning. We appreciate your interest in our company and your investment for Newfield. I'm confident that our new near term business plan is sound and that we are executing well on the path and will make us better, more efficient and more profitable in the future. Operator, we're now ready to take the questions."

Again, year-to-date, both in terms of time, efficiency and cost. We are in a position now that we can see 95% of our legacy core position in Kingfisher and Canadian will be HBP-ed at year end, so it's rational to set up a program that's becoming increasingly development dominated. So relative to that program, we're saying that 2/3 estimate or somewhere around 2/3 of the wells we expect to drill in that acreage position in 2017 will be development wells. So to that end, that's the point that was being made there. Certainly, there are incremental efficiencies that will be gained in development. We've talked about the ability to shave somewhere around $750,000 to $1 million off of the wealth drill from where you've got infrastructure facilities in plays. We believe that still achievable if you sent them certainly something will realize that would translate to high returns on the well basis. There's outstanding information that we outlined I the call that none of us have at this point and that would be information that we pull takes some time over the next course of the next year or so. We and our other friends in the play will be studying the pilot data to optimize both Latimore distance between horizontals latterly and vertically, the vertical offset throughout the STACK productive interval. So those are the pieces of the puzzle that we won't completely know, but we have -- we have plenty of data that. We can enter now the early phase of development with confidence and with high expectations so the result. I think the last part of your question having to do with expectations per se. I would say because of those cost savings, the efficiencies, the shift to 2/3 of the spending on development wells and the ability then because HBP-ed, so highest return to lowest return areas, will be targeting the highest return areas of the play. And. that's the part that we referenced on the call that will be very, very exciting. So teams excited. Going to continue to execute this year, but the teams worked hard over the last 5 or 6 years to get ready for development, and I hope they're listening in right now because I know they're going to enjoy it and have fun. We're going to have fun reporting on the results."

We've been marching through this development step-by-step with very logical approach. First step, when you go back to it was a big step change was the reduction in spacing between . That was something we saw outstanding results a couple of years ago, and it led to the first increase in the type curve. Since that time, the team has been working on various combinations on fluid volumes and proppant and mix in terms of the fluid systems. And again, they've taken a very sequential methodical approach, so we can understand the data that's coming back to us. Again, focused on development, not the short term. so we're at the point today where we're testing higher fluid volumes and higher proppant volumes, and I indicated in the call commentary earlier that we're seeing some encouraging signs. But a lot of that higher volume and higher proppant is fairly recent data and not really a part of most of the work that's been done in terms of the 100-well data set that's been released. And then ultimately, we know from past experience in other plays that not every area in this play will probably have the same frac recipe. And so you'll end up with some areas that you think Option A is the best approach, other areas will be Recipe B and some other area might be Recipe C. But in general, I'm confident that we have the data and are acquiring the data we need to optimize and put it together is any color he wants to add."

We're moving to the point where I think people can share and help each other optimize. It's pretty -- going to be a pretty exciting time for the play going forward.

And I do apologize, Jeff, I don't remember at the densitometry to talk about it, but we have a history of we've kind of pioneered some of the horizontal or developments in shallow waters in Southeast Asia. We had operations in Malaysia where we developed several fields. The Pearl was our first orders of developments offshore in China, but I would as far as operating development. What I would tell you that reservoir simulators are a great tools and teams do a great job of putting all the data in. But every single field, every one that we develop in Asia outperformed the initial reservoir simulation. And there's numbers of reasons for it. It's fluid properties, quality of the reservoirs, it's the map not being perfect when you go vertical to horizontal comparison. So a whole host of those things, but I will tell you none of us are surprised it outperformed. But when you have a lot of really talented people and reservoir simulators telling you the answer is x, you can hope and pray that it's x plus. But until you see it demonstrated, it's an unknown. So we took a conservative posture in the front end. I think it's a prudent way that the team described it. And frankly, we benefited in Pearl by all of the things that you don't want to work in your favor. There's more oil in plays than probably wasn't tooted. We're getting a higher recovery efficiencies that you might otherwise have assumed. The rates have sustained themselves for far longer than any of the reservoir simulations sort of would have predicted. And today, with couple of years production data, the teams able to recalibrate the rest of the simulation. And we know at some point it will go and decline, but we want to enjoy this of production for just as long as we can. Cash is King. Larry tells me get the cash in the bank is the objective in China, but he never let's any of us forget."

That's what we're drilling the pilots for. I mean, I'd be nothing speculating anything that in a lateral sense, if you go off of demonstrated activities and individual there, 5, 6, 7 wells per horizon, you've got a lot of examples where that's worked effectively. So if I were leaning into something, I'd probably say that I would expect that kind of spacing per layer. The big question remains how many layers and what the vertical offset is going to be as you develop the other areas. We'll be optimizing, I mentioned rate of return is a driver, but ultimately, we're optimizing to maximize net present value. If you go back historically and you got to remember that a lot of these historical plays have long-term production or gas, we're producing oil here, so there are other variables. But typically, 10%, 15%, 20% type of interference related to impacts the EURs would be expected as you're optimizing. And I think we've been consistent on reminding everybody of that. And I think if you listen carefully on the calls earlier, there are a lot of factors that get involved. Oil price is a factor, well cost are a factor. We've got -- there's a continuous optimization program there, but I think the best guidance I can give everybody is that don't run with the unbounded type curves and things that's come to be just exactly what the development wells will be. If it is, we keep getting them closer until we find the optimal spacing. But at this point, we're excited to get strong data, hundred-plus wells demonstrated 1.1 million-barrel EUR and the pilot projects are under way. So good place to be and a lot of good information there. As I mentioned earlier, quality operators to help us solve the problem."

It was one of the items that was very attractive to us about the package because they would accelerate our knowledge base and I think they made a smart call. And they started this one out, as I mentioned on the call, which is a 2-layer test. We've got the first 4 wells down, so it will be 6 wells per layer, 12 of DSU. The other 2 pilots that we did mention earlier back in the second quarter, there are Newfield operator would be the, which is presently drilling and the Dorothy, which is going to be drilled before year end. The spacing in these recently similar. I think you can do the math. The 6-well scenario gives you 880-foot lateral spacing and the 5-well gives you 10 50. So we're going to have pretty good test kind of in that range. That's similar to the spacing that we've had in the well pairs along these lines. So we'll have a lot of data to kind of calibrate it.

Thanks for joining us for our second quarter conference call and operational update. We appreciate your interest in Newfield. In addition to our earnings release and operational updates yesterday afternoon, this mo",3309,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter conference call and operational update. 
We appreciate your interest in Newfield. In addition to our earnings release and operational updates yesterday afternoon, this morning, we announced the signing of 2 separate agreements to sell our onshore Texas assets for a combined price of nearly $390 million. The transactions include our unconventional assets in the Eagle Ford Shale and our conventional natural gas assets in South and West Texas. 
Current net daily production from the combined assets is approximately 12,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which, about 35% is oil. Upon closing, proceeds from these sales will replenish our cash balance and will be available to fund an acceleration of our activities in the Anadarko Basin at the right time. Newfield continues to high grade its asset base.
Well, it's certainly been a very busy summer. Here at home, we worked due diligence on a recent STACK acquisition, which we have now successfully closed. And several weeks ago, we issued an interim update release to raise our production guidance and highlight the continued advancement we are making as we HBP our primary STACK position. 
In addition to the energy conference schedule over the last 2 months, which was quite heavy, we were able to catch up with many of you on the road and various discussions along the way. If we didn't get a chance to see you recently, simply know that our near term objectives are very da well-defined. 
Number one, HBP our STACK play, number two, maintain a strong balance sheet; number three, sell non-strategic assets; and four, ready the organization for the timely acceleration of our top tier developments in SCOOP and STACK when the commodity prices provide the right signals. 
Certainly, proceeds from today's announced asset sale give us this flexibility. We continue to deliver outstanding results and our performance is differentiating the Newfield story. Since we recently issued an interim update in last night's earnings release, and @NFX is full of details, we will focus our call this morning on what's new and leave ample time at the end to address any specific questions that you have. 
So let's get started with a quick summary of our second quarter financial and operating results. Our domestic production in the second quarter was 13.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, and total company production was 15.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which, 45% was oil and 63% was liquids. 
This was slightly ahead of the projection we gave you in our June update in our interim update release. In the second quarter, we had a loss of $3.36 per share, which included the impact of a ceiling test write-down derivative losses and G&A expenses associated with our restructuring of the organization. Excluding these items, net income for the second quarter was $64 million or $0.32 per share on revenues of $381 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $306 million and discretionary cash flow from operations was $228 million. 
Our interest share and cash flow compared very favorably to Street estimates for the second quarter. Our cash operating expenses for the second quarter stated on a unit-of-production basis were below guidance. Year-over-year, our lease operating expenses are down about 25%. This is a nice combination of high volumes and the great strides that we've taken to improve our cost structures throughout the organization. 
Our domestic LOE for the second quarter was $3.37 per BOE, down another 4% from the first quarter of the year. As always, we updated our guidance numbers and @NFX for the third quarter and full year.
For the second quarter, we had $12 million or $0.06 per share in one-time G&A expense associated with restructuring and the continuing refinements we're making in our organization. We're estimating additional one-time cost of $18 million for the remainder of the year with about half expected in the third quarter.
Important to note are some very healthy trends under way in our consolidated structure. I think it's definitely worth spending a moment to highlight a few of them for you. First, our lower LOE is being driven primarily by SCOOP and STACK. Our recurring lease operating expense in the Anadarko Basin is currently less than $2 per BOE, the lowest of all of our operating regions. Since this is our fastest growing region, we are seeing improving LOE cost on a consolidated basis. 
With the lion's share of our capital being allocated to Anadarko Basin, production on our remaining operating regions is on decline. As higher cost areas naturally decline and our growth accelerates in the Anadarko Basin, we expect to see continued positive trends in our margins. Upon closing the sale of the Eagle Ford in South Texas assets, we should see further improvement in our consolidated cash operating costs on a unit-of-production basis. 
Our differentials to both NYMEX, WTI and Henry Hub were improving as well. This is a direct result of the shift under way in our production mix by basin. Our lowest realized oil price is the Uinta Basin; our highest is STACK and we expect continued favorable trends in our revenue per BOE going forward. 
Lastly, on this list of positive trends is reduced SG&A expense, something that has been under way since the oil price slide in the second half of 2014. We moved early and aggressively to reposition Newfield for the prospect that oil could remain lower for longer. These tough decisions have paid off. We consolidated our Denver, Tulsa and Houston offices and realigned a more efficient work force into the Woodlands. We anticipate that these steps will result in more than $60 million in annualized savings in 2017 forward or about 30% less SG&A expense than in 2014.
As I mentioned earlier, STACK is driving our improved oil price realizations. Our new STACK oil pipeline to Cushing is operational, and we are seeing great market demand for this high-quality barrel. 
Our most recent batch sales have sold for NYMEX, WTI plus about $0.50 per barrel, so even after transportation expense we are netting NYMEX less $2.50 per barrel. Substantially, all of our oil production in STACK should be fully on pipe during the third quarter.
On the balance sheet, you'll see we ended the quarter with $165 million cash on hand, post-closing of our recent STACK acquisition. The proceeds from the sales of our Eagle Ford and conventional South Texas gas properties will replenish our cash balance and more than bridge any deficit between our cash flow and planning investments in 2016 and 2017. 
Let's talk in more detail now about Anadarko Basin. STACK has certainly garnered a great number of headlines recently and is one of a few select areas in the country that has seen an increasing rig count in the face of low commodity prices. Industry activity has led to the drilling of more than 500 STACK wells to-date with consistent results across a multicounty area. 
This expensive well-control, along with our more than 100-plus operated STACK wells to-date, provide us with heightened confidence in the size of this prolific resource. The depth and quality of our [indiscernible]  prospect inventory and its ability to drive corporate growth and production in reserves well into the future. 
Recent transactions in STACK have been extremely competitive and valuations for undeveloped acreage have been very strong. Our legacy acreage position in Kingfisher in Canadian County is now sandwiched between recent 1 billion-plus transactions and undeveloped acreage values of $15,000 to more than $20,000 per acre. 
In this business, there is significant value created by identifying an unseen opportunity and founding a large-scale resource play. Even post-closing of our recent STACK acquisition, our oil and acreage cost in STACK total less than $3,000 per acre. Our low-entry  cost should boost our full cycle rates of return as we drill thousands of development wells over the next few decades. 
We have a top tier acreage position in STACK, and it's detailed on Page 9 in @NFX, and there are several key things to note about this acreage. First, our acreage is largely contiguous and lends itself to a very efficient future development. In HBP mode, we've largely drilled lease line pairs purposely leaving nearly 2 miles of undeveloped ground between our initial wells. 
This will be ideal for proper infield spacing in the future. The contiguous nature of our acreage will allow for more than 2/3 of future wells to be Super Extended Laterals or SXLs. We have proven time and again that SXLs are the most efficient way to develop a resource play. 
Second, we have exposure to all hydrocarbon phases across our acreage. As you transition from dry gas in the Cana field and move North and East, you enter the oil window, which is what we originally targeted when our leasing began here 5 years ago. Today, we have solid representation to the West where we are confident that EURs and gas content both move significantly higher. For us, it's about rate of return. Well costs are lower in the oil window as gas content increases to the West, the EURs also rise. It all has a great ROR, and we are very fortunate to be represented across the entirety of the STACK play today. 
Oklahoma, more specifically, the Anadarko Basin, provides commodity, diversity and optionality. Once HBP-ed, we will have the flexibility to target the right commodity at the right time. And third, we can now see the end of HBP and are planning for full field development. We expect that our legacy acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties will be about 95% held by production by year-end 2016. For much of the last 12 months, we've been  primarily drilling to hold acreage in the Northern and Eastern portions of our acreage. 
Although we have continued to see very consistent results, I can assure you we are looking forward to the high-grading of drilling locations during the future development phase. 
Newfield and others are pressing forward with several important pilots in STACK. We are all working to understand the optimal spacing for our future development wells. Fortunately, we share working interest in many of the pilots conducted to-date. We're accumulating a great deal of information from both our operated pilots and outside operated pilots where we own interest. 
By early next year, we should know a great deal more in terms of thinking about the development phase. 
In @NFX, we show recent 24-hour production results from our new Raptor-X pilot, which just commenced production. As you'll see on Page 10, this pilot includes 4 wells and was drilled due to test a 12 well spacing configuration, 2 layers in the Meramec, upper and lower. With wells drilled approximately 880 feet apart, the Raptor-X is showing strong early results. 24-hour production rates range between 1,400 and 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We are very encouraged with these early results, but as one of our completion engineers stated, ""Bad things show fast, but good things take time."" 
We will continue to watch these results over the next several months to draw meaningful conclusions to aid in our future development decisions. 
Our Chlouber Pilot is currently drilling with 5 infield wells spaced 1,050 feet apart to test a 10-well configuration in the Meramec, upper and lower, 2 horizons. Following the Chlouber, we will commence the Dorothy pilot in  the fourth quarter. The Dorothy will include 4 wells to test 5,000-foot laterals. 
Our planned spacing between wells will be 1,050 feet, simulating 5 wells in a single Meramec horizon. We expect to have information to share with you early next year. To-date, we've released information on about 100 STACK wells. This is a very large sample. In fact, the largest in the industry. Our longest producing wells have now been online for 4 years or more. 
Newfield is founder of the plays, more operated well dated than any other player in the region. We're looking at the long-term production for our wells to date, we see outperformance to our previous 950,000 BOE average type curve. Today, we raise the EUR on our average type curve by 15% to 1.1 million barrels Gross Equivalent for our unbounded wells on our Legacy acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties. 
Let may be clear. This new average type curve is reflected of only our legacy acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties, which constitutes nearly 200,000 net acres where we have significant well control and long-term production data. 
Clearly, as we move to the west in Blaine and Dewey, we expect that these areas will likely have a different hydrocarbon composition and likely a different type curve.  As we gather additional information from our operated wells planned here in 2017, we will share results and update you on our expectations. For now, there's lots of information from our peers who are having great success in  Blaine, and we look forward to wells in this area very soon. 
Regardless of where we drill in STACK, we know that targeting and geology will continue to be extremely important. In addition, completion design and size will contribute to EUR. But the simple issue for us will be how do we maximize our rate of return across the play for decades to come? We will continue to work the issues and navigate to the optimal completion. It's early. We don't have all the answers, but we're very encouraged about what  we have seen. 
We continue to make great strides operationally to improve efficiencies in both drilling and completion. We are firm believers today that larger profit and fluid volumes are both leading to higher EURs and improve production performance. Today's type curve increase is not merely a reflection of larger completions. We've only recently begun testing the larger sand and fluid concentrations, and we will continue to gather more information on the road ahead.
As we learn more about the sub-surface across a very large area, we will adjust our completion jobs to create the best recovery, highest returns and maximum net present value. Today, we're pumping more proppant than we employed in 2014, early 2015. And testing a combination of cross-link and hybrid fracture stimulations. Our goal is pretty simple, arrive at the best rate of return for development and create the most long-term value for our shareholders. 
We know that there are significant efficiencies still to be captured and are highly confident in our ability to deliver additional efficiencies and development. In fact, a recent best-in-class well was drilled and completed for less than $6 million gross. We've been working behind-the-scenes over the last several years to prepare the full-field development in STACK. Although many of these initiatives don't benefit us today, they will be hugely instrumental in the future. 
Here are some of the things that we've been doing in STACK. We have carefully placed our HBP wells. Our lease line pairs of HBP wells have left the acreage in the best position for future drilling and development optimization of well placements. We have nearly 2 miles of virgin surface and sub-surface acreage between about 1/3 of our HBP wells drilled to date. We've made significant investments in an extensive water infrastructure network that will allow us to efficiently source, move, store and recycle water during our upcoming development operations. 
We work to develop an expandable natural gas gathering and processing system with our partner, Mark West. Newfield and others are today considering a new open season on several proposed pipeline projects in STACK that will add 750 million cubic feet a day of takeaway in 2019 and beyond. We are confident that the infrastructure will be there to timely match our growth outlook from the basin.
Lastly, we're actively permitting for full field development and preparing for higher levels of activity in the future. We expect that about 2/3 of our wells next year in STACK will be development wells drilled from common pads. We look forward to continuing to drive down cost, exploit operational efficiencies and improve our margins.
As mentioned earlier, we closed in our recent acquisition of acreage in STACK. This was a great fit for us with about half of the acreage overlapping our legacy STACK, acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties and the remainder gives us a solid representation to the west. 
In addition to the Raptor-X pilot, we had 4 additional wells that recently commenced production. These wells are outlined on Page 9 in @NFX. The rates in these wells were impressive and range from about 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent a day to more than 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Each of these wells has strong liquids rates between 80% and 90% of the total production. We have additional wells planned in these areas for later this year. 
With strong results in STACK, we plan to increase activity in the second half of the year, and we will look for additional opportunities as we enter 2017. We today announced the revised production outlook in capital budget for 2016. We're planning to keep a rig active on our new STACK acreage and are quickening pace in days to depth is affording us the ability to drill additional wells this year with the same rig count. 
Our beginning of year plan called for the drilling of about 50 wells in STACK. Today, we estimate that we will drill more than 60 wells in 2016, including our pilots. 
Our new guidance for 2016 domestic production is 53 million to 54.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Recall that we've now raised guidance 3 times due to superior operational results year-to-date, and we are now including volumes associated with our recent STACK acquisition and additional planned activity in the second half of 2016. 
In China, our Pearl field continues to produce near peak rates and they expect a natural climb has been slower to materialize than forecast. We also increased our expectations for China due to this continued outperformance. In fact, our guidance for 2016 is now about 700,000 barrels ahead of our beginning-of-year projection. 
Our second half estimate for this year reflects our expectations for natural decline as well as the timing of liftings. Pearl continues to produce near peak rates over 25,000 barrels of oil per day. 
China liftings in 2016 expected to total about 5 million barrels of oil equivalent. When combined, total company production for 2016 is now expected to be 58 million to 59.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. 
Our production guidance today includes our Eagle Ford in South Texas properties through year-end. Upon closing of these sales in late September, we plan to again  update our production guidance for the year.
Our capital budget for the year is now $700 million to $750 million. There's a helpful table in today's @NFX publication that reconciles our budget back to the original $625 million to $675 million beginning of year plan. 
Our increased capital budget is supported by an improved outlook for 2016 cash flow from our legacy production as well as anticipated 2016 investments in our recently acquired STACK assets. In addition, we now have better clarity around the asset sales, proceeds and timing. 
In the current commodity prices, we expect that our capital spending will exceed cash flow by less than $100 million. Again, proceeds from the plant nonstrategic asset sales should be an effective tool in managing our debt levels and maintaining a superior capital structure.
So that includes our prepared remarks this morning. We appreciate your interest in our company and your investment in Newfield Exploration. I'm confident that our new near-term business plan is sound and that we are executing well along the path that will make us better, more efficient and more profitable in the future.

Again, year-to-date, both in terms of time, efficiency and cost. We are in a position now that we can see 95% of our legacy core position in Kingfisher and Canadian will be HBP-ed at year end, so it's rational to set up a program that is going to become increasingly development dominated. So relative to that program, we're saying that 2/3 estimate or somewhere around 2/3 of the wells we expect to drill in that acreage position in 2017 will be development wells. So to that end, that's the point that was being made there. Certainly, there are incremental efficiencies that will be gained in development. We've talked about the ability to shave somewhere around $750,000 to $1 million off of a well and drill from common pads, where you've got infrastructure and facilities in place. We believe that still achievable, it's certainly be something that we'll realize. That would translate to higher returns on a well basis. There's outstanding information that we outlined in the call that none of us have at this point and that will be the information that we pull takes some time over the next course of the next year or so. We and our other friends in the play will be studying the pilot data to optimize both lateral distance between horizontals laterally and vertically, the vertical offset throughout the STACK at productive intervals. So those will be pieces of the puzzle that we won't completely know, but we'll have -- we have plenty of data to know if we can enter now the early phase of development with confidence and with high expectations in terms of the results. I think the last part of your question having to do with expectations per se. I would say because of those cost savings, the efficiencies, the shift to 2/3 of the spending on development wells and the ability then because it's HBP-ed, to sort highest return to lowest return areas, we'll be targeting the highest return areas of the play. And that's the part that we referenced on the call that will be very, very exciting. So team's excited. We're going to continue to execute through this year, but the teams worked hard over the last 5 or 6 years to get ready for development, and I hope they're listening in right now because I know they're going to enjoy it and have fun. We're going to have fun reporting on the results."

We've been marching through this development step-by-step with very logical approach. First step, you go back to, it was a big step change was the reduction in spacing between [indiscernible] . That was something we saw outstanding results a couple of years ago, and it led to the first increase in the type curve. Since that time, the team has been working on various combinations of fluid volumes and proppant and mix in terms of the fluid systems. And again, they've taken a very sequential methodical approach, so that we can understand the data that's coming back to us. Again, focused on development, not the short term. So we're at the point today where we're testing higher fluid volumes and higher proppant volumes, and I indicated in the call commentary earlier that we're seeing some encouraging signs. But a lot of that higher volume and higher proppant is fairly recent data and not really a part of most of the work that's been done in terms of the 100-well data set that's been released. And then ultimately, we know from past experience in other plays that not every area in this play will probably have the same frac recipe. And so you'll end up with some areas that you think that Option A is the best approach, other areas it will be Recipe B and some other area might be Recipe C. But in general, I'm confident that we have the data and are acquiring the data we need to optimize and I'll flip it to Gary to see if he's got any other color he wants to add."

It's certainly been an outstanding first half and a good quarter. Thank you for those comments. We were joking before the call started amongst ourselves that one of the things we're proudest of -- the effort over the last several years is our team's put Exploration back into Newfield Exploration's name in a big way. And that's a big driver in terms of results and portfolio and quality of assets we have. And I'd be remiss not to give them all a pat on the back. And, of course, the operational guys coming along behind that and driving down costs further and faster than we might have otherwise imagined, it's just icing on the cake. So the team is performing at a high level. And I'm being polite, but I'll just say that if we have anything going on in exploration and/or if we had our eye on any other acreage, the last thing I do is announce it on this call because we have a lot of friends and a lot of competition. But the truth is the big obvious packages have largely transacted. You've got 3 large transactions within the core STACK position there that we talk about just in the last 7 or 8 months. We were fortunate to pick off the one that we wanted and the other 2 went for attractive prices saying that Newfield's acreage is in a really, really good spot. So as far as I'm concerned, we've got really strong companies in the play. Credible operators. Everybody's got a great acreage position that's a big area. We're moving to the point where I think people can share and help each other optimize. It's pretty -- going to be a pretty exciting time for the play going forward. We will all continue to compete with each other, because that's just what we do, and, hopefully, we can find some areas to scrap for some additional acreage. And if anybody has any out there that you want to sell, please call Larry Massaro right after we get off this call."

First off, I'll just say that I think we're demonstrated over the last several years that our team, and that means the entire team, management team, asset teams, operating folks, commercial side, have become accustomed that assets have a lifecycle. And we've embedded within our leadership team the grow, what I call the ""grow, hold or divest"" mentality, and it's something we talk about every day. Leaders throughout the organization have to ask themselves are we trying to grow an asset, are we holding this asset, are we divesting this asset? And that leads to a very healthy dialogue. So we've been consistent, I've been consistent that it's not a question of if, it's more a question of when.

And I do apologize, Jeff, I don't know that I've ever had a chance to talk about it, but we have a history of -- we kind of pioneered some of the horizontal oil developments in shallow waters in Southeast Asia. We had operations in Malaysia where we developed several fields. The Pearl field was our first horizontal development offshore China, but I would as far as operated development. But I would tell you that reservoir simulators are great tools and teams do a great job of putting all the data in. But every single field, every one that we developed in Asia outperformed the initial reservoir simulation. And there's numbers of reasons for it. It's fluid properties, quality of the reservoir, it's the math not being perfect when you go vertical to horizontal comparison. A whole host of things, but I will tell you none of us are surprised it outperformed. But when you have a lot of really talented people and reservoir simulators telling you the answer is x, you can hope and pray that it's x plus. But until you see it demonstrated, it's an unknown. So we took a conservative posture on the front end. I think it's a prudent way that the team described it. And frankly, we benefited at Pearl by all of the things that you'd want work in your favor. There's more oil in place than probably wasn't tooted. We're getting a higher recovery efficiency than you might otherwise have assumed. The rates have sustained themselves for far longer than any of the reservoir simulations would have predicted. And today, with a couple of years production data, the team's able to recalibrate the reservoir simulation. And we know at some point it will go in decline, but we want to enjoy this plateau production for just as long as we can. Cash is King. Larry tells me getting the cash in the bank is the objective in China, he never lets any of us forget it."

It's probably a high-class problem in today's world. And I think that we said on the call that it positions us very well because we're able to rotate our operational and technical talent into focus in the development phase of the SCOOP and STACK assets that we've been talking about in some length this morning that's positive, and it gives us the ability to accelerate that development activity at the time of our choosing, which we've been consistent over the last couple of years saying that when the market forces indicate that stepping on the accelerator is the right option, this play is going to get -- we're going to accelerate. And I think we're reminded of the volatility that you've seen in the commodity here over the last 2.5 years, and we expect that's going to continue for the next, I don't know, 12, 18 months. And, hopefully, we'll get some clarity somewhere along the way to accelerate development. But yes, it's a good place to be, and we're -- we continue to be more focused on the things that are generating the really exciting returns, and we've got the cash to do what we need to do to take care of the business."

That's what we're drilling the pilots for. I mean, I'd be nothing but speculating. I think that in a lateral sense, if you go off of demonstrated activities in a individual layer, 5, 6, 7 wells per horizon, you've got a lot of examples where that's worked effectively. So if I were leaning into something, I'd probably say that I would expect that kind of spacing per layer. The big question remains how many layers and what the vertical offset is going to be as you develop the other areas. We'll be optimizing, I mentioned rate of return as a driver, but ultimately, we're optimizing to maximize net present value. If you go back historically and you got to remember that a lot of these historical plays have long-term production or gas, we're producing oil here, so there are other variables. But typically, 10%, 15%, 20% type of interference related to [indiscernible] impacts the EURs would be expected as you optimize. And I think we've been consistent on reminding everybody of that. And I think if you listened carefully to the call script earlier, there are a lot of factors that get involved. Oil price is a factor, well costs are a factor. We've got -- there's a continuous optimization program there, but I think the best guidance I can give everybody is that don't run with the unbounded type curves and think that's going to be just exactly what the development wells will be. If it is, then we're going to keep drilling closer until we find the optimum spacing. But at this point, we're excited to get strong data, hundred-plus wells, demonstrated 1.1 million-barrel EUR and the pilot projects are under way. So good place to be and a lot of good information. And as I mentioned earlier, quality operators to help us solve that problem."

And they started this one out, as I mentioned on the call, it's a 2-layer test. We've got the first 4 wells down, so it would be 6 wells per layer, 12 well DSU. The other 2 pilots that we did mention earlier back in the second quarter, they are our Newfield operated would be the Chlouber, which is presently drilling and the Dorothy, which is going to be drilled before year end. The spacing in these are reasonably similar. I think you can do the math. The 6-well scenario gives you 880-foot lateral spacing and the 5-well gives you 1050. So we're going to have pretty good tests kind of in that range. That's similar to the spacing that we've had in the well pairs along lease lines. So we'll have a lot of data to kind of calibrate. And again, I take you back to the discussion we had earlier on this call and the Q&A on Pearl. It'll give our engineers an opportunity to optimize their simulations and give us the answer.

Thanks for joining us for our second quarter conference call and operational update. We appreciate your interest in Newfield. 
In addition to our earnings release and operational updates yesterday afternoon, this morning, we announced the signing of 2 separate agreements to sell our onshore Texas assets for a combined price of nearly $390 million. The transactions include our unconventional assets in the Eagle Ford Shale and our conventional natural gas assets in South and West Texas. 
Current net daily production from the combined assets is approximately 12,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which, about 35% is oil. Upon closing, proceeds from these sales will replenish our cash balance and will be available to fund an acceleration of our activities in the Anadarko Basin at the right time. Newfield continues to high grade its asset base.
Well, it's certainly been a very busy summer. Here at home, we worked due diligence on a recent STACK acquisition, which we have now successfully closed. And several weeks ago, we issued an interim update release to raise our production guidance and highlight the continued advancements we are making as we HBP our premier STACK position. 
In addition to the energy conference schedule over the last 2 months, which was quite heavy, we were able to catch up with many of you on the road and various discussions along the way. If we didn't get a chance to see you recently, simply know that our near term objectives are very well-defined. 
Number one, HBP our STACK play; number two, maintain a strong balance sheet; number three, sell non-strategic assets; and four, ready the organization for the timely acceleration of our top tier developments in SCOOP and STACK when the commodity prices provide the right signals. 
Certainly, proceeds from today's announced asset sale give us this flexibility. We continue to deliver outstanding results and our performance is differentiating the Newfield story. Since we recently issued an interim update in last night's earnings release, and @NFX is full of details, we will focus our call this morning on what's new and leave ample time at the end to address any specific questions that you have. 
So let's get started with a quick summary of our second quarter financial and operating results. 
Our domestic production in the second quarter was 13.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, and total company production was 15.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which, 45% was oil and 63% was liquids. 
This was slightly ahead of the projection we gave you in our June update in our interim update release. In the second quarter, we had a loss of $3.36 per share, which included the impact of a ceiling test write-down, derivative losses and G&A expenses associated with our restructuring of the organization. Excluding these items, net income for the second quarter was $64 million or $0.32 per share on revenues of $381 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $306 million and discretionary cash flow from operations was $228 million. 
Our interest share and cash flow compared very favorably to Street estimates for the second quarter. Our cash operating expenses for the second quarter stated on a unit-of-production basis were below guidance. Year-over-year, our lease operating expenses are down about 25%. This is a nice combination of higher volumes and the great strides that we've taken to improve our cost structures throughout the organization. 
Our domestic LOE for the second quarter was $3.37 per BOE, down another 4% from the first quarter of the year. As always, we updated our guidance numbers and @NFX for the third quarter and full year.
For the second quarter, we had $12 million or $0.06 per share in one-time G&A expense associated with restructuring and the continuing refinements we're making in our organization. We're estimating additional one-time cost of $18 million for the remainder of the year with about half expected in the third quarter.
Important to note are some very healthy trends under way in our consolidated cost structure. I think it's definitely worth spending a moment to highlight a few of them for you. 
First, our lower LOE is being driven primarily by SCOOP and STACK. Our recurring lease operating expense in the Anadarko Basin is currently less than $2 per BOE, the lowest of all of our operating regions. Since this is our fastest growing region, we are seeing improving LOE cost on a consolidated basis. 
With the lion's share of our capital being allocated to Anadarko Basin, production on our remaining operating regions is on decline. As higher cost areas naturally decline and our growth accelerates in the Anadarko Basin, we expect to see continued positive trends in our margins. Upon closing the sale of the Eagle Ford in South Texas assets, we should see further improvement in our consolidated cash operating costs on a unit-of-production basis. 
Our differentials to both NYMEX, WTI and Henry Hub are improving as well. This is a direct result of the shift under way in our production mix by basin. Our lowest realized oil price is the Uinta Basin; our highest is STACK and we expect continued favorable trends in our revenue per BOE going forward. 
Lastly, on this list of positive trends is reduced SG&A expense, something that has been under way since the oil price slide in the second half of 2014. We moved early and aggressively to reposition Newfield for the prospect that oil could remain lower-for-longer. These tough decisions have paid off. We consolidated our Denver, Tulsa and Houston offices and realigned a more efficient work force into The Woodlands. We anticipate that these steps will result in more than $60 million in annualized savings in 2017 forward or about 30% less SG&A expense than in 2014.
As I mentioned earlier, STACK is driving our improved oil price realizations. Our new STACK oil pipeline to Cushing is operational, and we are seeing great market demand for this high-quality barrel. 
Our most recent batch sales have sold for NYMEX, WTI plus about $0.50 per barrel, so even after transportation expense we are netting NYMEX less $2.50 per barrel. Substantially, all of our oil production in STACK should be fully on pipe during the third quarter.
On the balance sheet, you'll see we ended the quarter with $165 million cash on hand, post-closing of our recent STACK acquisition. The proceeds from the sales of our Eagle Ford and conventional South Texas gas properties will replenish our cash balance and more than bridge any deficit between our cash flow and planned investments in 2016 and 2017. 
Let's talk in more detail now about the Anadarko Basin. STACK has certainly garnered a great number of headlines recently and is one of a few select areas in the country that has seen an increasing rig count in the face of low commodity prices. Industry activity has led to the drilling of more than 500 STACK wells to date with consistent results across a multicounty area. 
This expensive well-control, along with our more than 100-plus operated STACK wells to date, provide us with heightened confidence in the size of this prolific resource. The depth and quality of our undrilled prospect inventory and its ability to drive corporate growth and production in reserves well into the future. 
Recent transactions in STACK have been extremely competitive and valuations for undeveloped acreage have been very strong. Our legacy acreage position in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties is now sandwiched between recent $1 billion-plus transactions and undeveloped acreage values of $15,000 to more than $20,000 per acre. 
In this business, there is significant value created by identifying an unseen opportunity and founding a large-scale resource play. Even post-closing of our recent STACK acquisition, our oil and acreage costs in STACK total less than $3,000 per acre. Our low entry cost should boost our full cycle rates of return as we drill thousands of development wells over the next few decades. 
We have a top tier acreage position in STACK, and it's detailed on Page 9 in @NFX, and there are several key things to note about this acreage. First, our acreage is largely contiguous and lends itself to a very efficient future development. In HBP mode, we've largely drilled lease line pairs purposely leaving nearly 2 miles of undeveloped ground between our initial wells. This will be ideal for proper infill spacing in the future. The contiguous nature of our acreage will allow for more than 2/3 of future wells to be Super Extended Laterals or SXLs. We have proven time and again that SXLs are the most efficient way to develop a resource play. 
Second, we have exposure to all hydrocarbon phases across our acreage. As you transition from dry gas in the Cana field and move North and East, you enter the oil window, which is what we originally targeted when our leasing began here 5 years ago. Today, we have solid representation to the West where we are confident that EURs and gas content both move significantly higher. For us, it's about rate of return. Well costs are lower in the oil window as gas content increases to the West, the EURs also rise. It all has a great ROR, and we are very fortunate to be represented across the entirety of the STACK play today. 
Oklahoma, more specifically, the Anadarko Basin, provides commodity, diversity and optionality. Once HBP-ed, we will have the flexibility to target the right commodity at the right time. 
And third, we can now see the end of HBP and are planning for full field development. We expect that our legacy acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties will be about 95% held by production by year-end 2016. For much of the last 12 months, we've been primarily drilling to hold acreage in the Northern and Eastern portions of our acreage. 
Although we have continued to see very consistent results, I can assure you we are looking forward to the high-grading of drilling locations during the future development phase. 
Newfield and others are pressing forward with several important pilots in STACK. We are all working to understand the optimal spacing for our future development wells. Fortunately, we share working interests in many of the pilots conducted to date [ph]. We're accumulating a great deal of information from both our operated pilots and outside operated pilots where we own interests. By early next year, we should know a great deal more in terms of thinking about the development phase. 
In @NFX, we show recent 24-hour production results from our new Raptor-X pilot, which just commenced production. As you'll see on Page 10, this pilot includes 4 wells and was drilled to test a 12 well spacing configuration, 2 layers in the Meramec, upper and lower. With wells drilled approximately 880 feet apart, the Raptor-X is showing strong early results. 24-hour production rates range between 1,400 and 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We are very encouraged with these early results, but as one of our completion engineers stated, ""Bad things show fast, but good things take time."" We will continue to watch these results over the next several months to draw meaningful conclusions to aid in our future development decisions. 
Our Chlouber Pilot is currently drilling with 5 infill wells spaced 1,050 feet apart to test a 10-well configuration in the Meramec, upper and lower, 2 horizons. Following the Chlouber, we will commence the Dorothy pilot in the fourth quarter. The Dorothy will include 4 wells to test 5,000-foot laterals. Our planned spacing between wells will be 1,050 feet, simulating 5 wells in a single Meramec horizon. We expect to have information to share with you early next year. 
To date, we've released information on about 100 STACK wells. This is a very large sample. In fact, the largest in the industry. Our longest producing wells have now been online for 4 years or more. Newfield is founder of the plays, more operated well data than any other player in the region. We're looking at the long-term production for our wells to date, we see outperformance to our previous 950,000 BOE average type curve. Today, we raise the EUR on our average type curve by 15% to 1.1 million barrels gross equivalent for our unbounded wells on our Legacy acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties. 
Let may be clear. This new average type curve is reflective of only our legacy acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties, which constitutes nearly 200,000 net acres where we have significant well control and long-term production data. 
Clearly, as we move to the west in Blaine and Dewey, we expect that these areas will likely have a different hydrocarbon composition and likely a different type curve. As we gather additional information from our operated wells planned here in 2017, we will share results and update you on our expectations. For now, there's lots of information from our peers who are having great success in Blaine, and we look forward to wells in this area very soon. 
Regardless of where we drill in STACK, we know that targeting and geology will continue to be extremely important. In addition, completion design and size will contribute to EUR. But the simple issue for us will be how do we maximize our rate of return across the play for decades to come? We will continue to work the issues and navigate to the optimal completion. It's early. We don't have all the answers, but we're very encouraged about what we have seen. 
We continue to make great strides operationally to improve efficiencies in both drilling and completion. We are firm believers today that larger profit and fluid volumes are both leading to higher EURs and improve production performance. Today's type curve increase is not merely a reflection of larger completions. We've only recently begun testing the larger sand and fluid concentrations, and we will continue to gather more information on the road ahead.
As we learn more about the sub-surface across a very large area, we will adjust our completion jobs to create the best recovery, highest returns and maximum net present value. Today, we're pumping more proppant than we employed in 2014, early 2015. And testing a combination of cross-link and hybrid fracture stimulations. Our goal is pretty simple, arrive at the best rate of return for development and create the most long-term value for our shareholders. 
We know that there are significant efficiencies still to be captured and are highly confident in our ability to deliver additional efficiencies in development. In fact, a recent best-in-class well was drilled and completed for less than $6 million gross. We've been working behind-the-scenes over the last several years to prepare the full-field development in STACK. Although many of these initiatives don't benefit us today, they will be hugely instrumental in the future. 
Here are some of the things that we've been doing in STACK. We have carefully placed our HBP wells. Our lease line pairs of HBP wells have left the acreage in the best position for future drilling and development optimization of well placements. We have nearly 2 miles of virgin surface and sub-surface acreage between about 1/3 of our HBP wells drilled to date. We've made significant investments in an extensive water infrastructure network that will allow us to efficiently source, move, store and recycle water during our upcoming development operations. 
We work to develop an expandable natural gas gathering and processing system with our partner, Mark West. Newfield and others are today considering a new open season on several proposed pipeline projects in STACK that will add 750 million cubic feet a day of takeaway in 2019 and beyond. We are confident that the infrastructure will be there to timely match our growth outlook from the basin.
Lastly, we're actively permitting for full field development and preparing for higher levels of activity in the future. We expect that about 2/3 of our wells next year in STACK will be development wells drilled from common pads. We look forward to continuing to drive down cost, exploit operational efficiencies and improve our margins.
As mentioned earlier, we closed on our recent acquisition of acreage in STACK. This was a great fit for us with about half of the acreage overlapping our legacy STACK, acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties and the remainder gives us a solid representation to the west. 
In addition to the Raptor-X pilot, we had 4 additional wells that recently commenced production. These wells are outlined on Page 9 in @NFX. The rates in these wells were impressive and range from about 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent a day to more than 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Each of these wells has strong liquids rates between 80% and 90% of the total production. We have additional wells planned in these areas for later this year. 
With strong results in STACK, we plan to increase activity in the second half of the year, and we will look for additional opportunities as we enter 2017. We today announced the revised production outlook and capital budget for 2016. We're planning to keep a rig active on our new STACK acreage and our quickening pace in days to depth is affording us the ability to drill additional wells this year with the same rig count. 
Our beginning of year plan called for the drilling of about 50 wells in STACK. Today, we estimate that we will drill more than 60 wells in 2016, including our pilots. 
Our new guidance for 2016 domestic production is 53 million to 54.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Recall that we've now raised guidance 3 times due to superior operational results year-to-date, and we are now including volumes associated with our recent STACK acquisition and additional planned activity in the second half of 2016. 
In China, our Pearl field continues to produce near peak rates and they expect the natural decline has been slower to materialize than forecast. We also increased our expectations for China due to this continued outperformance. In fact, our guidance for 2016 is now about 700,000 barrels ahead of our beginning-of-year projection. Our second half estimate for this year reflects our expectations for a natural decline as well as the timing of liftings. Pearl continues to produce near peak rates over 25,000 barrels of oil per day. 
China liftings in 2016 expected to total about 5 million barrels of oil equivalent. When combined, total company production for 2016 is now expected to be 58 million to 59.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. 
Our production guidance today includes our Eagle Ford and South Texas properties through year-end. Upon closing of these sales in late September, we plan to again update our production guidance for the year.
Our capital budget for the year is now $700 million to $750 million. There's a helpful table in today's @NFX publication that reconciles our budget back to the original $625 million to $675 million beginning of year plan. Our increased capital budget is supported by an improved outlook for 2016 cash flow from our legacy production as well as anticipated 2016 investments in our recently acquired STACK assets. In addition, we now have better clarity around the asset sales, proceeds and timing. 
In the current commodity prices, we expect that our capital spending will exceed cash flow by less than $100 million. Again, proceeds from the plant nonstrategic asset sales should be an effective tool in managing our debt levels and maintaining a superior capital structure.
So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We appreciate your interest in our company and your investment in Newfield Exploration. I'm confident that our new near-term business plan is sound and that we are executing well along the path that will make us better, more efficient and more profitable in the future. Operator, we're now ready to take the questions."

Again, year-to-date, both in terms of time, efficiency and cost. We are in a position now that we can see 95% of our legacy core position in Kingfisher and Canadian will be HBP-ed at year end, so it's rational to set up a program that is going to become increasingly development dominated. So relative to that program, we're saying that 2/3 estimate or somewhere around 2/3 of the wells we expect to drill in that acreage position in 2017 will be development wells. So to that end, that's the point that was being made there. Certainly, there are incremental efficiencies that will be gained in development. We've talked about the ability to shave somewhere around $750,000 to $1 million off of a well and drill from common pads, where you've got infrastructure and facilities in place. We believe that's still achievable, it would certainly be something that we'll realize That would translate to higher returns on a well basis. There's outstanding information that we outlined in the call that none of us have at this point and that will be the information that we pull takes some time over the next -- course of the next year or so. We and our other friends in the play will be studying the pilot data to optimize both lateral distance between horizontals laterally and vertically, the vertical offset throughout the STACK at productive intervals. So those will be pieces of the puzzle that we won't completely know, but we'll have -- we have plenty of data to know that we can enter now early phase of development with confidence and with high expectations in terms of the results. I think the last part of your question having to do with expectations per se. I would say because of those cost savings, the efficiencies, the shift to 2/3 of the spending on development wells and the ability then because it's HBP-ed, to sort highest return to lowest return areas, we'll be targeting the highest return areas of the play. And that's the part that we referenced on the call that will be very, very exciting. So team's excited. We're going to continue to execute through this year, but the teams worked hard over the last 5 or 6 years to get ready for development, and I hope they're listening in right now because I know they're going to enjoy it and have fun. We're going to have fun reporting on the results."

We've been marching through this development step-by-step with very logical approach. First step, you go back to, it was a big step change was the reduction in spacing between perf clusters. That was something we saw outstanding results a couple of years ago, and it led to the first increase in the type curve. Since that time, the team has been working on various combinations of fluid volumes and proppant and mix in terms of the fluid systems. And again, they've taken a very sequential methodical approach, so that we can understand the data that's coming back to us. Again, focused on development, not the short term. So we're at the point today where we're testing higher fluid volumes and higher proppant volumes, and I indicated in the call commentary earlier that we're seeing some encouraging signs. But a lot of that higher volume and higher proppant is fairly recent data and not really a part of most of the work that's been done in terms of the 100-well data set that's been released. And then ultimately, we know from past experience in other plays that not every area in this play will probably have the same frac recipe. And so you'll end up with some areas that you think that Option A is the best approach, other areas it will be Recipe B and some other area might be Recipe C. But in general, I'm confident that we have the data and are acquiring the data we need to optimize and I'll flip it to Gary to see if he's got any other color he wants to add."

It's certainly been an outstanding first half and a good quarter. Thank you for those comments. We were joking before the call started amongst ourselves that one of the things we're proudest of -- the effort over the last several years is our team's put Exploration back into Newfield Exploration's name in a big way. And that's a big driver in terms of the results and the portfolio and the quality of assets we have. And I'd be remiss not to give them all a pat on the back. And, of course, the operational guys coming along behind that and driving down costs further and faster than we might have otherwise imagined, it's just icing on the cake. So the team is performing at a high level. And I'm being polite, but I'll just say that if we have anything going on in exploration and/or if we had our eye on any other acreage, the last thing I do is announce it on this call because we have a lot of friends and a lot of competition. But the truth is the big obvious packages have largely transacted. You've got 3 large transactions within the core STACK position there that we talk about just in the last 7 or 8 months. We were fortunate to pick off the one that we wanted and the other 2 went for attractive prices saying that Newfield's acreage is in a really, really good spot. So as far as I'm concerned, we've got really strong companies in the play. Credible operators. Everybody's got a great acreage position that's a big area. We're moving to the point where I think people can share and help each other optimize. It's pretty -- it's going to be a pretty exciting time for the play going forward. We'll all continue to compete with each other, because that's just what we do, and, hopefully, we can find some areas to scrap for some additional acreage. And if anybody has any out there that you want to sell, please call Larry Massaro right after we get off this call."

Some of you guys, most of you guys probably met John Jasek by now, but he and the team are all over that. So I don't lose sleep about acreage that needs to be HBP-ed. I think they've got a good plan. They're executing well and we'll stay on top of that. But we don't have any material issues in that regard, and I'll remind you that the acquisition that we recently closed on 95% of that acreage is HBP. So there's not a short-term driver to have to drill. There's a desire and a want to drill and we'll just call that development. I'll reference the earlier comments on the percentage of wells drilled in development in 2017."

And I do apologize, Jeff, I don't know that I've ever had a chance to talk to you about it, but we have a history of -- we kind of pioneered some of the horizontal oil developments in the shallow waters in Southeast Asia. We had operations in Malaysia where we developed several fields. The Pearl field was our first horizontal development offshore China, but I would -- as far as operated development. But I would tell you that reservoir simulators are great tools and teams do a great job of putting all the data in. But every single field, every one that we developed in Asia outperformed the initial reservoir simulation. And there's a number of reasons for it. It's fluid properties, quality of the reservoir, it's the math not being perfect when you go vertical to horizontal comparison. It's a whole host of things, but I would tell you none of us are surprised it outperformed. But when you have a lot of really talented people and reservoir simulators telling you the answer is x, you can hope and pray that it's x plus. But until you see it demonstrated, it's an unknown. So we took a conservative posture on the front end. I think it's a prudent way that the team described it. And frankly, we've benefited at Pearl by all of the things that you'd want work in your favor. There's more oil in place than probably was imputed. We're getting a higher recovery efficiency than you might otherwise have assumed. The rates have sustained themselves for far longer than any of the reservoir simulations would have predicted. And today, with a couple of years' production data, the team's able to recalibrate the reservoir simulation. And we know at some point it will go in decline, but we want to enjoy this plateau production for just as long as we can. Cash is king. Larry tells me getting the cash in the bank is the objective in China, he never lets any of us forget it."

It's probably a high-class problem in today's world. And I think that we said on the call that it positions us very well because we're able to rotate our operational and technical talent into focus in the development phase of the SCOOP and STACK assets that we've been talking about at some length this morning, that's positive, and it gives us the ability to accelerate that development activity at the time of our choosing, which we've been consistent over the last couple of years in saying that when the market forces indicate that stepping on the accelerator is the right option, this play is going to get -- we're going to accelerate. And I think the -- we're reminded of the volatility that you've seen in the commodity here over the last 2.5 years, and we expect that's going to continue for the next, I don't know, 12, 18 months.

That's what we're drilling the pilots for. I mean, I'd be doing nothing but speculating. I think that in a lateral sense, if you go off of demonstrated activities in a individual layer, 5, 6, 7 wells per horizon, you've got a lot of examples where that's worked effectively. So if I were leaning into something, I'd probably say that I would expect that kind of spacing per layer. The big question remains how many layers and what the vertical offset is going to be as you develop the other areas. We'll be optimizing, I mentioned rate of return as a driver, but ultimately, we're optimizing to maximize net present value. If you go back historically and you got to remember that a lot of these historical plays have long-term production or gas, we're producing oil here, so there are other variables. But typically, 10%, 15%, 20% type of interference related effects, impacts to EURs would be expected as you optimize. And I think we've been consistent on reminding everybody of that. And I think if you listened carefully to the call script earlier, there are a lot of factors that get involved. Oil price is a factor, well costs are a factor. We've got -- there's a continuous optimization program there, but I think the best guidance I can give everybody is that don't run with the unbounded type curves and think that's going to be just exactly what the development wells will be. If it is, then we're going to keep drilling closer until we find the optimum spacing. But at this point, we're excited, we've got strong data, hundred-plus wells, demonstrated 1.1 million-barrel EUR and the pilot projects are under way. So good place to be and a lot of good information. And as I mentioned earlier, quality operators to help us solve that problem."

I think they got the pilots moving in the right direction. It was one of the items that was very attractive to us about the package because it would accelerate our knowledge base and I think they made a smart call. And they started this one out, as I mentioned on the call, it's a 2-layer test. We've got the first 4 wells down, so it would be 6 wells per layer, 12 well DSU. The other 2 pilots that we did mention earlier, back in the second quarter, that are Newfield-operated would be the Chlouber, which is presently drilling, and the Dorothy, which is going to be drilled before year end. The spacing in these are reasonably similar. I think you can do the math. The 6-well scenario gives you 880-foot lateral spacing and the 5-well gives you 1050. So we're going to have pretty good tests kind of in that range. That's similar to the spacing that we've had in the well pairs along lease lines. So we'll have a lot of data to kind of calibrate. And again, I take you back to the discussion we had earlier on this call and the Q&A on Pearl. It'll give our engineers an opportunity to optimize their simulations and give us the answer. So we're -- we need time.

Thanks for joining us for our second quarter conference call and operational update. We appreciate your interest in Newfield. In addition to our earnings release and operational updates yesterday afternoon, this mo",3314,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter conference call and operational update. We appreciate your interest in Newfield. 
In addition to our earnings release and operational updates yesterday afternoon, this morning, we announced the signing of 2 separate agreements to sell our onshore Texas assets for a combined price of nearly $390 million. The transactions include our unconventional assets in the Eagle Ford Shale and our conventional natural gas assets in South and West Texas. 
Current net daily production from the combined assets is approximately 12,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which, about 35% is oil. Upon closing, proceeds from these sales will replenish our cash balance and will be available to fund an acceleration of our activities in the Anadarko Basin at the right time. Newfield continues to high grade its asset base.
Well, it's certainly been a very busy summer. Here at home, we worked due diligence on a recent STACK acquisition, which we have now successfully closed. And several weeks ago, we issued an interim update release to raise our production guidance and highlight the continued advancements we are making as we HBP our premier STACK position. 
In addition to the energy conference schedule over the last 2 months, which was quite heavy, we were able to catch up with many of you on the road and various discussions along the way. If we didn't get a chance to see you recently, simply know that our near term objectives are very well-defined. 
Number one, HBP our STACK play; number two, maintain a strong balance sheet; number three, sell non-strategic assets; and four, ready the organization for the timely acceleration of our top tier developments in SCOOP and STACK when the commodity prices provide the right signals. 
Certainly, proceeds from today's announced asset sale give us this flexibility. We continue to deliver outstanding results and our performance is differentiating the Newfield story. Since we recently issued an interim update in last night's earnings release, and @NFX is full of details, we will focus our call this morning on what's new and leave ample time at the end to address any specific questions that you have. 
So let's get started with a quick summary of our second quarter financial and operating results. 
Our domestic production in the second quarter was 13.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, and total company production was 15.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which, 45% was oil and 63% was liquids. 
This was slightly ahead of the projection we gave you in our June update in our interim update release. In the second quarter, we had a loss of $3.36 per share, which included the impact of a ceiling test write-down, derivative losses and G&A expenses associated with our restructuring of the organization. Excluding these items, net income for the second quarter was $64 million or $0.32 per share on revenues of $381 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $306 million and discretionary cash flow from operations was $228 million. 
Our interest share and cash flow compared very favorably to Street estimates for the second quarter. Our cash operating expenses for the second quarter stated on a unit-of-production basis were below guidance. Year-over-year, our lease operating expenses are down about 25%. This is a nice combination of higher volumes and the great strides that we've taken to improve our cost structures throughout the organization. 
Our domestic LOE for the second quarter was $3.37 per BOE, down another 4% from the first quarter of the year. As always, we updated our guidance numbers and @NFX for the third quarter and full year.
For the second quarter, we had $12 million or $0.06 per share in one-time G&A expense associated with restructuring and the continuing refinements we're making in our organization. We're estimating additional one-time cost of $18 million for the remainder of the year with about half expected in the third quarter.
Important to note are some very healthy trends under way in our consolidated cost structure. I think it's definitely worth spending a moment to highlight a few of them for you. 
First, our lower LOE is being driven primarily by SCOOP and STACK. Our recurring lease operating expense in the Anadarko Basin is currently less than $2 per BOE, the lowest of all of our operating regions. Since this is our fastest growing region, we are seeing improving LOE cost on a consolidated basis. 
With the lion's share of our capital being allocated to Anadarko Basin, production on our remaining operating regions is on decline. As higher cost areas naturally decline and our growth accelerates in the Anadarko Basin, we expect to see continued positive trends in our margins. Upon closing the sale of the Eagle Ford in South Texas assets, we should see further improvement in our consolidated cash operating costs on a unit-of-production basis. 
Our differentials to both NYMEX, WTI and Henry Hub are improving as well. This is a direct result of the shift under way in our production mix by basin. Our lowest realized oil price is the Uinta Basin; our highest is STACK and we expect continued favorable trends in our revenue per BOE going forward. 
Lastly, on this list of positive trends is reduced SG&A expense, something that has been under way since the oil price slide in the second half of 2014. We moved early and aggressively to reposition Newfield for the prospect that oil could remain lower-for-longer. These tough decisions have paid off. We consolidated our Denver, Tulsa and Houston offices and realigned a more efficient work force into The Woodlands. We anticipate that these steps will result in more than $60 million in annualized savings in 2017 forward or about 30% less SG&A expense than in 2014.
As I mentioned earlier, STACK is driving our improved oil price realizations. Our new STACK oil pipeline to Cushing is operational, and we are seeing great market demand for this high-quality barrel. 
Our most recent batch sales have sold for NYMEX, WTI plus about $0.50 per barrel, so even after transportation expense we are netting NYMEX less $2.50 per barrel. Substantially, all of our oil production in STACK should be fully on pipe during the third quarter.
On the balance sheet, you'll see we ended the quarter with $165 million cash on hand, post-closing of our recent STACK acquisition. The proceeds from the sales of our Eagle Ford and conventional South Texas gas properties will replenish our cash balance and more than bridge any deficit between our cash flow and planned investments in 2016 and 2017. 
Let's talk in more detail now about the Anadarko Basin. STACK has certainly garnered a great number of headlines recently and is one of a few select areas in the country that has seen an increasing rig count in the face of low commodity prices. Industry activity has led to the drilling of more than 500 STACK wells to date with consistent results across a multicounty area. 
This expensive well-control, along with our more than 100-plus operated STACK wells to date, provide us with heightened confidence in the size of this prolific resource. The depth and quality of our undrilled prospect inventory and its ability to drive corporate growth and production in reserves well into the future. 
Recent transactions in STACK have been extremely competitive and valuations for undeveloped acreage have been very strong. Our legacy acreage position in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties is now sandwiched between recent $1 billion-plus transactions and undeveloped acreage values of $15,000 to more than $20,000 per acre. 
In this business, there is significant value created by identifying an unseen opportunity and founding a large-scale resource play. Even post-closing of our recent STACK acquisition, our oil and acreage costs in STACK total less than $3,000 per acre. Our low entry cost should boost our full cycle rates of return as we drill thousands of development wells over the next few decades. 
We have a top tier acreage position in STACK, and it's detailed on Page 9 in @NFX, and there are several key things to note about this acreage. First, our acreage is largely contiguous and lends itself to a very efficient future development. In HBP mode, we've largely drilled lease line pairs purposely leaving nearly 2 miles of undeveloped ground between our initial wells. This will be ideal for proper infill spacing in the future. The contiguous nature of our acreage will allow for more than 2/3 of future wells to be Super Extended Laterals or SXLs. We have proven time and again that SXLs are the most efficient way to develop a resource play. 
Second, we have exposure to all hydrocarbon phases across our acreage. As you transition from dry gas in the Cana field and move North and East, you enter the oil window, which is what we originally targeted when our leasing began here 5 years ago. Today, we have solid representation to the West where we are confident that EURs and gas content both move significantly higher. For us, it's about rate of return. Well costs are lower in the oil window as gas content increases to the West, the EURs also rise. It all has a great ROR, and we are very fortunate to be represented across the entirety of the STACK play today. 
Oklahoma, more specifically, the Anadarko Basin, provides commodity, diversity and optionality. Once HBP-ed, we will have the flexibility to target the right commodity at the right time. 
And third, we can now see the end of HBP and are planning for full field development. We expect that our legacy acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties will be about 95% held by production by year-end 2016. For much of the last 12 months, we've been primarily drilling to hold acreage in the Northern and Eastern portions of our acreage. 
Although we have continued to see very consistent results, I can assure you we are looking forward to the high-grading of drilling locations during the future development phase. 
Newfield and others are pressing forward with several important pilots in STACK. We are all working to understand the optimal spacing for our future development wells. Fortunately, we share working interests in many of the pilots conducted to date [ph]. We're accumulating a great deal of information from both our operated pilots and outside operated pilots where we own interests. By early next year, we should know a great deal more in terms of thinking about the development phase. 
In @NFX, we show recent 24-hour production results from our new Raptor-X pilot, which just commenced production. As you'll see on Page 10, this pilot includes 4 wells and was drilled to test a 12 well spacing configuration, 2 layers in the Meramec, upper and lower. With wells drilled approximately 880 feet apart, the Raptor-X is showing strong early results. 24-hour production rates range between 1,400 and 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We are very encouraged with these early results, but as one of our completion engineers stated, ""Bad things show fast, but good things take time."" We will continue to watch these results over the next several months to draw meaningful conclusions to aid in our future development decisions. 
Our Chlouber Pilot is currently drilling with 5 infill wells spaced 1,050 feet apart to test a 10-well configuration in the Meramec, upper and lower, 2 horizons. Following the Chlouber, we will commence the Dorothy pilot in the fourth quarter. The Dorothy will include 4 wells to test 5,000-foot laterals. Our planned spacing between wells will be 1,050 feet, simulating 5 wells in a single Meramec horizon. We expect to have information to share with you early next year. 
To date, we've released information on about 100 STACK wells. This is a very large sample. In fact, the largest in the industry. Our longest producing wells have now been online for 4 years or more. Newfield is founder of the plays, more operated well data than any other player in the region. We're looking at the long-term production for our wells to date, we see outperformance to our previous 950,000 BOE average type curve. Today, we raise the EUR on our average type curve by 15% to 1.1 million barrels gross equivalent for our unbounded wells on our Legacy acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties. 
Let may be clear. This new average type curve is reflective of only our legacy acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties, which constitutes nearly 200,000 net acres where we have significant well control and long-term production data. 
Clearly, as we move to the west in Blaine and Dewey, we expect that these areas will likely have a different hydrocarbon composition and likely a different type curve. As we gather additional information from our operated wells planned here in 2017, we will share results and update you on our expectations. For now, there's lots of information from our peers who are having great success in Blaine, and we look forward to wells in this area very soon. 
Regardless of where we drill in STACK, we know that targeting and geology will continue to be extremely important. In addition, completion design and size will contribute to EUR. But the simple issue for us will be how do we maximize our rate of return across the play for decades to come? We will continue to work the issues and navigate to the optimal completion. It's early. We don't have all the answers, but we're very encouraged about what we have seen. 
We continue to make great strides operationally to improve efficiencies in both drilling and completion. We are firm believers today that larger profit and fluid volumes are both leading to higher EURs and improve production performance. Today's type curve increase is not merely a reflection of larger completions. We've only recently begun testing the larger sand and fluid concentrations, and we will continue to gather more information on the road ahead.
As we learn more about the sub-surface across a very large area, we will adjust our completion jobs to create the best recovery, highest returns and maximum net present value. Today, we're pumping more proppant than we employed in 2014, early 2015. And testing a combination of cross-link and hybrid fracture stimulations. Our goal is pretty simple, arrive at the best rate of return for development and create the most long-term value for our shareholders. 
We know that there are significant efficiencies still to be captured and are highly confident in our ability to deliver additional efficiencies in development. In fact, a recent best-in-class well was drilled and completed for less than $6 million gross. We've been working behind-the-scenes over the last several years to prepare the full-field development in STACK. Although many of these initiatives don't benefit us today, they will be hugely instrumental in the future. 
Here are some of the things that we've been doing in STACK. We have carefully placed our HBP wells. Our lease line pairs of HBP wells have left the acreage in the best position for future drilling and development optimization of well placements. We have nearly 2 miles of virgin surface and sub-surface acreage between about 1/3 of our HBP wells drilled to date. We've made significant investments in an extensive water infrastructure network that will allow us to efficiently source, move, store and recycle water during our upcoming development operations. 
We work to develop an expandable natural gas gathering and processing system with our partner, Mark West. Newfield and others are today considering a new open season on several proposed pipeline projects in STACK that will add 750 million cubic feet a day of takeaway in 2019 and beyond. We are confident that the infrastructure will be there to timely match our growth outlook from the basin.
Lastly, we're actively permitting for full field development and preparing for higher levels of activity in the future. We expect that about 2/3 of our wells next year in STACK will be development wells drilled from common pads. We look forward to continuing to drive down cost, exploit operational efficiencies and improve our margins.
As mentioned earlier, we closed on our recent acquisition of acreage in STACK. This was a great fit for us with about half of the acreage overlapping our legacy STACK, acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties and the remainder gives us a solid representation to the west. 
In addition to the Raptor-X pilot, we had 4 additional wells that recently commenced production. These wells are outlined on Page 9 in @NFX. The rates in these wells were impressive and range from about 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent a day to more than 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Each of these wells has strong liquids rates between 80% and 90% of the total production. We have additional wells planned in these areas for later this year. 
With strong results in STACK, we plan to increase activity in the second half of the year, and we will look for additional opportunities as we enter 2017. We today announced the revised production outlook and capital budget for 2016. We're planning to keep a rig active on our new STACK acreage and our quickening pace in days to depth is affording us the ability to drill additional wells this year with the same rig count. 
Our beginning of year plan called for the drilling of about 50 wells in STACK. Today, we estimate that we will drill more than 60 wells in 2016, including our pilots. 
Our new guidance for 2016 domestic production is 53 million to 54.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Recall that we've now raised guidance 3 times due to superior operational results year-to-date, and we are now including volumes associated with our recent STACK acquisition and additional planned activity in the second half of 2016. 
In China, our Pearl field continues to produce near peak rates and they expect the natural decline has been slower to materialize than forecast. We also increased our expectations for China due to this continued outperformance. In fact, our guidance for 2016 is now about 700,000 barrels ahead of our beginning-of-year projection. Our second half estimate for this year reflects our expectations for a natural decline as well as the timing of liftings. Pearl continues to produce near peak rates over 25,000 barrels of oil per day. 
China liftings in 2016 expected to total about 5 million barrels of oil equivalent. When combined, total company production for 2016 is now expected to be 58 million to 59.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. 
Our production guidance today includes our Eagle Ford and South Texas properties through year-end. Upon closing of these sales in late September, we plan to again update our production guidance for the year.
Our capital budget for the year is now $700 million to $750 million. There's a helpful table in today's @NFX publication that reconciles our budget back to the original $625 million to $675 million beginning of year plan. Our increased capital budget is supported by an improved outlook for 2016 cash flow from our legacy production as well as anticipated 2016 investments in our recently acquired STACK assets. In addition, we now have better clarity around the asset sales, proceeds and timing. 
In the current commodity prices, we expect that our capital spending will exceed cash flow by less than $100 million. Again, proceeds from the plant nonstrategic asset sales should be an effective tool in managing our debt levels and maintaining a superior capital structure.
So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We appreciate your interest in our company and your investment in Newfield Exploration. I'm confident that our new near-term business plan is sound and that we are executing well along the path that will make us better, more efficient and more profitable in the future. Operator, we're now ready to take the questions."

Again, year-to-date, both in terms of time, efficiency and cost. We are in a position now that we can see 95% of our legacy core position in Kingfisher and Canadian will be HBP-ed at year end, so it's rational to set up a program that is going to become increasingly development dominated. So relative to that program, we're saying that 2/3 estimate or somewhere around 2/3 of the wells we expect to drill in that acreage position in 2017 will be development wells. So to that end, that's the point that was being made there. Certainly, there are incremental efficiencies that will be gained in development. We've talked about the ability to shave somewhere around $750,000 to $1 million off of a well and drill from common pads, where you've got infrastructure and facilities in place. We believe that's still achievable, it would certainly be something that we'll realize that would translate to higher returns on a well basis. There's outstanding information that we outlined in the call that none of us have at this point and that will be the information that we pull takes some time over the next -- course of the next year or so. We and our other friends in the play will be studying the pilot data to optimize both lateral distance between horizontals laterally and vertically, the vertical offset throughout the STACK at productive intervals. So those will be pieces of the puzzle that we won't completely know, but we'll have -- we have plenty of data to know that we can enter now early phase of development with confidence and with high expectations in terms of the results. I think the last part of your question having to do with expectations per se. I would say because of those cost savings, the efficiencies, the shift to 2/3 of the spending on development wells and the ability then because it's HBP-ed, to sort highest return to lowest return areas, we'll be targeting the highest return areas of the play. And that's the part that we referenced on the call that will be very, very exciting. So team's excited. We're going to continue to execute through this year, but the teams worked hard over the last 5 or 6 years to get ready for development, and I hope they're listening in right now because I know they're going to enjoy it and have fun. We're going to have fun reporting on the results."

We've been marching through this development step-by-step with very logical approach. First step, you go back to, it was a big step change was the reduction in spacing between perf clusters. That was something we saw outstanding results a couple of years ago, and it led to the first increase in the type curve. Since that time, the team has been working on various combinations of fluid volumes and proppant and mix in terms of the fluid systems. And again, they've taken a very sequential methodical approach, so that we can understand the data that's coming back to us. Again, focused on development, not the short term. So we're at the point today where we're testing higher fluid volumes and higher proppant volumes, and I indicated in the call commentary earlier that we're seeing some encouraging signs. But a lot of that higher volume and higher proppant is fairly recent data and not really a part of most of the work that's been done in terms of the 100-well data set that's been released. And then ultimately, we know from past experience in other plays that not every area in this play will probably have the same frac recipe. And so you'll end up with some areas that you think that Option A is the best approach, other areas it will be Recipe B and some other area might be Recipe C. But in general, I'm confident that we have the data and are acquiring the data we need to optimize and I'll flip it to Gary to see if he's got any other color he wants to add."

And that's a big driver in terms of the results and the portfolio and the quality of assets we have. And I'd be remiss not to give them all a pat on the back. And, of course, the operational guys coming along behind that and driving down costs further and faster than we might have otherwise imagined, it's just icing on the cake. So the team is performing at a high level. And I'm being polite, but I'll just say that if we have anything going on in exploration and/or if we had our eye on any other acreage, the last thing I do is announce it on this call because we have a lot of friends and a lot of competition. But the truth is the big obvious packages have largely transacted. You've got 3 large transactions within the core STACK position there that we talk about just in the last 7 or 8 months. We were fortunate to pick off the one that we wanted and the other 2 went for attractive prices saying that Newfield's acreage is in a really, really good spot. So as far as I'm concerned, we've got really strong companies in the play. Credible operators. Everybody's got a great acreage position that's a big area. We're moving to the point where I think people can share and help each other optimize. It's pretty -- it's going to be a pretty exciting time for the play going forward. We'll all continue to compete with each other, because that's just what we do, and, hopefully, we can find some areas to scrap for some additional acreage.

First off, I'll just say that I think we've demonstrated over the last several years that our team, and that means the entire team, management team, asset teams, operating folks, commercial side, have become accustomed that assets have a lifecycle. And we've embedded within our leadership team the grow -- what I call the ""grow, hold or divest"" mentality, and it's something we talk about every day. Leaders throughout the organization have to ask themselves are we trying to grow an asset, are we holding this asset, are we divesting this asset? And that leads to a very healthy dialogue. So we've been consistent, I've been consistent that it's not a question of if, it's more a question of when. We have no need to sell any other assets today with the announcement of these transactions, but we all know that at the right place and time in the future that there'll be additional asset transactions. And I know that our team will perform at a very high level when that day comes. Oh, JVs.

And I do apologize, Jeff, I don't know that I've ever had a chance to talk to you about it, but we have a history of -- we kind of pioneered some of the horizontal oil developments in the shallow waters in Southeast Asia. We had operations in Malaysia where we developed several fields. The Pearl field was our first horizontal development offshore China, but I would -- as far as operated development. But I would tell you that reservoir simulators are great tools and teams do a great job of putting all the data in. But every single field, every one that we developed in Asia outperformed the initial reservoir simulation. And there's a number of reasons for it. It's fluid properties, quality of the reservoir, it's the math not being perfect when you go vertical to horizontal comparison. It's a whole host of things, but I would tell you none of us are surprised it outperformed. But when you have a lot of really talented people and reservoir simulators telling you the answer is x, you can hope and pray that it's x plus. But until you see it demonstrated, it's an unknown. So we took a conservative posture on the front end. I think it's a prudent way that the team described it. And frankly, we've benefited at Pearl by all of the things that you'd want work in your favor. There's more oil in place than probably was imputed. We're getting a higher recovery efficiency than you might otherwise have assumed. The rates have sustained themselves for far longer than any of the reservoir simulations would have predicted. And today, with a couple of years' production data, the team's able to recalibrate the reservoir simulation. And we know at some point it will go in decline, but we want to enjoy this plateau production for just as long as we can. Cash is king. Larry tells me getting the cash in the bank is the objective in China, he never lets any of us forget it."

That's what we're drilling the pilots for. I mean, I'd be doing nothing but speculating. I think that in a lateral sense, if you go off of demonstrated activities in a individual layer, 5, 6, 7 wells per horizon, you've got a lot of examples where that's worked effectively. So if I were leaning into something, I'd probably say that I would expect that kind of spacing per layer. The big question remains how many layers and what the vertical offset is going to be as you develop the other areas. We'll be optimizing, I mentioned rate of return as a driver, but ultimately, we're optimizing to maximize net present value. If you go back historically and you got to remember that a lot of these historical plays have long-term production or gas, we're producing oil here, so there are other variables. But typically, 10%, 15%, 20% type of interference related effects, impacts to EURs would be expected as you optimize. And I think we've been consistent on reminding everybody of that. And I think if you listened carefully to the call script earlier, there are a lot of factors that get involved. Oil price is a factor, well costs are a factor. We've got -- there's a continuous optimization program there, but I think the best guidance I can give everybody is that don't run with the unbounded type curves and think that's going to be just exactly what the development wells will be. If it is, then we're going to keep drilling closer until we find the optimum spacing. But at this point, we're excited, we've got strong data, hundred-plus wells, demonstrated 1.1 million-barrel EUR and the pilot projects are under way. So good place to be and a lot of good information. And as I mentioned earlier, quality operators to help us solve that problem."

I think they got the pilots moving in the right direction. It was one of the items that was very attractive to us about the package because it would accelerate our knowledge base and I think they made a smart call. And they started this one out, as I mentioned on the call, it's a 2-layer test. We've got the first 4 wells down, so it would be 6 wells per layer, 12 well DSU. The other 2 pilots that we did mention earlier, back in the second quarter, that are Newfield-operated would be the Chlouber, which is presently drilling, and the Dorothy, which is going to be drilled before year end. The spacing in these are reasonably similar. I think you can do the math. The 6-well scenario gives you 880-foot lateral spacing and the 5-well gives you 1050. So we're going to have pretty good tests kind of in that range. That's similar to the spacing that we've had in the well pairs along lease lines. So we'll have a lot of data to kind of calibrate.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter conference call and operational update. We appreciate your interest and investments in our company. 
It's easy to get distracted during the lengthy presidential election contest, where we anxiously tune in each day to hear about the latest scandal, e-mail investigation, forgotten sound bites or the poll numbers in the presidential election that are simply too close to call, and we're still 6 days out from the election. But know one thing, we at Newfield are coming to work each day to find and develop precious oil and gas commodities that America needs a lot more of for its bright economic future regardless of who gets elected. We're not distracted and we're focused on our job of adding value for our shareholders. But just a friendly reminder, if you haven't voted yet, make sure you go and exercise your rights. 
So it is November and it's hard to believe that 2016 is nearly behind us. By all accounts, Newfield has enjoyed a very strong year of performance, and we have successfully repositioned the company to compete and win both today and on the road ahead. Our teams have delivered on our strategic objectives in 2016. Including today, [ph] we raise production guidance each quarter throughout the year. Excluding acquisitions, we expect to beat our original 2016 business plan by about 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. That's 7% over our beginning of the year forecast. 
Furthermore, had we retained the Eagle Ford and South Texas assets, we would have bested guidance by nearly 4.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our beat [ph] can be attributed to operational excellence across the enterprise. We worked hard to reduce cost and improve our margins. Our domestic LOE per unit of production is down. It's expected to be down more than 20% year-over-year, and our average domestic oil differential has improved more than 20% over the last year. 
Since 2014, we've taken dramatic actions to reduce our G&A expense. We reduced our workforce by more than 30% as we consolidated our offices from Tulsa, Denver and Houston into The Woodlands, enabling us to leverage our workforce for the future. When you compare our early G&A estimates for 2017 to 2014, we will have reduced annual net domestic G&A expense by more than $50 million per year.
We upgraded our portfolio during the year by selling nonstrategic assets in Texas and acquiring more core acreage in STACK. In total, we have now divested more than 3 billion in assets since 2011 and used the proceeds to improve our balance sheet and capture premier industry-leading return plays in the Anadarko Basin. Today, we're fortunate to have options, options that clearly differentiate Newfield from other investment choices in the E&P space. We have a strong balance sheet with a net debt over adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 2x and about $480 million of cash on hand. Our 1.8 billion credit facility remains undrawn. We have attractive interest rates and laddered debt maturities with nothing due until 2022. And most importantly, our SCOOP and STACK assets are ready today for acceleration and are not dependent on higher oil prices to make them competitive investments in our landscape. These are exciting times for E&P companies that have captured large positions in onshore resource plays and are now entering the harvest mode. 
In development, results become more consistent, efficiencies are exploited en masse [ph] and value creation is evident. There's a revolution underway today in completion designs, and there are significant differences in Gen 1, Gen 2. And today's new completions for both liquids volumes and sand concentrations are moving higher. Newfield is no different. We are now moving to our third-generation completions and our transition out of HBP into full-field development should continue to show strong improvements. 
Before we move to our usual discussion of quarterly financial results and operational updates, let me provide a high level of framework on how we're approaching our business plan for 2017. This is the season for our strategic discussions with our management team and, ultimately, our Board of Directors. The various scenarios we are running today will culminate into our official guidance that is customarily disclosed in February, along with our year-end earnings. Although this work is underway, we certainly have some preliminary thoughts today that you may find helpful. 
First, we expect that oil prices will remain volatile. Although we have been encouraged by recent OPEC discussions of production freezes, oil prices today continue to hover in the mid-40s, not too dissimilar from where we were a year ago. Newfield is fortunate to have options today. Even at today's prices, we are seeing excellent returns in SCOOP and STACK, and any uplift in oil prices from here simply brightens our view. We're fortunate to control a significant position in one of the best resource plays in all of industry, and we control the pace of development. 
Second, we are working multiple scenarios today, scenarios that encompass lower for longer oil prices as well as more bullish cases that move oil prices to $50 per barrel and higher. Our preference is obviously the latter. With prices strengthening from here, we would expect to add significant drilling activity in the Anadarko Basin. Slight [ph] large reductions in our workforce over the last 2 years, we have preserved the organizational capacity to more than double our operated rig count. However, should oil prices remain weak, we have the option to invest at similar levels to 2016 and accomplish our care key near-term objectives holding acreage by production, kicking off in-fill development drilling and continuing to optimize both our well densities and completion designs. Again, these options are a competitive advantage for us and we must be prepared to play both offense or defense as appropriate for the business environment. 
Third, we have the financial capacity to comfortably execute either strategy. We can find an acceleration using cash on hand. The recent sale of our Eagle Ford and South Texas assets provides the near-term fuel [ph] to accelerate development of the SCOOP and STACK assets. We plan to use a portion of our cash balance to add rigs in the Anadarko Basin. We have recently contracted to pick up additional rigs, and we'll phase them into operation between now and early January. 
As a result, we have today instep [ph] our plan 2016 investments to about $750 million or the high end of our $700 million to $750 million guidance range for 2016. Our cash on the balance sheet from recent asset sales can be used to effectively bridge any near-term variance between our cash flow and capital investments, while allowing us to keep strong coverage ratios on our debt. Newfield truly is in an advantaged position today. We see 2017 as a momentous year that fully transitions our Anadarko Basin operations into full-field development. Since 2012, we have done [indiscernible] work to transform Newfield into a company rich in asset quality, scale and financial strength. 
Since we are just a week away from an important presidential election, I'll quote the great Ronald Reagan that famously talked about his dream for a shining city upon a hill. Newfield's shining city is for a company that combines strong production with profitability, all while living [ph] within cash flow and maintaining financial strength. For us, that shining city that we've all been working toward is just around the corner. So know that between now and February, we will create an optimized plan for 2017 that delivers long-term value for our stockholders, and we look forward to sharing more specifics with you early next year. For now, let's move on to a brief discussion of our third quarter financial and operating results. 
Our domestic production in the third quarter was 14.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, nearly 4.5% higher than the prior quarter. Today, company production was -- total company production was 15.2 million barrels or about 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent above the midpoint of our guidance. Of the total, 61% was liquids and 39% was gas. Our beat [ph] in the quarter was primarily driven by higher production from the SCOOP and STACK assets, which more than offset the 93,000-barrel impact associated with the sale of our South Texas assets during the third quarter.
For the third quarter, we had net income of $0.24 per diluted share. In our news release, we detailed certain items that negatively impacted earnings by a combined $0.21 per share. Excluding these items, net income for the third quarter was $89 million or $0.45 per share on revenues of $392 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $209 million, and discretionary cash flow from operations was $183 million. Our cash operating expenses adjusted for onetime charges for the third quarter stated on a unit of production basis were below our guidance ranges for the quarter. You can see the positive impact we have made on our cash operating expenses, and this will lead to improved profitability in the future.
We're seeing a continued improvement on our price realizations, driven largely by our new pipeline transportation agreements that move STACK barrels to Cushing. Demand is strong for these high-quality barrels, and recent batch sales have sold for [ph] NYMEX WTI plus $0.60 to $0.80 per barrel. After transportation expense, we have most recently been netting NYMEX less $1.70 per barrel. This is improving our average differential across the company. Our recent Eagle Ford and South Texas asset sales restored the balance sheet and provided cash on hand of about $480 million. This allows us maximum flexibility to play offense or defense as the situation dictates.
We have included a table at @NFX today that provides a detailed look at our production volumes. From this table, you can see our outperformance in 2016 from legacy Newfield assets as well as the impact from our recent South Texas asset sales. Consistent with our usual practice, we will provide official guidance on 2017 capital investments and production expectations in February of next year.
So let's talk now in more detail about the Anadarko Basin. In today's @NFX publication, we have provided updates on our recent drilling campaign. Today's results include an update on SXL and XL wells or long and short laterals. The good news is that our results continue to be very consistent. As we work with our [ph] HBP drilling requirements this year, we've drilled more than 20 XL wells to 5,000-foot laterals. These short lateral wells had very strong performance, as you can see on Page 7, in the @NFX publication. However, we've proven time and again that SXL wells are still the preferred path to optimize capital efficiency and maximize net present value. 
On Page 6, we provided an update on a few recent SXL wells, along with the Raptor-X infill pilot. This pilot includes 4 producing wells that were drilled to test 6 wells for [ph] layer spacing. This would have resulted in a 12-well spacing configuration for 2 layers of Meramec. With wells drilled at approximately 880-feet apart, the Raptor is continuing to show strong results after 120 days, averaging about 1,050 barrels of oil equivalent per day over that period.
Important to know [ph] is the difference in completion design on the Raptor, which we inherited in our Chesapeake asset acquisition earlier this year and our current design that we're implementing today on our Chlouber and Dorothy pilots. The Raptor was completed with a lesser design of 1,700 pounds of sand per foot and 800 gallons of liquids per foot. Although we are encouraged by what we see for Raptor-X today in terms of production and the cost were significantly less on these smaller jobs, we are looking forward to the latest completion designs consisting of 2,100 pounds of sand per foot with 2,100 gallons of liquid per foot on the completion. 
Industry is extremely active today with development pilots in STACK. In fact, today, there are about 25 pilots currently underway and/or planned by 7 different operators. Newfield has or will have an interest in nearly half of these infill pilots. This is great news for us as we can learn and use realtime information to tweak and adapt our spacing and completion designs on the road ahead. 
There's a tremendous amount of information being gathered today that will benefit our development operations in the months and years ahead. Spacing configurations today vary greatly with everything imaginable being tested. The good news is, to date, we have not seen any data that suggests any of the wells are being too tightly drilled. It is early and we will need to capture 12 to 24 months of production data from these various pilots to make a more definitive final conclusion on optimized spacing. We will find the right configuration that yields the best value proposition for our shareholders. 
So let there be no doubt about it, we are seeing the same things in SCOOP and STACK as evident in other active basins. Bigger volumes and more proppant [ph] seems to be better when it comes to completions. As I said earlier, our upcoming operated pilots were large [ph] completions, and we expect to see continued improving results. We are now completing our Chlouber pilot, and the Dorothy pilot has just concluded drilling. Meaningful production results in both will be available early next year. Both the Chlouber and the Dorothy completions will have stimulation jobs consisting of 2,100 pounds of sand and 2,100 gallons of fluid per foot. 
Our original well at Dorothy was drilled back in 2015. This well was completed with 1,650 pounds of sand per foot and 1,000 gallons of liquid per foot. Our production from this well was drove [ph] back in its early days due to gas takeaway constraints at that time. This well originally produced upcasing [ph] with 4,000 psi flowing tubing pressure. However, now that we have 250 days of production, the camps [ph] from this will are very impressive and we think one of the best in the industry. The well has averaged about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over those first 250 days of production, and that production is nearly 70% black oil. 
Today's new completion designs should demonstrate our wells are just as prolific as many of the recent data points in the Blaine and Kingfisher County line area. We estimate these wells will cost up to $2 million more than the older well designs. However, the EUR and production uplift are expected to drive material value creation. 
Our goal today is pretty simple, figure out the best path forward for decades of development activity that we have in front of us. We're looking forward to entering development mode in 2017, and we know from our experience and other resource plays that as we transition into path [ph] and onto [ph] drilling, our production will be a little lumpier early on than in quarters past when drilling in HBP mode where you had single wells on individual joint spacing units. You're starting to see that today as we have had our STACK rigs tied up on the Chlouber and Dorothy multi-well [ph] pilots over the last several weeks. This will likely smooth out in the second half of 2017 as more paths commence production and we build a stable wedge of base production around them. We'll have more to share with you in February when we talk with you about more definitive plans for 2017. 
So I can close our prepared remarks this morning. [ph] Before I open it up to take your questions, let me summarize the key takeaways we hope you heard in today's call. First, Newfield is in an advantaged [ph] position today. We are executing extremely well, and we have options to differentiate our story from the pack. Second, STACK is a great asset, the kind of asset that can drive our production growth and profitability well into the future. Today, we can see the end of the HBP phase and are preparing to kick off an exciting development campaign. Although there was still commodity price uncertainty, we are confident in our ability to deliver great returns in STACK and are planning to add activity as we enter 2017. 
As I said earlier, we can pull back the reins if oil prices deteriorate from here. Lastly, we're gathering critical data in STACK that will lead us to the optimal well spacing and completion designs. With our operated drillings and active programs from our peers, we will have answers to these important questions soon and we'll be applying them to our development plans as we progress. 
Thanks again for your time today. Operator, we're now ready to take questions."

And I think we've got well documented that we're seeing consisting results at more than 100 wells that we released [ph] across there. So no change in that regard. As you move west, you move into the volatile oil region and quickly thereafter into what we call the wet gas condensate region. I know everybody's got a lot of different ways that they talk about that. The yield on terms of NGLs generally is 100 barrels per million or greater, somewhere in that ZIP Code. So when you go through the math, black oil, liquid barrels at the surface, that's what I was referencing in terms of the well performance on that well. I think after 250-plus days, I think it is that -- total average cut there was 70%. If you go back to the original footprint there on the east that we did much of the drilling on the first 2, 3 years in the play and those 100-plus wells, I think, historically, you've seen that those wells have performed kind of in that 75%, 80% oil cut [ph] range as well.

And clearly, I think we've said it in this call, and I know we've said it in the past, that one of the lessons learned here at Newfield that we remind ourselves every day that, yes, you got to have great quality assets. We have that. You've got to have a strong balance sheet. We've got that. Both of those have been kind of earned wins by the team and [ph] our investors over the last several years. We know we can go faster. We've talked about having the ability to accelerate activity. But the truth is, you need to go faster at the right time. So when we think about the volatility in the space since the slide started back in September 2014, I actually think and I quoted [ph] in New York back in early September that when everybody started talking about production growth, production growth, production growth, it sounded a lot like discussions in 2014 previously. And we just don't believe that production growth at any cost makes sense. So we want to stay financially strong. We want to make smart decisions on our assets. We want to maximize value for the shareholders, and we're going to take kind of an all-of-the-above approach to those considerations. But the volatility in the space is real and it's something that we're going to stay closely attuned to. And frankly, I think that should oil prices hang in this ZIP Code or deteriorate from here, you're going to hear a storyline there that's going to sound a lot like what we've talked about previously where we're going to go ahead and do the things that we need to do, and we'll wait for a better day to go faster. Having said all of that, we are optimistically adding rigs to accelerate our knowledge capture in terms of the pilot projects, so that we can expedite getting to the most efficient development. So we're going to have additional momentum going into 2017, but we'll wait till we've had discussions with our board next week and define [ph] all our plan at the February board meeting before we talk any more specifically of [ph] that."

So [indiscernible] a lot more profit volume. Pressure pumping is not profit free either. So as you raise the volume of fluid and the volume of sand being pumped, you're adding cost in the completion. So what you would say is that maybe the completions are $1 million to as much as $2 million higher than what we would've talked about a year ago. The uplift in EUR should translate to a lower F&D and an improved rate of return picture on an individual well basis. So today, just thinking through those costs that we were talking about, wells with a 6 on them, we'd be talking about wells that are probably in the $7 million to $9 million for a 10,000-foot lateral. That's an important point. A lot of the numbers looking around out in the industry, and you guys make sure you talk to people about exactly what well they're talking about. A lot of the wells that you hear about in the play that have sixes in front of them today are 5,000-foot laterals. And that other 5,000 feet, both on drilling and completion, is not free. So you need to make sure that your -- you keep up with the mix in individual companies have in terms of 5,000 and 10,000-foot laterals.

And then we announced the play a couple of years later. We've been pretty diligent about our approach in data collection, completion designs. Been kind of methodical, but it's good. It allows us to talk about consistently in the play to prove it. We're now stepping of activity in terms of volumes in proppant, doing that in concert with industry. and the truth is the downturn on the commodity has provided a great time for all of us and our peer companies in the plays to experiment. So we're experimenting on accelerated basis. Way back when, those early days, we started talking about the play in 2013. I remember saying more than once that we thought there were probably 3 to 5 levels, layers, if you will, that could ultimately be exploited across that acreage footprint where those 100-plus wells have been delivered successfully. We certainly still believe that today. So if you wanted to think about the Meramec section, I would say it's 3 or more, depending upon how tight the vertical spacing can be as we work through that part of the equation. You've got the Woodford, which is a horizon that exists for us all of that footprint. So certainly, it will be exploited. And you've got the Osage where you've got people talking today about test kind of east and north and on the periphery of the acreage footprint. And frankly, that oil-saturated interval cuts across the entirety of our position up there. So I still think that there'll be 3 to 5 layers ultimately exploited. A lot of data yet to be acquired to know that down. And frankly, the optimist in the crowd could say that you can put a 5 plus on the back end because if we're able to prove that you can stack the wells in closer vertically, then there'll be more layers greater than 5 exploited ultimately. So that's how I would explain it."

Well, that will be technical cost piece as well. The technical data will tell us when you're too close or too far and we'll move to optimize that, and certainly, that's going to be a viable. There are actually geologic layers. You all talk about Meramec, Osage, Woodford. They are 3 geologic, but the Meramec is thick enough that you could see that ultimately split into multiple levels. And there are, frankly, portions of the Woodford where you can see that happen as well. And we'll all have to drill wells in the Osage to figure out what the answer is there because that's an area where we know it's all saturated and it's got all the right attributes. But we have drilling in the horizontal wells area. Will try to do that in the first half of 2017. That will be part of our program. So hopefully that helps, but stay tuned.

And I'll give you some reasons to think about that. You view of a lot of pull DSU top to bottom on all of these layers. You could have capital burn for a better part of the year, and we'd be telling you that if we follow that approach fully and completely that production occurs sometime the year following. So it's probably going to be a trade-off and probably going to be some efforts there that you need to consider when you think about modeling companies.

When you go from single wells drilled complete produced and a time frame that has shrunk down to where you could do that inside of 30 to 45 days to multi-well pads, you're now talking about months between spotting the first well and completing the last well before you can actually stimulate production. So you guys have seen that. Just be aware it's going to be part of the equation over the next couple of years as we and the industry translate -- transition into full field development."

I think that's been demonstrated this point in time. The things we don't fully know and understand and appreciate this point are going to be it's not just the lateral asset dimension. I think we've got enough test going on in the industry right now that you'll be able to cover the landscape between 4 and probably 8 wells per horizon or let's call it per layer. What is the interrelationship going to be as you start adding additional layers, how close can you put those players to each other? That's the variable that we think about is going to be pretty important. And frankly, as we said earlier, an answer to one of the other questions, there could be trade offs. It could be that you back off on fluid volumes and proppant in development mode because you understand what those interrelationships are. You deliver a cheaper, more efficient well, and you fully exploit the resource for maximum value. I mean, I could imagine that being a scenario. If you look at isolation with the data that we and industry have accumulated here in the play, generally, there is a positive correlation between increased fluid volumes. So that probably means that the fluids out of this thing is creating more fractures and more fracture complexity. You put more proper way in that same regard then it's probably transported farther from the well and get better propped fractures. And as our guys, John, likes to remind me, it's about stimulated rock volumes. So that would be the drainage volume of an individual well. You can kind of understand those trade-offs. Not too hard to get your mind around it. But right now, when we look at the endpoint -- midpoints that we have in the data set, we had situations where proppant was prompted 2:1 relative to fluid. We're closer to 1:1. I think that's probably true for a lot of the industry as well. That probably says that both are important and right now, it seems like having those in similar amounts is ratio 1:1 is probably a better answer than the proppant loaded scenarios that we saw earlier in the development of the play."

I think the other thing I'll remind you of, the  complexity issues and the pilot projects, vertical and horizontal dimensions that we've got optimized on, that will have some impact as well. When we put up the updated type curve, we have 100-plus wells in that full data set. And we're very careful to point out that those wells are all unbounded, which means they were single wells for the most part on individual DSUs. We know as we move into development that we and the peers will all be chasing what I call constructive interference, i.e. that you're going to get to a point where you actually see interference between wells so that you know that you effectively completed the resource. That will be a different well in all likelihood than the types of wells that are populating the data set today. So just kind of stay tuned and kind of listen to the data points, and we'll land on the right solution. But clearly, the well that we drill today with more fluid, more proppant, tighter spacing between perf clusters will be bigger wells in their right than the wells that we drilled 2 or 3 years ago in the play. No doubt about that."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter conference call and operational update. We appreciate your interest and investments in our company. 
It's easy to get distracted during the lengthy presidential election contest, where we anxiously tune in each day to hear about the latest scandal, e-mail investigation, forgotten sound bites or the poll numbers in the presidential election that are simply too close to call, and we're still 6 days out from the election. But know one thing, we at Newfield are coming to work each day to find and develop precious oil and gas commodities that America needs a lot more of for its bright economic future regardless of who gets elected. We're not distracted and we're focused on our job of adding value for our shareholders. But just a friendly reminder, if you haven't voted yet, make sure you go and exercise your rights. 
So it is November and it's hard to believe that 2016 is nearly behind us. By all accounts, Newfield has enjoyed a very strong year of performance, and we have successfully repositioned the company to compete and win both today and on the road ahead. Our teams have delivered on our strategic objectives in 2016. Including today, we raised production guidance each quarter throughout the year. Excluding acquisitions, we expect to beat our original 2016 business plan by about 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. That's 7% over our beginning of the year forecast. 
Furthermore, had we retained the Eagle Ford and South Texas assets, we would have bested guidance by nearly 4.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our beat can be attributed to operational excellence across the enterprise. We worked hard to reduce cost and improve our margins. Our domestic LOE per unit of production is down. It's expected to be down more than 20% year-over-year, and our average domestic oil differential has improved more than 20% over the last year. 
Since 2014, we've taken dramatic actions to reduce our G&A expense. We reduced our workforce by more than 30% as we consolidated our offices from Tulsa, Denver and Houston into The Woodlands, enabling us to leverage our workforce for the future. When you compare our early G&A estimates for 2017 to 2014, we will have reduced annual net domestic G&A expense by more than $50 million per year.
We upgraded our portfolio during the year by selling nonstrategic assets in Texas and acquiring more core acreage in STACK. In total, we have now divested more than 3 billion in assets since 2011 and used the proceeds to improve our balance sheet and capture premier industry-leading return plays in the Anadarko Basin. Today, we're fortunate to have options, options that clearly differentiate Newfield from other investment choices in the E&P space. We have a strong balance sheet with a net debt over adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 2x and about $480 million of cash on hand. Our 1.8 billion credit facility remains undrawn. We have attractive interest rates and laddered debt maturities with nothing due until 2022. And most importantly, our SCOOP and STACK assets are ready today for acceleration and are not dependent on higher oil prices to make them competitive investments in our landscape. These are exciting times for E&P companies that have captured large positions in onshore resource plays and are now entering the harvest mode. 
In development, results become more consistent, efficiencies are exploited en masse and value creation is evident. There's a revolution underway today in completion designs, and there are significant differences in Gen 1, Gen 2. And today's new completions for both liquids volumes and sand concentrations are moving higher. Newfield is no different. We are now moving to our third-generation completions and our transition out of HBP into full-field development should continue to show strong improvements. 
Before we move to our usual discussion of quarterly financial results and operational updates, let me provide a high level of framework on how we're approaching our business plan for 2017. This is the season for our strategic discussions with our management team and, ultimately, our Board of Directors. The various scenarios we are running today will culminate into our official guidance that is customarily disclosed in February, along with our year-end earnings. Although this work is underway, we certainly have some preliminary thoughts today that you may find helpful. 
First, we expect that oil prices will remain volatile. Although we have been encouraged by recent OPEC discussions of production freezes, oil prices today continue to hover in the mid-40s, not too dissimilar from where we were a year ago. Newfield is fortunate to have options today. Even at today's prices, we are seeing excellent returns in SCOOP and STACK, and any uplift in oil prices from here simply brightens our view. We're fortunate to control a significant position in one of the best resource plays in all of industry, and we control the pace of development. 
Second, we are working multiple scenarios today, scenarios that encompass lower for longer oil prices as well as more bullish cases that move oil prices to $50 per barrel and higher. Our preference is obviously the latter. With prices strengthening from here, we would expect to add significant drilling activity in the Anadarko Basin. Despite large reductions on our workforce over the last 2 years, we have preserved the organizational capacity to more than double our operated rig count. However, should oil prices remain weak, we have the option to invest at similar levels to 2016 and accomplish our care key near-term objectives holding acreage by production, kicking off in-fill development drilling and continuing to optimize both our well densities and completion designs. Again, these options are a competitive advantage for us and we must be prepared to play both offense or defense as appropriate for the business environment. 
Third, we have the financial capacity to comfortably execute either strategy. We can find an acceleration using cash on hand. The recent sale of our Eagle Ford and South Texas assets provides the near-term fuel to accelerate development of the SCOOP and STACK assets. We plan to use a portion of our cash balance to add rigs in the Anadarko Basin. We have recently contracted to pick up additional rigs, and we'll phase them into operation between now and early January. 
As a result, we have today inched up our planned 2016 investments to about $750 million or the high end of our $700 million to $750 million guidance range for 2016. Our cash on the balance sheet from recent asset sales can be used to effectively bridge any near-term variance between our cash flow and capital investments, while allowing us to keep strong coverage ratios on our debt. Newfield truly is in an advantaged position today. We see 2017 as a momentous year that fully transitions our Anadarko Basin operations into full-field development. Since 2012, we have done yeomen's work to transform Newfield into a company rich in asset quality, scale and financial strength. 
Since we are just a week away from an important presidential election, I'll quote the great Ronald Reagan that famously talked about his dream for a shining city upon a hill. Newfield's shining city is for a company that combines strong production with profitability, all while living within cash flow and maintaining financial strength. For us, that shining city that we've all been working toward is just around the corner. So know that between now and February, we will create an optimized plan for 2017 that delivers long-term value for our stockholders, and we look forward to sharing more specifics with you early next year. For now, let's move on to a brief discussion of our third quarter financial and operating results. 
Our domestic production in the third quarter was 14.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, nearly 4.5% higher than the prior quarter. Today, company production was -- total company production was 15.2 million barrels or about 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent above the midpoint of our guidance. Of the total, 61% was liquids and 39% was gas. Our beat in the quarter was primarily driven by higher production from the SCOOP and STACK assets, which more than offset the 93,000-barrel impact associated with the sale of our South Texas assets during the third quarter.
For the third quarter, we had net income of $0.24 per diluted share. In our news release, we detailed certain items that negatively impacted earnings by a combined $0.21 per share. Excluding these items, net income for the third quarter was $89 million or $0.45 per share on revenues of $392 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $209 million, and discretionary cash flow from operations was $183 million. Our cash operating expenses adjusted for onetime charges for the third quarter stated on a unit of production basis were below our guidance ranges for the quarter. You can see the positive impact we have made on our cash operating expenses, and this will lead to improved profitability in the future.
We're seeing a continued improvement on our price realizations, driven largely by our new pipeline transportation agreements that move STACK barrels to Cushing. Demand is strong for these high-quality barrels, and recent batch sales have sold for NYMEX WTI plus $0.60 to $0.80 per barrel. After transportation expense, we have most recently been netting NYMEX less $1.70 per barrel. This is improving our average differential across the company. Our recent Eagle Ford and South Texas asset sales restored the balance sheet and provided cash on hand of about $480 million. This allows us maximum flexibility to play offense or defense as the situation dictates.
We have included a table at @NFX today that provides a detailed look at our production volumes. From this table, you can see our outperformance in 2016 from legacy Newfield assets as well as the impact from our recent South Texas asset sales. Consistent with our usual practice, we will provide official guidance on 2017 capital investments and production expectations in February of next year.
So let's talk now in more detail about the Anadarko Basin. In today's @NFX publication, we have provided updates on our recent drilling campaign. Today's results include an update on SXL and XL wells or long and short laterals. The good news is that our results continue to be very consistent. As we work with our HBP drilling requirements this year, we've drilled more than 20 XL wells to 5,000-foot laterals. These short lateral wells had very strong performance, as you can see on Page 7, in the @NFX publication. However, we've proven time and again that SXL wells are still the preferred path to optimize capital efficiency and maximize net present value. 
On Page 6, we provided an update on a few recent SXL wells, along with the Raptor-X infill pilot. This pilot includes 4 producing wells that were drilled to test 6 wells per layer of spacing. This would have resulted in a 12-well spacing configuration for 2 layers of Meramec. With wells drilled at approximately 880-feet apart, the Raptor is continuing to show strong results after 120 days, averaging about 1,050 barrels of oil equivalent per day over that period.
Important to know is the difference in completion design on the Raptor, which we inherited in our Chesapeake asset acquisition earlier this year and our current design that we're implementing today on our Chlouber and Dorothy pilots. The Raptor was completed with a lesser design of 1,700 pounds of sand per foot and 800 gallons of liquids per foot. Although we are encouraged by what we see for Raptor-X today in terms of production and the cost were significantly less on these smaller jobs, we are looking forward to the latest completion designs consisting of 2,100 pounds of sand per foot with 2,100 gallons of liquid per foot on the completion. 
Industry is extremely active today with development pilots in STACK. In fact, today, there are about 25 pilots currently underway and/or planned by 7 different operators. Newfield has or will have an interest in nearly half of these infill pilots. This is great news for us as we can learn and use realtime information to tweak and adapt our spacing and completion designs on the road ahead. 
There's a tremendous amount of information being gathered today that will benefit our development operations in the months and years ahead. Spacing configurations today vary greatly with everything imaginable being tested. The good news is, to date, we have not seen any data that suggests any of the wells are being too tightly drilled. It is early and we will need to capture 12 to 24 months of production data from these various pilots to make a more definitive final conclusion on optimized spacing. We will find the right configuration that yields the best value proposition for our shareholders. 
So let there be no doubt about it, we are seeing the same things in SCOOP and STACK as evident in other active basins. Bigger volumes and more proppant seems to be better when it comes to completions. As I said earlier, our upcoming operated pilots were larger completions, and we expect to see continued improving results. We are now completing our Chlouber pilot, and the Dorothy pilot has just concluded drilling. Meaningful production results in both will be available early next year. Both the Chlouber and the Dorothy completions will have stimulation jobs consisting of 2,100 pounds of sand and 2,100 gallons of fluid per foot. 
Our original well at Dorothy was drilled back in 2015. This well was completed with 1,650 pounds of sand per foot and 1,000 gallons of liquid per foot. Our production from this well was choked back in its early days due to gas takeaway constraints at that time. This well originally produced upcasing with 4,000 psi flowing tubing pressure. However, now that we have 250 days of production, accums from this well are very impressive and we think one of the best in the industry. The well has averaged about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over those first 250 days of production, and that production is nearly 70% black oil. 
Today's new completion designs should demonstrate our wells are just as prolific as many of the recent data points in the Blaine and Kingfisher County line area. We estimate these wells will cost up to $2 million more than the older well designs. However, the EUR and production uplift are expected to drive material value creation. 
Our goal today is pretty simple, figure out the best path forward for decades of development activity that we have in front of us. We're looking forward to entering development mode in 2017, and we know from our experience and other resource plays that as we transition into pad then onto drilling, our production will be a little lumpier early on than in quarters past when drilling in HBP mode where you had single wells on individual joint spacing units. You're starting to see that today as we have had our STACK rigs tied up on the Chlouber and Dorothy multi-well pilots over the last several weeks. This will likely smooth out in the second half of 2017 as more paths commence production and we build a stable wedge of base production around them. We'll have more to share with you in February when we talk with you about more definitive plans for 2017. 
So I can close our prepared remarks this morning. Before I open it up to take your questions, let me summarize the key takeaways that we hope you heard in today's call. First, Newfield is in an advantaged position today. We are executing extremely well, and we have options to differentiate our story from the pack. Second, STACK is a great asset, the kind of asset that can drive our production growth and profitability well into the future. Today, we can see the end of the HBP phase and are preparing to kick off an exciting development campaign. Although there was still commodity price uncertainty, we are confident in our ability to deliver great returns in STACK and are planning to add activity as we enter 2017. 
As I said earlier, we can pull back the reins if oil prices deteriorate from here. Lastly, we're gathering critical data in STACK that will lead us to the optimal well spacing and completion designs. With our operated drillings and active programs from our peers, we will have answers to these important questions soon and we'll be applying them to our development plans as we progress. 
Thanks again for your time today. Operator, we're now ready to take questions."

And I think we've got well documented that we're seeing consisting results at more than 100 wells that we've released across there. So no change in that regard. As you move west, you move into the volatile oil region and quickly thereafter into what we call the wet gas condensate region. I know everybody's got a lot of different ways that they talk about that. The yield on terms of NGLs generally is 100 barrels per million or greater, somewhere in that ZIP Code. So when you go through the math, black oil, liquid barrels at the surface, that's what I was referencing in terms of the well performance on that well. I think after 250-plus days, I think it is that -- total average cut there was 70%. If you go back to the original footprint there on the east that we did much of the drilling on the first 2, 3 years in the play and those 100-plus wells, I think, historically, you've seen that those wells have performed kind of in that 75%, 80% oil cut range as well.

And clearly, I think we've said it in this call, and I know we've said it in the past, that one of the lessons learned here at Newfield that we remind ourselves every day that, yes, you got to have great quality assets. We have that. You've got to have a strong balance sheet. We've got that. Both of those have been kind of earned wins by the team and our investors over the last several years. We know we can go faster. We've talked about having the ability to accelerate activity. But the truth is, you need to go faster at the right time. So when we think about the volatility in the space since the slide started back in September 2014, I actually think I quipped in New York back in early September that when everybody started talking about production growth, production growth, production growth, it sounded a lot like discussions in 2014 previously. And we just don't believe that production growth at any cost makes sense. So we want to stay financially strong. We want to make smart decisions on our assets. We want to maximize value for the shareholders, and we're going to take kind of an all-of-the-above approach to those considerations. But the volatility in the space is real and it's something that we're going to stay closely attuned to. And frankly, I think that should oil prices hang in this ZIP Code or deteriorate from here, you're going to hear a storyline there that's going to sound a lot like what we've talked about previously where we're going to go ahead and do the things that we need to do, and we'll wait for a better day to go faster. Having said all of that, we are optimistically adding rigs to accelerate our knowledge capture in terms of the pilot projects, so that we can expedite getting to the most efficient development. So we're going to have additional momentum going into 2017, but we'll wait till we've had discussions with our board next week and we final our plan at the February board meeting before we talk any more specifically about that."

So you probably got a lot more proppant volume. Pressure pumping is not free either. So as you raise the volume of fluid and the volume of sand being pumped, you're adding cost in the completions. So what you would say is that maybe the completions are $1 million to as much as $2 million higher than what we would have talked about a year ago. The uplift in EUR should translate to a lower F&D and an improved rate of return picture on an individual well basis. So today, just thinking through those costs that we were talking about, wells with the 6 on them, we'd be talking about wells that are probably in the $7 million to $9 million for a 10,000-foot lateral. That's an important point. There are a lot of numbers floating around out in the industry, and you guys should always make sure you talk to people about exactly what well they're talking about. And a lot of the wells that you hear about in the play that have sixes in front of them today are 5,000-foot laterals. And that other 5,000 feet, both on drilling and completion, is not free. So you need to make sure that your -- you keep up with the mix that individual companies have in terms of 5,000 and 10,000-foot laterals.

And then we announced the play a couple of years later. We've been pretty diligent about our approach in data collection, completion designs. Been kind of methodical, but it's good. It allows us to talk about consistency in the play to prove it. We're now stepping up activity in terms of fluid volumes in proppant, doing that in concert with industry. And the truth is, the downturn on the commodity has provided a great time for all of us and our peer companies in the plays to experiment. So we're experimenting on an accelerated basis. Way back when, those early days, we started talking about the play in 2013, I remember saying more than once that we thought there were probably 3 to 5 levels, layers, if you will, that could ultimately be exploited across that acreage footprint where those 100-plus wells have been delivered successfully. We certainly still believe that today. So if you wanted to think about the Meramec section, I would say it's 3 or more, depending upon how tight the vertical spacing can be as we work through that part of the equation. You've got the Woodford, which is a horizon that exists across all of that footprint. So certainly, I think, it will be exploited. And you've got the Osage where you've got people talking today about test kind of east and north and on the periphery of the acreage footprint. And frankly, that oil-saturated interval cuts across the entirety of our position up there. So I still think that there'll be 3 to 5 layers ultimately exploited. A lot of data yet to be acquired to nail that down. And frankly, the optimist in the crowd could say that you can put a 5-plus on the back end because if we're able to prove that you can stack the wells in closer vertically, then there'll be more layers greater than 5 exploited ultimately. So that's how I would explain it."

You just think about the factors you got to deal with. You got oil price. That's going to be a big deal, okay? So that will dictate how close you drill wells. Number of layers. Well, that will be a technical cost piece as well. The technical data will tell us when you're too close or too far and we'll move to optimize that. And certainly, that's going to be a variable. There are actually geologic layers. We talk about Meramec, Osage, Woodford. They're 3 geologic layers, but the Meramec is thick enough that you could see that ultimately split into multiple levels. And there are, frankly, portions of the Woodford where you could see that happen as well. And we'll all have to drill wells in the Osage to figure out what the answer is there because that's an area where we know it's all saturated and it's got all the right attributes. But we had to drill in the horizontal wells area. We'll plan to do that in the first half of 2017. That will be part of our program. So hopefully that helps, but stay tuned.

We're just going to have to work through what the optimal scenario there is. And I'll give you some reasons to think about that. You drill out a full DSU, top to bottom, on all of these layers. You could have capital burn for the better part of the year, and we'd be telling you that if we follow that approach fully and completely that production occurs sometime the year following. So it's probably going to be a trade-off and probably going to be some efforts there that you'll need to consider when you think about modeling companies.

When you go from single wells drilled, complete, produce, at a time frame that has shrunk down to where you could do that inside of 30 to 45 days to multi-well pads, you're now talking about months between spotting the first well and completing the last well before you can actually stimulate production.

I think that's been demonstrated this point in time. The things we don't fully know and understand and appreciate at this point are going to be the -- it's not just the lateral offset dimension. I think we've got enough tests going on in the industry right now that you'll be able to cover the landscape between 4 and probably 8 wells per horizon or let's call it per layer. What is the interrelationship going to be as you start adding additional layers and how close can you put those players to each other, that's the variable that we think about that is going to be pretty important. And frankly, as I said earlier, answer to one of the other questions, there could be trade offs. It could be that you back off on fluid volumes and proppant in development mode because you understand what those interrelationships are. You deliver a cheaper, more efficient well, and you fully exploit the resource maximum value. I mean, I could imagine that being a scenario. If you look at isolation with the data that we in the industry have accumulated here in the play, generally, there is a positive correlation between increased fluid volumes. So that probably means that the fluids out of this thing is creating more fractures and more fracture complexity. If you put more prop away in that same regard then it's probably transported farther from the well and get better propped fractures. And then as our guys, John Jasek, likes to remind me, it's about stimulated rock volumes. So that would be the drainage volume of an individual well. You can kind of understand those trade-offs, not too hard to get your mind around it. But right now, when we look at the endpoints that we have in the data set, we had situations where proppant was prompted 2:1 relative to fluid. We're closer to 1:1 today, I think that's probably true for a lot of the industry as well. That probably says that both are important. And right now, it seems like having those in similar amounts is -- ratio 1:1, is probably a better answer than the proppant loaded scenarios that we saw earlier in the development of the play."

We know as we move into development that we and the peers will all be chasing what I call constructive interference, i.e., that you're going to get to a point where you actually see interference between wells so that you know that you effectively completed the resource. That will be a different well in all likelihood than the types of wells that are populating the data set today. So just kind of stay tuned and kind of listen to the data points, and we'll land on the right solution. But clearly, the wells that we drilled today with the more fluid, more proppant, tighter spacing between prop clusters will be bigger wells in their own right than the wells that were drilled 2 or 3 years ago in the play. No doubt about that."

Ultimately, we could see percentages a little higher, a little lower than that depending upon capital spend and pace. That's how I been thinking about that. As far as the -- I think I've talked long enough, I almost forgot the part of your question, but I think the other question was a cost question on synergies. I think we've been pretty consistent when you go from HBP mode with single wells on DSU to development mode. There's probably somewhere in the $0.75 million to maybe $1 million of total cost synergies that you're able to capture in development mode. I think those numbers will probably still be pretty good estimates today.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter conference call and operational update. We appreciate your interest and investments in our company. 
It's easy to get distracted during the lengthy presidential election contest, where we anxiously tune in each day to hear about the latest scandal, e-mail investigation, forgotten sound bites or the poll numbers in the presidential election that are simply too close to call, and we're still 6 days out from the election. But know one thing, we at Newfield are coming to work each day to find and develop precious oil and gas commodities that America needs a lot more of for its bright economic future regardless of who gets elected. We're not distracted and we're focused on our job of adding value for our shareholders. But just a friendly reminder, if you haven't voted yet, make sure you go and exercise your rights. 
So it is November and it's hard to believe that 2016 is nearly behind us. By all accounts, Newfield has enjoyed a very strong year of performance, and we have successfully repositioned the company to compete and win both today and on the road ahead. Our teams have delivered on our strategic objectives in 2016. Including today, we raised production guidance each quarter throughout the year. Excluding acquisitions, we expect to beat our original 2016 business plan by about 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. That's 7% over our beginning of the year forecast. 
Furthermore, had we retained the Eagle Ford and South Texas assets, we would have bested guidance by nearly 4.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our beat can be attributed to operational excellence across the enterprise. We worked hard to reduce cost and improve our margins. Our domestic LOE per unit of production is down. It's expected to be down more than 20% year-over-year, and our average domestic oil differential has improved more than 20% over the last year. 
Since 2014, we've taken dramatic actions to reduce our G&A expense. We reduced our workforce by more than 30% as we consolidated our offices from Tulsa, Denver and Houston into The Woodlands, enabling us to leverage our workforce for the future. When you compare our early G&A estimates for 2017 to 2014, we will have reduced annual net domestic G&A expense by more than $50 million per year.
We high-graded our portfolio during the year by selling nonstrategic assets in Texas and acquiring more core acreage in STACK. In total, we have now divested more than 3 billion in assets since 2011 and used the proceeds to improve our balance sheet and capture premier industry-leading return plays in the Anadarko Basin. Today, we're fortunate to have options, options that clearly differentiate Newfield from other investment choices in the E&P space. We have a strong balance sheet with a net debt over adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 2x and about $480 million of cash on hand. Our 1.8 billion credit facility remains undrawn. We have attractive interest rates and laddered debt maturities with nothing due until 2022. And most importantly, our SCOOP and STACK assets are ready today for acceleration and are not dependent on higher oil prices to make them competitive investments in our landscape. These are exciting times for E&P companies that have captured large positions in onshore resource plays and are now entering the harvest mode. 
In development, results become more consistent, efficiencies are exploited en masse and value creation is evident. There's a revolution underway today in completion designs, and there are significant differences in Gen 1, Gen 2. And today's new completions for both liquids volumes and sand concentrations are moving higher. Newfield is no different. We are now moving to our third-generation completions and our transition out of HBP into full-field development should continue to show strong improvements. 
Before we move to our usual discussion of quarterly financial results and operational updates, let me provide a high level of framework on how we're approaching our business plan for 2017. This is the season for our strategic discussions with our management team and, ultimately, our Board of Directors. The various scenarios we are running today will culminate into our official guidance that is customarily disclosed in February, along with our year-end earnings. Although this work is underway, we certainly have some preliminary thoughts today that you may find helpful. 
First, we expect that oil prices will remain volatile. Although we have been encouraged by recent OPEC discussions of production freezes, oil prices today continue to hover in the mid-40s, not too dissimilar from where we were a year ago. Newfield is fortunate to have options today. Even at today's prices, we are seeing excellent returns in SCOOP and STACK, and any uplift in oil prices from here simply brightens our view. We're fortunate to control a significant position in one of the best resource plays in all of industry, and we control the pace of development. 
Second, we are working multiple scenarios today, scenarios that encompass lower for longer oil prices as well as more bullish cases that move oil prices to $50 per barrel and higher. Our preference is obviously the latter. With prices strengthening from here, we would expect to add significant drilling activity in the Anadarko Basin. Despite large reductions on our workforce over the last 2 years, we have preserved the organizational capacity to more than double our operated rig count. However, should oil prices remain weak, we have the option to invest at similar levels to 2016 and accomplish our care key near-term objectives holding acreage by production, kicking off in-fill development drilling and continuing to optimize both our well densities and completion designs. Again, these options are a competitive advantage for us and we must be prepared to play both offense or defense as appropriate for the business environment. 
Third, we have the financial capacity to comfortably execute either strategy. We can find an acceleration using cash on hand. The recent sale of our Eagle Ford and South Texas assets provides the near-term fuel to accelerate development of the SCOOP and STACK assets. We plan to use a portion of our cash balance to add rigs in the Anadarko Basin. We have recently contracted to pick up additional rigs, and we'll phase them into operation between now and early January. 
As a result, we have today inched up our planned 2016 investments to about $750 million or the high end of our $700 million to $750 million guidance range for 2016. Our cash on the balance sheet from recent asset sales can be used to effectively bridge any near-term variance between our cash flow and capital investments, while allowing us to keep strong coverage ratios on our debt. Newfield truly is in an advantaged position today. We see 2017 as a momentous year that fully transitions our Anadarko Basin operations into full-field development. Since 2012, we have done yeomen's work to transform Newfield into a company rich in asset quality, scale and financial strength. 
Since we are just a week away from an important presidential election, I'll quote the great Ronald Reagan that famously talked about his dream for a shining city upon a hill. Newfield's shining city is for a company that combines strong production with profitability, all while living within cash flow and maintaining financial strength. For us, that shining city that we've all been working toward is just around the corner. So know that between now and February, we will create an optimized plan for 2017 that delivers long-term value for our stockholders, and we look forward to sharing more specifics with you early next year. For now, let's move on to a brief discussion of our third quarter financial and operating results. 
Our domestic production in the third quarter was 14.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, nearly 4.5% higher than the prior quarter. Today, company production was -- total company production was 15.2 million barrels or about 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent above the midpoint of our guidance. Of the total, 61% was liquids and 39% was gas. Our beat in the quarter was primarily driven by higher production from the SCOOP and STACK assets, which more than offset the 93,000-barrel impact associated with the sale of our South Texas assets during the third quarter.
For the third quarter, we had net income of $0.24 per diluted share. In our news release, we detailed certain items that negatively impacted earnings by a combined $0.21 per share. Excluding these items, net income for the third quarter was $89 million or $0.45 per share on revenues of $392 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $209 million, and discretionary cash flow from operations was $183 million. Our cash operating expenses adjusted for onetime charges for the third quarter stated on a unit of production basis were below our guidance ranges for the quarter. You can see the positive impact we have made on our cash operating expenses, and this will lead to improved profitability in the future.
We're seeing a continued improvement on our price realizations, driven largely by our new pipeline transportation agreements that move STACK barrels to Cushing. Demand is strong for these high-quality barrels, and recent batch sales have sold for NYMEX WTI plus $0.60 to $0.80 per barrel. After transportation expense, we have most recently been netting NYMEX less $1.70 per barrel. This is improving our average differential across the company. Our recent Eagle Ford in South Texas asset sales restored the balance sheet and provided cash on hand of about $480 million. This allows us maximum flexibility to play offense or defense as the situation dictates.
We have included a table at @NFX today that provides a detailed look at our production volumes. From this table, you can see our outperformance in 2016 from legacy Newfield assets as well as the impact from our recent South Texas asset sales. Consistent with our usual practice, we will provide official guidance on 2017 capital investments and production expectations in February of next year.
So let's talk now in more detail about the Anadarko Basin. In today's @NFX publication, we have provided updates on our recent drilling campaign. Today's results include an update on SXL and XL wells or long and short laterals. The good news is that our results continue to be very consistent. As we work with our HBP drilling requirements this year, we've drilled more than 20 XL wells to 5,000-foot laterals. These short lateral wells had very strong performance, as you can see on Page 7, in the @NFX publication. However, we've proven time and again that SXL wells are still the preferred path to optimize capital efficiency and maximize net present value. 
On Page 6, we provided an update on a few recent SXL wells, along with the Raptor-X infill pilot. This pilot includes 4 producing wells that were drilled to test 6 wells per layer of spacing. This would have resulted in a 12-well spacing configuration for 2 layers of Meramec. With wells drilled at approximately 880-feet apart, the Raptor is continuing to show strong results after 120 days, averaging about 1,050 barrels of oil equivalent per day over that period.
Important to know is the difference in completion design on the Raptor, which we inherited in our Chesapeake asset acquisition earlier this year and our current design that we're implementing today on our Chlouber and Dorothy pilots. The Raptor was completed with a lesser design of 1,700 pounds of sand per foot and 800 gallons of liquids per foot. Although we are encouraged by what we see for Raptor-X today in terms of production and the cost were significantly less on these smaller jobs, we are looking forward to the latest completion designs consisting of 2,100 pounds of sand per foot with 2,100 gallons of liquid per foot on the completion. 
Industry is extremely active today with development pilots in STACK. In fact, today, there are about 25 pilots currently underway and/or planned by 7 different operators. Newfield has or will have an interest in nearly half of these infill pilots. This is great news for us as we can learn and use realtime information to tweak and adapt our spacing and completion designs on the road ahead. 
There's a tremendous amount of information being gathered today that will benefit our development operations in the months and years ahead. Spacing configurations today vary greatly with everything imaginable being tested. The good news is, to date, we have not seen any data that suggests any of the wells are being too tightly drilled. It is early and we will need to capture 12 to 24 months of production data from these various pilots to make a more definitive final conclusion on optimized spacing. We will find the right configuration that yields the best value proposition for our shareholders. 
So let there be no doubt about it, we are seeing the same things in SCOOP and STACK as evident in other active basins. Bigger volumes and more proppant seems to be better when it comes to completions. As I said earlier, our upcoming operated pilots were larger completions, and we expect to see continued improving results. We are now completing our Chlouber pilot, and the Dorothy pilot has just concluded drilling. Meaningful production results in both will be available early next year. Both the Chlouber and the Dorothy completions will have stimulation jobs consisting of 2,100 pounds of sand and 2,100 gallons of fluid per foot. 
Our original well at Dorothy was drilled back in 2015. This well was completed with 1,650 pounds of sand per foot and 1,000 gallons of liquid per foot. Our production from this well was choked back in its early days due to gas takeaway constraints at that time. This well originally produced upcasing with 4,000 psi flowing tubing pressure. However, now that we have 250 days of production, accums from this well are very impressive and we think one of the best in the industry. The well has averaged about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over those first 250 days of production, and that production is nearly 70% black oil. 
Today's new completion designs should demonstrate our wells are just as prolific as many of the recent data points in the Blaine and Kingfisher County line area. We estimate these wells will cost up to $2 million more than the older well designs. However, the EUR and production uplift are expected to drive material value creation. 
Our goal today is pretty simple, figure out the best path forward for decades of development activity that we have in front of us. We're looking forward to entering development mode in 2017, and we know from our experience and other resource plays that as we transition into pad then onto drilling, our production will be a little lumpier early on than in quarters past when drilling in HBP mode where you had single wells on individual joint spacing units. You're starting to see that today as we have had our STACK rigs tied up on the Chlouber and Dorothy multi-well pilots over the last several weeks. This will likely smooth out in the second half of 2017 as more paths commence production and we build a stable wedge of base production around them. We'll have more to share with you in February when we talk with you about more definitive plans for 2017. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Before I open it up to take your questions, let me summarize the key takeaways that we hope you heard in today's call. First, Newfield is in an advantaged position today. We are executing extremely well, and we have options to differentiate our story from the pack. Second, STACK is a great asset, the kind of asset that can drive our production growth and profitability well into the future. Today, we can see the end of the HBP phase and are preparing to kick off an exciting development campaign. Although there was still commodity price uncertainty, we are confident in our ability to deliver great returns in STACK and are planning to add activity as we enter 2017. 
As I said earlier, we can pull back the reins if oil prices deteriorate from here. Lastly, we're gathering critical data in STACK that will lead us to the optimal well spacing and completion designs. With our operated drillings and active programs from our peers, we will have answers to these important questions soon and we'll be applying them to our development plans as we progress. 
Thanks again for your time today. Operator, we're now ready to take questions."

And I think we've got well documented that we're seeing consisting results at more than 100 wells that we've released across there. So no change in that regard. As you move west, you move into the volatile oil region and quickly thereafter into what we call the wet gas condensate region. I know everybody's got a lot of different ways that they talk about that. The yield on terms of NGLs generally is 100 barrels per million or greater, somewhere in that ZIP Code. So when you go through the math, black oil, liquid barrels at the surface, that's what I was referencing in terms of the well performance on that well. I think after 250-plus days, I think it is that -- total average cut there was 70%. If you go back to the original footprint there on the east that we did much of the drilling on the first 2, 3 years in the play and those 100-plus wells, I think, historically, you've seen that those wells have performed kind of in that 75%, 80% oil cut range as well.

And clearly, I think we've said it in this call, and I know we've said it in the past, that one of the lessons learned here at Newfield that we remind ourselves every day that, yes, you got to have great quality assets. We have that. You've got to have a strong balance sheet. We've got that. Both of those have been kind of earned wins by the team and our investors over the last several years. We know we can go faster. We've talked about having the ability to accelerate activity. But the truth is, you need to go faster at the right time. So when we think about the volatility in the space since the slide started back in September 2014, I actually think I quipped in New York back in early September that when everybody started talking about production growth, production growth, production growth, it sounded a lot like discussions in 2014 previously. And we just don't believe that production growth at any cost makes sense. So we want to stay financially strong. We want to make smart decisions on our assets. We want to maximize value for the shareholders, and we're going to take kind of an all-of-the-above approach to those considerations. But the volatility in the space is real and it's something that we're going to stay closely attuned to. And frankly, I think that should oil prices hang in this ZIP Code or deteriorate from here, you're going to hear a storyline there that's going to sound a lot like what we've talked about previously where we're going to go ahead and do the things that we need to do, and we'll wait for a better day to go faster. Having said all of that, we are optimistically adding rigs to accelerate our knowledge capture in terms of the pilot projects, so that we can expedite getting to the most efficient development. So we're going to have additional momentum going into 2017, but we'll wait till we've had discussions with our board next week and we final our plan at the February board meeting before we talk any more specifically about that."

So you probably got a lot more proppant volume. Pressure pumping is not free either. So as you raise the volume of fluid and the volume of sand being pumped, you're adding cost in the completions. So what you would say is that maybe the completions are $1 million to as much as $2 million higher than what we would have talked about a year ago. The uplift in EUR should translate to a lower F&D and an improved rate of return picture on an individual well basis. So today, just thinking through those costs that we were talking about, wells with the 6 on them, we'd be talking about wells that are probably in the $7 million to $9 million for a 10,000-foot lateral. That's an important point. There are a lot of numbers floating around out in the industry, and you guys should always make sure you talk to people about exactly what well they're talking about. And a lot of the wells that you hear about in the play that have sixes in front of them today are 5,000-foot laterals. And that other 5,000 feet, both on drilling and completion, is not free. So you need to make sure that your -- you keep up with the mix that individual companies have in terms of 5,000 and 10,000-foot laterals.

And then we announced the play a couple of years later. We've been pretty diligent about our approach in data collection, completion designs. Been kind of methodical, but it's good. It allows us to talk about consistency in the play to prove it. We're now stepping up activity in terms of fluid volumes in proppant, doing that in concert with industry. And the truth is, the downturn on the commodity has provided a great time for all of us and our peer companies in the plays to experiment. So we're experimenting on an accelerated basis. Way back when, those early days, we started talking about the play in 2013, I remember saying more than once that we thought there were probably 3 to 5 levels, layers, if you will, that could ultimately be exploited across that acreage footprint where those 100-plus wells have been delivered successfully. We certainly still believe that today. So if you wanted to think about the Meramec section, I would say it's 3 or more, depending upon how tight the vertical spacing can be as we work through that part of the equation. You've got the Woodford, which is a horizon that exists across all of that footprint. So certainly, I think, it will be exploited. And you've got the Osage where you've got people talking today about test kind of east and north and on the periphery of the acreage footprint. And frankly, that oil-saturated interval cuts across the entirety of our position up there. So I still think that there'll be 3 to 5 layers ultimately exploited. A lot of data yet to be acquired to nail that down. And frankly, the optimist in the crowd could say that you can put a 5-plus on the back end because if we're able to prove that you can stack the wells in closer vertically, then there'll be more layers greater than 5 exploited ultimately. So that's how I would explain it."

You just think about the factors you got to deal with. You got oil price. That's going to be a big deal, okay? So that will dictate how close you drill wells. Number of layers. Well, that will be a technical cost piece as well. The technical data will tell us when you're too close or too far and we'll move to optimize that. And certainly, that's going to be a variable. There are actually geologic layers. We talk about Meramec, Osage, Woodford. They're 3 geologic layers, but the Meramec is thick enough that you could see that ultimately split into multiple levels. And there are, frankly, portions of the Woodford where you could see that happen as well. And we'll all have to drill wells in the Osage to figure out what the answer is there because that's an area where we know it's all saturated and it's got all the right attributes. But we had to drill in the horizontal wells area. We'll plan to do that in the first half of 2017. That will be part of our program. So hopefully that helps, but stay tuned.

We're just going to have to work through what the optimal scenario there is. And I'll give you some reasons to think about that. You drill out a full DSU, top to bottom, on all of these layers. You could have capital burn for the better part of the year, and we'd be telling you that if we follow that approach fully and completely that production occurs sometime the year following. So it's probably going to be a trade-off and probably going to be some efforts there that you'll need to consider when you think about modeling companies. And that's why we referenced lumpy, not that's the best word, but we'll just call lumpy the right thing. When you go from single wells drilled, complete, produce, at a time frame that has shrunk down to where you could do that inside of 30 to 45 days to multi-well pads, you're now talking about months between spotting the first well and completing the last well before you can actually stimulate production.

I think that's been demonstrated this point in time. The things we don't fully know and understand and appreciate at this point are going to be the -- it's not just the lateral offset dimension. I think we've got enough tests going on in the industry right now that you'll be able to cover the landscape between 4 and probably 8 wells per horizon or let's call it per layer. What is the interrelationship going to be as you start adding additional layers and how close can you put those layers to each other, that's the variable that we think about that is going to be pretty important. And frankly, as I said earlier, answer to one of the other questions, there could be trade offs. It could be that you back off on fluid volumes and proppant in development mode because you understand what those interrelationships are. You deliver a cheaper, more efficient well, and you fully exploit the resource maximum value. I mean, I could imagine that being a scenario. If you look at isolation with the data that we in the industry have accumulated here in the play, generally, there is a positive correlation between increased fluid volumes. So that probably means that the fluids side of this thing is creating more fractures and more fracture complexity. If you put more prop away in that same regard then it's probably transported farther from the well and get better propped fractures. And then as our guys, John Jasek, likes to remind me, it's about stimulated rock volumes. So that would be the drainage volume of an individual well. You can kind of understand those trade-offs, not too hard to get your mind around it. But right now, when we look at the endpoints that we have in the data set, we had situations where proppant was prompted 2:1 relative to fluid. We're closer to 1:1 today, I think that's probably true for a lot of the industry as well. That probably says that both are important. And right now, it seems like having those in similar amounts is -- ratio 1:1, is probably a better answer than the proppant loaded scenarios that we saw earlier in the development of the play."

So I wouldn't be too concerned about that. And then furthermore, as you move west to support your other argument, you see more and more gas production.

So that's something that certainly our team takes into account. I think the other thing I'll remind you of that complexity issues in the pilot projects, vertical and horizontal dimensions that we've got to optimize on, that will have some impacts as well. When we put out the updated type curve, we had 100-plus wells in that full data set. And we're very careful to point out that those wells are all unbounded, which means they were single wells for the most part on individual DSUs. We know as we move into development that we and the peers will all be chasing what I call constructive interference, i.e., that you're going to get to a point where you actually see interference between wells so that you know that you effectively completed the resource.

So just kind of stay tuned and kind of listen to the data points, and we'll land on the right solution. But clearly, the wells that we drilled today with the more fluid, more proppant, tighter spacing between prop clusters will be bigger wells in their own right than the wells that were drilled 2 or 3 years ago in the play. No doubt about that."

If you went back to the price environment you had when you were drilling $8.5 million wells, that well probably cost us $7.5 million a day.

Ultimately, we could see percentages a little higher, a little lower than that depending upon capital spend and pace. That's how I been thinking about that. As far as the -- I think I've talked long enough, I almost forgot the part of your question, but I think the other question was a cost question on synergies. I think we've been pretty consistent when you go from HBP mode with single wells on DSU to development mode.

I think those numbers will probably still be pretty good estimates today.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter conference call and operational update. We appreciate your interest and investments in our company. 
It's easy to get distracted during the lengthy presidential election contest, where we anxiously tune in each day to hear about the latest scandal, e-mail investigation, forgotten sound bites or the poll numbers in the presidential election that are simply too close to call, and we're still 6 days out from the election. But know one thing, we at Newfield are coming to work each day to find and develop precious oil and gas commodities that America needs a lot more of for its bright economic future regardless of who gets elected. We're not distracted and we're focused on our job of adding value for our shareholders. But just a friendly reminder, if you haven't voted yet, make sure you go and exercise your rights. 
So it is November and it's hard to believe that 2016 is nearly behind us. By all accounts, Newfield has enjoyed a very strong year of performance, and we have successfully repositioned the company to compete and win both today and on the road ahead. Our teams have delivered on our strategic objectives in 2016. Including today, we raised production guidance each quarter throughout the year. Excluding acquisitions, we expect to beat our original 2016 business plan by about 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. That's 7% over our beginning of the year forecast. 
Furthermore, had we retained the Eagle Ford and South Texas assets, we would have bested guidance by nearly 4.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our beat can be attributed to operational excellence across the enterprise. We worked hard to reduce cost and improve our margins. Our domestic LOE per unit of production is down. It's expected to be down more than 20% year-over-year, and our average domestic oil differential has improved more than 20% over the last year. 
Since 2014, we've taken dramatic actions to reduce our G&A expense. We reduced our workforce by more than 30% as we consolidated our offices from Tulsa, Denver and Houston into The Woodlands, enabling us to leverage our workforce for the future. When you compare our early G&A estimates for 2017 to 2014, we will have reduced annual net domestic G&A expense by more than $50 million per year.
We high-graded our portfolio during the year by selling nonstrategic assets in Texas and acquiring more core acreage in STACK. In total, we have now divested more than 3 billion in assets since 2011 and used the proceeds to improve our balance sheet and capture premier industry-leading return plays in the Anadarko Basin. Today, we're fortunate to have options, options that clearly differentiate Newfield from other investment choices in the E&P space. We have a strong balance sheet with a net debt over adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 2x and about $480 million of cash on hand. Our 1.8 billion credit facility remains undrawn. We have attractive interest rates and laddered debt maturities with nothing due until 2022. And most importantly, our SCOOP and STACK assets are ready today for acceleration and are not dependent on higher oil prices to make them competitive investments in our landscape. These are exciting times for E&P companies that have captured large positions in onshore resource plays and are now entering the harvest mode. 
In development, results become more consistent, efficiencies are exploited en masse and value creation is evident. There's a revolution underway today in completion designs, and there are significant differences in Gen 1, Gen 2. And today's new completions for both liquids volumes and sand concentrations are moving higher. Newfield is no different. We are now moving to our third-generation completions and our transition out of HBP into full-field development should continue to show strong improvements. 
Before we move to our usual discussion of quarterly financial results and operational updates, let me provide a high level of framework on how we're approaching our business plan for 2017. This is the season for our strategic discussions with our management team and, ultimately, our Board of Directors. The various scenarios we are running today will culminate into our official guidance that is customarily disclosed in February, along with our year-end earnings. Although this work is underway, we certainly have some preliminary thoughts today that you may find helpful. 
First, we expect that oil prices will remain volatile. Although we have been encouraged by recent OPEC discussions of production freezes, oil prices today continue to hover in the mid-40s, not too dissimilar from where we were a year ago. Newfield is fortunate to have options today. Even at today's prices, we are seeing excellent returns in SCOOP and STACK, and any uplift in oil prices from here simply brightens our view. We're fortunate to control a significant position in one of the best resource plays in all of industry, and we control the pace of development. 
Second, we are working multiple scenarios today, scenarios that encompass lower for longer oil prices as well as more bullish cases that move oil prices to $50 per barrel and higher. Our preference is obviously the latter. With prices strengthening from here, we would expect to add significant drilling activity in the Anadarko Basin. Despite large reductions on our workforce over the last 2 years, we have preserved the organizational capacity to more than double our operated rig count. However, should oil prices remain weak, we have the option to invest at similar levels to 2016 and accomplish our care key near-term objectives holding acreage by production, kicking off in-fill development drilling and continuing to optimize both our well densities and completion designs. Again, these options are a competitive advantage for us and we must be prepared to play both offense or defense as appropriate for the business environment. 
Third, we have the financial capacity to comfortably execute either strategy. We can find an acceleration using cash on hand. The recent sale of our Eagle Ford and South Texas assets provides the near-term fuel to accelerate development of the SCOOP and STACK assets. We plan to use a portion of our cash balance to add rigs in the Anadarko Basin. We have recently contracted to pick up additional rigs, and we'll phase them into operation between now and early January. 
As a result, we have today inched up our planned 2016 investments to about $750 million or the high end of our $700 million to $750 million guidance range for 2016. Our cash on the balance sheet from recent asset sales can be used to effectively bridge any near-term variance between our cash flow and capital investments, while allowing us to keep strong coverage ratios on our debt. Newfield truly is in an advantaged position today. We see 2017 as a momentous year that fully transitions our Anadarko Basin operations into full-field development. Since 2012, we have done yeomen's work to transform Newfield into a company rich in asset quality, scale and financial strength. 
Since we are just a week away from an important presidential election, I'll quote the great Ronald Reagan that famously talked about his dream for a shining city upon a hill. Newfield's shining city is for a company that combines strong production with profitability, all while living within cash flow and maintaining financial strength. For us, that shining city that we've all been working toward is just around the corner. So know that between now and February, we will create an optimized plan for 2017 that delivers long-term value for our stockholders, and we look forward to sharing more specifics with you early next year. For now, let's move on to a brief discussion of our third quarter financial and operating results. 
Our domestic production in the third quarter was 14.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, nearly 4.5% higher than the prior quarter. Today, company production was -- total company production was 15.2 million barrels or about 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent above the midpoint of our guidance. Of the total, 61% was liquids and 39% was gas. Our beat in the quarter was primarily driven by higher production from the SCOOP and STACK assets, which more than offset the 93,000-barrel impact associated with the sale of our South Texas assets during the third quarter.
For the third quarter, we had net income of $0.24 per diluted share. In our news release, we detailed certain items that negatively impacted earnings by a combined $0.21 per share. Excluding these items, net income for the third quarter was $89 million or $0.45 per share on revenues of $392 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $209 million, and discretionary cash flow from operations was $183 million. Our cash operating expenses adjusted for onetime charges for the third quarter stated on a unit of production basis were below our guidance ranges for the quarter. You can see the positive impact we have made on our cash operating expenses, and this will lead to improved profitability in the future.
We're seeing a continued improvement on our price realizations, driven largely by our new pipeline transportation agreements that move STACK barrels to Cushing. Demand is strong for these high-quality barrels, and recent batch sales have sold for NYMEX WTI plus $0.60 to $0.80 per barrel. After transportation expense, we have most recently been netting NYMEX less $1.70 per barrel. This is improving our average differential across the company. Our recent Eagle Ford in South Texas asset sales restored the balance sheet and provided cash on hand of about $480 million. This allows us maximum flexibility to play offense or defense as the situation dictates.
We have included a table at @NFX today that provides a detailed look at our production volumes. From this table, you can see our outperformance in 2016 from legacy Newfield assets as well as the impact from our recent South Texas asset sales. Consistent with our usual practice, we will provide official guidance on 2017 capital investments and production expectations in February of next year.
So let's talk now in more detail about the Anadarko Basin. In today's @NFX publication, we have provided updates on our recent drilling campaign. Today's results include an update on SXL and XL wells or long and short laterals. The good news is that our results continue to be very consistent. As we work with our HBP drilling requirements this year, we've drilled more than 20 XL wells to 5,000-foot laterals. These short lateral wells had very strong performance, as you can see on Page 7, in the @NFX publication. However, we've proven time and again that SXL wells are still the preferred path to optimize capital efficiency and maximize net present value. 
On Page 6, we provided an update on a few recent SXL wells, along with the Raptor-X infill pilot. This pilot includes 4 producing wells that were drilled to test 6 wells per layer of spacing. This would have resulted in a 12-well spacing configuration for 2 layers of Meramec. With wells drilled at approximately 880-feet apart, the Raptor is continuing to show strong results after 120 days, averaging about 1,050 barrels of oil equivalent per day over that period.
Important to know is the difference in completion design on the Raptor, which we inherited in our Chesapeake asset acquisition earlier this year and our current design that we're implementing today on our Chlouber and Dorothy pilots. The Raptor was completed with a lesser design of 1,700 pounds of sand per foot and 800 gallons of liquids per foot. Although we are encouraged by what we see for Raptor-X today in terms of production and the cost were significantly less on these smaller jobs, we are looking forward to the latest completion designs consisting of 2,100 pounds of sand per foot with 2,100 gallons of liquid per foot on the completion. 
Industry is extremely active today with development pilots in STACK. In fact, today, there are about 25 pilots currently underway and/or planned by 7 different operators. Newfield has or will have an interest in nearly half of these infill pilots. This is great news for us as we can learn and use realtime information to tweak and adapt our spacing and completion designs on the road ahead. 
There's a tremendous amount of information being gathered today that will benefit our development operations in the months and years ahead. Spacing configurations today vary greatly with everything imaginable being tested. The good news is, to date, we have not seen any data that suggests any of the wells are being too tightly drilled. It is early and we will need to capture 12 to 24 months of production data from these various pilots to make a more definitive final conclusion on optimized spacing. We will find the right configuration that yields the best value proposition for our shareholders. 
So let there be no doubt about it, we are seeing the same things in SCOOP and STACK as evident in other active basins. Bigger volumes and more proppant seems to be better when it comes to completions. As I said earlier, our upcoming operated pilots were larger completions, and we expect to see continued improving results. We are now completing our Chlouber pilot, and the Dorothy pilot has just concluded drilling. Meaningful production results in both will be available early next year. Both the Chlouber and the Dorothy completions will have stimulation jobs consisting of 2,100 pounds of sand and 2,100 gallons of fluid per foot. 
Our original well at Dorothy was drilled back in 2015. This well was completed with 1,650 pounds of sand per foot and 1,000 gallons of liquid per foot. Our production from this well was choked back in its early days due to gas takeaway constraints at that time. This well originally produced upcasing with 4,000 psi flowing tubing pressure. However, now that we have 250 days of production, accums from this well are very impressive and we think one of the best in the industry. The well has averaged about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over those first 250 days of production, and that production is nearly 70% black oil. 
Today's new completion designs should demonstrate our wells are just as prolific as many of the recent data points in the Blaine and Kingfisher County line area. We estimate these wells will cost up to $2 million more than the older well designs. However, the EUR and production uplift are expected to drive material value creation. 
Our goal today is pretty simple, figure out the best path forward for decades of development activity that we have in front of us. We're looking forward to entering development mode in 2017, and we know from our experience and other resource plays that as we transition into pad then onto drilling, our production will be a little lumpier early on than in quarters past when drilling in HBP mode where you had single wells on individual joint spacing units. You're starting to see that today as we have had our STACK rigs tied up on the Chlouber and Dorothy multi-well pilots over the last several weeks. This will likely smooth out in the second half of 2017 as more paths commence production and we build a stable wedge of base production around them. We'll have more to share with you in February when we talk with you about more definitive plans for 2017. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Before I open it up to take your questions, let me summarize the key takeaways that we hope you heard in today's call. First, Newfield is in an advantaged position today. We are executing extremely well, and we have options to differentiate our story from the pack. Second, STACK is a great asset, the kind of asset that can drive our production growth and profitability well into the future. Today, we can see the end of the HBP phase and are preparing to kick off an exciting development campaign. Although there was still commodity price uncertainty, we are confident in our ability to deliver great returns in STACK and are planning to add activity as we enter 2017. 
As I said earlier, we can pull back the reins if oil prices deteriorate from here. Lastly, we're gathering critical data in STACK that will lead us to the optimal well spacing and completion designs. With our operated drillings and active programs from our peers, we will have answers to these important questions soon and we'll be applying them to our development plans as we progress. 
Thanks again for your time today. Operator, we're now ready to take questions."

And I think we've got well documented that we're seeing consisting results at more than 100 wells that we've released across there. So no change in that regard. As you move west, you move into the volatile oil region and quickly thereafter into what we call the wet gas condensate region. I know everybody's got a lot of different ways that they talk about that. The yield on terms of NGLs generally is 100 barrels per million or greater, somewhere in that ZIP Code. So when you go through the math, black oil, liquid barrels at the surface, that's what I was referencing in terms of the well performance on that well. I think after 250-plus days, I think it is that -- total average cut there was 70%. If you go back to the original footprint there on the east that we did much of the drilling on the first 2, 3 years in the play and those 100-plus wells, I think, historically, you've seen that those wells have performed kind of in that 75%, 80% oil cut range as well.

And clearly, I think we've said it in this call, and I know we've said it in the past, that one of the lessons learned here at Newfield that we remind ourselves every day that, yes, you got to have great quality assets. We have that. You've got to have a strong balance sheet. We've got that. Both of those have been kind of earned wins by the team and our investors over the last several years. We know we can go faster. We've talked about having the ability to accelerate activity. But the truth is, you need to go faster at the right time. So when we think about the volatility in the space since the slide started back in September 2014, I actually think I quipped in New York back in early September that when everybody started talking about production growth, production growth, production growth, it sounded a lot like discussions in 2014 previously. And we just don't believe that production growth at any cost makes sense. So we want to stay financially strong. We want to make smart decisions on our assets. We want to maximize value for the shareholders, and we're going to take kind of an all-of-the-above approach to those considerations. But the volatility in the space is real and it's something that we're going to stay closely attuned to. And frankly, I think that should oil prices hang in this ZIP Code or deteriorate from here, you're going to hear a storyline there that's going to sound a lot like what we've talked about previously where we're going to go ahead and do the things that we need to do, and we'll wait for a better day to go faster. Having said all of that, we are optimistically adding rigs to accelerate our knowledge capture in terms of the pilot projects, so that we can expedite getting to the most efficient development. So we're going to have additional momentum going into 2017, but we'll wait till we've had discussions with our board next week and we final our plan at the February board meeting before we talk any more specifically about that."

So you probably got a lot more proppant volume. Pressure pumping is not free either. So as you raise the volume of fluid and the volume of sand being pumped, you're adding cost in the completions. So what you would say is that maybe the completions are $1 million to as much as $2 million higher than what we would have talked about a year ago. The uplift in EUR should translate to a lower F&D and an improved rate of return picture on an individual well basis. So today, just thinking through those costs that we were talking about, wells with the 6 on them, we'd be talking about wells that are probably in the $7 million to $9 million for a 10,000-foot lateral. That's an important point. There are a lot of numbers floating around out in the industry, and you guys should always make sure you talk to people about exactly what well they're talking about. And a lot of the wells that you hear about in the play that have sixes in front of them today are 5,000-foot laterals. And that other 5,000 feet, both on drilling and completion, is not free. So you need to make sure that your -- you keep up with the mix that individual companies have in terms of 5,000 and 10,000-foot laterals.

And then we announced the play a couple of years later. We've been pretty diligent about our approach in data collection, completion designs. Been kind of methodical, but it's good. It allows us to talk about consistency in the play to prove it. We're now stepping up activity in terms of fluid volumes in proppant, doing that in concert with industry. And the truth is, the downturn on the commodity has provided a great time for all of us and our peer companies in the plays to experiment. So we're experimenting on an accelerated basis. Way back when, those early days, we started talking about the play in 2013, I remember saying more than once that we thought there were probably 3 to 5 levels, layers, if you will, that could ultimately be exploited across that acreage footprint where those 100-plus wells have been delivered successfully. We certainly still believe that today. So if you wanted to think about the Meramec section, I would say it's 3 or more, depending upon how tight the vertical spacing can be as we work through that part of the equation. You've got the Woodford, which is a horizon that exists across all of that footprint. So certainly, I think, it will be exploited. And you've got the Osage where you've got people talking today about test kind of east and north and on the periphery of the acreage footprint. And frankly, that oil-saturated interval cuts across the entirety of our position up there. So I still think that there'll be 3 to 5 layers ultimately exploited. A lot of data yet to be acquired to nail that down. And frankly, the optimist in the crowd could say that you can put a 5-plus on the back end because if we're able to prove that you can stack the wells in closer vertically, then there'll be more layers greater than 5 exploited ultimately. So that's how I would explain it."

You just think about the factors you got to deal with. You got oil price. That's going to be a big deal, okay? So that will dictate how close you drill wells. Number of layers. Well, that will be a technical cost piece as well. The technical data will tell us when you're too close or too far and we'll move to optimize that. And certainly, that's going to be a variable. There are actually geologic layers. We talk about Meramec, Osage, Woodford. They're 3 geologic layers, but the Meramec is thick enough that you could see that ultimately split into multiple levels. And there are, frankly, portions of the Woodford where you could see that happen as well. And we'll all have to drill wells in the Osage to figure out what the answer is there because that's an area where we know it's all saturated and it's got all the right attributes. But we had to drill in the horizontal wells area. We'll plan to do that in the first half of 2017. That will be part of our program. So hopefully that helps, but stay tuned.

We're just going to have to work through what the optimal scenario there is. And I'll give you some reasons to think about that. You drill out a full DSU, top to bottom, on all of these layers. You could have capital burn for the better part of the year, and we'd be telling you that if we follow that approach fully and completely that production occurs sometime the year following. So it's probably going to be a trade-off and probably going to be some efforts there that you'll need to consider when you think about modeling companies. And that's why we referenced lumpy, not that's the best word, but we'll just call lumpy the right thing. When you go from single wells drilled, complete, produce, at a time frame that has shrunk down to where you could do that inside of 30 to 45 days to multi-well pads, you're now talking about months between spotting the first well and completing the last well before you can actually stimulate production.

I think that's been demonstrated this point in time. The things we don't fully know and understand and appreciate at this point are going to be the -- it's not just the lateral offset dimension. I think we've got enough tests going on in the industry right now that you'll be able to cover the landscape between 4 and probably 8 wells per horizon or let's call it per layer. What is the interrelationship going to be as you start adding additional layers and how close can you put those layers to each other, that's the variable that we think about that is going to be pretty important. And frankly, as I said earlier, answer to one of the other questions, there could be trade offs. It could be that you back off on fluid volumes and proppant in development mode because you understand what those interrelationships are. You deliver a cheaper, more efficient well, and you fully exploit the resource maximum value. I mean, I could imagine that being a scenario. If you look at isolation with the data that we in the industry have accumulated here in the play, generally, there is a positive correlation between increased fluid volumes. So that probably means that the fluids side of this thing is creating more fractures and more fracture complexity. If you put more prop away in that same regard then it's probably transported farther from the well and get better propped fractures. And then as our guys, John Jasek, likes to remind me, it's about stimulated rock volumes. So that would be the drainage volume of an individual well. You can kind of understand those trade-offs, not too hard to get your mind around it. But right now, when we look at the endpoints that we have in the data set, we had situations where proppant was prompted 2:1 relative to fluid. We're closer to 1:1 today, I think that's probably true for a lot of the industry as well. That probably says that both are important. And right now, it seems like having those in similar amounts is -- ratio 1:1, is probably a better answer than the proppant loaded scenarios that we saw earlier in the development of the play."

So I wouldn't be too concerned about that. And then furthermore, as you move west to support your other argument, you see more and more gas production.

So that's something that certainly our team takes into account. I think the other thing I'll remind you of that complexity issues in the pilot projects, vertical and horizontal dimensions that we've got to optimize on, that will have some impacts as well. When we put out the updated type curve, we had 100-plus wells in that full data set. And we're very careful to point out that those wells are all unbounded, which means they were single wells for the most part on individual DSUs. We know as we move into development that we and the peers will all be chasing what I call constructive interference, i.e., that you're going to get to a point where you actually see interference between wells so that you know that you effectively completed the resource.

So just kind of stay tuned and kind of listen to the data points, and we'll land on the right solution. But clearly, the wells that we drilled today with the more fluid, more proppant, tighter spacing between prop clusters will be bigger wells in their own right than the wells that were drilled 2 or 3 years ago in the play. No doubt about that."

I mean, we've pretty good swing there. That's what we talk about in terms of volatility. Now in general, if you're in a rising commodity, we would expect that the prices likewise will come up. And I think we've said historically that if you go back and anchor on some endpoints, and let's say when we were drilling $8.5 million  wells a few years ago and we got that to where we could see the $6.5 million might be a cost for that same well for drilling that same well today. If you went back to the price environment you had when you were drilling $8.5 million wells, that well probably cost us $7.5 million a day. Because you give half of that gain back to the service industry with the new commodity environment. I'm sure every company has got their own view of that, but we build those types of forecasts into all of our projections because they're real. As far as are we feeling any significant inflation pressure right at the moment, I would say nothing really significant."

So the first part of that in terms of the current split, I would say that we're probably 50-50 right now. Generally, I mean, about half of the current activity you talked about and the other half is still HBP. We've said previously that -- remember that we haven't finaled the 2017 plan at this point. We'll be talking to the board about that here next week and we'll also be following up with a final recommendation in February at the board meeting. We said that we'd expect around 2/3 of our total activity 2017 to be development-related. So that's part of that shift towards the development mode. Ultimately, we could see percentages a little higher, a little lower than that depending upon capital spend and pace. That's how I been thinking about that. As far as the -- I think I've talked long enough, I almost forgot the part of your question, but I think the other question was a cost question on synergies. I think we've been pretty consistent when you go from HBP mode with single wells on DSU to development mode. There's probably somewhere in the $0.75 million to maybe $1 million of total cost synergies that you're able to capture in development mode. I think those numbers will probably still be pretty good estimates today.
Well, I guess that probably concludes the call. Again, thanks for joining us and signing in. Stay tuned. We look forward to updating you on the full year progress early next year, and we'll see some of you guys on the road here in the weeks ahead. Have a great day."
