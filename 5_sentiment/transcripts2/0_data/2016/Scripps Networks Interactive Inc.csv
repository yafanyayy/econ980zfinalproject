Revenues were up 13% hitting $3 billion for the first time. Advertising rev",634,"All right. Thank you, Dylan, and good morning, everyone. We're happy that you're able to be with us today. What a year. 2015 was a milestone year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Revenues were up 13% hitting $3 billion for the first time. Advertising revenues were up 14%, exceeding $2 billion for the first time. Adjusted segment profits, up 13% to $1.3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share, up 25% to $4.94, and we completed the largest acquisition in the company's history, successfully transforming our international business through the acquisition of TVN. So quite a year indeed for the company, and I just like to say thanks to all the dedicated employees that help make this possible. 
We have a pretty simple business philosophy. We fortify and protect our core brands. We extend our reach by creating new connections with consumers. And finally, we generate and extract value from each of those connections whether it be on a television screen, a mobile device or even the pages of a magazine and we're doing that around the world. With TVN, the leading multi-platform media company in Poland, our company firmly established itself in one of Europe's most vibrant economies and created a platform for future growth in this desirable region. Here in the United States, our television networks enjoyed another strong year. We, once again, outperformed our peer group as we continued to attract the upscale engaged audiences coveted by our advertisers. 
As you'll hear from Burton shortly, our networks continue to be an essential element in the media plans of brands and agencies everywhere. We're meeting the challenges presented by changing media consumption habits. We broadened our horizons and we made our valued content available on a growing array of delivery platforms, including television, tablets and mobile to meet clear consumer demand. We're making smart strategic business moves that further position the company to take advantage of the evolving media landscape. We consolidated all of our U.S. television content development under a new Chief Content and Brand officer, Kathleen Finch, who's doing a fantastic job. It's a move that really makes it easier to tap the expertise and talent previously separated by brand. Truly made us a more cohesive and holistic organization. 
At the same time, we're expanding beyond institutional platforms and generating more on-demand and short-form content specific to the platform on which it's consumed. Our recent launch of the Scripps Lifestyle Studios reflects our progress in this area. We made positive strides in 2015 to let consumers access our content on their delivery platform of choice and they responded by visiting our websites and mobile apps in ever-increasing numbers. 
In 2015, we experienced strong revenue growth, and advertising sales and content distribution. We united those under a single Chief Revenue Officer, Steve Gelati, who's tasked with maximizing all of the company's monetization streams. We completed a company-wide cost analysis and took necessary steps to bring costs in line with projected revenue. It has made us leaner and it's really enhance our ability to move quickly when opportunities arise. Advertisers want to work with us and distributors consider our channels as the kind of must-carry brands their consumers demand. 
So in summary, 2015 was truly a transformational year for our company. And over the last 20 years, we've established powerful brands that connect deeply with consumers across the world. We're growing revenues as we monetize audiences on all platforms. The solid consistent performance that our company exhibits quarter after quarter, year after year, validates the efforts of our incredibly talented teams around the world as we build value for all our shareholders. So I want to thank you again for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. 
And now, let me turn it over to Burton who has details on our strong fourth quarter results. Burton?"

The year 2015 ended strong and that strength has continued into the early part of 2016. Here are just a few highlights. In 2015, both HGTV and Cooking Channel recorded their best years ever. HGTV was 1 of only 3 to",1158,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. The year 2015 ended strong and that strength has continued into the early part of 2016. Here are just a few highlights. In 2015, both HGTV and Cooking Channel recorded their best years ever. HGTV was 1 of only 3 top 10 cable networks to grow its ratings in 2015. It completed its ninth consecutive year as the #1 network for upscale women and for the second year in a row was #1 with women 25 to 54 on weekends, that's a time period that really serves as a second primetime sales opportunity for us. 
Food Network and Travel Channel experienced strong growth in the fourth quarter and so far this year, all 6 of our networks are seeing ratings growth. On HGTV, some newer shows emerged as huge hits. Fixer Upper, a series about remodeling homes in Waco, Texas, has become one of the biggest shows in the network's history. It's just one example of how HGTV taps into the heartland of America. New seasons of Flip or Flop, Hawaii Life and Property Brothers Home on the Ranch delivered high audiences as did House Hunters of course, our perennial franchise that we continue to expand to great effect. 
At Food Network, we've turned a corner on audience growth especially among younger viewers. Millennial appealing hits like Cutthroat Kitchen, Camp Cutthroat and Worst Cooks Celebrity drove 5% year-over-year growth in the valuable adults 25 to 34 age group. Family-friendly series like Halloween Baking Championship, Rachel Ray's Kids Cook-Off, encouraged co-viewing by the whole family and increased younger viewers by double-digits. The 11th season of Food Network's Star scored 15% higher ratings, becoming 1 of the summer's biggest success stories. And during fourth quarter, Food Network's overall viewership was up 5% over 2014. The network finished in the top 10 in women 25 to 54 and just outside the top 10 among adults. 
Travel Channel also showed very positive movement as some of the new shows we've been telling you about continued to gain traction. Overall Travel Channel viewership was up an impressive 5% for the quarter and the network has maintained its positive performance into the new year. Key contributors included Expedition Unknown, Bizarre Foods and Booze Traveler. And we have a slate of new shows in the pipeline that we're confident will help continue the growth trend. 
Late last year, we began to move some Travel Channel operations to our Knoxville headquarters and we expect to gain additional creative synergies as that move plays out over the next few quarters. Ratings at Cooking Channel continue to improve in the fourth quarter, maintaining healthy growth throughout the year. Cooking Channel finished 2015 with its sixth straight year of audience growth. For the fourth quarter, viewership soared 13% to record levels for adults and women ages 25 to 54, more over the quarter was the youngest ever for primetime, thanks to strong growth in adults 25 to 54. 
Ratings growth resulted from successful original shows like Unique Eats and Sugar Showdown. DIY Network had a strong 2015, the most-watched year ever for adults 18 plus, and the second highest year for adults 25 to 54, driven by shows like Rehab Addict and Barnwood Builders. And Great American Country experienced its most upscale year yet as we continue its successful conversion to lifestyle programming. 
Now we talk a lot about television audiences and linear television is thriving at Scripps Networks Interactive. We also benefit from the growing awareness of TV Everywhere. Usage of our watch apps increased nearly 300% in January versus a year earlier. Connected devices such as Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV already comprise more than 1/3 of our total TV Everywhere reach. We're working diligently to ensure that we attract the next generation of viewers and consumers. We've seen significant progress on our television networks and on over-the-top services, but we must also create content that is purposely designed for alternative formats. 
At the end of 2015, we launched Scripps Lifestyle Studios. It's a dedicated editorial team that creates content specific to the platform on which it's consumed. It could be Facebook, Apple news, Snapchat or any of the many platforms that emerge every day as well as our own digital properties, and it lets us take advantage of key audiences and advertising opportunities while also reaching digital natives. An early example featured Chef Bobby Flay and his daughter Sophie, starring in a series of cooking videos that aired on Snapchat. This approach to content generation gives us greater agility to take advantage of advertising opportunities. We're able to integrate advertisers into authentic storytelling. This helps clients reach high-value audiences on the digital platforms they love and translates that engagement into deeper connection and transactions. 
I want to expand a little now on our international progress. TVN group closed 2015 with a strong 22% share of the adults 16 to 49 television audience in Poland and its spring season has opened with strong numbers. The programs Master Chef Junior and the new drama series, second chance, scored the business ratings since 2013 across all TV channels in Poland. TVN continues to shine in its over-the-top strategy more than 1.7 million people have registered with the TVN Player, making it 1 of the top 5 distribution platforms in the country. 
We continue to view TVN as a great asset for the engaged audiences, it's networks aggregate. We also seek good opportunity to leverage TVN as a launchpad for expanding Scripps presence in this important region. Now while TVN provided the year's big international headline, the company experienced substantial growth in other parts of the world as well. Food Network, our most widely distributed global brand, is now available in more than 150 countries. It's the top lifestyle channel in the U.K. and has seen substantial success in Southeast Asia and more recently, Latin America and Australia. 
Travel Channel, our second most distributed brand is viewed in more than 130 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific region. HGTV debuted on the international scene just about a year ago. It's already the #1 lifestyle channel in Singapore and is growing rapidly in Malaysia and the Philippines. Additionally, our international-only brands, Asian Food Channel and Fine Living Network, enjoyed strong growth in 2015. Asian Food Channel allows us to develop locally produced shows specific to Asian markets while with the Fine Living Network, we can showcase the best of our content from the home, food and travel categories on a single network in markets where that approach works best. 
From Knoxville to New York, to Warsaw in Singapore, on TV streams, tablets and smartphones, we're connecting with millions of consumers worldwide every day, every way. And we're taking advantage of new ways to monetize the close relationships we develop. That's our goal, that's our commitment. 
And now I'll turn it over to Lori who will review financial performance."

Since you've seen our strong results, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers that Ken mentioned, discuss our segment performance, provide guidance and then open it up for Q&A. 2015 was a great year for Scripp",1183,"Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. Since you've seen our strong results, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers that Ken mentioned, discuss our segment performance, provide guidance and then open it up for Q&A. 
2015 was a great year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Revenue increased an impressive 13% surpassing $3 billion for the first time. Driving this growth was a strong advertising market for our lifestyle brands, growth in affiliate fees and a significant expansion of our international business through TVN. This strong revenue growth, coupled with focused cost control helped in part by our 2014 announced restructuring and early retirement effort translated to a 13% growth in adjusted segment profit and adjusted EPS growth of 25% compared with the prior year. 
For the fourth quarter, total company revenue was up 27%. Contributing to this growth was the inclusion of TVN, and strong advertising growth and affiliate fee increases primarily at the U.S. network segment, which I'll discuss in more detail later. Total adjusted segment profit increased 19%, driven by strong revenue growth, partially offset by increases in cost of services primarily program expense. Also, contributing to the expense growth were international increases related to the inclusion of TVN. 
Adjusted net income attributable to SNI was $1.35 per diluted share, up 35% due to the operating improvement noted previously. We had a great quarter at our U.S. network segment. Revenues increased 8%, driven by strong advertising demand for our lifestyle network as well as continued affiliate fee growth. For the advertising revenue. Improved scatter pricing, coupled with CPM price increases from the 2015, 2016 upfront and calendar upfront market, drove an 8% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing was up high single to low double-digits year-over-year and up high-teens to low 20s over the broadcast upfront. 
Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter, were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, auto and pharmaceutical. These categories are fairly consistent with prior periods, except pharma, which was stronger than normal in the fourth quarter. The strong advertising market is continued into the first quarter with scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing up high single to low double-digits year-over-year and up teen to low 20s over the new broadcast upfront. 
For affiliate fees. Contributing to the 5% growth were: contractual rate escalated with our traditional distribution partners; incremental distribution increases that we negotiated in some recent renewals for both DIY Network and Cooking Channel; and new distribution related to broadband providers. Looking at our adjusted segment profit and as Burton mentioned for the fourth quarter of 2015, our networks realized positive ratings momentum that has continued into 2016. Helping to drive this performance was the decision to shift programming premiers to the fourth quarter, which also allowed us to take advantage of a robust advertising market. However, this record amount of new programming also drove an increase in programming expense for the quarter. Additionally, and as indicated on previous call, we focused on developing programming themes for the Travel Channel to develop a strong network identity. We reevaluated our programming library and elected to light off a larger than normal amount of channel programming in the fourth quarter. 
As a result of these decisions our adjustment segment profit was down 1% for the quarter. However, we believe a longer-term trend will be a continued deceleration rate of programming expense growth consistent with what we've seen over the past couple of years. Our international revenues of $163 million increased significantly due to consolidation of TVN, coupled with growth in our existing international business. TVN revenues were up 7% in local currency compared to the same quarter a year ago while revenues from our existing operations were up 17% on an organic basis. 
International segment profit was a healthy $36 million compared with a loss of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This $44 million improvement is primarily due to the inclusion of TVN as we are still investing in our existing international lifestyle network. In addition to our consolidated results, we have significant international operations reported in our equity earnings. In total, our equity earnings and affiliates was $11 million, down compared with the prior year fourth quarter, primarily due to transaction-related accounting adjustments and seasonality related to the TVN minority investment that we acquired. 
On the balance sheet, I want to touch on a couple of items. As you've seen, reflecting the confidence management has in the business to continue to generate strong operating free cash flow, we've increased our dividend for the sixth consecutive year to $1 per share annually. Within our capital allocation priority, we're focused on using cash operating outflow to fund organic growth, reduce our leverage and invest in M&A both in the U.S. and internationally. We ended the fourth quarter at approximately 3.2x growth leverage and we recently notified cost communication of our intent to purchase their 35% stake in Travel Channel. This notification started the valuation process for the transaction and we expect the transaction will be completed by the end of the first quarter. 
Finally and before we open it up for questions, we'll provide our full-year 2016 guidance. All guidance is based on total company results. As a result, the strong demand for our networks from viewers and advertisers along with an increasing contribution from international, we expect revenue growth of approximately 12%. We believe the revenue increase will be driven primarily by a full year TVN results and growth in advertising revenue. We expect for the first half of 2016, the company will realize a higher growth rate due in part to easier advertising comps at the U.S. networks segment and because TVN results were not included in the first half of 2015. 
We expect the third quarter will be impacted by the Olympics and to a lesser extent, the presidential election. So it should be the slowest growth quarter of the year then growth should accelerate somewhat for the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 7%. Adjustment segment profit excludes TVN transaction and integration costs, restructuring and reorganization costs for 2015 and 2016. Impacting the 2016 segment profit growth will be a larger proportionate share of international revenues, which have an inherently lower segment profit profile compared to our U.S. networks; a change in our program amortization policy and estimation rates for certain programming across the networks; and the likely impact from a onetime rate equalization process due to the expected renewal of certain distributor agreements that are being consolidated. 
After this initial period, we expect to realize mid- to high-single-digit annualized pricing increases per subscriber. These 3 items impact our estimated adjusted segment profit growth by 500 to 600 basis points. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be $120 million to $125 million. This estimate excludes $52 million of TVN purchase price adjustment. We will also exclude purchase price adjustments from our adjusted earnings per share calculation. We expect interest expense to be approximately $135 million and lastly, our tax rate should be 30% to 32% for the year. 
And with that, we're ready for your questions."

I mean it was helpful getting the cadence around how you think advertising flows for the year, but as we just sort of think about the set up going forward here, with your ratings would've been better? And then any details that you have on the change of program and amortization, the rationale and sort of what you change from into, would be helpful. And then if you wouldn't mind me throwing a third in there, just anything in terms of new entrants into distribution that you would comment on at this point. It seems like there's a lot of conversations going on by the middle of the year, we might have some new entrants launching.

But calendar is always strong for us because especially on the home side, it's where endemics in the home category really put their money down. That's the way their buying calendar works. And so we're seeing that continued strength, we're very happy with it. And I have to say going into the upfront, we're feeling good. Ratings in all 6 of our networks are up that's a great position to be in as we tie up the strength of our brands and the quality of our audience. We're still upscale. We've got a great story in fact, our ad sales grew this meeting this week for the national sales meeting. I was with them yesterday, I'll be with them this afternoon, and they're as upbeat as they can be given where we are with our networks and where they are in the marketplace."

It should be no surprise that when we periodically look at how we're estimating our how amortization, and how it matches with revenue and how our shows are being premiered with the results, we're accelerating our amortization in the first year for certain networks and it's having a onetime adjustment as we change the policy. So what you'll see is an impact, and you see our cost of sales numbers and the growth rate probably call it from 1 point to 2 points impact for the year depending on when the show's premiere. So again, we get past 2016, it will be no longer an impact. So I call it a noncash amortization impact. So I hope that helps you a little bit, but we continue to look at these things. And again, I think with the collapse of the networks all under Kathleen's leadership, we might continue to relook at how we're using programming and how that might impact, so we'll keep you in tuned but on an ongoing basis, our investment is still moderating from a cash basis. So again, if you look at what the dollars going out the doors, we're still moderating. If we go back in time, we were probably as we brought in travel, we were more at the high-teens, we moderated that to the low teens and now we're in the -- I would call, we're closely in without this adjustment probably in the high single-digit zone, which is what we've been striving to do for over the last couple of years."

I mean we have invested more as Lori just said a few moments ago, the percentage growth that was higher, but that's been moderating. We expect that moderation to continue. And the reason is that even though Courtney is news coming into travel, what we've learned about the travel audience and travel programming over the last 18 months is what we intended. You may recall over the last several quarters we've been saying that we're going to put a lot of programming on, new programming on the fourth quarter, we did. We learned a lot about what we put on, as always in TV some work, some didn't, so now we have better direction going forward. Courtney, she's got a long history with us, 10 years, long history in the business before that. She is very adept at articulating very clear rationale for why programs need to be on the air, and so she's very craftily divided sort of what's working on travel into several groups of kinds of shows and we're going to be pursuing those because we've seen that they've worked. We've seen a lot of sort of adventure quest shows and the guise of Expedition Unknown. We like seeing personalities like Andrew Zimmern and others like in Booze Traveler and Bizarre Foods going out and exploring the world, you'll see more of that. You'll see more pairs of people traveling because we like dynamics between them and we're going to bring a little dose of celebrity to the network as well. We've got Queen Latifah with a new show, so start off in South America and then we've got other celebrities coming on too. So a lot of what we learn from the current programming in travel that's working. What Courtney learned in HGTV, we're going to bring to bear and I have to tell you, she is moving forward at a very fast pace to make all this work."

Moreover as data becomes more of a commodity in the selling of advertising, we're going to excel, purchasing data, our audiences buy stuff. They the money. They have disposable income. They go out and buy things. You're seeing pricing increases as Lori pointed out in our scatter.

And then kind of related to that, anybody who wants to just help applying the theory here, we've been observing, when we see your ratings go up, which is rare in this world, it seems to be  tied very closely to when you put new episodes of your key programs on the air, which is great news because it shows when you have a hit show, when you put a new episode on, people watch it. It also begs the question of how -- are you more dependent than ever before on having to have new episodes? And what does it mean for rate of continued spend and investment? Is the world different now, do you think than it was a couple of years ago? And how sensitive the audience is to new programming versus the lifespans of reruns of those."

So we're feeling again that it's going to be a very good year. It's going to be better than last year, but unlike last year, which I think we've talked a lot about that acceleration throughout the year where we started out slow, it's the first half we think it's going to be very strong due to some of the things that I said in my prepared comments is that it was softer in the first half and we've got pricing plus our impressions are all up.

In general though, I would say your premises is right. The television audiences in general have less tolerance for reruns and that's why you're seeing a lot of what's going on in the television industry overall. Its also why we responded many years ago in fact, when Jim Samples was running HGTV to that by putting into production 300 [ph] and 400 episodes of year -- a year of House Hunters. Very reasonably priced show for us, drives a lot of viewing. We decided that's where the investment of the original content. When we come to more new ones though because each network is a little different in our mix and even within a network, different kinds of shows are different when it comes to repeatability. Competition shows like the Food Network Star, they don't repeat very well. And so over time, I'm sure you've observed, you've seen us do fewer and fewer big stunt type shows. HGTV is in fact, backing off a lot on that. Food Network is scaling them down a little bit. They don't repeat as well. They're great when they run, but they don't repeat as well. On the other hand, the show like Fixer Upper, which is far in way right now, the #1 show in HGTV. The team there is so good in understanding when audiences are watching the network on certain nights that they realize that Fixer Upper on Tuesday night was getting an audience, but Fixer Upper reruns on Thursday night rather, could get a different audience that hasn't seen it. Sure enough, they put it on, on Thursday night. We actually promoted it. The first time we've ever promoted repeats of the show and the ratings were nearly 100% as what they were on Tuesday night. So there are ways for us to utilize reruns, recognizing the way audiences view in different patterns on our networks. So yes, you'll see more original programming, although as Lori said, we're not going to go crazy on our program budgets. We think we have the right number of hours and we can make the mix work."

So if you look at our total business operations domestically, and you realize we're having probably in 21 years some of our best rating years ever, it's because we're attracting newer audiences and growing still even though some of the distribution as I said has waned a bit on the traditional platforms. But as we see opportunities on alternative distribution platforms, we're going for them. I mentioned the Scripps Lifestyle Studios that we've created to do more short-form programming. We're very much about taking our content, and our categories and continuing to grow it but now on different distribution platforms and we're having enormous success on the TV Everywhere model as far as take rates and as spot in general.

No guarantee that we'll win, but we have a long history of success of knowing audiences in our categories, of sticking to our categories, of researching our categories and knowing advertisers in our categories. And so I have to say, we bet on ourselves to do well in those environments. Maybe not everyone, but the preponderance I think will do very well."

We've already looked at some of the programming lineups that's coming up, I guess in the next few months, Burton, where we're tapping into some of this talent. So it's not just for us to try to create content for those platforms. Find out what's working and then in some areas where we can recruit the talent, bring them into our company. We can enhance that talent by offering them larger platforms and different social media outlets to expand their personality, their brand, their talent as well. And so far, we've had a pretty good success rate with the ones we recruited in. So it's a little bit of a two-way street. This is new territory for us in some ways but pretty exciting.

Last summer and I believe we talked about this on calls, we started aggressively promoting our TV Everywhere watch apps, primarily on our 3 big networks HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel. We began to see significant downloads of our own watched apps at that point and they're growing by tens of thousands of additional download each month. The Roku, Amazon, Fire and Apple TV apps are for -- are connected devices, so you watch through television. Those have a very large existing base already. So the goal there was to make the existing users of those devices aware that our apps are now available. They became available toward the end of last year and we're seeing huge downloads of those apps over the first 3 months that they've been available. The viewing of course, is another matter, once you're in the apps you might have to view. So the viewership, we're pushing aggressively on air as well. So we have 2 parked promotion message on TV. One is get the app. The second is now you can watch your favorite programs anytime, anywhere, any device if you have the app and that's both live viewing and delayed viewing. And so it really is a very coordinated promotional effort to try to get viewers to understand. You can watch as now more often anywhere, anytime on any device. And I have to say it's early days, but we're seeing it work. On monetization, these are still small numbers against the overall linear television universe. So monetization will come. We have to start getting the habit in there now. It comes in a couple of ways, of course in C3, we can monetize all those connected devices right away because Nielsen measures anything that comes through a TV. On the apps that people are viewing on their pads or phones, C3 will be a little bit of a waste to monetize until Nielsen gets the measure in order and sign up for that additional measurement product. However, on insertion after C3, that's all monetizeable. Now again, that's small right now, but we see that as a potential growth area for the insertion dynamic and insertion of ads. So we're getting the habits in place right now for viewing, but we expect to see monetization grow as time goes on."

I think it's both the areas that we've move into with digital. What we're finding, we'll call it experimentation because it is a little bit, this works, maybe this doesn't work but more emphasis here. But also think, it underscores the fact that millennials watch television and they're going to continue to watch television. Much of it for us has to do with 25 to 34-year-olds growing into the categories. Once they started to become interested in the design of their apartment or their condo, or if they're fortunate enough, their home. Food, similarly once you start preparing meals, once it becomes a little bit more of a family environment, then our content just naturally kind of clicks in. So what we've seen is not only the increasing -- increases in ratings overall, but the increases as you mentioned, in millennials, but a lot of it has to do with traditional television watching. Now no question, they're using mobile in different ways, they're using other platforms in different ways. And we're experimenting over there and we're also using the investments that we've made in Tastemade, Refinery29, to see how those take rates are, how millennials are responding there. So I don't know if you agree with that, Burton, but I think it's a mixture of both."

What a year. 2015 was a milestone year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Revenues were up 13% hitting $3 billion for the first time. Advertising revenues were up 14%, exceeding $2 billion for the first time. Adjusted segment profits, up 13% to $1.3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share, up 25% to $4.94, and we completed the largest acquisition in the company's history, successfully transforming our international business through the acquisition of TVN. So quite a year indeed for the company, and I just like to say thanks to all the dedicated employees that help make this possible. 
We have a pretty simple business philosophy. We fortify and protect our core brands. We extend our reach by creating new connections with consumers. And finally, we generate and extract value from each of those connections whether it be on a television screen, a mobile device or even the pages of a magazine and we're doing that around the world. With TVN, the leading multi-platform media company in Poland, our company firmly established itself in one of Europe's most vibrant economies and created a platform for future growth in this desirable region. Here in the United States, our television networks enjoyed another strong year. We, once again, outperformed our peer group as we continue to attract the upscale engaged audiences coveted by our advertisers. 
As you'll hear from Burton shortly, our networks continue to be an essential element in the media plans of brands and agencies everywhere. We're meeting the challenges presented by changing media consumption habits. We broadened our horizons and we made our valued content available on a growing array of delivery platforms, including television, tablets and mobile to meet clear consumer demand. We're making smart strategic business moves that further position the company to take advantage of the evolving media landscape. We consolidated all of our U.S. television content development under a new Chief Content and Brand officer, Kathleen Finch, who's doing a fantastic job. It's a move that really makes it easier to tap the expertise and talent previously separated by brand. Truly made us a more cohesive and holistic organization. 
At the same time, we're expanding beyond traditional distribution platforms and generating more on-demand and short-form content specific to the platform on which it's consumed. Our recent launch of the Scripps Lifestyle Studios reflects our progress in this area. We made positive strides in 2015 to let consumers access our content on their delivery platform of choice and they responded by visiting our websites and mobile apps in ever-increasing numbers. 
In 2015, we experienced strong revenue growth, and advertising sales and content distribution. We united those under a single Chief Revenue Officer, Steve Gigliotti, who's tasked with maximizing all the company's monetization streams. We completed a company-wide cost analysis and took necessary steps to bring costs in line with projected revenue. It has made us leaner and certainly enhanced our ability to move quickly when opportunities arise. Advertisers want to work with us and distributors consider our channels as the kind of must-carry brands their consumers demand. 
So in summary, 2015 was truly a transformational year for our company. And over the last 20 years, we've established powerful brands that connect deeply with consumers across the world. We're growing revenues as we monetize audiences on all platforms. The solid consistent performance that our company exhibits quarter after quarter, year after year, validates the efforts of our incredibly talented teams around the world as we build value for all of our shareholders. So I want to thank you again for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. 
And now, let me turn it over to Burton who has details on our strong fourth quarter results. Burton?"

HGTV was 1 of only 3 to",1160,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. The year 2015 ended strong and that strength has continued into the early part of 2016. Here are just a few highlights. In 2015, both HGTV and Cooking Channel recorded their best years ever. HGTV was 1 of only 3 top 10 cable networks to grow its ratings in 2015. It completed its ninth consecutive year as the #1 network for upscale women and for the second year in a row was #1 with women 25 to 54 on weekends, that's a time period that really serves as a second primetime sales opportunity for us. 
Food Network and Travel Channel experienced strong growth in the fourth quarter and so far this year, all 6 of our networks are seeing ratings growth. On HGTV, some newer shows emerged as huge hits. Fixer Upper, a series about remodeling homes in Waco, Texas, has become one of the biggest shows in the network's history. It's just one example of how HGTV taps into the heartlands of America. New seasons of Flip or Flop, Hawaii Life and Property Brothers at Home on the Ranch delivered high audiences as did House Hunters of course, our perennial franchise that we continue to expand to great effect. 
At Food Network, we've turned a corner on audience growth especially among younger viewers. Millennial appealing hits like Cutthroat Kitchen, Camp Cutthroat and Worst Cooks Celebrity drove 5% year-over-year growth in the valuable adults 25 to 34 age group. Family-friendly series like Halloween Baking Championship, Rachel Ray's Kids Cook-Off, encouraged co-viewing by the whole family and increased younger viewers by double-digits. The 11th season of Food Network's Star scored 15% higher ratings, becoming 1 of the summer's biggest success stories. And during fourth quarter, Food Network's overall viewership was up 5% over 2014. The network finished in the top 10 in women 25 to 54 and just outside the top 10 among adults. 
Travel Channel also showed very positive movement as some of the new shows we've been telling you about continued to gain traction. Overall Travel Channel viewership was up an impressive 5% for the quarter and the network has maintained its positive performance into the new year. Key contributors included Expedition Unknown, Bizarre Foods and Booze Traveler. And we have a slate of new shows in the pipeline that we're confident will help continue the growth trend. 
Late last year, we began to move some Travel Channel operations to our Knoxville headquarters and we expect to gain additional creative synergies as that move plays out over the next few quarters. Ratings at Cooking Channel continue to improve in the fourth quarter, maintaining healthy growth throughout the year. Cooking Channel finished 2015 with its sixth straight year of audience growth. For the fourth quarter, viewership soared 13% to record levels for adults and women ages 25 to 54, more over the quarter was the youngest ever for primetime, thanks to strong growth in adults 25 to 54. 
Ratings growth resulted from successful original shows like Unique Eats and Sugar Showdown. DIY Network had a strong 2015, the most-watched year ever for adults 18 plus, and the second highest year for adults 25 to 54, driven by shows like Rehab Addict and Barnwood Builders. And Great American Country experienced its most upscale year yet as we continue its successful conversion to lifestyle programming. 
Now we talk a lot about television audiences and linear television is thriving at Scripps Networks Interactive. We also benefit from the growing awareness of TV Everywhere. Usage of our watch apps increased nearly 300% in January versus a year earlier. Connected devices such as Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV already comprise more than 1/3 of our total TV Everywhere reach. We're working diligently to ensure that we attract the next generation of viewers and consumers. We've seen significant progress on our television networks and on over-the-top services, but we must also create content that is purposely designed for alternative formats. 
At the end of 2015, we launched Scripps Lifestyle Studios. It's a dedicated editorial team that creates content specific to the platform on which it's consumed. It could be Facebook, Apple news, Snapchat or any of the many platforms that emerge every day as well as our own digital properties, and it lets us take advantage of key audiences and advertising opportunities while also reaching digital natives. An early example featured Chef Bobby Flay and his daughter Sophie, starring in a series of cooking videos that aired on Snapchat. This approach to content generation gives us greater agility to take advantage of advertising opportunities. We're able to integrate advertisers into authentic storytelling. This helps clients reach high-value audiences on the digital platforms they love and translates that engagement into deeper connection and transactions. 
I want to expand a little now on our international progress. TVN group closed 2015 with a strong 22% share of the adults 16 to 49 television audience in Poland and its spring season has opened with strong numbers. The programs Master Chef Junior and the new drama series, Second Chance, scored the best season premier ratings since 2013 across all TV channels in Poland. TVN continues to shine in its over-the-top strategy, more than 1.7 million people have registered with the TVN Player, making it 1 of the top 5 distribution platforms in the country. 
We continue to view TVN as a great asset for the engaged audiences, it's networks aggregate. We also see good opportunity to leverage TVN as a launchpad for expanding Scripps presence in this important region. Now while TVN provided the year's big international headline, the company experienced substantial growth in other parts of the world as well. Food Network, our most widely distributed global brand, is now available in more than 150 countries. It's the top lifestyle channel in the U.K. and has seen substantial success in Southeast Asia and more recently, Latin America and Australia. 
Travel Channel, our second most distributed brand is viewed in more than 130 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific region. HGTV debuted on the international scene just about a year ago. It's already the #1 lifestyle channel in Singapore and is growing rapidly in Malaysia and the Philippines. Additionally, our international-only brands, Asian Food Channel and Fine Living Network, enjoyed strong growth in 2015. Asian Food Channel allows us to develop locally produced shows specific to Asian markets while with Fine Living Network, we can showcase the best of our content from the home, food and travel categories on a single network in markets where that approach works best. 
From Knoxville to New York, to Warsaw in Singapore, on TV screens, tablets and smartphones, we're connecting with millions of consumers worldwide every day, every way. And we're taking advantage of new ways to monetize the close relationships we develop. That's our goal, that's our commitment. 
And now I'll turn it over to Lori who will review financial performance."

Since you've seen our strong results, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers that Ken mentioned, discuss our segment performance, provide guidance and then open it up for Q&A. 
2015 was a great year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Revenue increased an impressive 13% surpassing $3 billion for the first time. Driving this growth was a strong advertising market for our lifestyle brands, growth in affiliate fees, and a significant expansion of our international business through TVN. This strong revenue growth, coupled with focused cost control helped in part by our 2014 announced restructuring and early retirement effort translated to a 13% growth in adjusted segment profit and adjusted EPS growth of 25% compared with the prior year. 
For the fourth quarter, total company revenue was up 27%. Contributing to this growth was the inclusion of TVN, and strong advertising growth and affiliate fee increases primarily at the U.S. network segment, which I'll discuss in more detail later. Total adjusted segment profit increased 19%, driven by strong revenue growth, partially offset by increases in cost of services, primarily programming expense. Also, contributing to the expense growth were international increases related to the inclusion of TVN. 
Adjusted net income attributable to SNI was $1.35 per diluted share, up 35% due to the operating improvement noted previously. We had a great quarter at our U.S. network segment. Revenues increased 8%, driven by strong advertising demand for our lifestyle networks as well as continued affiliate fee growth. For the advertising revenue, improved scatter pricing, coupled with CPM price increases from the 2015, 2016 upfront and calendar upfront market, drove an 8% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing was up high single to low double-digits year-over-year and up high-teens to low 20s over the broadcast upfront. 
Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter, were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, auto and pharmaceutical. These categories are fairly consistent with prior periods, except pharma, which was stronger than normal in the fourth quarter. The strong advertising market is continued into the first quarter with scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing up high single to low double-digits year-over-year and up teens to low 20s over the new broadcast upfront. 
For affiliate fees. Contributing to the 5% growth were: contractual rate escalated with our traditional distribution partners; incremental distribution increases that we negotiated in some recent renewals for both DIY Network and Cooking Channel; and new distribution related to broadband providers. Looking at our adjusted segment profit and as Burton mentioned for the fourth quarter of 2015, our networks realized positive ratings momentum that has continued into 2016. Helping to drive this performance was the decision to shift programming premiers to the fourth quarter, which also allowed us to take advantage of a robust advertising market. However, this record amount of new programming also drove an increase in programming expense for the quarter. Additionally, and as indicated on previous calls, we focused on developing programming themes for the Travel Channel to develop a strong network identity. We reevaluated our programming library and elected to light off a larger than normal amount of Travel Channel programming in the fourth quarter. 
As a result of these decisions our adjustment segment profit was down 1% for the quarter. However, we believe a longer-term trend will be a continued deceleration rate of programming expense growth consistent with what we've seen over the past couple of years. Our international revenues of $163 million increased significantly due to the consolidation of TVN, coupled with growth in our existing international business. TVN revenues were up 7% in local currency compared to the same quarter a year ago while revenues from our existing operations were up 17% on an organic basis. 
International segment profit was a healthy $36 million compared with a loss of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This $44 million improvement is primarily due to the inclusion of TVN as we are still investing in our existing international lifestyle networks. In addition to our consolidated results, we have significant international operations reported in our equity earnings. In total, our equity and earnings of affiliates was $11 million, down compared with the prior year fourth quarter, primarily due to transaction-related accounting adjustments and seasonality related to the TVN minority investments we acquired. 
On the balance sheet, I want to touch on a couple of items. As you've seen, reflecting the confidence management has in the business to continue to generate strong operating free cash flow, we've increased our dividend for the sixth consecutive year to $1 per share annually. Within our capital allocation priority, we're focused on using operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our leverage and invest in M&A both in the U.S. and internationally. We ended the fourth quarter at approximately 3.2x growth leverage and we recently notified Cox Communications of our intent to purchase their 35% stake in Travel Channel. This notification started the valuation process for the transaction and we expect the transaction will be completed by the end of the first quarter. 
Finally and before we open it up for questions, we'll provide our full-year 2016 guidance. All guidance is based on total company results. As a result, the strong demand for our networks from viewers and advertisers along with an increasing contribution from international, we expect revenue growth of approximately 12%. We believe the revenue increase will be driven primarily by a full year of TVN results and growth in advertising revenue. We expect for the first half of 2016, the company will realize a higher growth rate due in part to easier advertising comps at the U.S. networks segment and because TVN results were not included in the first half of 2015. 
We expect the third quarter will be impacted by the Olympics and to a lesser extent, the presidential election. So it should be the slowest growth quarter of the year then growth should accelerate somewhat for the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 7%. Adjustment segment profit excludes TVN transaction and integration costs, restructuring and reorganization costs for 2015 and 2016. Impacting the 2016 segment profit growth will be a larger proportionate share of international revenues, which have an inherently lower segment profit profile compared to our U.S. networks; a change in our program amortization policy and estimation rates for certain programming across the networks; and the likely impact from a onetime rate equalization process due to the expected renewal of certain distributor agreements that are being consolidated. 
After this initial period, we expect to realize mid- to high-single-digit annualized pricing increases per subscriber. These 3 items impact our estimated adjusted segment profit growth by 500 to 600 basis points. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be $120 million to $125 million. This estimate excludes $52 million of TVN purchase price adjustment. We will also exclude purchase price adjustments from our adjusted earnings per share calculation. We expect interest expense to be approximately $135 million and lastly, our tax rate should be 30% to 32% for the year. 
And with that, we're ready for your questions."

I mean it was helpful getting the cadence around how you think advertising flows for the year, but as we just sort of think about the set up going forward with your ratings doing a bit better, and then any details that you have on the change of programming amortization, the rationale and sort of what you change from and into, would be helpful. And then if you wouldn't mind me throwing a third in there, just anything in terms of new entrants into distribution that you would comment on at this point. It seems like there's a lot of conversations going on, by the middle of the year, we might have some new entrants launching. Do you think you'll be available on any new platforms or bundles at launch? Or is that something that's still uncertain at this point?"

But calendar is always strong for us because especially on the home side, it's where endemics in the home category really put their money down. That's the way their buying calendar works. And so we're seeing that continued strength, we're very happy with it. And I have to say going into the upfront, we're feeling good. Ratings at all 6 of our networks are up, that's a great position to be in as we tie up the strength of our brands and the quality of our audience. We're still upscale. We've got a great story, in fact, our ad sales group is meeting this week for their national sales meeting. I was with them yesterday, I'll be with them this afternoon, and they're as upbeat as they can be given where we are with our networks, and where they are in the marketplace."

As it should be no surprise when we periodically look at how we're estimating our amortization, how it matches with revenue, and how our shows are being premiered and as a result, we're accelerating our amortization in the first year for certain networks, and it's having a onetime adjustment as we change the policy. So what you'll see is an impact, and you see our cost of sales numbers and the growth rate, probably call it from 1 point to 2 points impact for the year, depending on when the shows premiere. So again, we get past 2016, it will be no longer an impact. So I call it a noncash amortization impact. So I hope that helps you a little bit, but we continue to look at these things. And again, I think with the collapse of the networks all under Kathleen's leadership, we might continue to relook at how we're using programming and how that might impact, so we'll keep you in tuned but on an ongoing basis. Our investment is still moderating from a cash basis. So again, if you look at what the dollars going out the doors, we're still moderating. If we go back in time, we were probably as we brought in Travel, we were more at the high teens, we moderated that to the low teens and now we're in the -- I would call, we're closely in without this adjustment probably in the high single-digit zone, which is what we've been striving to do over the last couple of years."

So for the premieres in 2016, for certain networks, some of our larger ones, they're going to take a bigger proportion of that amortization in year 1, which we'll get the benefit in year 2, 3 and 4. So again, anytime we make changes in the amortization, it takes some time to funnel through and that's why I point back to the cash investment because that's a better indicator of what we're spending and what you'll see overtime."

I mean we had invested more as Lori just said a few moments ago, the percentage growth there was higher, but that's been moderating. We expect that moderation to continue and the reason is that even though Courtney's views coming into Travel, what we've learned about the Travel audience and Travel programming over the last 18 months is what we intended. You may recall over the last several quarters we've been saying that we're going to put a lot of programming on, new programming in the fourth quarter, we did. We learned a lot about what we put on, as always in TV some work, some didn't, so now we have better direction going forward. Courtney, she's got a long history with us, 10 years, long history in the business before that. She is very adept at articulating very clear rationale for why programs need to be on the air, and so she's very craftily divided sort of what's working on Travel into several groups of kinds of shows, and we're going to be pursuing those because we've seen that they've worked. You'll see a lot of sort of adventure quest shows in the guise of Expedition Unknown. We like seeing personalities like Andrew Zimmern and others like in Booze Traveler and Bizarre Foods going out and exploring the world, you'll see more of that. You'll see more pairs of people traveling because we like dynamics between them, and we're going to bring a little dose of celebrity to the network as well. We've got Queen Latifah with a new show, she will start off in South America, and then we've got other celebrities coming on too. So a lot of what we learned from the current programming in Travel that's working. What Courtney learned at HGTV, we're going to bring to bear and I have to tell you, she is moving forward at a very fast pace to make all this work."

High income, highly educated with a great preponderance to buy the products that they see advertised in our networks. That's indisputable and based on outside research, not our own research, and we are at the top in those attributes. Moreover as data becomes more of a commodity in the selling of advertising, we're going to excel, purchasing data, our audiences buy stuff. They have the money. They have disposable income. They go out and buy things. You're seeing pricing increases as Lori pointed out in our scatter. We think we're going to continue to close that gap, and we think we have a lot of headroom to do so because of the quality of our content, the nature of our environment, which the ads run and most importantly, the quality of that audience."

I think it's pretty clear that if we were to think about what U.S. domestic advertising growth rate is embedded in the guidance you gave, it seems like it might be the same or may be a slight acceleration from this year, may be the higher end of mid-singles, if you comment on that anyway I think it'd be helpful. And then kind of related to that, anybody who wants to just help opine on the theory here, we've been observing, when we see your ratings go up, which is rare in this world, it seems to be  tied very closely to when you put new episodes of your key programs on the air, which is great news because it shows when you have a hit show, when you put a new episode on, people watch it. It also begs the question of how -- are you more dependent than ever before on having to have new episodes? And what does it mean for rate of continued spend and investment? Is the world different now, do you think than it was a couple of years ago? And how sensitive the audience is to new programming versus the lifespans of reruns of those."

So again, I think it's the story of pricing and just like you're seeing, we're seeing strong scatter, we're seeing -- the calendar was very strong, options are at normal levels. So we're feeling again that it's going to be a very good year. It's going to be better than last year, but unlike last year, which I think we've talked a lot about that acceleration throughout the year where we started out slow, it's the first half we think it's going to be very strong due to some of the things that I said in my prepared comments is that it was softer in the first half, so we've got pricing plus our impressions are all up. So all very good, and we're seeing a little more strength there than we did last year."

In general though, I would say your premise is right. The television audiences in general have less tolerance for reruns and that's why you're seeing a lot of what's going on in the television industry overall. Its also why we responded many years ago in fact, when Jim Samples was running HGTV to that by putting into production 300 and 400 episodes of year -- a year of House Hunters. Very reasonably priced show for us, drives a lot of viewing. We decided that's where the investment of the original content. When we come to more new ones though because each network is a little different in our mix and even within a network, different kinds of shows are different when it comes to repeatability. Competition shows like the Food Network Star, they don't repeat very well. And so over time, I'm sure you've observed, you've seen us do fewer and fewer big stunt type shows. HGTV in fact is backing off a lot on that. Food Network is scaling them down a little bit. They don't repeat as well. They're great when they run, but they don't repeat as well. On the other hand, the show like Fixer Upper, which is far in a way right now, the #1 show on HGTV. The team there is so good in understanding when audiences are watching the network on certain nights that they realize that Fixer Upper on Tuesday night was getting an audience, but Fixer Upper reruns on Thursday night rather, could get a different audience that hasn't seen it. Sure enough, they put it on, on Thursday night. We actually promoted it. The first time we've ever promoted repeats of the show and the ratings were nearly 100% as what they were on Tuesday night. So there are ways for us to utilize reruns, recognizing the way audiences view in different patterns on our networks. So yes, you'll see more original programming, although as Lori said, we're not going to go crazy on our program budgets. We think we have the right number of hours and we can make the mix work."

Again, this high valuation, these valuations may come down, but they're not as actionable. And then on the international front, we just did a big TVN transaction that Jim and his team are focused on making that, working successfully as possible, taking the benefit of that and again, there's not a lot of big international opportunities that come on the horizon. So of course, anything that comes, we will take a look and keeping in mind that we have -- that we're trying to deleverage, so that we can take advantage of those opportunities when they come. Again, our priority is on investing our cash flows for things that generate growth and cash flow. So again, we've always got a 6 to 12-month window that we're looking. Also, on the Travel, that's already embedded in our delevering plan. We think that we can ingest that and really take care of that, so we continue to delever. That's our focus.

I think if you look, if you think about my remarks this morning, what we're doing as a company is transforming to a certain degree to different platforms.

And I think Doug upfront mentioned may be some new entrants coming on. So if you look at our total business operation domestically, and you realize we're having probably in 21 years some of our best rating years ever, it's because we're attracting newer audiences and growing still even though some of the distribution as I said has waned a bit on the traditional platforms. But as we see opportunities on alternative distribution platforms, we're going for them. I mentioned the Scripps Lifestyle Studios that we've created to do more short-form programming. We're very much about taking our content, and our categories and continuing to grow it but now on different distribution platforms and we're having enormous success on the TV Everywhere model as far as take rates and a spot in general. So we think the future for us is a bright one. But we're going to have to be more creative and ingenious in how we do reach future consumers on their platform of choice, if you will."

Our basic position is we don't automatically win on other platforms, the way we do in television. We have to be incredibly competitive. We have to look at what competitors are doing. We have to understand audiences particularly younger audiences who may not in some cases be as familiar with our TV brands. Although I'd point out, we told you today that millennial audiences actually are growing on our TV networks. So we do attract them there. And so the way we talk about it internally, strategically is we're in the same business we were in television when it comes to new platforms. We create great content. We attract desirable audiences, brand the content in many cases, and we got to compete just as aggressively on new platforms as we did on TV. No guarantee that we'll win, but we have a long history of success of knowing audiences in our categories, of sticking to our categories, of researching our categories and knowing advertisers in our categories. And so I have to say, we bet on ourselves to do well in those environments. Maybe not everyone, but the preponderance I think will do very well."

We will actually recruit talent because their ultimate goal is to be on our networks. So, and you will see more of that in the future. We've already looked at some of the programming lineups that's coming up, I guess in the next few months, Burton, where we're tapping into some of this talent. So it's not just for us to try to create content for those platforms. Find out what's working and then in some areas where we can recruit the talent, bring them into our company. We can enhance that talent by offering them larger platforms and different social media outlets to expand their personality, their brand, their talent as well. And so far, we've had a pretty good success rate with the ones we recruited in. So it's a little bit of a two-way street. This is new territory for us in some ways but pretty exciting.

Last summer and I believe we talked about this on calls, we started aggressively promoting our TV Everywhere watch apps, primarily on our 3 big networks HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel. We began to see significant downloads of our own watched apps at that point and they're growing by tens of thousands of additional downloads each month. The Roku, Amazon Fire and Apple TV apps are for -- are connected devices, so you watch through a television. Those have a very large existing base already. So the goal there was to make the existing users of those devices aware that our apps were now available. They became available toward the end of last year and we're seeing huge downloads of those apps over the first 3 months that they've been available. The viewing of course, is another matter, once you've the apps you then have to view. So the viewership, we're pushing aggressively on air as well. So we have 2 part promotion message on TV. One is get the app. The second is now you can watch your favorite programs anytime, anywhere, any device if you have the app and that's both live viewing and delayed viewing. And so it really is a very coordinated promotional effort to try to get viewers to understand. You can watch as now more often anywhere, anytime on any device. And I have to say it's early days, but we're seeing it work. On monetization, these are still small numbers against the overall linear television universe. So monetization will come. We have to start getting the habit in there now. It comes in a couple of ways, of course in C3, we can monetize all those connected devices right away because Nielsen measures anything that comes through a TV. The apps that people are viewing on their pads or phones, C3 will be a little bit of a waste to monetize until Nielsen gets the measure in order and signing up for that additional measurement product. However, on insertion after C3, that's all monetizeable. Now again, that's small right now, but we see that as a potential growth area for the insertion dynamic and insertion of ads. So we're getting the habits in place now for viewing, but we expect to see monetization grow as time goes on."

I think it's both the areas that we've moved into in digital. What we're finding, we'll call it experimentation because it is a little bit, this works, maybe this doesn't work but more emphasis here. But also think, it underscores the fact that millennials watch television and they're going to continue to watch television. Much of it for us, Laura, has to do with 25 to 34-year-olds growing into the categories. Once they started to become interested in the design of their apartment or their condo, or if they're fortunate enough, their home. Food, similarly once you start preparing meals, once it becomes a little bit more of a family environment, then our content just naturally kind of clicks in. So what we've seen is not only the increasing -- increases in ratings overall, but the increases as you mentioned, in millennials, but a lot of it has to do with traditional television watching. Now no question, they're using mobile in different ways, they're using other platforms in different ways. And we're experimenting over there and we're also using the investments that we've made in Tastemade, Refinery29, to see how those take rates are, how millennials are responding there. So I don't know if you agree with that, Burton, but I think it's a mixture of both."

What a year. 2015 was a milestone year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Revenues were up 13% hitting $3 billion for the first time. Advertising revenues were up 14%, exceeding $2 billion for the first time. Adjusted segment profits, up 13% to $1.3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share, up 25% to $4.94, and we completed the largest acquisition in the company's history, successfully transforming our international business through the acquisition of TVN. So quite a year indeed for the company, and I'd just like to say thanks to all the dedicated employees that help make this possible. 
We have a pretty simple business philosophy. We fortify and protect our core brands. We extend our reach by creating new connections with consumers. And finally, we generate and extract value from each of those connections whether it be on a television screen, a mobile device or even the pages of a magazine and we're doing that around the world. With TVN, the leading multi-platform media company in Poland, our company firmly established itself in one of Europe's most vibrant economies and created a platform for future growth in this desirable region. Here in the United States, our television networks enjoyed another strong year. We, once again, outperformed our peer group as we continued to attract the upscale engaged audiences coveted by our advertisers. 
As you'll hear from Burton shortly, our networks continue to be an essential element in the media plans of brands and agencies everywhere. We're meeting the challenges presented by changing media consumption habits. We've broadened our horizons and we've made our valued content available on a growing array of delivery platforms, including television, tablets and mobile to meet clear consumer demand. We're making smart strategic business moves that further position the company to take advantage of the evolving media landscape. We consolidated all of our U.S. television content development under a new Chief Content and Brand officer, Kathleen Finch, who's doing a fantastic job. It's a move that really makes it easier to tap the expertise and talent previously separated by brand. It's really made us a more cohesive and holistic organization. 
At the same time, we're expanding beyond traditional distribution platforms and generating more on-demand and short-form content specific to the platform on which it's consumed. Our recent launch of the Scripps Lifestyle Studios reflects our progress in this area. We made positive strides in 2015 to let consumers access our content on their delivery platform of choice and they've responded by visiting our websites and mobile apps in ever-increasing numbers. 
In 2015, we experienced strong revenue growth in advertising sales and content distribution. We united those under a single Chief Revenue Officer, Steve Gigliotti, who's tasked with maximizing all the company's monetization streams. We completed a company-wide cost analysis and took necessary steps to bring costs in line with projected revenue. It's made us leaner and it's really enhanced our ability to move quickly when opportunities arise. Advertisers want to work with us and distributors consider our channels as the kind of must-carry brands their consumers demand. 
So in summary, 2015 was truly a transformational year for our company. And over the last 20 years, we've established powerful brands that connect deeply with consumers across the world. We're growing revenues as we monetize audiences on all platforms. The solid consistent performance that our company exhibits quarter after quarter, year after year, validates the efforts of our incredibly talented teams around the world as we build value for all of our shareholders. So I want to thank you again for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. 
And now, let me turn it over to Burton who has details on our strong fourth quarter results. Burton?"

HGTV was 1 of only 3 to",1160,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. The year 2015 ended strong and that strength has continued into the early part of 2016. Here are just a few highlights. In 2015, both HGTV and Cooking Channel recorded their best years ever. HGTV was 1 of only 3 top 10 cable networks to grow its ratings in 2015. It completed its ninth consecutive year as the #1 network for upscale women and for the second year in a row was #1 with women 25 to 54 on weekends, that's a time period that really serves as a second primetime sales opportunity for us. 
Food Network and Travel Channel experienced strong growth in the fourth quarter and so far this year, all 6 of our networks are seeing ratings growth. On HGTV, some newer shows emerged as huge hits. Fixer Upper, a series about remodeling homes in Waco, Texas, has become one of the biggest shows in the network's history. It's just one example of how HGTV taps into the heartland of America. New seasons of Flip or Flop, Hawaii Life and Property Brothers at Home on the Ranch delivered high audiences as did House Hunters of course, our perennial franchise that we continue to expand to great effect. 
At Food Network, we've turned a corner on audience growth especially among younger viewers. Millennial appealing hits like Cutthroat Kitchen, Camp Cutthroat and Worst Cooks Celebrity drove 5% year-over-year growth in the valuable adults 25 to 34 age group. Family-friendly series like Halloween Baking Championship, Rachel Ray's Kids Cook-Off, encouraged co-viewing by the whole family and increased younger viewers by double digits. The 11th season of Food Network Star scored 15% higher ratings, becoming one of the summer's biggest success stories. And during fourth quarter, Food Network's overall viewership was up 5% over 2014. The network finished in the top 10 in women 25 to 54 and just outside the top 10 among adults. 
Travel Channel also showed very positive movement as some of the new shows we've been telling you about continued to gain traction. Overall Travel Channel viewership was up an impressive 5% for the quarter and the network has maintained its positive performance into the new year. Key contributors included Expedition Unknown, Bizarre Foods and Booze Traveler. And we have a slate of new shows in the pipeline that we're confident will help continue the growth trend. 
Late last year, we began to move some Travel Channel operations to our Knoxville headquarters and we expect to gain additional creative synergies as that move plays out over the next few quarters. Ratings at Cooking Channel continued to improve in the fourth quarter, maintaining healthy growth throughout the year. Cooking Channel finished 2015 with its sixth straight year of audience growth. For the fourth quarter, viewership soared 13% to record levels for adults and women ages 25 to 54, moreover the quarter was the youngest ever for primetime, thanks to strong growth in adults 25 to 54. 
Ratings growth resulted from successful original shows like Unique Eats and Sugar Showdown. DIY Network had a strong 2015, the most-watched year ever for adults 18 plus, and the second highest year for adults 25 to 54, driven by shows like Rehab Addict and Barnwood Builders. And Great American Country experienced its most upscale year yet as we continue its successful conversion to lifestyle programming. 
Now we talk a lot about television audiences and linear television is thriving at Scripps Networks Interactive. We also benefit from the growing awareness of TV Everywhere. Usage of our watch apps increased nearly 300% in January versus a year earlier. Connected devices such as Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV already comprise more than 1/3 of our total TV Everywhere reach. We're working diligently to ensure that we attract the next generation of viewers and consumers. We've seen significant progress on our television networks and on over-the-top services, but we must also create content that is purposely designed for alternative formats. 
At the end of 2015, we launched Scripps Lifestyle Studios. It's a dedicated editorial team that creates content specific to the platform on which it's consumed. It could be Facebook, Apple News, Snapchat or any of the many platforms that emerge every day as well as our own digital properties, and it lets us take advantage of key audiences and advertising opportunities while also reaching digital natives. An early example featured Chef Bobby Flay and his daughter Sophie, starring in a series of cooking videos that aired on Snapchat. This approach to content generation gives us greater agility to take advantage of advertising opportunities. We're able to integrate advertisers into authentic storytelling. This helps clients reach high-value audiences on the digital platforms they love and translates that engagement into deeper connection and transactions. 
I want to expand a little now on our international progress. TVN group closed 2015 with a strong 22% share of the adults 16 to 49 television audience in Poland and its spring season has opened with strong numbers. The programs Master Chef Junior and the new drama series, Second Chance, scored the best season premier ratings since 2013 across all TV channels in Poland. TVN continues to shine in its over-the-top strategy, more than 1.7 million people have registered with the TVN Player, making it 1 of the top 5 distribution platforms in the country. 
We continue to view TVN as a great asset for the engaged audiences its networks aggregate. We also see good opportunity to leverage TVN as a launchpad for expanding Scripps presence in this important region. Now while TVN provided the year's big international headline, the company experienced substantial growth in other parts of the world as well. Food Network, our most widely distributed global brand, is now available in more than 150 countries. It's the top lifestyle channel in the U.K. and has seen substantial success in Southeast Asia and more recently, Latin America and Australia. 
Travel Channel, our second most distributed brand is viewed in more than 130 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific region. HGTV debuted on the international scene just about a year ago. It's already the #1 lifestyle channel in Singapore and is growing rapidly in Malaysia and the Philippines. Additionally, our international-only brands, Asian Food Channel and Fine Living Network, enjoyed strong growth in 2015. Asian Food Channel allows us to develop locally produced shows specific to Asian markets while with Fine Living Network, we can showcase the best of our content from the home, food and travel categories on a single network in markets where that approach works best. 
From Knoxville to New York, to Warsaw and Singapore, on TV screens, tablets and smartphones, we're connecting with millions of consumers worldwide every day, every way. And we're taking advantage of new ways to monetize the close relationships we develop. That's our goal, that's our commitment. 
And now I'll turn it over to Lori who will review financial performance."

Since you've seen our strong results, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers that Ken mentioned, discuss our segment performance, provide guidance and then open it up for Q&A. 
2015 was a great year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Revenue increased an impressive 13% surpassing $3 billion for the first time. Driving this growth was a strong advertising market for our lifestyle brands, growth in affiliate fees, and the significant expansion of our international business through TVN. This strong revenue growth, coupled with focused cost control helped in part by our 2014 announced restructuring and early retirement effort translated to a 13% growth in adjusted segment profit and adjusted EPS growth of 25% compared with the prior year. 
For the fourth quarter, total company revenue was up 27%. Contributing to this growth was the inclusion of TVN, and strong advertising growth and affiliate fee increases primarily at the U.S. Networks segment, which I'll discuss in more detail later. Total adjusted segment profit increased 19%, driven by strong revenue growth, partially offset by increases in cost of services, primarily programming expense. Also, contributing to the expense growth were international increases related to the inclusion of TVN. 
Adjusted net income attributable to SNI was $1.35 per diluted share, up 35% due to the operating improvements noted previously. We had a great quarter at our U.S. Networks segment. Revenues increased 8%, driven by strong advertising demand for our lifestyle networks as well as continued affiliate fee growth. For the advertising revenue, improved scatter pricing, coupled with CPM price increases from the 2015, 2016 upfront and calendar upfront markets, drove an 8% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing was up high single to low double digits year-over-year and up high teens to low 20s over the broadcast upfront. 
Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter, were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, auto and pharmaceutical. These categories are fairly consistent with prior periods, except pharma, which was stronger than normal in the fourth quarter. This strong advertising market has continued into the first quarter with scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing up high single to low double digits year-over-year and up teens to low 20s over the new broadcast upfront. 
For affiliate fees. Contributing to the 5% growth were: contractual rate escalators with our traditional distribution partners; incremental distribution increases that we negotiated in some recent renewals for both DIY Network and Cooking Channel; and new distribution related to broadband providers. Looking at our adjusted segment profit and as Burton mentioned for the fourth quarter of 2015, our networks realized positive ratings momentum that has continued into 2016. Helping to drive this performance was the decision to shift programming premiers to the fourth quarter, which also allowed us to take advantage of a robust advertising market. However, this record amount of new programming also drove an increase in programming expense for the quarter. Additionally, and as indicated on previous calls, we focused on developing programming themes for the Travel Channel to develop a strong network identity. We reevaluated our programming library and elected to write off a larger than normal amount of Travel Channel programming in the fourth quarter. 
As a result of these decisions our adjusted segment profit was down 1% for the quarter. However, we believe the longer-term trend will be a continued deceleration rate of programming expense growth consistent with what we've seen over the past couple of years. Our international revenues of $163 million increased significantly due to the consolidation of TVN, coupled with growth in our existing international business. TVN revenues were up 7% in local currency compared to the same quarter a year ago while revenues from our existing operations were up 17% on an organic basis. 
International segment profit was a healthy $36 million compared with a loss of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This $44 million improvement is primarily due to the inclusion of TVN as we are still investing in our existing international lifestyle networks. In addition to our consolidated results, we have significant international operations reported in our equity earnings. In total, our equity and earnings of affiliates was $11 million, down compared with the prior year fourth quarter, primarily due to transaction-related accounting adjustments and seasonality related to the TVN minority investments we acquired. 
On the balance sheet, I want to touch on a couple of items. As you've seen, reflecting the confidence management has in the business to continue to generate strong operating free cash flow, we've increased our dividend for the sixth consecutive year to $1 per share annually. Within our capital allocation priorities, we're focused on using operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our leverage and invest in M&A both in the U.S. and internationally. We ended the fourth quarter at approximately 3.2x growth leverage and we recently notified Cox Communications of our intent to purchase their 35% stake in Travel Channel. This notification started the valuation process for the transaction and we expect the transaction will be completed by the end of the first quarter. 
Finally and before we open it up for questions, we'll provide our full-year 2016 guidance. All guidance is based on total company results. As a result of the strong demand for our networks from viewers and advertisers along with an increasing contribution from international, we expect revenue growth of approximately 12%. We believe the revenue increase will be driven primarily by a full year of TVN results and growth in advertising revenue. We expect for the first half of 2016, the company will realize a higher growth rate due in part to easier advertising comps at the U.S. Networks segment and because TVN results were not included in the first half of 2015. 
We expect the third quarter will be impacted by the Olympics and to a lesser extent, the presidential election. So it should be the slowest growth quarter of the year, then growth should accelerate somewhat for the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 7%. Adjusted segment profit excludes TVN transaction and integration cost, restructuring and reorganization costs for 2015 and 2016. Impacting the 2016 segment profit growth will be a larger proportionate share of international revenues, which have an inherently lower segment profit profile compared to our U.S. networks; a change in our program amortization policy and estimation rates for certain programming across the networks; and the likely impact from a onetime rate equalization process due to the expected renewal of certain distributor agreements that are being consolidated. 
After this initial period, we expect to realize mid- to high single-digit annualized pricing increases per subscriber. These 3 items impact our estimated adjusted segment profit growth by 500 to 600 basis points. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be $120 million to $125 million. This estimate excludes $52 million of TVN purchase price adjustments. We will also exclude purchase price adjustments from our adjusted earnings per share calculations. We expect interest expense to be approximately $135 million and lastly, our tax rate should be 30% to 32% for the year. 
And with that, we're ready for your questions."

And then if you wouldn't mind me throwing a third in there, just anything in terms of new entrants into distribution that you would comment on at this point. It seems like there's a lot of conversations going on, and by the middle of the year, we might have some new entrants launch.

With scatter pricing where it is, I think advertisers want to get their money down and try to not play in that scatter market if they can avoid it because the pricing is so high. But calendar is always strong for us because especially on the home side, it's where endemics in the home category really put their money down. That's the way their buying calendar works. And so we're seeing that continued strength, we're very happy with it. And I have to say going into the upfront, we're feeling good. Ratings at all 6 of our networks are up, that's a great position to be in as we tally [ph] up the strength of our brands and the quality of our audience. We're still upscale. We've got a great story, in fact, our ad sales group is meeting this week for their national sales meeting.

As it should be no surprise, when we periodically look at how we're estimating our amortization, how it matches with revenue, and how our shows are being premiered and as a result, we're accelerating our amortization in the first year for certain networks, and it's having a onetime adjustment as we change the policy. So what you'll see is an impact when you see our cost of sales numbers and the growth rate, probably, call it, from 1 point to 2 points impact for the year, depending on when the shows premiere. So again, we get past 2016, it will be no longer an impact. So I'd call it a noncash amortization impact. So hopefully that helps you a little bit, but we continue to look at these things. And again, I think with the collapse of the networks all under Kathleen's leadership, we might continue to relook at how we're using programming and how that might impact, so we'll keep you in tune. But on an ongoing basis, our investment is still moderating from a cash basis. So again, if you look at what the dollars going out the doors, we're still moderating. If we go back in time, we were probably as we brought in Travel, we were more at the high teens, we moderated that to the low teens and now we're in the -- I would call, we're closely -- and without this adjustment probably in the high single-digit zone, which is what we've been striving to do over the last couple of years."

So for the premieres in 2016, for certain networks, some of our larger ones, they're going to take a bigger proportion of that amortization in year 1, which they'll get the benefit in year 2, 3 and 4. So again, anytime we make changes in the amortization, it takes some time to funnel through and that's why I point back to the cash investment because that's a better indicator of what we're spending and what you'll see over time."

I mean we had invested more, as Lori just said a few moments ago, the percentage growth there was higher, but that's been moderating. We expect that moderation to continue and the reason is that even though Courtney is new to coming into Travel, what we've learned about the Travel audience and Travel programming over the last 18 months is what we intended. You may recall over the last several quarters we've been saying that we're going to put a lot of programming on, new programming in the fourth quarter, we did. We learned a lot about what we put on, as always in TV some worked, some didn't, so now we have better direction going forward. Courtney, she's got a long history with us, 10 years, long history in the business before that. She is very adept at articulating a very clear rationale for why programs need to be on the air, and so she's very craftily divided sort of what's working on Travel into several groups of kinds of shows, and we're going to be pursuing those because we've seen that they've worked. You'll see a lot of sort of adventure quest shows in the guise of Expedition Unknown. We like seeing personalities like Andrew Zimmern and others like in Booze Traveler and Bizarre Foods going out and exploring the world, you'll see more of that. You'll see more pairs of people traveling because we like dynamics between them, and we're going to bring a little dose of celebrity to the network as well. We've got Queen Latifah with a new show, she'll start off in South America, and then we've got other celebrities coming on too. So a lot of what we learned from the current programming at Travel that's working. What Courtney learned at HGTV we're going to bring to bear, and I have to tell you, she is moving forward at a very fast pace to make all this work."

High income, highly educated with a great preponderance to buy the products that they see advertised on our networks. That's indisputable and based on outside research, not our own research, and we are at the top in those attributes. Moreover as data becomes more of a commodity in the selling of advertising, we're going to excel, purchasing data, our audiences buy stuff. They have the money. They have disposable income. They go out and buy things. You're seeing pricing increases as Lori pointed out in our scatter. We think we're going to continue to close that gap, and we think we have a lot of headroom to do so because of the quality of our content, the nature of our environment in which the ads run and most importantly, the quality of that audience."

I think it's pretty clear that if we were to think about what U.S. domestic advertising growth rate is embedded in the guidance you gave, it seems like it might be the same or maybe a slight acceleration from this year, may be the higher end of mid-singles, if you'd comment on that in any way, I think it'd be helpful. And then kind of related to that, anybody who wants to just help opine on the theory here, we've been observing, when we see your ratings go up, which is rare in this world, it seems to be tied very closely to when you put new episodes of your key programs on the air, which is great news because it shows when you have a hit show, when you put a new episode on, people watch it. It also begs the question of how -- are you more dependent than ever before on having to have new episodes? And what does it mean for rate of continued spend and investment? Is the world different now, do you think than it was a couple of years ago in how sensitive the audience is to new programming versus the lifespan of reruns of those."

So again, I think it's the story of pricing and just like you're seeing, we're seeing strong scatter, we're seeing -- the calendar was very strong, options are at normal levels. So we're feeling again that it's going to be a very good year. It's going to be better than last year, but unlike last year, which I think we've talked a lot about that acceleration throughout the year where we started out slow, it's the first half we think is going to be very strong due to some of the things that I said in my prepared comments is that it was softer in the first half, so we got pricing plus our impressions are all up.

In general though, I would say your premise is right, that television audiences in general have less tolerance for reruns and that's why you're seeing a lot of what's going on in the television industry overall. Its also why we responded, many years ago in fact, when Jim Samples was running HGTV, to that by putting into production 300 and 400 episodes of year -- a year of House Hunters. A very reasonably priced show for us, drives a lot of viewing. We decided that that's worth the investment in the original content. It becomes more nuanced, though, because each network is a little different in our mix and even within a network, different kinds of shows are different when it comes to repeatability. Competition shows like the Food Network Star, they don't repeat very well. And so over time, I'm sure you've observed, you've seen us do fewer and fewer big stunt type shows. HGTV in fact is backing off a lot on that. Food Network is scaling them down a little bit. They don't repeat as well. They're great when they run, but they don't repeat as well. On the other hand, a show like Fixer Upper, which is far and away right now, the #1 show on HGTV. The team there is so good at understanding when audiences are watching the network on certain nights that they realize that Fixer Upper on Tuesday night was getting an audience, but Fixer Upper reruns on Thursday night rather, could get a different audience that hadn't seen it. Sure enough, they put it on, on Thursday night. We actually promoted it. The first time we've ever promoted repeats of a show and the ratings were nearly 100% as what they were on Tuesday night. So there are ways for us to utilize reruns, recognizing the way audiences view in different patterns on our networks. So yes, you'll see more original programming, although as Lori said, we're not going to go crazy on our program budgets. We think we have the right number of hours and we can make the mix work."

Then Jim and his team are focused on making that work as successfully as possible, taking the benefit of that and again, there's not a lot of big international opportunities that come on the horizon. So of course, anything that comes, we will take a look, keeping in mind that we have -- that we're trying to delever, so that we can take advantage of those opportunities when they come. Again, our priority is on investing our cash flows for things that generate growth and cash flow. So again, we've always got a 6 to 12-month window that we're looking. Also, on the Travel, that's already embedded in our delevering plan. We think that we can ingest that and really take care of that, so we continue to delever. That's our focus.

And I think Doug upfront mentioned maybe some new entrants coming on. So if you look at our total business operation domestically, and you realize we're having probably in 21 years some of our best ratings years ever, it's because we're attracting newer audiences and growing still even though some of the distribution as I said has waned a bit on the traditional platforms. But as we see opportunities on alternative distribution platforms, we're going for them. I mentioned the Scripps Lifestyle Studios that we've created to do more short-form programming. We're very much about taking our content, and our categories and continuing to grow it, but now on different distribution platforms. And we're having enormous success on the TV Everywhere model as far as take rates and SFOT [ph] in general. So we think the future for us is a bright one.

Our basic position is we don't automatically win on other platforms, the way we do in television. We have to be incredibly competitive. We have to look at what competitors are doing. We have to understand audiences particularly younger audiences who may not in some cases be as familiar with our TV brands. Although I'd point out, we told you today that millennial audiences actually are growing on our TV networks. So we do attract them there. And so the way we talk about it internally, strategically is we're in the same business we were in television when it comes to new platforms. We create great content. We attract desirable audiences. It's branded content in many cases, and we've got to compete just as aggressively on new platforms as we did on TV. No guarantee that we'll win, but we have a long history of success of knowing audiences in our categories, of sticking to our categories, of researching our categories and knowing advertisers in our categories.

We will actually recruit talent because their ultimate goal is to be on our networks. So, and you will see more of that in the future. We've already looked at some of the programming lineups that's coming up, I guess in the next few months, Burton, where we're tapping into some of this talent. So it's not just for us to try to create content for those platforms, but find out what's working and in some areas where we can recruit the talent, bring them into our company. We can enhance that talent by offering them larger a platform and different social media outlets to expand their personality, their brand, their talent as well. And so far, we've had a pretty good success rate with the ones we recruited in. So it's a little bit of a two-way street. This is new territory for us in some ways but pretty exciting.

And that's embedded in that 500 to 600 basis point, which includes the other things, so we've got an increasing amount of internationals in the first 6 months as well as the program amortization. So there's an impact there, but I would like to stress again, it's a onetime item. And then when we get to 2017 again, we're looking for mid- to high single digits.

Last summer and I believe we talked about this on calls, we started aggressively promoting our TV Everywhere watch apps, primarily on our 3 big networks HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel. We began to see significant downloads of our own watch apps at that point and they're growing by tens of thousands of additional downloads each month. The Roku, Amazon Fire and Apple TV apps are for connected -- are connected devices, so you watch through a television. Those have a very large existing base already. So the goal there was to make the existing users of those devices aware that our apps were now available. They became available toward the end of last year and we're seeing huge downloads of those apps over the first 3 months that they've been available. The viewing of course, is another matter, once you have the apps you then have to view. So the viewership, we're pushing aggressively on air as well. So we have a 2 part promotion message on TV. One is get the app. The second is now you can watch your favorite programs anytime, anywhere, any device if you have the app and that's both live viewing and delayed viewing. And so it really is a very coordinated promotional effort to try to get viewers to understand. You can watch us now more often anywhere, anytime on any device. And I have to say it's early days, but we're seeing it work. On monetization, these are still small numbers against the overall linear television universe. So monetization will come. We have to start getting the habit in there now. It comes in a couple of ways, of course in C3, we can monetize all those connected devices right away because Nielsen measures anything that comes through a TV. The apps that people are viewing on their pads or phones, C3 will be a little bit of a wait to monetize until Nielsen gets the measurment in order and we sign up for that additional measurement product. However, on insertion after C3, that's all monetizeable. Now again, that's small right now, but we see that as a potential growth area for the insertion dynamic and insertion of ads. So we're getting the habits in place now for viewing, but we expect to see monetization grow as time goes on."

I think it's both the areas that we've moved into in digital. What we're finding, we'll call it experimentation because it is a little bit, this works, maybe this doesn't work, put more emphasis here. But I also think it underscores the fact that millennials watch television and are going to continue to watch television. Much of it for us, Laura, has to do with 25 to 34-year-olds growing into the categories. Once they start to become interested in the design of their apartment or their condo, or if they're fortunate enough, their home. Food, similarly, once you start preparing meals, once it becomes a little bit more of a family environment, then our content just naturally kind of clicks in. And so what we've seen is not only the increasing -- increases in ratings overall, but the increases as you mentioned, in millennials, but a lot of it has to do with traditional television watching. Now no question, they're using mobile in different ways, they're using other platforms in different ways. And we're experimenting over there and we're also using the investments that we've made in Tastemade, Refinery29, to see how those take rates are, how millennials are responding there. So I don't know if you agree with that, Burton, but I think it's a mixture of both."

What a year. 2015 was a milestone year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Revenues were up 13% hitting $3 billion for the first time. Advertising revenues were up 14%, exceeding $2 billion for the first time. Adjusted segment profits, up 13% to $1.3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share, up 25% to $4.94, and we completed the largest acquisition in the company's history, successfully transforming our international business through the acquisition of TVN. So quite a year indeed for the company, and I'd just like to say thanks to all the dedicated employees that help make this possible. 
We have a pretty simple business philosophy. We fortify and protect our core brands. We extend our reach by creating new connections with consumers. And finally, we generate and extract value from each of those connections whether it be on a television screen, a mobile device or even the pages of a magazine and we're doing that around the world. With TVN, the leading multi-platform media company in Poland, our company firmly established itself in one of Europe's most vibrant economies and created a platform for future growth in this desirable region. Here in the United States, our television networks enjoyed another strong year. We, once again, outperformed our peer group as we continued to attract the upscale engaged audiences coveted by our advertisers. 
As you'll hear from Burton shortly, our networks continue to be an essential element in the media plans of brands and agencies everywhere. We're meeting the challenges presented by changing media consumption habits. We've broadened our horizons and we've made our valued content available on a growing array of delivery platforms, including television, tablets and mobile to meet clear consumer demand. We're making smart strategic business moves that further position the company to take advantage of the evolving media landscape. We consolidated all of our U.S. television content development under a new Chief Content and Brand officer, Kathleen Finch, who's doing a fantastic job. It's a move that really makes it easier to tap the expertise and talent previously separated by brand. It's really made us a more cohesive and holistic organization. 
At the same time, we're expanding beyond traditional distribution platforms and generating more on-demand and short-form content specific to the platform on which it's consumed. Our recent launch of the Scripps Lifestyle Studios reflects our progress in this area. We made positive strides in 2015 to let consumers access our content on their delivery platform of choice and they've responded by visiting our websites and mobile apps in ever-increasing numbers. 
In 2015, we experienced strong revenue growth in advertising sales and content distribution. We united those under a single Chief Revenue Officer, Steve Gigliotti, who's tasked with maximizing all the company's monetization streams. We completed a company-wide cost analysis and took necessary steps to bring costs in line with projected revenue. It's made us leaner and it's really enhanced our ability to move quickly when opportunities arise. Advertisers want to work with us and distributors consider our channels as the kind of must-carry brands their consumers demand. 
So in summary, 2015 was truly a transformational year for our company. And over the last 20 years, we've established powerful brands that connect deeply with consumers across the world. We're growing revenues as we monetize audiences on all platforms. The solid consistent performance that our company exhibits quarter after quarter, year after year, validates the efforts of our incredibly talented teams around the world as we build value for all of our shareholders. So I want to thank you again for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. 
And now, let me turn it over to Burton who has details on our strong fourth quarter results. Burton?"

HGTV was 1 of only 3 to",1160,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. The year 2015 ended strong and that strength has continued into the early part of 2016. Here are just a few highlights. In 2015, both HGTV and Cooking Channel recorded their best years ever. HGTV was 1 of only 3 top 10 cable networks to grow its ratings in 2015. It completed its ninth consecutive year as the #1 network for upscale women and for the second year in a row was #1 with women 25 to 54 on weekends, that's a time period that really serves as a second primetime sales opportunity for us. 
Food Network and Travel Channel experienced strong growth in the fourth quarter and so far this year, all 6 of our networks are seeing ratings growth. On HGTV, some newer shows emerged as huge hits. Fixer Upper, a series about remodeling homes in Waco, Texas, has become one of the biggest shows in the network's history. It's just one example of how HGTV taps into the heartland of America. New seasons of Flip or Flop, Hawaii Life and Property Brothers at Home on the Ranch delivered high audiences as did House Hunters of course, our perennial franchise that we continue to expand to great effect. 
At Food Network, we've turned a corner on audience growth especially among younger viewers. Millennial appealing hits like Cutthroat Kitchen, Camp Cutthroat and Worst Cooks Celebrity drove 5% year-over-year growth in the valuable adults 25 to 34 age group. Family-friendly series like Halloween Baking Championship, Rachel Ray's Kids Cook-Off, encouraged co-viewing by the whole family and increased younger viewers by double digits. The 11th season of Food Network Star scored 15% higher ratings, becoming one of the summer's biggest success stories. And during fourth quarter, Food Network's overall viewership was up 5% over 2014. The network finished in the top 10 in women 25 to 54 and just outside the top 10 among adults. 
Travel Channel also showed very positive movement as some of the new shows we've been telling you about continued to gain traction. Overall Travel Channel viewership was up an impressive 5% for the quarter and the network has maintained its positive performance into the new year. Key contributors included Expedition Unknown, Bizarre Foods and Booze Traveler. And we have a slate of new shows in the pipeline that we're confident will help continue the growth trend. 
Late last year, we began to move some Travel Channel operations to our Knoxville headquarters and we expect to gain additional creative synergies as that move plays out over the next few quarters. Ratings at Cooking Channel continued to improve in the fourth quarter, maintaining healthy growth throughout the year. Cooking Channel finished 2015 with its sixth straight year of audience growth. For the fourth quarter, viewership soared 13% to record levels for adults and women ages 25 to 54, moreover the quarter was the youngest ever for primetime, thanks to strong growth in adults 25 to 54. 
Ratings growth resulted from successful original shows like Unique Eats and Sugar Showdown. DIY Network had a strong 2015, the most-watched year ever for adults 18 plus, and the second highest year for adults 25 to 54, driven by shows like Rehab Addict and Barnwood Builders. And Great American Country experienced its most upscale year yet as we continue its successful conversion to lifestyle programming. 
Now we talk a lot about television audiences and linear television is thriving at Scripps Networks Interactive. We also benefit from the growing awareness of TV Everywhere. Usage of our watch apps increased nearly 300% in January versus a year earlier. Connected devices such as Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV already comprise more than 1/3 of our total TV Everywhere reach. We're working diligently to ensure that we attract the next generation of viewers and consumers. We've seen significant progress on our television networks and on over-the-top services, but we must also create content that is purposely designed for alternative formats. 
At the end of 2015, we launched Scripps Lifestyle Studios. It's a dedicated editorial team that creates content specific to the platform on which it's consumed. It could be Facebook, Apple News, Snapchat or any of the many platforms that emerge every day as well as our own digital properties, and it lets us take advantage of key audiences and advertising opportunities while also reaching digital natives. An early example featured Chef Bobby Flay and his daughter Sophie, starring in a series of cooking videos that aired on Snapchat. This approach to content generation gives us greater agility to take advantage of advertising opportunities. We're able to integrate advertisers into authentic storytelling. This helps clients reach high-value audiences on the digital platforms they love and translates that engagement into deeper connection and transactions. 
I want to expand a little now on our international progress. TVN group closed 2015 with a strong 22% share of the adults 16 to 49 television audience in Poland and its spring season has opened with strong numbers. The programs Master Chef Junior and the new drama series, Second Chance, scored the best season premier ratings since 2013 across all TV channels in Poland. TVN continues to shine in its over-the-top strategy, more than 1.7 million people have registered with the TVN Player, making it 1 of the top 5 distribution platforms in the country. 
We continue to view TVN as a great asset for the engaged audiences its networks aggregate. We also see good opportunity to leverage TVN as a launchpad for expanding Scripps presence in this important region. Now while TVN provided the year's big international headline, the company experienced substantial growth in other parts of the world as well. Food Network, our most widely distributed global brand, is now available in more than 150 countries. It's the top lifestyle channel in the U.K. and has seen substantial success in Southeast Asia and more recently, Latin America and Australia. 
Travel Channel, our second most distributed brand is viewed in more than 130 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific region. HGTV debuted on the international scene just about a year ago. It's already the #1 lifestyle channel in Singapore and is growing rapidly in Malaysia and the Philippines. Additionally, our international-only brands, Asian Food Channel and Fine Living Network, enjoyed strong growth in 2015. Asian Food Channel allows us to develop locally produced shows specific to Asian markets while with Fine Living Network, we can showcase the best of our content from the home, food and travel categories on a single network in markets where that approach works best. 
From Knoxville to New York, to Warsaw and Singapore, on TV screens, tablets and smartphones, we're connecting with millions of consumers worldwide every day, every way. And we're taking advantage of new ways to monetize the close relationships we develop. That's our goal, that's our commitment. 
And now I'll turn it over to Lori who will review financial performance."

Since you've seen our strong results, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers that Ken mentioned, discuss our segment performance, provide guidance and then open it up for Q&A. 
2015 was a great year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Revenue increased an impressive 13% surpassing $3 billion for the first time. Driving this growth was a strong advertising market for our lifestyle brands, growth in affiliate fees, and the significant expansion of our international business through TVN. This strong revenue growth, coupled with focused cost control helped in part by our 2014 announced restructuring and early retirement effort translated to a 13% growth in adjusted segment profit and adjusted EPS growth of 25% compared with the prior year. 
For the fourth quarter, total company revenue was up 27%. Contributing to this growth was the inclusion of TVN, and strong advertising growth and affiliate fee increases primarily at the U.S. Networks segment, which I'll discuss in more detail later. Total adjusted segment profit increased 19%, driven by strong revenue growth, partially offset by increases in cost of services, primarily programming expense. Also, contributing to the expense growth were international increases related to the inclusion of TVN. 
Adjusted net income attributable to SNI was $1.35 per diluted share, up 35% due to the operating improvements noted previously. We had a great quarter at our U.S. Networks segment. Revenues increased 8%, driven by strong advertising demand for our lifestyle networks as well as continued affiliate fee growth. For the advertising revenue, improved scatter pricing, coupled with CPM price increases from the 2015, 2016 upfront and calendar upfront markets, drove an 8% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing was up high single to low double digits year-over-year and up high teens to low 20s over the broadcast upfront. 
Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter, were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, auto and pharmaceutical. These categories are fairly consistent with prior periods, except pharma, which was stronger than normal in the fourth quarter. This strong advertising market has continued into the first quarter with scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing up high single to low double digits year-over-year and up teens to low 20s over the new broadcast upfront. 
For affiliate fees. Contributing to the 5% growth were: contractual rate escalators with our traditional distribution partners; incremental distribution increases that we negotiated in some recent renewals for both DIY Network and Cooking Channel; and new distribution related to broadband providers. Looking at our adjusted segment profit and as Burton mentioned for the fourth quarter of 2015, our networks realized positive ratings momentum that has continued into 2016. Helping to drive this performance was the decision to shift programming premiers to the fourth quarter, which also allowed us to take advantage of a robust advertising market. However, this record amount of new programming also drove an increase in programming expense for the quarter. Additionally, and as indicated on previous calls, we focused on developing programming themes for the Travel Channel to develop a strong network identity. We reevaluated our programming library and elected to write off a larger than normal amount of Travel Channel programming in the fourth quarter. 
As a result of these decisions, our adjusted segment profit was down 1% for the quarter. However, we believe the longer-term trend will be a continued deceleration rate of programming expense growth consistent with what we've seen over the past couple of years. Our international revenues of $163 million increased significantly due to the consolidation of TVN, coupled with growth in our existing international business. TVN revenues were up 7% in local currency compared to the same quarter a year ago while revenues from our existing operations were up 17% on an organic basis. 
International segment profit was a healthy $36 million compared with a loss of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This $44 million improvement is primarily due to the inclusion of TVN as we are still investing in our existing international lifestyle networks. In addition to our consolidated results, we have significant international operations reported in our equity earnings. In total, our equity and earnings of affiliates was $11 million, down compared with the prior year fourth quarter, primarily due to transaction-related accounting adjustments and seasonality related to the TVN minority investments we acquired. 
On the balance sheet, I want to touch on a couple of items. As you've seen, reflecting the confidence management has in the business to continue to generate strong operating free cash flow, we've increased our dividend for the sixth consecutive year to $1 per share annually. Within our capital allocation priorities, we're focused on using operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our leverage and invest in M&A both in the U.S. and internationally. We ended the fourth quarter at approximately 3.2x growth leverage and we recently notified Cox Communications of our intent to purchase their 35% stake in Travel Channel. This notification started the valuation process for the transaction and we expect the transaction will be completed by the end of the first quarter. 
Finally and before we open it up for questions, we'll provide our full-year 2016 guidance. All guidance is based on total company results. As a result of the strong demand for our networks from viewers and advertisers along with an increasing contribution from international, we expect revenue growth of approximately 12%. We believe the revenue increase will be driven primarily by a full year of TVN results and growth in advertising revenue. We expect for the first half of 2016, the company will realize a higher growth rate due in part to easier advertising comps at the U.S. Networks segment and because TVN results were not included in the first half of 2015. 
We expect the third quarter will be impacted by the Olympics and to a lesser extent, the presidential election. So it should be the slowest growth quarter of the year, then growth should accelerate somewhat for the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 7%. Adjusted segment profit excludes TVN transaction and integration cost, restructuring and reorganization costs for 2015 and 2016. Impacting the 2016 segment profit growth will be a larger proportionate share of international revenues, which have an inherently lower segment profit profile compared to our U.S. networks; a change in our program amortization policy and estimation rates for certain programming across the networks; and the likely impact from a onetime rate equalization process due to the expected renewal of certain distributor agreements that are being consolidated. 
After this initial period, we expect to realize mid- to high single-digit annualized pricing increases per subscriber. These 3 items impact our estimated adjusted segment profit growth by 500 to 600 basis points. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be $120 million to $125 million. This estimate excludes $52 million of TVN purchase price adjustments. We will also exclude purchase price adjustments from our adjusted earnings per share calculations. We expect interest expense to be approximately $135 million and lastly, our tax rate should be 30% to 32% for the year. 
And with that, we're ready for your questions."

And then if you wouldn't mind me throwing a third in there, just anything in terms of new entrants into distribution that you would comment on at this point. It seems like there's a lot of conversations going on, and by the middle of the year, we might have some new entrants launch.

But calendar is always strong for us because especially on the home side, it's where endemics in the home category really put their money down. That's the way their buying calendar works. And so we're seeing that continued strength, we're very happy with it. And I have to say going into the upfront, we're feeling good. Ratings at all 6 of our networks are up, that's a great position to be in as we tally [ph] up the strength of our brands and the quality of our audience. We're still upscale. We've got a great story, in fact, our ad sales group is meeting this week for their national sales meeting.

As it should be no surprise, when we periodically look at how we're estimating our amortization, how it matches with revenue, and how our shows are being premiered and as a result, we're accelerating our amortization in the first year for certain networks, and it's having a onetime adjustment as we change the policy. So what you'll see is an impact when you see our cost of sales numbers and the growth rate, probably, call it, from 1 point to 2 points impact for the year, depending on when the shows premiere. So again, we get past 2016, it will be no longer an impact. So I'd call it a noncash amortization impact. So hopefully that helps you a little bit, but we continue to look at these things. And again, I think with the collapse of the networks all under Kathleen's leadership, we might continue to relook at how we're using programming and how that might impact, so we'll keep you in tune. But on an ongoing basis, our investment is still moderating from a cash basis. So again, if you look at what the dollars going out the doors, we're still moderating. If we go back in time, we were probably -- as we brought in Travel, we were more at the high teens. We moderated that to the low teens and now we're in the -- I would call, we're closely -- and without this adjustment, probably in the high single-digit zone, which is what we've been striving to do over the last couple of years."

So for the premieres in 2016, for certain networks, some of our larger ones, they're going to take a bigger proportion of that amortization in year 1, which they'll get the benefit in year 2, 3 and 4. So again, anytime we make changes in the amortization, it takes some time to funnel through and that's why I point back to the cash investment because that's a better indicator of what we're spending and what you'll see over time."

I mean we had invested more, as Lori just said a few moments ago, the percentage growth there was higher, but that's been moderating. We expect that moderation to continue and the reason is that even though Courtney is new to coming into Travel, what we've learned about the Travel audience and Travel programming over the last 18 months is what we intended. You may recall over the last several quarters we've been saying that we're going to put a lot of programming on, new programming in the fourth quarter, we did. We learned a lot about what we put on, as always in TV some worked, some didn't, so now we have better direction going forward. Courtney, she's got a long history with us, 10 years, long history in the business before that. She is very adept at articulating a very clear rationale for why programs need to be on the air, and so she's very craftily divided sort of what's working on Travel into several groups of kinds of shows, and we're going to be pursuing those because we've seen that they've worked. You'll see a lot of sort of adventure quest shows in the guise of Expedition Unknown. We like seeing personalities like Andrew Zimmern and others like in Booze Traveler and Bizarre Foods going out and exploring the world, you'll see more of that. You'll see more pairs of people traveling because we like dynamics between them, and we're going to bring a little dose of celebrity to the network as well. We've got Queen Latifah with a new show, she'll start off in South America, and then we've got other celebrities coming on too. So a lot of what we learned from the current programming at Travel that's working. What Courtney learned at HGTV we're going to bring to bear, and I have to tell you, she is moving forward at a very fast pace to make all this work."

Moreover as data becomes more of a commodity in the selling of advertising, we're going to excel, purchasing data, our audiences buy stuff. They have the money. They have disposable income. They go out and buy things. You're seeing pricing increases as Lori pointed out in our scatter.

I think it's pretty clear that if we were to think about what U.S. domestic advertising growth rate is embedded in the guidance you gave, it seems like it might be the same or maybe a slight acceleration from this year, may be the higher end of mid-singles, if you'd comment on that in any way, I think it'd be helpful. And then kind of related to that, anybody who wants to just help opine on the theory here, we've been observing, when we see your ratings go up, which is rare in this world, it seems to be tied very closely to when you put new episodes of your key programs on the air, which is great news because it shows when you have a hit show, when you put a new episode on, people watch it. It also begs the question of how -- are you more dependent than ever before on having to have new episodes? And what does it mean for rate of continued spend and investment? Is the world different now, do you think, than it was a couple of years ago in how sensitive the audience is to new programming versus the lifespan of reruns of those."

So we're feeling again that it's going to be a very good year. It's going to be better than last year, but unlike last year, which I think we've talked a lot about that acceleration throughout the year where we started out slow, it's the first half we think is going to be very strong due to some of the things that I said in my prepared comments is that it was softer in the first half, so we got pricing plus our impressions are all up.

In general though, I would say your premise is right, that television audiences in general have less tolerance for reruns and that's why you're seeing a lot of what's going on in the television industry overall. It's also why we responded, many years ago in fact, when Jim Samples was running HGTV, to that by putting into production 300 and 400 episodes of year -- a year of House Hunters. A very reasonably priced show for us, drives a lot of viewing. We decided that that's worth the investment in the original content. It becomes more nuanced, though, because each network is a little different in our mix and even within a network, different kinds of shows are different when it comes to repeatability. Competition shows like the Food Network Star, they don't repeat very well. And so over time, I'm sure you've observed, you've seen us do fewer and fewer big stunt type shows. HGTV in fact is backing off a lot on that. Food Network is scaling them down a little bit. They don't repeat as well. They're great when they run, but they don't repeat as well. On the other hand, a show like Fixer Upper, which is far and away right now, the #1 show on HGTV. The team there is so good at understanding when audiences are watching the network on certain nights that they realize that Fixer Upper on Tuesday night was getting an audience, but Fixer Upper reruns on Thursday night rather, could get a different audience that hadn't seen it. Sure enough, they put it on, on Thursday night. We actually promoted it. The first time we've ever promoted repeats of a show and the ratings were nearly 100% as what they were on Tuesday night. So there are ways for us to utilize reruns, recognizing the way audiences view in different patterns on our networks. So yes, you'll see more original programming, although as Lori said, we're not going to go crazy on our program budgets. We think we have the right number of hours and we can make the mix work."

Then Jim and his team are focused on making that work as successfully as possible, taking the benefit of that and again, there's not a lot of big international opportunities that come on the horizon. So of course, anything that comes, we will take a look, keeping in mind that we have -- that we're trying to delever, so that we can take advantage of those opportunities when they come. Again, our priority is on investing our cash flows for things that generate growth and cash flow. So again, we've always got a 6 to 12-month window that we're looking.

And I think Doug upfront mentioned maybe some new entrants coming on. So if you look at our total business operation domestically, and you realize we're having probably in 21 years some of our best ratings years ever, it's because we're attracting newer audiences and growing still even though some of the distribution as I said has waned a bit on the traditional platforms. But as we see opportunities on alternative distribution platforms, we're going for them. I mentioned the Scripps Lifestyle Studios that we've created to do more short-form programming. We're very much about taking our content, and our categories and continuing to grow it, but now on different distribution platforms. And we're having enormous success on the TV Everywhere model as far as take rates and SFOT [ph] in general. So we think the future for us is a bright one.

No guarantee that we'll win, but we have a long history of success of knowing audiences in our categories, of sticking to our categories, of researching our categories and knowing advertisers in our categories. And so I have to say, we bet on ourselves to do well in those environments. Maybe not every one, but the preponderance I think will do very well."

We will actually recruit talent because their ultimate goal is to be on our networks. So, and you will see more of that in the future. We've already looked at some of the programming lineups that's coming up, I guess in the next few months, Burton, where we're tapping into some of this talent. So it's not just for us to try to create content for those platforms, but find out what's working and in some areas where we can recruit the talent, bring them into our company. We can enhance that talent by offering them larger a platform and different social media outlets to expand their personality, their brand, their talent as well. And so far, we've had a pretty good success rate with the ones we recruited in. So it's a little bit of a two-way street. This is new territory for us in some ways but pretty exciting.

And that's embedded in that 500 to 600 basis point, which includes the other things, so we've got an increasing amount of internationals in the first 6 months as well as the program amortization. So there's an impact there, but I would like to stress again, it's a onetime item. And then when we get to 2017 again, we're looking for mid- to high single digits.

Last summer and I believe we talked about this on calls, we started aggressively promoting our TV Everywhere watch apps, primarily on our 3 big networks HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel. We began to see significant downloads of our own watch apps at that point and they're growing by tens of thousands of additional downloads each month. The Roku, Amazon Fire and Apple TV apps are for connected -- are connected devices, so you watch through a television. Those have a very large existing base already. So the goal there was to make the existing users of those devices aware that our apps were now available. They became available toward the end of last year and we're seeing huge downloads of those apps over the first 3 months that they've been available. The viewing of course, is another matter, once you have the apps you then have to view. So the viewership, we're pushing aggressively on air as well. So we have a 2 part promotion message on TV. One is get the app. The second is now you can watch your favorite programs anytime, anywhere, any device if you have the app and that's both live viewing and delayed viewing. And so it really is a very coordinated promotional effort to try to get viewers to understand. You can watch us now more often anywhere, anytime on any device. And I have to say it's early days, but we're seeing it work. On monetization, these are still small numbers against the overall linear television universe. So monetization will come. We have to start getting the habit in there now. It comes in a couple of ways, of course in C3, we can monetize all those connected devices right away because Nielsen measures anything that comes through a TV. The apps that people are viewing on their pads or phones, C3 will be a little bit of a wait to monetize until Nielsen gets the measurement in order and we sign up for that additional measurement product. However, on insertion after C3, that's all monetizable. Now again, that's small right now, but we see that as a potential growth area for the insertion dynamic and insertion of ads. So we're getting the habits in place now for viewing, but we expect to see monetization grow as time goes on."

I think it's both the areas that we've moved into in digital. What we're finding, we'll call it experimentation because it is a little bit, this works, maybe this doesn't work, put more emphasis here. But I also think it underscores the fact that millennials watch television and are going to continue to watch television. Much of it for us, Laura, has to do with 25 to 34-year-olds growing into the categories. Once they start to become interested in the design of their apartment or their condo, or if they're fortunate enough, their home. Food, similarly, once you start preparing meals, once it becomes a little bit more of a family environment, then our content just naturally kind of clicks in. And so what we've seen is not only the increasing -- increases in ratings overall, but the increases as you mentioned, in millennials, but a lot of it has to do with traditional television watching. Now no question, they're using mobile in different ways, they're using other platforms in different ways. And we're experimenting over there and we're also using the investments that we've made in Tastemade, Refinery29, to see how those take rates are, how millennials are responding there. So I don't know if you agree with that, Burton, but I think it's a mixture of both."

Scripps N",804,"Okay, thank you, Dylan, and good morning, everyone. Very happy that you're able to join us today, especially since this is a very busy couple of days for all of you, I know. Put simply, this was one of the best quarters in the company's history. Scripps Networks Interactive has become synonymous with distinctive lifestyle programming and strong, consistent financial performance. It's something that we're committed to every quarter and every year, and needless to say, we're off to another great start this year. In the first quarter of 2016, total operating revenues grew 24%. Consolidated advertising revenues grew 31%, thanks in part to the inclusion of TVN. Advertising revenues for the U.S. networks increased 14%, making Q1 the best advertising revenue growth quarter for us in more than 5 years. Adjusted segment profit increased 27%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 34% to $1.37. Now Burt and Lori will go to the details on the quarter in a few minutes, but I want to highlight just some of the remarkable results delivered by our brands during the first quarter. 
Scripps Networks Interactive was the only network group to see all of its U.S. television networks ratings increase compared with the prior year quarter. We're 6 for 6 in network growth, making this one of the best ratings quarters in the company's history. HGTV continues its impressive string of records. The first quarter in 2016 marked of the network's highest-rated quarter ever with adult viewers 25-54 for sales prime, total day and weekend. Food Network and Travel Channel both saw their second consecutive quarter of primetime ratings growth, and TVN group delivered an outstanding ratings growth up 4% over last year on the strength of the new TVN primetime lineup. We have strong brands, compelling content and programming that viewers love and trust, especially the upscale and highly engaged audiences that advertisers are looking to reach. Our audiences are savvy, they're well-informed, most importantly, they're ready to buy. The research speaks for itself. In the March 2016 brand identity study published by Beta Research, HGTV tied for first as a favorite network among viewers over 18. Additionally, viewers designated 5 of our 6 U.S. networks to be among the top 12 networks on which they are inclined to pay the most attention to commercials. Now this is exactly why our advertising partners trust us quarter-after-quarter, resulting in a remarkable advertising performance that we reported today. These are all great brands with high-quality content that consistently deliver an engaged audience better than anyone else in the industry, and we do it night after night. For example, HGTV primetime viewership is within 15% of its weekly primetime average every night of the week. At Food Network, it's 6 of 7 nights. Now this remarkable consistency really demonstrates the high degree of schedule and programming strength over a broad number of shows and nights. In the midst of ever-changing and expanding viewer options, our family of networks remains essential to distributors. They're the must-have networks that consumers consistently seek out for lifestyle content. 
We recently held our presentation of 7 United States markets. I have to say we received an enthusiastic response to the new season of entertaining and family-friendly programming. We're confident this will be reflected in our upfront negotiations. We have the best advertising sales team in the business, and that continues to pay off. We're also well positioned to take advantage of the wealth of opportunity of our lifestyle brands outside the United States. Since launching in 2009, our international networks have expanded to more than 175 countries and territories, touching more than 272 million cumulative subscribers in 29 languages. We continue to launch our lifestyle brands in major international markets, recently with Food Network in Australia, and we'll soon benefit from additional distribution in 7 Latin American countries. And there remains significant opportunity to grow the HGTV brand around the world. Of course, our international growth was topped off last year by the transformative acquisition of TVN, which is the leading, multiplatform media business in Poland. Now the team there is doing a great job working across all consumer touch points to deliver content that consumers crave, their audiences and advertisers demand. 
TVN is really the leading lifestyle media company in Poland, and we believe it has the opportunity to become even stronger. We've got a number of initiatives in the pipeline to make that a reality. We've accomplished much in a short amount of time with our international networks, and we're very excited to see what comes next as we continue to develop and grow our global footprint. 
Now I want to thank you again for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. And with that, let me turn it over to Burton who have some details on our first quarter results. Burton?"

As Ken mentioned, the first quarter in 2016 marked HGT",988,"All right. Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. What a way to begin the year. With the investments we made in programming and the international business, the company is performing at a high level. As Ken mentioned, the first quarter in 2016 marked HGTV's highest-rated quarter ever with viewers 25 to 54  for sales primetime total day and weekend and outpaced the next highest-rated quarter by an incredible 12%. In fact, HGTV was the only top 5 cable network to post a ratings gain in the first quarter versus last year for adults 25 to 54 in primetime. Driving this record growth were viewer favorites like Fixer Upper, which finished its record-breaking third season as one of the highest-rated programs in networks -- in the network's history; and Flip or Flop with its rating soaring 26% for adults 25 to 54. HGTV also delivered its highest-rated quarter ever for millennials 25 to 34, with ratings up 10%. And so far in the second quarter, these positive trends are continuing. HGTV just announced that April 2016 was its highest-rated and most-watched April ever for primetime adult 25 to 54 viewers, a 9% increase over April 2015. 
Food Network continued to post solid ratings in the first quarter, too, especially among adults watching with their children. Kids Baking Championship, Cake Wars and Chopped Junior helped push up primetime co-viewing during the quarter. Food Network wins with millennials as well, posting a 5% ratings improvement with that viewer group in the month of March. 
Travel Channel continues to gain momentum, reporting its highest-rated quarter in 2 years. We're building our upscale female audience on the network as well. In fact, on most nights, the network now attracts more women than men. In April, Travel Channel grew 15% among adults 25 to 54 and 26% for the women 25 to 54 compared with the prior year. This was the network's best performance since 2013, and we feel this is just the start. Travel Channel represents one of the most significant growth opportunities for the company, and its recent progress shows that we're well positioned to deliver on that expectation. 
DIY Network had a very strong show in delivering its most-watched quarter ever among adults 18 and over, driven by strong-performing shows, including Texas Flip and Move and Tiny House Big Living. 
Cooking Channel had the highest-rated and most-watched first quarter in its history among both adults and women 25 to 54, maintaining its steady growth rate that it's hard since 2010. In rounding out the U.S. networks, Great American Country also experienced ratings gains posting its highest-rated sales prime ratings in 8 years. 
Now Linear TV isn't only the place we built success in first quarter. We launched Scripps Lifestyle Studios in the fourth quarter of 2015, consisting of a dedicated editorial team to create digital and video content. Their online videos have received great response and increasing engagement from their targeted audiences during the first month of 2016. The Scripps Lifestyle Studios team produced over 1,000 videos for mobile and social platforms in the first quarter, and that's quite an achievement for a group we formed a just few month ago. This output is helping us gain greater traction in the content marketing and social video marketplaces. Food was our entry point onto these new platforms, but we're aggressively targeting the home category as we move further into 2016. 
And speaking of growth in digital, we recently reviewed our agreement with Snapchat, which offers us another reach way to reach millennials and provides a new path for our advertisers to reach consumers. It's still relatively early days for the platform, but we're looking forward to bringing more content to life through that application. Scripps Networks Interactive broadly embraces innovation in pioneering new formats, and we'll continue to expand our content and functionality as we make our valued programming available on as many platforms as possible.
The last several quarters have been especially exciting for our international networks as the company continues to grow outside the United States. To start, I want to highlight the promotion of Derek Chang, who will Head of up our international lifestyle channels; and the addition of Eduardo Hauser, who will direct SNI's businesses across Latin America. Derek and Eduardo's wealth of industry experience will enable us to tap into the numerous opportunities for our networks as we continue to build our global lifestyle brands. 
In Poland, TVN networks achieved 6% revenue growth in local currency compared with the prior year quarter. TVN, the broadcast channel, was #1 in its commercial target group for viewers 16 to 49, attaining more than 13% market share in the first quarter. And over the same period, time period, the TVN group increased their total market share by 4%. [ph] 
We were incorporating original lifestyle content in the TVN's lineup. One of the first efforts is the locally produced version of DIY NetworkKitchen Crashers, which premiered on TVN's style channel. Another SNI format, House Clashes, that's locally produced will premiere later this summer. And TVN is also producing episodes of House Hunters International in Europe, and those episodes will premiere in the U.S. later this year. As you can tell, the integration of TVN into our International portfolio is producing impressive results. For its just completed fiscal year, UKTV posted record revenues and increased 13% and record operating profits, which grew 10% both in local currency. The multichannel broadcaster also grew its share of viewing from prior year. UKTV's phenomenal results were driven by strong advertising revenues, continued investment in original programming and strong financial discipline. 
So 2016 is off to an extraordinary start, and we remain committed to what we do best, bringing life to lifestyle as we develop an even deeper connection with our consumers across all of our brands. 
Now I'll turn it over to Lori, who'll review the company's financial performance for the first quarter of 2016."

Continuing our strong results, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, provide updated guidance and an open it up for Q&A. And as Burton mentioned, what a terrific start to 2016",908,"Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. Continuing our strong results, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, provide updated guidance and an open it up for Q&A. And as Burton mentioned, what a terrific start to 2016 with revenues up an impressive 24%. This growth was primarily driven by strong U.S. advertising market, coupled with ratings improvement across all 6 U.S. networks and a significant expansion of our international business through our acquisition of TVN last year. Adjusted segment profit increased 27%, fueled by the strong revenue growth. This increase in adjusted segment profit translated into a robust 34% growth and adjusted earnings per share compared with the prior year. We had a great quarter at our U.S. networks segments. Revenues increased 10%, driven by strong revenue demand for our lifestyle networks as well as continued distribution revenue growth. 
For advertising revenues, strong CPM pricing, coupled with ratings growth at all 6 of our networks, drove a 14% year-over-year increase in the first quarter. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing was up in the low double digits year-over-year and up low 20s over the broadcast prime. Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, financial and automotive. These categories are fairly consistent with the prior period. 
The strong advertising market has continued into the second quarter, with scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing up mid to high-teens year-over-year and up low to mid-20s over the broadcast upfront. Contributing to the 2% growth in U.S. networks distribution revenue, were negotiated rate escalators with our traditional distribution partners as well as new distribution related to over-the-top broadband provider. These were partially offset by the previously disclosed onetime rate equalization of certain distributor agreements related to consolidation and low single-digit subscriber decline also in line with expectation. The healthy 20% growth in adjusted segment profit for the U.S. network reflects the increase in revenues, partially offset by a slight increase in expenses. The increase in cost of services was largely offset by decreases in SG&A expenses. This reflects the shift in marketing cost to later in the year, along with the ongoing operating efficiencies achieved from the restructuring, including the recent Travel Channel reorganization. 
International networks revenues increased significantly to $121 million from $24 million due to the inclusion of TVN in the first quarter of 2016. And as Burton mentioned, for the quarter, TVN's revenues grew 6% in local currency compared to the same time a year ago. International segment profit was $10 million compared with a loss of $6 million a year ago. The $16 million improvement is primarily related to the inclusion of TVN as we continue to invest in our international lifestyle network. Historically, for TVN, the third quarter have lower margins while the second and fourth quarters have higher margins. In addition to our consolidated results, we have significant international operations reported in our equity earnings. In total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $26 million, up 36% compared with the prior year. This growth is primarily related to the addition of MC plus, an investment held by TVN, and UKTV's improved performance. Partially impacting the growth was the sale of our minority interest in Boxford stock. We recorded a $208 million pretax gain during the quarter related to the sale of this minority holding. Going forward, we expect that the majority of equity and earnings of affiliates will come from our international investment. 
On the balance sheet, I want to touch on the couple of items. Our capital allocation priorities are to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our overall leverage and invest in M&A both in the U.S. and internationally. On the M&A front, in addition to selling our FOX Sports minority stake, we also acquired the remaining 35% interest in Travel Channel from Cox Communications for $99 million in cash and certain tax benefits. 
Travel Channel is a key asset to the company and one which we believe holds great upside potential. We finished the first quarter with approximately 3x gross leverage, down to 3.2 at the end of 2015. The first quarter leverage reflects both the FOX sports minority sale and the Travel Channel buy-in. It also reflects a reduction on the amended revolving credit facility of approximately $325 million. And we did not repurchase any shares during this quarter as we focused on delivering and the M&A activities previously mentioned. Finally, as a result of the stronger-than-expected advertising market, combined with a strong ratings performance, we're updating our full year 2016 guidance. All guidance is based on adjusted consolidated company results. Due to the increase in revenue, we now expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 8% year-over-year, up from the previously issued 7%. All other 2016 guidance remains unchanged. As a reminder, for the first half of 2016, we expect to realize a higher growth rate due in part to easier advertising comps for the U.S. network segment and TVN's results were not included in the first half of 2015. We continue to expect that the third quarter will be impacted by the Summer Olympics until the presidential elections, which should be the slowest revenue growth quarter of the year. Then revenue growth should accelerate somewhat for the fourth quarter of 2016.  Additionally, for the third quarter, due to the timing of certain expenses, it should be the lowest adjusted segment profit margin quarter of the year. 
And with that, we're ready for your questions."

I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about embracing innovation in terms of over-the-top platforms and just to continue the theme, the subject of who life, I would think that for your content, it would actually lend itself better to live programming. So I guess, to the extent that Internet delivered viewership of cable TV content shift to live and away from SVOD or on-demand viewership, I think that's a benefit to your company. Can be -- is that consistent with your view of what's going on in terms of introduction of these new platforms? And then second question and maybe this is for Burton or Lori. In terms of conversations you're having with your marketers, they're obviously allocating a lot greater spend to your networks, and clearly ratings is a big part of the reason why. I just wondering what are you were hearing from big advertisers about their view on the ROI or effectiveness of your ads in terms of driving conversion to sales? And obviously, that conversation dovetails with what's the relative ROI of social media ad spending given the growth in spend on social media platforms. I'd love to here about that."

What you partially answered, and as you know, we have consistently always delivered a better live performance. As you heard me say many times, 94% of our viewing on average vary somewhere in the low 90s is done in a C3 window. And by the way, to that point, you probably saw the information that Nielsen released yesterday, which very much reflects that live viewing with the reality-based, nonfiction programming is more in the first 3 periods -- the first 3 days and over 7 days. And look, just the way we've been built, part of that is the advertising environment so the commercials not only are viewed but are viewed in that live window, which is very important in advertising, especially when it's timely. And it also plays well, I think, to our content, and that's why we have longer viewing periods where people tune our into networks and they tend not to tune away because there's very few objectionable periods or speed bumps, if you will, are just blockbuster-type shows. And that's why you heard in my comments we do so well consistently over a 7-night period. And our content is not from a rating success standpoint is roadblock over a night or 2. It's consistently 6 or 7 nights a week. So all this plays very well into, I think, some of the trends you mentioned that we're starting to see more importance space on live, live streaming and even with the announcement of Hulu's upcoming venture in 2017. So I hope that answers your question, but yes, it's the way we've been built. It's the expectations that our viewership has now the networks and also the way we stack programming and promote. So I'll let -- Burt, do you want to take the second?"

I was with our ad sales team last week, so I've got very current point of view on how advertisers are seeing this. This really ties into the long history of value that we provide to advertisers. And I think in the current environment where social media and digital certainly bring a lot of data to an advertiser that they can use, there are also questions about the ability all the things that you've read. But we bring a lot of great data to advertisers as well, and their factors like the environment that we create on our networks, demonstrably, third-party research shows the viewers are more receptive to the advertising on our networks. That's been true over a long period of time and remains true. Simply the subject matter that we're in provides an opportunity for advertisers to reach upscale viewers. Again, the independent data shows that we have, as a group, the most upscale collection of viewers on television. And then you combine that with just a the consistency that we talked about in our opening remarks night after night. Advertisers, marketers know what they're going to get when they advertise on our network. So now [indiscernible] they'll find their ad pin. There's consistency of viewing, and it ties into part of Ken's answer, which is the live viewing, the high rate of live viewing mean that those ads are going to be seen when the advertisers intend them to be seen. So we're hearing very positive point of view about what we offer marketers as compared to other television networks and even some other opportunities for them. Now that said, we have digital assets, too. We package those up with our television offerings, and we're doing all we can to minimize some of the objections of digital in terms of the ability of measurement. And I think we're doing a very good job there, too, as well."

The more we're able to make that audience on Travel Channel reflect the audience that we have in HGTV and Food Network, we're able to use cross-promotion to do that. The benefits that we've seen in terms of improvement in ratings at Travel are really coming from what we said all last year that we put on group shows in the fourth quarter, some which didn't work we took [indiscernible] some of which did work, and we're reaping the benefits of that now into 2016. But we also stabilized the schedule. At something we talked about for a couple of years there, too. Our scheduling team has worked really hard to create that greater consistency night after night. We're beginning to see that. We're still ways to go with Travel Channel, but that's why we think there's more upside. So consistency in viewing patterns is something we've seen on the rise. And then we have -- we consolidated all of our networks under the same leadership of Katherine and she put all of our marketing teams under the leadership of Shannon Driver. And as a result of that, we're looking at bringing the successful marketing strategies that we had that HGTV to Travel Channel, and you'll see those unfold over time, too, which again makes us confident that we have more upside there."

What we will have is more stability in those hours, especially with Travel as you start having more and more returning series, your predictability and your ability to control your investment growth becomes more certain. But again, it's art and science, and we'll continue to do the right thing for the screen. But again, we have a fairly good focus on the investment.

It was little hard to hear on this end of the line. But virtually, yes. I think in general, they'll do okay. It's pure speculation at this point. But I do think you might see some shifting from one distributer to another, and it's going to be an incremental basis. What's going to be more important I think is the technology that goes along with it. And by that, I mean, let's just take the new [indiscernible] box that Comcast has rolled out and Cox is using the same technology. These new generations of boxes and what you're going to be able to do as a consumer is going to have, I think a, great impact on the competition between distribution models going forward. You marry that with Smart TV, you put an enormous amount of power in the consumer's hands as to what they can watch, when they can watch, how they can watch. And I think those are going to be the game-changer. So it's not just about packaging and coming up with another service, be it traditional models that we've all grown up with over the past x number of years or some of the new models that are rolling out. It's going to be all the bells and whistles that come along with it because I do think not only the millenial generation but everybody now it's just a becoming accustomed to in a world of iPhones, more technology and more options. And one comment I would just make before I turn it over to Burton, a lot around the advertising market. If you look at the first quarter, it was a really unique quarter in the sense that the amount of sports programming and compelling sports programming, everything from the NFL playoffs to the Super Bowl. In the NBA season, which we saw a team surpass the Chicago Bulls of 73 wins. If you look at the NCAA playoffs, which has never been more competitive and never more watched, and for us to be able to deliver a 14% year-over-year advertising growth rate, I think it really underscores the value of our content, the environment that we're giving the advertisers. So it's hard not to feel confident about advertising going forward, but we still have to factor in seasonalities. We have Dream Home giveaways. We have different things throughout the year. So consistency to me is more important that quarter-after-quarter if we're delivering the best of the peer group in advertising growth, we're pretty happy."

There are a few others out there doing upfront presentations. So the obvious cushion is, what do you guys doing? Well, one reason we do it is because we like the ability for our advertisers to co-mingle with our talent and truly understand why we are asking for these increases on something that is already premium priced. So I think just to sit back and think that we'll just push out data, we have to get out with the advertisers. We have to also hear them when we come up with advertising solutions because this is now becoming a game not just about 30s and 60s as we all have seen evolve over the last several years. This is about advertising solutions. It is very much why we started in the Scripps digital studio because a lot of what we're doing now is in conjunction with these packages that we're selling. So you're not just buying advertising across this network. You're buying solution. You're buying maybe placement and green home giveaway, smartphone giveaway, Food Network, kitchen and what we're doing there and on and on and on. So it's long-winded way of saying, yes, we think not only are we priced at the top of the market but we continue to push that because, let's face it, at the end of the day, quality and exclusivity are always going to be at the minimum and, therefore, are going to be priced at the high end of the market."

So on the affiliate growth, yes, we're pretty consistent with what the universe overall is doing. But I would add this, that because of the upscale nature of our viewers, any declines in the overall universe don't really affect us as they might other networks who have a less affluent viewership. In other words, our viewers are the ones who are least likely to drop or shave their paid television subscription. So in terms of just overall viewership, HGTV and the rest of our networks aren't immune but have a pretty good protection against those kinds of declines that are affecting the overall universe. In terms of ratings, yes, HGTV is absolutely growing their viewers. The millennial growth that I recorded on, 10% in ratings, shows that we are bringing in viewers who are new to the network.

And so HGTV's trick, if you will, has been both maximizing the viewing of the viewers that we already have and we do that probably better than any network programming mainly [indiscernible] but also drawing new viewers who we then keep in the family for a long, long time."

They have very strong sales there, too, so we bring a benefit that's a little under the radar to our distribution partners, but that certainly factors in. We also believe that when you have an HGTV, that's pretty much the #1 network for women viewing right now, particularly upscale viewing, upscale women. It's been that way for 9 years. And Food Network, which is it top 10 to top 12 network, those are 2 very powerful brands that bring great value to a distributor. And over the years, Ken has said this, we believe we've been a bit undervalued in terms of distribution payments but that can also work to our benefit. We are a very good value as a result to distributors. But we'll continue to push the great benefits that our networks bring to any distributor. On TV Everywhere, basically, because we have rights for all of our programming, we own 100%, pretty close to 100% of all of our shows and the agreements that we reach with our distributors, what you see of our top-rated, top-performing shows in our networks, you will see streamed on TV Everywhere on-demand.

So everything that's on the table going forward and these distributions especially with new and upcoming platforms and partnerships. So just because it's historically been that way, the 2 minutes is going to be put into these negotiations on the distributor side, it does not necessarily hold true going forward in the newer deals.

Very happy that you're able to join us today, especially since this is a very busy couple of days for all of you, I know. 
Put simply, this was one of the best quarters in the company's history. Scripps Networks Interactive has become synonymous with distinctive lifestyle programming and strong, consistent financial performance. That's something that we're committed to every quarter and every year, and needless to say, we're off to another great start this year. 
In the first quarter of 2016, total operating revenues grew 24%. Consolidated advertising revenues grew 31%, thanks in part to the inclusion of TVN. Advertising revenues for the U.S. Networks increased 14%, making Q1 the best advertising revenue growth quarter for us in more than 5 years. Adjusted segment profit increased 27%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 34% to $1.37. 
Now Burt and Lori will go into the details on the quarter in a few minutes, but I want to highlight just some of the remarkable results delivered by our brands during the first quarter. Scripps Networks Interactive was the only network group to see all of its U.S. television networks ratings increase compared with the prior year quarter. We're 6 for 6 in network growth, making this one of the best ratings quarters in the company's history. 
HGTV continues its impressive string of records. The first quarter in 2016 marked the network's highest-rated quarter ever with adult viewers 25-54 for sales prime total day and weekend. Food Network and Travel Channel both saw their second consecutive quarter of primetime ratings growth, and TVN group delivered an outstanding ratings quarter, up 4% over last year on the strength of the new TVN primetime lineup. We have strong brands, compelling content and programming that viewers love and trust, especially the upscale and highly engaged audiences that advertisers are looking to reach. 
Our audiences are savvy. They're well-informed. Most importantly, they're ready to buy. The research speaks for itself. In the March 2016 Brand Identity Study published by Beta Research, HGTV tied for first as a favorite network among viewers over 18. Additionally, viewers designated 5 of our 6 U.S. Networks to be among the top 12 networks on which they are inclined to pay the most attention to commercials. Now this is exactly why our advertising partners trust us quarter after quarter, resulting in the remarkable advertising performance that we reported today. 
These are all great brands with high-quality content that consistently deliver an engaged audience better than anyone else in the industry, and we do it night after night. For example, HGTV primetime viewership is within 15% of its weekly primetime average every night of the week. At Food Network, it's 6 of 7 nights. Now this remarkable consistency really demonstrates the high degree of schedule and programming strength over a broad number of shows and nights. In the midst of ever-changing and expanding viewer options, our family of networks remains essential to distributors. They're the must-have networks that consumers consistently seek out for lifestyle content. 
We recently held our upfront presentation at 7 United States markets, and I have to say we received an enthusiastic response to the new season of entertaining and family-friendly programming. We're confident this will be reflected in our upfront negotiations. We have the best advertising sales team in the business, and that continues to pay off. 
We're also well positioned to take advantage of the wealth of opportunity of our lifestyle brands outside the United States. Since launching in 2009, our International Networks have expanded to more than 175 countries and territories, touching more than 272 million cumulative subscribers in 29 languages. We continue to launch our lifestyle brands in major international markets, recently, with Food Network in Australia, and we'll soon benefit from additional distribution in 7 Latin American countries. And there remains significant opportunity to grow the HGTV brand around the world. 
Of course, our International growth was topped off last year by the transformative acquisition of TVN, which is the leading, multi-platform media business in Poland. Now the team there is doing a great job working across all consumer touch points to deliver content that consumers crave, that audiences and advertisers demand. TVN is really the leading lifestyle media company in Poland, and we believe it has the opportunity to become even stronger. We've got a number of initiatives in the pipeline to make that a reality. 
We've accomplished much in the short amount of time with our International Networks, and we're very excited to see what comes next as we continue to develop and grow our global footprint. Now I want to thank you again for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Burton, who have some details on our first quarter results. Burton?"

As Ken mentioned, the first quarter in 2016 marked HGTV's highest-rated quarter ever with viewers 25 to 54 for sales primetime total day and weekend and outpaced the next highest-rated quarter by an incredible 12%. In fact, HGTV was the only top 5 cable network to post a ratings gain in the first quarter versus last year for adults 25 to 54 in primetime. Driving this record growth were viewer favorites like: Fixer Upper, which finished its record-breaking third season as one of the highest-rated programs in networks -- in the network's history; and Flip or Flop with ratings soaring 26% for adults 25 to 54. HGTV also delivered its highest-rated quarter ever for millennials, 25 to 34, with ratings up 10%. And so far in the second quarter, these positive trends are continuing. HGTV just announced that April 2016 was its highest-rated and most-watched April ever for primetime adult 25 to 54 viewers, a 9% increase over April 2015. 
Food Network continued to post solid ratings in the first quarter, too, especially among adults watching with their children. Kids Baking Championship, Cake Wars and Chopped Junior helped push up primetime co-viewing during the quarter. Food Network wins with millennials as well, posting a 5% ratings improvement with that viewer group in the month of March. 
Travel Channel continues to gain momentum, reporting its highest-rated quarter in 2 years. We're building our upscale female audience on the network as well. In fact, on most nights, the network now attracts more women than men. In April, Travel Channel grew 15% among adults 25 to 54 and 26% for women 25 to 54 compared with the prior year. This was the network's best performance since 2013, and we feel this is just the start. Travel Channel represents one of the most significant growth opportunities for the company, and its recent progress shows that we're well positioned to deliver on that expectation. 
DIY Network had a very strong show in delivering its most-watched quarter ever among adults 18 and over, driven by strong-performing shows, including Texas Flip and Move and Tiny House, Big Living. 
Cooking Channel had the highest-rated and most-watched first quarter in its history among both adults and women 25 to 54, maintaining its steady growth rate that it's had since 2010. 
And rounding out the U.S. Networks, Great American Country also experienced ratings gains, posting its highest-rated sales prime ratings in 8 years. 
Now linear TV isn't the only place we built success in the first quarter. We launched Scripps Lifestyle Studios in the fourth quarter of 2015, consisting of a dedicated editorial team to create digital and video content. Their online videos have received great response and increasing engagement from their targeted audiences during the first month of 2016. The Scripps Lifestyle Studios team produced over 1,000 videos for mobile and social platforms in the first quarter, and that's quite an achievement for a group we formed a just few month ago. This output is helping us gain greater traction in the content marketing and social video marketplaces. Food was our entry point onto these new platforms, but we're aggressively targeting the home category as we move further into 2016. 
And speaking of growth in digital, we recently renewed our agreement with Snapchat, which offers us another way to reach millennials and provides a new path for our advertisers to reach consumers. It's still relatively early days for the platform, but we're looking forward to bringing more content to life through that application. Scripps Networks Interactive proudly embraces innovation in pioneering new formats, and we'll continue to expand our content and functionality as we make our valued programming available on as many platforms as possible.
The last several quarters have been especially exciting for our International Networks as the company continues to grow outside the United States. To start, I want to highlight the promotion of Derek Chang, who will head up our International Lifestyle Channels; and the addition of Eduardo Hauser, who will direct SNI's businesses across Latin America. Derek and Eduardo's wealth of industry experience will enable us to tap into the numerous opportunities for our networks as we continue to build our global lifestyle brands. 
In Poland, TVN's networks achieved 6% revenue growth in local currency compared with the prior year quarter. TVN, the broadcast channel, was #1 in its commercial target group for viewers 16 to 49, attaining more than 13% market share in the first quarter. And over the same period -- time period, the TVN group increased their total market share by 4%. 
We're incorporating original lifestyle content into TVN's lineup. One of the first efforts was the locally produced version of DIY Network's Kitchen Crashers, which premiered on TVN Style channel. Another SNI format, House Crashers, that's locally produced, will premiere later this summer. And TVN is also producing episodes of House Hunters International in Europe, and those episodes will premiere in the U.S. later this year. As you can tell, the integration of TVN into our International portfolio is producing impressive results. 
For its just completed fiscal year, UKTV posted record revenues that increased 13% and record operating profits, which grew 10%, both in local currency. The multichannel broadcaster also grew its share of viewing from the prior year. U.K.'s -- UKTV's phenomenal results were driven by strong advertising revenues, continued investment in original programming and strong financial discipline. 
So 2016 is off to an extraordinary start. We remain committed to what we do best, bringing life to lifestyle, as we develop an even deeper connection with our consumers across all of our brands. 
Now I'll turn it over to Lori, who'll review the company's financial performance for the first quarter of 2016."

Since you've seen our strong results, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, provide updated guidance and then open it up for Q&A. 
And as Burton mentioned, what a terrific start to 2016 with revenues up an impressive 24%. This growth was primarily driven by a strong U.S. advertising market, coupled with ratings improvement across all 6 U.S. Networks, and a significant expansion of our International business through our acquisition of TVN last year. Adjusted segment profit increased 27%, fueled by the strong revenue growth. This increase in adjusted segment profit translated into a robust 34% growth in adjusted earnings per share compared with the prior year. 
We had a great quarter at our U.S. Networks segments. Revenues increased 10%, driven by strong revenue demand for our lifestyle networks as well as continued distribution revenue growth. For advertising revenues, strong CPM pricing, coupled with ratings growth at all 6 of our networks, drove a 14% year-over-year increase in the first quarter. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing was up in the low double digits year-over-year and up low-20s over the broadcast upfront. Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, financial and automotive. These categories are fairly consistent with prior periods. The strong advertising market has continued into the second quarter with scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing up mid to high-teens year-over-year and up low to mid-20s over the broadcast upfront. 
Contributing to the 2% growth in U.S. Networks distribution revenue were negotiated rate escalators with our traditional distribution partners as well as new distribution related to over-the-top broadband providers. These were partially offset by the previously disclosed onetime rate equalization of certain distributor agreements related to consolidation and low single-digit subscriber decline also in line with expectations. 
The healthy 20% growth in adjusted segment profit for the U.S. Networks reflects the increase in revenues, partially offset by a slight increase in expenses. The increase in cost of services was largely offset by decreases in SG&A expenses. This reflects the shift of marketing cost to later in the year, along with the ongoing operating efficiencies achieved from the restructuring, including the recent Travel Channel reorganization. 
International Networks revenues increased significantly to $121 million from $24 million due to the inclusion of TVN in the first quarter of 2016. And as Burton mentioned, for the quarter, TVN's revenues grew 6% in local currency compared with the same time a year ago. International segment profit was $10 million compared with a loss of $6 million a year ago. The $16 million improvement is primarily related to the inclusion of TVN as we continue to invest in our International Lifestyle Networks. Historically, for TVN, the first and third quarters have lower margins while the second and fourth quarters have higher margins. 
In addition to our consolidated results, we have significant International operations reported in our equity earnings. In total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $26 million, up 36% compared with the prior year. This growth is primarily related to the addition of nc+, an investment held by TVN, and UKTV's improved performance. Partially impacting the growth was the sale of our minority interest in Fox Sports South. We recorded a $208 million pretax gain during the quarter related to the sale of this minority holding. Going forward, we expect that the majority of equity and earnings of affiliates will come from our International investments. 
On the balance sheet, I want to touch on a couple of items. Our capital allocation priorities are to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our overall leverage and invest in M&A, both in the U.S. and internationally. On the M&A front, in addition to selling our Fox Sports South minority stake, we also acquired the remaining 35% interest in Travel Channel from Cox Communications for $99 million in cash and certain tax benefits. Travel Channel is a key asset for the company and one which we believe holds great upside potential. 
We finished the first quarter with approximately 3x gross leverage, down from 3.2 at the end of 2015. The first quarter leverage reflects both the Fox Sports South minority sale and the Travel Channel buy-in. It also reflects a reduction on the amended revolving credit facility of approximately $325 million, and we did not repurchase any shares during this quarter as we focused on delevering and the M&A activities previously mentioned. 
Finally, as a result of the stronger-than-expected advertising market, combined with a strong ratings performance, we're updating our full year 2016 guidance. All guidance is based on adjusted consolidated company results. Due to the increase in revenue, we now expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 8% year-over-year, up from the previously issued 7%. All other 2016 guidance remains unchanged. 
As a reminder, for the first half of 2016, we expect to realize a higher growth rate due in part to easier advertising comps for the U.S. Networks segment and because TVN results were not included in the first half of 2015. We continue to expect that the third quarter will be impacted by the Summer Olympics and, to a lesser extent, the presidential election. So it should be the slowest revenue growth quarter of the year. Then revenue growth should accelerate somewhat for the fourth quarter of 2016.  Additionally, for the third quarter, due to the timing of certain expenses, it should be the lowest adjusted segment profit margin quarter of the year. 
And with that, we're ready for your questions."

Can the -- is that consistent with your view of the -- what's going on in terms of introduction of these newer platforms? And then second question, and maybe this is for Burton or Lori. In terms of conversations you're having with your marketers, they're obviously allocating a lot greater spend to your networks, and clearly, ratings is a big part of the reason why. I just wonder, what are you hearing from big advertisers about their view on the ROI or effectiveness of your ads in terms of driving conversion to sales? And obviously, that conversation dovetails with what's the relative ROI of social media ad spending, given the growth in spend on social media platforms. I'd love to hear about that."

And as you know, we have consistently always delivered a better live performance. As you've heard us say many times, 94% of our viewing, on average, vary somewhere in the low 90s, is done in a C3 window. And by the way, to that point, you probably saw the information that Nielsen released yesterday, which very much reflects that live viewing with reality-based, nonfiction programming is more in the first 3 periods then -- the first 3 days and over 7 days. And look, just the way we've been built, part of that is the advertising environment, so the commercials not only are viewed but are viewed in that live window, which is very important in advertising, especially when it's timely, and it also plays well, I think, to our content. And that's why we have longer viewing periods, where people tune our into networks and they tend not to tune away because there's very few objectionable periods or speed bumps, if you will, are just blockbuster-type shows. And that's why you heard in my comments, we do so well consistently over a 7-night period. Our content is not, from a ratings success standpoint, just roadblock over a night or 2. It's consistently 6 or 7 nights a week. So all of this plays very well into, I think, some of the trends you mentioned, that we're starting to see more importance space on live, live streaming and even with the announcement of Hulu's up and coming venture in 2017. So I hope that answers your question. But yes, it's the way we've been built. It's the expectations that our viewership has now the networks, and also the way we stack programming and promote. So I'll let -- Burton, you want to take the second?"

I was with our ad sales team last week, so I've got very current point of view on how advertisers are seeing that. This really ties into the long history of value that we provide to advertisers. And I think in the current environment, where social media and digital certainly bring a lot of data to an advertiser that they can use, there are also questions about the ability, all the things that you've read. But we bring a lot of great data to advertisers as well, and there are factors, like the environment, that we create on our networks. Demonstrably, third-party research shows that viewers are more receptive to the advertising on our networks. That's been true over a long period of time and remains true. The -- simply, the subject matter that we're in provides an opportunity for advertisers to reach upscale viewers. Again, the independent data shows that we have, as a group, the most upscale collection of viewers on television. And then you combine that with just the consistency that we talked about in our opening remarks, night after night. Advertisers, marketers know what they're going to get when they advertise on our network. There are no clunkers that they will find their ads in. There is a consistency of viewing, and it ties into part of Ken's answer, which is the live viewing. The high rate of live viewing mean that those ads are going to be seen when the advertisers intend them to be seen. So we're hearing very positive point of view about what we offer marketers as compared to other television networks and even some other opportunities for them. Now that said, we have digital assets, too. We package those up with our television offerings, and we're doing all we can to minimize some of the objections to digital in terms of viewability and measurement and, I think, doing a very good job there, too, as well."

So as we think about what that means going forward in terms of having to try and find new shows and add new hours, are we approaching more to steady state sort of situation at least for a while?

And as those hours go up at Travel or any of our networks, it's really commensurate with the revenue growth at this point. So you really wouldn't see one going up without seeing some sort of boost on the top line. But we really -- as we said, we see the investment on our U.S. Networks really moderating. When we brought on Travel, we were trying new shows. We knew some would fail, some would work, that there was an outsized investment there. What we will have is more stability in those hours, especially with Travel. As you start having more and more returning series, your predictability and your ability to control your investment growth becomes more certain. But again, it's more art than science, and we'll continue to do the right thing for the screen. But again, we have a fairly good focus on the investments. We feel like the number of hours that we're producing are the right hours. We will mix the mix and change those things. And again, the success you're seeing, like at HGTV, gives us the ability to experiment and find the new -- the hits of the future while still having the strength of the current schedule."

But on the virtual, yes. I think in general, they'll do okay. It's pure speculation at this point. But I will -- I do think you might see some shifting from one distributor to another, and it's going to be on an incremental basis. What's going to be more important, I think, is the technology that goes along with it, and by that, I mean -- let's just take the new XFINITY box that Comcast has rolled out and Cox is using the same technology, these new generations of boxes and what you're going to be able to do as a consumer is going to have, I think, a great impact on the competition between distribution models going forward. You marry that with smart TV, you put an enormous amount of power in the consumers' hands as to what they can watch, when they can watch, how they can watch. And I think those are going to be the game-changer. So it's not just about packaging and coming up with another service, be it traditional models that we've all grown up with over the past x number of years or some of the newer models that are rolling out. It's going to be all the bells and whistles that come along with it because I do think, not only the millenial generation, but everybody now who's just becoming accustomed to in a world of iPhones, more technology and more options. And one comment I would just make, before I turn it over to Burton, a lot around the advertising market, if you look at the first quarter, it was a really unique quarter in the sense that the amount of sports programming and compelling sports programming, everything from the NFL playoffs to the Super Bowl; and the NBA season, which we saw a team surpass the Chicago Bulls of 73 wins; if you look at the NCAA playoffs, which had never been more competitive and never more watched. And for us to be able to deliver a 14% year-over-year advertising growth rate, I think it really underscores the value of our content, the environment that we're giving the advertisers. So it's hard not to feel confident about advertising going forward, but we still have to factor in seasonalities. We have Dream Home Giveaways. We have different things throughout the year. So consistency to me is more important. And quarter after quarter if we're delivering the best of the peer group in advertising growth, we're pretty happy."

It does give me a chance to say -- you heard in my comments, we actually were in 7 cities across the country with our upfront presentations. There are a few of us out there anymore doing upfront presentations. So the obvious question is why do you guys do it. Well, one reason we do it is because we like the ability for our advertisers to co-mingle with our talent and truly understand why we're asking for these increases on something that's already premium priced. So I think just to sit back and think that we'll just push out data, we have to get out with the advertisers. We have to also hear them when we come up with advertising solutions because this is now becoming a game, not just [ph] about 30s and 60s as we all have seen evolve over the last several years. This is about advertising solutions. It is very much why we started the Scripps digital lifestyle studio, because a lot of what we're doing now is conjunction -- in conjunction with these packages that we're selling. So you're not just buying advertising across this network. You're buying solutions. You're buying maybe placement and Dream Home Giveaways, smart home giveaways, Food Network, Kitchen and what we're doing there and on and on and on. So it's a long-winded way of saying, yes, we think not only are we priced at the top of the market, but we continue to push that, because let's face it, at the end of the day, quality and exclusivity are always going to be at a minimum and, therefore, are going to be priced at the high end of the market."

So on affiliate growth, yes, we're pretty consistent with what the universe overall is doing. But I would add this, that because of the upscale nature of our viewers, any declines in the overall universe don't really affect us as they might other networks who had a less affluent viewership. In other words, our viewers are the ones who are least likely to drop or shave their paid television subscription. So in terms of just overall viewership, HGTV and the rest of our networks aren't immune but have a pretty good protection against those kinds of declines that are affecting the overall universe. In terms of ratings, yes, HGTV is absolutely growing their viewers. The millennial growth that I reported on, 10% in ratings, shows that we are bringing in viewers who are new to the network. And as we have seen over 2 decades now, once they become viewers, they stay with us. And so HGTV's trick, if you will, has been both maximizing the viewing of the viewers that we already have. And we do that probably better than any network programming mainly [indiscernible], but also drawing in new viewers, who we then keep in the family for a long, long time."

On negotiations, yes, I mean, we've always felt we were in a strong position, given the nature of our networks, the value of the audience that we bring to a distributor. It's evidenced not only in our national advertising sales, but based on what we know is going on in terms of local advertising that our distribution partners insert onto all of our networks. They have very strong sales there, too. So we bring a benefit that's a little under the radar to our distribution partners, but that certainly factors in. We also believe that when you have an HGTV, that's pretty much the #1 network for women viewing right now, particularly upscale viewing, upscale women. It's been that way for 9 years, and Food Network, which is a top 10 to top 12 network, that those are 2 very powerful brands that bring great value to a distributor. And over the years, Ken has said this, we believe we've been a bit undervalued in terms of distribution payments, but that can also work to our benefit. We are a very good value, as a result, for distributors. But we'll continue to push the great benefits that our networks bring to any distributor. On TV Everywhere, basically, because we have rights for all of our programming, we own 100% -- pretty close to 100% of all of our shows and the agreements that we reach with our distributors, what you see of our top-rated, top-performing shows in our networks, you will see streamed on TV Everywhere on-demand. But of course, our networks are available for live streaming on TV Everywhere right now. And we're beginning to see more and more uptake of our TV Everywhere apps, and as a result, more and more viewing both live and on-demand. We're very pleased with that."

And going forward, in a world of virtual distributors and more consolidation on the linear side, it's easy to assume that these will become more into play in negotiations. In our case, for example, those 2 minutes an hour, you can imagine, are extremely valuable. And I think going forward, they would come even more valuable digital ad insertion and the localization of our content, so everything that's on the table going forward and these distributions, especially with new and upcoming platforms and partnerships. So just because it's historically been that way, that 2 minutes is going to be put into these negotiations on the distributor side, does not necessarily hold true going forward in the newer deals. But having said that, we'll see, because in some cases, it's a great partnership. It's worked very well depending on how local ad sales teams are structured, et cetera. So I won't get into the details of our negotiations, but let's just say that that's at the forefront of our thinking because of the value we think we bring to those 2 minutes each hour."

Steve Gigliotti, Jon Steinlauf are both big believers in exactly what you're saying, that we can unlock greater value for our audiences, particularly audiences that traditionally are not the ones sought after on broad demographic buys, like adults 25 to 54. People over 54 do buy a lot of stuff.

And we believe we're uniquely situated, as your question suggest, to take advantage of that because of the nature of our content, the high quality of our audience, the money they have to spend and the nature of our subject matter.

We can't put a number on it, but let's just say we're very confident there's upside there."

Very happy that you're able to join us today, especially since this is a very busy couple of days for all of you, I know. 
Put simply, this was one of the best quarters in the company's history. Scripps Networks Interactive has become synonymous with distinctive lifestyle programming and strong, consistent financial performance. That's something that we're committed to every quarter and every year, and needless to say, we're off to another great start this year. 
In the first quarter of 2016, total operating revenues grew 24%. Consolidated advertising revenues grew 31%, thanks in part to the inclusion of TVN. Advertising revenues for the U.S. Networks increased 14%, making Q1 the best advertising revenue growth quarter for us in more than 5 years. Adjusted segment profit increased 27%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 34% to $1.37. 
Now Burt and Lori will go into the details on the quarter in a few minutes, but I want to highlight just some of the remarkable results delivered by our brands during the first quarter. Scripps Networks Interactive was the only network group to see all of its U.S. television networks ratings increase compared with the prior year quarter. We're 6 for 6 in network growth, making this one of the best ratings quarters in the company's history. 
HGTV continues its impressive string of records. The first quarter in 2016 marked the network's highest-rated quarter ever with adult viewers 25-54 for sales prime total day and weekend. Food Network and Travel Channel both saw their second consecutive quarter of primetime ratings growth, and TVN group delivered an outstanding ratings quarter, up 4% over last year on the strength of the new TVN primetime lineup. We have strong brands, compelling content and programming that viewers love and trust, especially the upscale and highly engaged audiences that advertisers are looking to reach. 
Our audiences are savvy. They're well-informed. Most importantly, they're ready to buy. The research speaks for itself. In the March 2016 Brand Identity Study published by Beta Research, HGTV tied for first as a favorite network among viewers over 18. Additionally, viewers designated 5 of our 6 U.S. Networks to be among the top 12 networks on which they are inclined to pay the most attention to commercials. Now this is exactly why our advertising partners trust us quarter after quarter, resulting in the remarkable advertising performance that we reported today. 
These are all great brands with high-quality content that consistently deliver an engaged audience better than anyone else in the industry, and we do it night after night. For example, HGTV primetime viewership is within 15% of its weekly primetime average every night of the week. At Food Network, it's 6 of 7 nights. Now this remarkable consistency really demonstrates the high degree of schedule and programming strength over a broad number of shows and nights. In the midst of ever-changing and expanding viewer options, our family of networks remains essential to distributors. They're the must-have networks that consumers consistently seek out for lifestyle content. 
We recently held our upfront presentation at 7 United States markets, and I have to say we received an enthusiastic response to the new season of entertaining and family-friendly programming. We're confident this will be reflected in our upfront negotiations. We have the best advertising sales team in the business, and that continues to pay off. 
We're also well positioned to take advantage of the wealth of opportunity of our lifestyle brands outside the United States. Since launching in 2009, our International Networks have expanded to more than 175 countries and territories, touching more than 272 million cumulative subscribers in 29 languages. We continue to launch our lifestyle brands in major international markets, recently, with Food Network in Australia, and we'll soon benefit from additional distribution in 7 Latin American countries. And there remains significant opportunity to grow the HGTV brand around the world. 
Of course, our International growth was topped off last year by the transformative acquisition of TVN, which is the leading, multi-platform media business in Poland. Now the team there is doing a great job working across all consumer touch points to deliver content that consumers crave, that audiences and advertisers demand. TVN is really the leading lifestyle media company in Poland, and we believe it has the opportunity to become even stronger. We've got a number of initiatives in the pipeline to make that a reality. 
We've accomplished much in the short amount of time with our International Networks, and we're very excited to see what comes next as we continue to develop and grow our global footprint. Now I want to thank you again for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Burton, who have some details on our first quarter results. Burton?"

With the investments we've made in programming and the International business, the company is performing at a high level. 
As Ken mentioned, the first quarter in 2016 marked HGTV's highest-rated quarter ever with viewers 25 to 54 for sales primetime total day and weekend and outpaced the next highest-rated quarter by an incredible 12%. In fact, HGTV was the only top 5 cable network to post a ratings gain in the first quarter versus last year for adults 25 to 54 in primetime. Driving this record growth were viewer favorites like: Fixer Upper, which finished its record-breaking third season as one of the highest-rated programs in networks -- in the network's history; and Flip or Flop with ratings soaring 26% for adults 25 to 54. HGTV also delivered its highest-rated quarter ever for millennials, 25 to 34, with ratings up 10%. And so far in the second quarter, these positive trends are continuing. HGTV just announced that April 2016 was its highest-rated and most-watched April ever for primetime adult 25 to 54 viewers, a 9% increase over April 2015. 
Food Network continued to post solid ratings in the first quarter, too, especially among adults watching with their children. Kids Baking Championship, Cake Wars and Chopped Junior helped push up primetime co-viewing during the quarter. Food Network wins with millennials as well, posting a 5% ratings improvement with that viewer group in the month of March. 
Travel Channel continues to gain momentum, reporting its highest-rated quarter in 2 years. We're building our upscale female audience on the network as well. In fact, on most nights, the network now attracts more women than men. In April, Travel Channel grew 15% among adults 25 to 54 and 26% for women 25 to 54 compared with the prior year. This was the network's best performance since 2013, and we feel this is just the start. Travel Channel represents one of the most significant growth opportunities for the company, and its recent progress shows that we're well positioned to deliver on that expectation. 
DIY Network had a very strong show in delivering its most-watched quarter ever among adults 18 and over, driven by strong-performing shows, including Texas Flip and Move and Tiny House, Big Living. 
Cooking Channel had the highest-rated and most-watched first quarter in its history among both adults and women 25 to 54, maintaining its steady growth rate that it's had since 2010. 
And rounding out the U.S. Networks, Great American Country also experienced ratings gains, posting its highest-rated sales prime ratings in 8 years. 
Now linear TV isn't the only place we built success in the first quarter. We launched Scripps Lifestyle Studios in the fourth quarter of 2015, consisting of a dedicated editorial team to create digital and video content. Their online videos have received great response and increasing engagement from their targeted audiences during the first month of 2016. The Scripps Lifestyle Studios team produced over 1,000 videos for mobile and social platforms in the first quarter, and that's quite an achievement for a group we formed a just few month ago. This output is helping us gain greater traction in the content marketing and social video marketplaces. Food was our entry point onto these new platforms, but we're aggressively targeting the home category as we move further into 2016. 
And speaking of growth in digital, we recently renewed our agreement with Snapchat, which offers us another way to reach millennials and provides a new path for our advertisers to reach consumers. It's still relatively early days for the platform, but we're looking forward to bringing more content to life through that application. Scripps Networks Interactive proudly embraces innovation in pioneering new formats, and we'll continue to expand our content and functionality as we make our valued programming available on as many platforms as possible.
The last several quarters have been especially exciting for our International Networks as the company continues to grow outside the United States. To start, I want to highlight the promotion of Derek Chang, who will head up our International Lifestyle Channels; and the addition of Eduardo Hauser, who will direct SNI's businesses across Latin America. Derek and Eduardo's wealth of industry experience will enable us to tap into the numerous opportunities for our networks as we continue to build our global lifestyle brands. 
In Poland, TVN's networks achieved 6% revenue growth in local currency compared with the prior year quarter. TVN, the broadcast channel, was #1 in its commercial target group for viewers 16 to 49, attaining more than 13% market share in the first quarter. And over the same period -- time period, the TVN group increased their total market share by 4%. 
We're incorporating original lifestyle content into TVN's lineup. One of the first efforts was the locally produced version of DIY Network's Kitchen Crashers, which premiered on TVN Style channel. Another SNI format, House Crashers, that's locally produced, will premiere later this summer. And TVN is also producing episodes of House Hunters International in Europe, and those episodes will premiere in the U.S. later this year. As you can tell, the integration of TVN into our International portfolio is producing impressive results. 
For its just completed fiscal year, UKTV posted record revenues that increased 13% and record operating profits, which grew 10%, both in local currency. The multichannel broadcaster also grew its share of viewing from the prior year. U.K.'s -- UKTV's phenomenal results were driven by strong advertising revenues, continued investment in original programming and strong financial discipline. 
So 2016 is off to an extraordinary start. We remain committed to what we do best, bringing life to lifestyle, as we develop an even deeper connection with our consumers across all of our brands. 
Now I'll turn it over to Lori, who'll review the company's financial performance for the first quarter of 2016."

Since you've seen our strong results, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, provide updated guidance and then open it up for Q&A. 
And as Burton mentioned, what a terrific start to 2016 with revenues up an impressive 24%. This growth was primarily driven by a strong U.S. advertising market, coupled with ratings improvement across all 6 U.S. Networks, and a significant expansion of our International business through our acquisition of TVN last year. Adjusted segment profit increased 27%, fueled by the strong revenue growth. This increase in adjusted segment profit translated into a robust 34% growth in adjusted earnings per share compared with the prior year. 
We had a great quarter at our U.S. Networks segments. Revenues increased 10%, driven by strong revenue demand for our lifestyle networks as well as continued distribution revenue growth. For advertising revenues, strong CPM pricing, coupled with ratings growth at all 6 of our networks, drove a 14% year-over-year increase in the first quarter. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing was up in the low double digits year-over-year and up low-20s over the broadcast upfront. Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, financial and automotive. These categories are fairly consistent with prior periods. The strong advertising market has continued into the second quarter with scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing up mid to high-teens year-over-year and up low to mid-20s over the broadcast upfront. 
Contributing to the 2% growth in U.S. Networks distribution revenue were negotiated rate escalators with our traditional distribution partners as well as new distribution related to over-the-top broadband providers. These were partially offset by the previously disclosed onetime rate equalization of certain distributor agreements related to consolidation and low single-digit subscriber decline also in line with expectations. 
The healthy 20% growth in adjusted segment profit for the U.S. Networks reflects the increase in revenues, partially offset by a slight increase in expenses. The increase in cost of services was largely offset by decreases in SG&A expenses. This reflects the shift of marketing cost to later in the year, along with the ongoing operating efficiencies achieved from the restructuring, including the recent Travel Channel reorganization. 
International Networks revenues increased significantly to $121 million from $24 million due to the inclusion of TVN in the first quarter of 2016. And as Burton mentioned, for the quarter, TVN's revenues grew 6% in local currency compared with the same time a year ago. International segment profit was $10 million compared with a loss of $6 million a year ago. The $16 million improvement is primarily related to the inclusion of TVN as we continue to invest in our International Lifestyle Networks. Historically, for TVN, the first and third quarters have lower margins while the second and fourth quarters have higher margins. 
In addition to our consolidated results, we have significant International operations reported in our equity earnings. In total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $26 million, up 36% compared with the prior year. This growth is primarily related to the addition of nc+, an investment held by TVN, and UKTV's improved performance. Partially impacting the growth was the sale of our minority interest in Fox Sports South. We recorded a $208 million pretax gain during the quarter related to the sale of this minority holding. Going forward, we expect that the majority of equity and earnings of affiliates will come from our International investments. 
On the balance sheet, I want to touch on a couple of items. Our capital allocation priorities are to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our overall leverage and invest in M&A, both in the U.S. and internationally. On the M&A front, in addition to selling our Fox Sports South minority stake, we also acquired the remaining 35% interest in Travel Channel from Cox Communications for $99 million in cash and certain tax benefits. Travel Channel is a key asset for the company and one which we believe holds great upside potential. 
We finished the first quarter with approximately 3x gross leverage, down from 3.2 at the end of 2015. The first quarter leverage reflects both the Fox Sports South minority sale and the Travel Channel buy-in. It also reflects a reduction on the amended revolving credit facility of approximately $325 million, and we did not repurchase any shares during this quarter as we focused on delevering and the M&A activities previously mentioned. 
Finally, as a result of the stronger-than-expected advertising market, combined with a strong ratings performance, we're updating our full year 2016 guidance. All guidance is based on adjusted consolidated company results. Due to the increase in revenue, we now expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 8% year-over-year, up from the previously issued 7%. All other 2016 guidance remains unchanged. 
As a reminder, for the first half of 2016, we expect to realize a higher growth rate due in part to easier advertising comps for the U.S. Networks segment and because TVN results were not included in the first half of 2015. We continue to expect that the third quarter will be impacted by the Summer Olympics and, to a lesser extent, the presidential election. So it should be the slowest revenue growth quarter of the year. Then revenue growth should accelerate somewhat for the fourth quarter of 2016.  Additionally, for the third quarter, due to the timing of certain expenses, it should be the lowest adjusted segment profit margin quarter of the year. 
And with that, we're ready for your questions."

Can the -- is that consistent with your view of the -- what's going on in terms of introduction of these newer platforms? And then second question, and maybe this is for Burton or Lori. In terms of conversations you're having with your marketers, they're obviously allocating a lot greater spend to your networks, and clearly, ratings is a big part of the reason why. I just wonder, what are you hearing from big advertisers about their view on the ROI or effectiveness of your ads in terms of driving conversion to sales? And obviously, that conversation dovetails with what's the relative ROI of social media ad spending, given the growth in spend on social media platforms. I'd love to hear about that."

And as you know, we have consistently always delivered a better live performance. As you've heard us say many times, 94% of our viewing, on average, vary somewhere in the low 90s, is done in a C3 window. And by the way, to that point, you probably saw the information that Nielsen released yesterday, which very much reflects that live viewing with reality-based, nonfiction programming is more in the first 3 periods then -- the first 3 days and over 7 days. And look, just the way we've been built, part of that is the advertising environment, so the commercials not only are viewed but are viewed in that live window, which is very important in advertising, especially when it's timely, and it also plays well, I think, to our content. And that's why we have longer viewing periods, where people tune our into networks and they tend not to tune away because there's very few objectionable periods or speed bumps, if you will, are just blockbuster-type shows. And that's why you heard in my comments, we do so well consistently over a 7-night period. Our content is not, from a ratings success standpoint, just roadblock over a night or 2. It's consistently 6 or 7 nights a week. So all of this plays very well into, I think, some of the trends you mentioned, that we're starting to see more importance space on live, live streaming and even with the announcement of Hulu's up and coming venture in 2017. So I hope that answers your question. But yes, it's the way we've been built. It's the expectations that our viewership has now the networks, and also the way we stack programming and promote. So I'll let -- Burton, you want to take the second?"

I was with our ad sales team last week, so I've got very current point of view on how advertisers are seeing that. This really ties into the long history of value that we provide to advertisers. And I think in the current environment, where social media and digital certainly bring a lot of data to an advertiser that they can use, there are also questions about the ability, all the things that you've read. But we bring a lot of great data to advertisers as well, and there are factors, like the environment, that we create on our networks. Demonstrably, third-party research shows that viewers are more receptive to the advertising on our networks. That's been true over a long period of time and remains true. The -- simply, the subject matter that we're in provides an opportunity for advertisers to reach upscale viewers. Again, the independent data shows that we have, as a group, the most upscale collection of viewers on television. And then you combine that with just the consistency that we talked about in our opening remarks, night after night. Advertisers, marketers know what they're going to get when they advertise on our network. There are no clunkers that they will find their ads in. There is a consistency of viewing, and it ties into part of Ken's answer, which is the live viewing. The high rate of live viewing mean that those ads are going to be seen when the advertisers intend them to be seen. So we're hearing very positive point of view about what we offer marketers as compared to other television networks and even some other opportunities for them. Now that said, we have digital assets, too. We package those up with our television offerings, and we're doing all we can to minimize some of the objections to digital in terms of viewability and measurement and, I think, doing a very good job there, too, as well."

The more we're able to make that audience on Travel Channel reflect the audience that we have in HGTV and Food Network, the more we're able to use cross-promotion to do that. The benefits that we've seen in terms of improvement in ratings at Travel are really coming from what we said all last year, that we put on a group of shows in the fourth quarter. Some of which didn't work, we took some write-offs, but some of which did work, and we're reaping the benefits of that now into 2016. But we also stabilized the schedule. It's something we talked about for a couple of years there, too. Our scheduling team has worked really hard to create that greater consistency night after night. We're beginning to see that. We still have a ways to go with Travel Channel, but that's why we think there's more upside. So consistency in viewing patterns is something we've seen on the rise.

What's going to be more important, I think, is the technology that goes along with it, and by that, I mean -- let's just take the new XFINITY box that Comcast has rolled out and Cox is using the same technology, these new generations of boxes and what you're going to be able to do as a consumer is going to have, I think, a great impact on the competition between distribution models going forward. You marry that with smart TV, you put an enormous amount of power in the consumers' hands as to what they can watch, when they can watch, how they can watch. And I think those are going to be the game-changer. So it's not just about packaging and coming up with another service, be it traditional models that we've all grown up with over the past x number of years or some of the newer models that are rolling out. It's going to be all the bells and whistles that come along with it because I do think, not only the millenial generation, but everybody now who's just becoming accustomed to in a world of iPhones, more technology and more options. And one comment I would just make, before I turn it over to Burton, a lot around the advertising market, if you look at the first quarter, it was a really unique quarter in the sense that the amount of sports programming and compelling sports programming, everything from the NFL playoffs to the Super Bowl; and the NBA season, which we saw a team surpass the Chicago Bulls of 73 wins; if you look at the NCAA playoffs, which had never been more competitive and never more watched. And for us to be able to deliver a 14% year-over-year advertising growth rate, I think it really underscores the value of our content, the environment that we're giving the advertisers. So it's hard not to feel confident about advertising going forward, but we still have to factor in seasonalities. We have Dream Home Giveaways. We have different things throughout the year. So consistency to me is more important. And quarter after quarter if we're delivering the best of the peer group in advertising growth, we're pretty happy."

It does give me a chance to say -- you heard in my comments, we actually were in 7 cities across the country with our upfront presentations. There are a few of us out there anymore doing upfront presentations. So the obvious question is why do you guys do it. Well, one reason we do it is because we like the ability for our advertisers to co-mingle with our talent and truly understand why we're asking for these increases on something that's already premium priced. So I think just to sit back and think that we'll just push out data, we have to get out with the advertisers. We have to also hear them when we come up with advertising solutions because this is now becoming a game, not just about 30s and 60s as we all have seen evolve over the last several years. This is about advertising solutions. It is very much why we started the Scripps digital lifestyle studio, because a lot of what we're doing now is conjunction -- in conjunction with these packages that we're selling. So you're not just buying advertising across this network. You're buying solutions. You're buying maybe placement and Dream Home Giveaways, smart home giveaways, Food Network, Kitchen and what we're doing there and on and on and on. So it's a long-winded way of saying, yes, we think not only are we priced at the top of the market, but we continue to push that, because let's face it, at the end of the day, quality and exclusivity are always going to be at a minimum and, therefore, are going to be priced at the high end of the market."

So on affiliate growth, yes, we're pretty consistent with what the universe overall is doing. But I would add this, that because of the upscale nature of our viewers, any declines in the overall universe don't really affect us as they might other networks who had a less affluent viewership. In other words, our viewers are the ones who are least likely to drop or shave their paid television subscription. So in terms of just overall viewership, HGTV and the rest of our networks aren't immune but have a pretty good protection against those kinds of declines that are affecting the overall universe. In terms of ratings, yes, HGTV is absolutely growing their viewers. The millennial growth that I reported on, 10% in ratings, shows that we are bringing in viewers who are new to the network. And as we have seen over 2 decades now, once they become viewers, they stay with us. And so HGTV's trick, if you will, has been both maximizing the viewing of the viewers that we already have. And we do that probably better than any network programming mainly [indiscernible], but also drawing in new viewers, who we then keep in the family for a long, long time."

We also believe that when you have an HGTV, that's pretty much the #1 network for women viewing right now, particularly upscale viewing, upscale women. It's been that way for 9 years, and Food Network, which is a top 10 to top 12 network, that those are 2 very powerful brands that bring great value to a distributor.

So just because it's historically been that way, that 2 minutes is going to be put into these negotiations on the distributor side, does not necessarily hold true going forward in the newer deals. But having said that, we'll see, because in some cases, it's a great partnership. It's worked very well depending on how local ad sales teams are structured, et cetera.

Steve Gigliotti, Jon Steinlauf are both big believers in exactly what you're saying, that we can unlock greater value for our audiences, particularly audiences that traditionally are not the ones sought after on broad demographic buys, like adults 25 to 54. People over 54 do buy a lot of stuff. And to the extent that data, like you're talking about, can help us connect advertisers to those consumers, who are specifically interested in buying the products that the marketer wants to promote, there is value to unlock there. And we believe we're uniquely situated, as your question suggest, to take advantage of that because of the nature of our content, the high quality of our audience, the money they have to spend and the nature of our subject matter.

Scripps Networks Interactive again delivered another quarter of strong operating performance. I could not be prouder of the great work our entire organization has produced so far this year. 
Just a quick review on the second quarter of 2016. Total operating revenues grew 22%. Consolidated advertising revenues grew 29%. Advertising revenues for the U.S. networks increased 9% and surpassed $0.5 billion this quarter for the first time ever. Consolidated adjusted segment profit increased 14%, and we closed a record broadcast upfront that puts the company in a great position for 2017. 
Now Burton and Lori will go into the details on the quarter in just a few minutes but first, I want to highlight some of the results delivered by our strong brands. HGTV sustained its strong ratings performance and achieved the highest-rated second quarter in network history among all the key demographics. This strategy that we've implemented at Travel Channel continues to deliver sustained success with the networks third consecutive quarter of primetime ratings growth. Travel Channel is a powerful brand with great growth potential, and we have exciting plans in place to build on this momentum. 
And TVN group delivered another solid quarter with total market share up 3% over last year, solidifying their position as the leading network group in Poland. Our family of networks leads the way in lifestyle programming in the United States and around the world. They're really unmatched in the industry for the savvy, well-informed upscale audiences that they deliver. The record advertising performance we reported today and the record upfront we just closed, speak to our leadership in using lifestyle content to connect advertisers with consumers. 
In the midst of the ever-changing and expanded viewer options, our networks remain essential to distributors and deliver consistent performance and high-quality audiences that our distribution partners seek. The unique nature of our networks and the audiences they attract means that both our ratings and our impressions remain robust. We're active in the virtual MVPD space, talking with new and perspective entrants as we continue to expand our engagement with audiences on nontraditional linear services. 
We're also actively extending the reach of our popular TV content as well, with short form originals on the various digital and mobile platforms. Burton will share some of the recent successes we've achieved with Scripps Lifestyle Studios in just a few moments. On the advertising side as I mentioned, we recently concluded our upfront negotiations, and we're delighted with the results. I just want to say thanks to Steve Gelati, Jon Steinlauf and everyone on our sales organization for the incredible job they're doing. 
Advertisers were lining up like never before to secure their place in our entertaining and family-friendly programming, and that has resulted in a record-breaking year for that team. Our international segment continues to deliver impressive results. The teams are hard at work assessing and delivering on the wealth of opportunities available to our lifestyle brands around the world. Over the past several months, we've expanded our footprint in key markets across South America, Europe and Asia Pacific. For example, we've taken important steps towards the global rollout of HGTV, a key priority for Scripps Networks. 
In June, HGTV launched in New Zealand. Additionally, we believe there is substantial opportunity for HGTV in Europe and I look forward to us making more announcements on that front in the coming months. TVN group, Poland's leading multiplatform media business, continues to exceed even our own high expectations. Audience levels are climbing steadily, and revenues continues to grow. TVN has proven to be a transformative acquisition converting our International Networks segment into a growing and profitable endeavor as it continues to break new ground developing and monetizing compelling original content for Polish audiences. 
Today, our International Networks, including our TVN portfolio, are distributed in more than 175 countries and territories around the world in broadcast in 29 languages, all on our way to 300 million cumulative subscribers. Scripps Networks Interactive continues to reach new heights. Couldn't be proud of all we've accomplished so far in 2016 both at our networks in the United States and at our international networks. And we're really about the prospects for the remainder of the year and the year ahead are just as positive, and we're very confident in the path ahead. 
Again, I want to thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive, and with that, let me turn it over to Burton who has additional details on second quarter results. Burton?"

We continue to perform at a high level and reach some significant milestones in the second quarter. Total day ratings for adults 25 to 54 improved at every 1 of our 6 U.S. networks during the quarter. In addition, sales prime ratings were up at 5 of the 6 networks. This success story is built on strong consistent networks that deliver on their promise to audiences day in and day out. This is not a hits-driven business, although we have plenty of those too. Our networks keep viewers watching at a high level through all day parts and as a result, provide a must-have service to distributors and a must spend environment to advertisers. 
At HGTV, it was the highest-rated second quarter ever among all key demographics and a third-highest rated quarter ever for sales prime. HGTV extended its leadership position as the #1 network for upscale women 25 to 54, in sales prime for nearly 10 consecutive years. In addition, viewership among the key millennials demographic grew 6% compared with 2015 driven by popular shows like Flip or Flop and Brother vs. Brother. 
At Food Network, our co-viewing strategy continues to deliver. Co-viewership reached its highest level in over 5 years with shows like Cake Wars, Kids Barbecue Championship and Chopped Junior appealing to adults and kids alike. In addition, total day ratings for adults 25 to 54 were up 4% at Food Network in the quarter, thanks to a strategic shift in daytime programming scheduling, coupled with new premieres like Cooks Versus Cons over time, we expect this to help boost primetime viewership too. 
Travel Channel is gaining momentum and reported its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sales prime ratings were up an impressive 11% among adults 25 to 54. Ratings grew in 6 out of 7 nights of the week, 4 of them by more than 20%. Additionally, time spent viewing on Travel Channel increased by more than 10 minutes, a testament to the moves we've made over the last few months, and our dive into summer programming, which concluded this past Sunday was an absolute hit with viewers, which help drive double-digit increases in Sunday prime ratings over the full quarter. 
Travel Channel represents one of the most significant growth opportunities for the company and its recent progress reinforces management view that we're advancing the network in the right direction. DIY Network had another very strong showing, delivering its most-watched quarter ever in sales prime among adults 25 to 54. Barnwood Builders and Vanilla Ice Project led the way with strong ratings. Cooking Channel also scored the highest-rated and most-watched quarter in its history for sales prime among adults and women 25 to 54. The network also set a new record for time spent viewing. 
Finally, Great American Country had its best quarter in almost 9 years, growing ratings by more than 50%. Our new Scripps Lifestyle Studios continues to pave the digital path for our company, and we saw many successes in the second quarter, including almost 20% growth in U.S. digital revenues. Total digital subscribers on Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat have grown 20% since January while video views on our Facebook pages have increased 123%. 
Food Network continues to show strong growth in demand in its online platforms where it currently has more than 10 million fans on Facebook and more than 1 million subscribers on its Snapchat Discovery Channel. In addition, HGTV had a milestone in June, reaching 5 million fans on Facebook and 1 million followers on Instagram. Now during the quarter, we shifted some organizational responsibilities in the digital group and brought all content, digital and linear, under the oversight of Chief Content Officer Kathleen Finch as we seek to build audiences across all platforms. 
At our international networks, the last several quarters have been especially exciting as the company grows outside the United States. In Poland, TVN had another successful quarter. TVN's family of networks saw revenue growth in the mid-single digits in local currency compared with the prior year. As Ken mentioned for the second quarter, TVN group saw its total commercial audience share increase 3%. Also, TVN, the broadcast channel, strengthened its #1 position in its key demographic reaching 15% market share. TVN24 has maintained its leadership in Poland among news channels while networks, DTV and TVN have substantially increased market share over the last 6 months. 
TVN is a great fit for our International portfolio. We couldn't be more pleased with the impressive results we've realized today. We're also expanding into new markets. We recently announced the upcoming launch of HGTV for the first time in the EMEA region. The channel will debut in the Middle East and North Africa in November and late last month, we announced our intent to introduce Food Network and Travel Channel to audiences in Israel for the first time beginning in September. In the second quarter, UKTV achieved a 10% share commercial impacts for the first time in its history and was the fastest-growing network group in the U.K.
2016 continues to set new records for the company. As we grow, we're redoubling our efforts to create a deeper connection with our consumers across all of our brands. And now I'll turn it over to Lori, who will review the company's financial performance."

Since you've seen our results, I'll highlight the consolidated number, discuss our segment performance and then open it up for Q&A. Consolidated revenues in the second quarter totaled $893 million, an increase",832,"Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. Since you've seen our results, I'll highlight the consolidated number, discuss our segment performance and then open it up for Q&A. 
Consolidated revenues in the second quarter totaled $893 million, an increase of 22% compared with the prior year. The growth was primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, coupled with ratings improvement and expansion of our international business through the acquisition of TVN last year. Consolidated adjustment segment profit increased 14% fueled by the strong revenue growth during the second quarter and the inclusion of TVN. Consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 8% compared with the prior year. 
The improvement in adjusted EPS was primarily due to the improved operating performance, which was partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with the financing for the acquisition of TVN as well as the assumed debt of TVN, and lower equity earnings of the affiliate driven by the sale of our investment in FOX Sports sale in the first quarter of 2016. At our U.S. Networks segment, revenues increased 5% driven by strong advertising demand for our Lifestyle Network, partially offset by a decline in distribution revenue. 
For advertising revenue, increases in CPM pricing, coupled with ratings improvement, drove a 9% year-over-year increase in the second quarter. Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter with CPM up mid- to high-teens year-over-year and up mid- to high 20% over the broadcast upfront. Our top 5 advertising category during the quarter were food, retail, automotive, home improvement and consumer packaged goods. These categories are consistent with historical performance of the second quarter. 
As Ken mentioned earlier, our ad sales team achieved a record setting up front, we drove both rate and volume without using any additional inventory. We expect to achieve low double digit price increases on the same amount of inventory as last year. The strength of scatter market has continued into the third quarter. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing is up mid- to high-teens year-over-year and up high 20s over the calendar upfront. 
Industry subscriber decline and the previously disclosed one-time rate equalization of certain distributor agreements related to consolidation drove a 4% decrease in U.S. networks distribution revenues. The declines in rates and subscribers were partially offset by previously negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top broadband providers. 
During the second quarter, we finalized a long-term agreement with one of our biggest distributers, which resulted in a one-time true up during the quarter. This does not impact our full year revenue outlook. Overall, we are extremely pleased with how the negotiations concluded. Looking forward, this deal in combination with other previously negotiated deals set the company up for mid- to high single digit rate growth in the future. 
On the expense side, cost of services for the U.S. network increased 18% as planned in the second quarter as a result of our continued investment in the quality and variety of programming on our network. We noted last quarter that we shifted some marketing and promotional expenses to later quarters due to the continued advertising strength and ratings improvement, we will once again able to defer margin out of the second quarter. We still expect to spend these marketing dollars, but it will be later in the year.
Reflecting the increase in advertising revenues, mostly offset by increases in programming-related expenses, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. networks increased 1%. International networks revenues increased significantly to $147 million from $22 million due to the inclusion of TVN in the second quarter of 2016. TVN revenues grew by mid-single digits in local currency compared with the same time a year ago. International adjusted segment profit was $37 million compared with an adjusted segment loss of $10 million in the second quarter of 2015. This $47 million improvement is primarily due to the inclusion of TVN. 
As a reminder, TVN historically operates at higher margins in the second and fourth quarters and at lower margins in the first and third quarters. In addition to our consolidated results, we have international operations reporting our equity earnings. In total, equity in earnings of affiliates was $22 million, down 20% compared with the prior year. The decline is primarily related to the sale of our investment in FOX sports earlier this year. 
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the second quarter at approximately 2.9x gross leverage, down from 3.2 at the end of 2015. Also, our capital allocation priorities remained unchanged. We plan to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our leverage and invest in M&A, both domestically and internationally. Given those goals, we do not buy back any shares during the quarter. 
Now for our 2016 full year guidance, which is based on consolidated company result. Grounded in the results we have seen to date, we are reiterating all of our previously issued guidance. And with that, we are ready for your questions."

And as we look at the back half, I think it would be fair to say as we continue to see the impact from equalization that we would see may be low single-digit decline as we go out of 2016, so as we look into 2017, we are quite encouraged based on the deals that we've done. And again, that's what I was referring to is that I think the agreements we've done, including the one that we just concluded that we expect mid- to high single digit price CAGRs for the foreseeable future and these are fairly long contracts, so we think that our carriers have been secured as well as that we've gotten great price increases that are representative of the brands and the products that we bring to distributors bundle. And again, I think I would point to, we've had a great year and I think the resounding success we've had in driving impressions is seen by distributors as well as they look at what we put in our bundle. So again, I think again, we've been calling it's been of a little bit of a choppy 2016 but we're feeling very good based on the agreements that we've struck looking as we lap those in 2017 and beyond.

So Olympics aside, I think part of the reason you're seeing the type of rating improvement increases you are across all over network is a little bit more of a full year strategy, including what we're doing in the summer and some of the summer impacted programming and targeted programming. So I don't want to give Kathleen and her team not enough credit for the fact that we've got Olympics here for 2.5 weeks when this is more of a year-round strategy. Okay?"

We continue to secure new subscribers and new shelf space across the landscape as well as look at what we can do on the Lifestyle Studios. As far as margins, we've been talking about programming, we've been moderating that. We saw some increases over the past few years as we ramp of our spending per Travel Channel, what we've always said is that has moderated. We have looked at across the portfolio but as Kathleen and her team find something that's working and driving investment on the top line, we would make investment to that because it is the best investment we can make overall as a company. But at that point on the U.S, I think we're very good stewards of our capital and of our expenses.

But what it is doing is creating a greater connection with our audience particularly the younger audience and we do believe and we do research on this, so we have some degree of evidence that we are driving younger viewers in particular to be more connected to our television programming as well. In addition, just the kind of shows that are being put on in particular outside of HGTV with Flip or Flop Brother vs. Brother, certain kinds of programming attracts the millennials audience better than others, and so we tend to focus on that for some of our social convergent content as well.

If anything I'm probably more confident than I've ever been about the position of our networks and going forward, I do think, as Lori alluded to, I think some of the smaller networks across the industry are a little under a bit more pressure but the good news for us is both DIY and cooking are actually extensions of our big brands and bring some very important advertising slots to our distribution partners as well.

I think it's interesting if you look back at your Q1, I think scatter pricing was healthy, but will double digit is what you cited and then in Q2, get excited mid- to high-teens scatter over scatter. So pricing actually better in Q2 than it was in Q1. Per our numbers, I don't think your audiences were up about the same amount in both Q1 and Q2 year-over-year low single-digit number. And yet your domestic ad revenues was higher in Q1 like 14% growth versus 9% growth in Q2, so just something else must be going.

Scripps Networks Interactive again delivered another quarter of strong operating performance. I could not be prouder of the great work our entire organization has produced so far this year. 
Just a quick review on the second quarter of 2016. Total operating revenues grew 22%. Consolidated advertising revenues grew 29%. Advertising revenues for the U.S. networks increased 9% and surpassed $0.5 billion this quarter for the first time ever. Consolidated adjusted segment profit increased 14%, and we closed a record broadcast upfront that puts the company in a great position for 2017. 
Now Burton and Lori will go into the details on the quarter in just a few minutes. But first, I want to highlight some of the results delivered by our strong brands. HGTV sustained its strong ratings performance and achieved the highest-rated second quarter in network history among all the key demographics. This strategy that we've implemented at Travel Channel continues to deliver sustained success with the networks third consecutive quarter of primetime ratings growth. Travel Channel is a powerful brand with great growth potential, and we have exciting plans in place to build on this momentum. 
And TVN Group delivered another solid quarter with total market share up 3% over last year, solidifying their position as the leading network group in Poland. Our family of networks leads the way in lifestyle programming in the United States and around the world. They're really unmatched in the industry for the savvy, well-informed, upscale audiences that they deliver. The record advertising performance we reported today, and the record upfront we just closed, speak to our leadership and using lifestyle content to connect the advertisers with consumers. 
In the midst of the ever-changing and expanded viewer options, our networks remain essential to distributors and deliver consistent performance and high-quality audiences that our distribution partners' seek. The unique nature of our networks and the audiences they attract means that both our ratings and our impressions remain robust. We're active in the virtual MVPD space, talking with new and perspective entrants as we continue to expand our engagement with audiences on nontraditional linear services. 
We're also actively extending the reach of our popular TV content as well, with short-form originals on the various digital and mobile platforms. Burton will share some of the recent successes we've achieved with Scripps Lifestyle Studios in just a few moments. 
On the advertising side, as I mentioned, we recently concluded our upfront negotiations, and we're delighted with the results. I just want to say thanks to Steven Gigliotti, Jon Steinlauf and everyone in our sales organization for the incredible job they're doing. 
Advertisers are lining up like never before to secure their place in our entertaining and family-friendly programming, and that has resulted in a record-breaking year for that team.  
Our International segment continues to deliver impressive results. The teams are hard at work assessing and delivering on the wealth of opportunities available to our lifestyle brands around the world. Over the past several months, we've expanded our footprint in key markets across South America, Europe and Asia Pacific. 
For example, we've taken important steps toward the global rollout of HGTV, a key priority for Scripps Networks.  In June, HGTV launched in New Zealand. Additionally, we believe there is substantial opportunity for HGTV in Europe. And I'll look forward to us making more announcements on that front in the coming months. 
TVN Group, Poland's leading multi-platform media business, continues to exceed even our own high expectations. Audience levels are climbing steadily, and revenues continues to grow. TVN has proven to be a transformative acquisition, converting our International Networks segment into a growing and profitable endeavor as it continues to break new ground-developing and monetizing compelling original content for Polish audiences. 
Today, our International Networks, including our TVN portfolio, are distributed in more than 175 countries and territories around the world and broadcast in 29 languages, all on under way to 300 million cumulative subscribers. 
Scripps Networks Interactive continues to reach new heights. Couldn't be proud of all we've accomplished so far in 2016, both at our networks in the United States and at our international networks. And we're really about the prospects for the remainder of the year, and the year ahead are just as positive, and we're very confident in the path ahead. 
Again, I want to thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. And with that, let me turn it over to Burton, who has additional details on second quarter results. Burton?"

We continue to perform at a high level and reached some significant milestones in the second quarter. Total day ratings for adults, 25 to 54, improved at every 1 of our 6 U.S. networks during the quarter. In addition, sales prime ratings were up at 5 of the 6 networks. This success story is built on strong consistent networks that deliver on their promise to audiences day in and day out. This is not a hits-driven business, although we have plenty of those too. Our networks keep viewers watching at a high level through all day parts, and as a result, provide a must-have service to distributors and a must-spend environment to advertisers. 
At HGTV, it was the highest-rated second quarter ever among all key demographics and a third highest-rated quarter ever for sales prime. HGTV extended its leadership position as the #1 network for upscale women, 25 to 54, in sales prime for nearly 10 consecutive years. In addition, viewership among the key millennials demographic grew 6% compared with 2015, driven by popular shows like Flip or Flop and Brother vs. Brother. 
At Food Network, our coviewing strategy continues to deliver. Coviewership reached its highest level in over 5 years, with shows like Cake Wars, Kids Barbecue Championship and Chopped Junior appealing to adults and kids alike. In addition, total day ratings for adults, 25 to 54, were up 4% at Food Network in the quarter, thanks to a strategic shift in daytime program scheduling, coupled with new premieres, like Cooks vs. Cons overtime, [ph] we expect this to help boost primetime viewership too. 
Travel Channel is gaining momentum and reported its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sales prime ratings were up an impressive 11% among adults, 25 to 54. Ratings grew in 6 out of 7 nights of the week, 4 of them by more than 20%. Additionally, time spent viewing on Travel Channel increased by more than 10 minutes, a testament to the moves we've made over the last few months. And our dive into summer programming, which concluded this past Sunday, was an absolute hit with viewers, which [ph] help drive double-digit increases in Sunday prime ratings over the full quarter. 
Travel Channel represents one of the most significant growth opportunities for the company, and its recent progress reinforces management view that we are advancing the network in the right direction. 
DIY Network had another very strong showing, delivering its most-watched quarter ever in sales prime among adults 25 to 54. Barnwood Builders and Vanilla Ice Project led the way with strong ratings. 
Cooking Channel also scored the highest-rated and most-watched quarter in its history for sales prime among adults and women 25 to 54. The network also set a new record for time spent viewing. 
Finally, Great American Country had its best quarter in almost 9 years, growing ratings by more than 50%. 
Our new Scripps Lifestyle Studios continues to pave the digital path for our company, and we saw many successes in the second quarter, including almost 20% growth in U.S. digital revenues. Total digital subscribers on Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat, have grown 20% since January, while video views on our Facebook pages have increased 123%.
Food Network continues to show strong growth in demand in its online platforms, where it currently has more than 10 million fans on Facebook and more than 1 million subscribers on its Snapchat Discover channel. In addition, HGTV had a milestone in June, reaching 5 million fans on Facebook and 1 million followers on Instagram. 
Now during the quarter, we've shifted some organizational responsibilities in the digital group and brought all content, digital and linear, under the oversight of Chief Content Officer Kathleen Finch, as we seek to build audiences across all platforms. 
At our International Networks, the last several quarters have been especially exciting, as the company grows outside the United States. In Poland, TVN had another successful quarter. TVN's family of networks saw revenue growth in the mid-single digits in local currency compared with the prior year. As Ken mentioned, for the second quarter, TVN group saw its total commercial audience share increase 3%. Also, TVN, the broadcast channel, strengthened its #1 position in its key demographic, reaching 15% market share. TVN24 has maintained its leadership in Poland among news channels, while thematic networks, TTV and TVN Fabula, have substantially increased market share over the last 6 months. 
TVN is a great fit for our international portfolio. We couldn't be more pleased with the impressive results we realized today. We're also expanding into new markets. We recently announced the upcoming launch of HGTV for the first time in the EMEA region. The channel will debut in the Middle East and North Africa in November. And late last month, we announced our intent to introduce Food Network and Travel Channel to audiences in Israel for the first time, beginning in September. 
In the second quarter, UKTV achieved a 10% share of commercial impacts for the first time in its history and was the fastest-growing network group in the U.K.
2016 continues to set new records for the company. As we grow, we're redoubling our efforts to create an ever-deeper connection with our consumers across all of our brands. 
And now I'll turn it over to Lori, who will review the company's financial performance."
6469353,372220210,1031518,"Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. Since you've seen our results, we'll highlight the consolidated number, discuss our segment performance, and then open it up for Q&A.

Since you've seen our results, we'll highlight the consolidated number, discuss our segment performance, and then open it up for Q&A. 
Consolidated revenues in the second quarter totaled $893 million, an increase of 22% compared with the prior year. The growth was primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, coupled with ratings improvement and expansion of our international business through the acquisition of TVN last year. Consolidated adjustment segment profit increased 14%, fueled by the strong revenue growth during the second quarter and the inclusion of TVN. Consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 8% compared with the prior year. 
The improvement in adjusted EPS was primarily due to the improved operating performance, which was partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with the financing for the acquisition of TVN as well as the assumed debt of TVN, and lower equity earnings of the affiliate driven by the sale of our investment in FOX Sports South in the first quarter of 2016. 
At our U.S. Networks segment, revenues increased 5%, driven by strong advertising demand for our Lifestyle Network, partially offset by a decline in distribution revenues. 
For advertising revenues, increases in CPM pricing, coupled with ratings improvement, drove a 9% year-over-year increase in the second quarter. Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter, with CPMs up mid- to high teens year-over-year and up mid- to high 20% over the broadcast upfront. 
Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, automotive, home improvement and consumer packaged goods. These categories are consistent with the historical performance of the second quarter. 
As Ken mentioned earlier, our ad sales team achieved a record setting upfront. We drove both rate and volume without using any additional inventory. We expect to achieve low double-digit price increases on the same amount of inventory as last year. The strength of scatter market has continued into the third quarter. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing is up mid- t high teens year-over-year and up high 20s over the calendar upfront. 
Industry subscriber decline, and the previously disclosed one-time rate equalization of certain distributor agreements related to consolidation drove a 4% decrease in U.S. Networks' distribution revenues. The declines in rates and subscribers were partially offset by previously negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top broadband providers. 
During the second quarter, we finalized a long-term agreement with one of our biggest distributers, which resulted in a one-time true-up during the quarter. This does not impact our full year revenue outlook.  Overall, we are extremely pleased with how the negotiations concluded. 
Looking forward, this deal, in combination with other previously negotiated deals, set the company up for mid- to high single-digit rate growth in the future. 
On the expense side, cost of services for the U.S Networks increased 18%, as planned, in the second quarter, as a result of our continued investment in the quality and variety of programming on our network. 
We noted last quarter that we shifted some marketing and promotional expenses to later quarters. Due to the continued advertising strengths and ratings improvements, we will once again able to defer marketing expenses out of the second quarter. We still expect to spend these marketing dollars, but it will be later in the year.
Reflecting the increases in advertising revenues, mostly offset by increases in programming-related expenses, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. Networks increased 1%. 
International Networks' revenues increased significantly to $147 million from $22 million, due to the inclusion of TVN in the second quarter of 2016. TVN revenues grew by mid-single digits in local currency compared with the same time a year ago. 
International adjusted segment profit was $37 million compared with an adjusted segment loss of $10 million in the second quarter of 2015. This $47 million improvement is primarily due to the inclusion of TVN. 
As a reminder, TVN historically operates at higher margins in the second and fourth quarters and at lower margins in the first and third quarters. In addition to our consolidated results, we have international operations reported in our equity earnings. In total, equity in earnings of affiliates was $22 million, down 20% compared with the prior year. The decline is primarily related to the sale of our investment in FOX Sports South earlier this year. 
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the second quarter at approximately 2.9x gross leverage, down from 3.2 at the end of 2015. Also, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We plan to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our leverage and invest in M&A, both domestically and internationally. Given those goals, we did not buy back any shares during the quarter. 
Now for our 2016 full year guidance, which is based on consolidated company result. Grounded in the results we have seen to-date, we are reiterating all of our previously issued guidance. And with that, we are ready for your questions."

So Lori, just wanted to ask about the 4% decline in U.S. distribution revenue. If you exclude the onetime rate equalization that you cited, what would affiliate rate growth have been in the 2Q? And then relatively, in the past -- and I think, just now in your prepared remarks, you said that you expect distribution revenue growth to revert to mid- to high single-digit growth at least in the future. So I wonder if you could bridge for us the 4% decline in the 2Q with the expectation for mid- to high single-digit growth in the future. For example, what's the expectation for distribution revenue for the balance of the year? So why don't we start with those? And then I have a quick follow-up."

Just as we finalized agreements, you'll see some lumpiness in how we record things. But I think I would point again to our full year guidance, we're still on track. And as we look at the back half, I think it would be fair to say, as we continue to see the impact from equalization, that we would see may be low single-digit decline as we go out of 2016. So as we look into 2017, we are quite encouraged based on the deals that we've done. And again, that's what I was referring to is that, with the agreements we've done, including the one that we just concluded, that we expect mid- to high-single digit price CAGRs for the foreseeable future. And these are fairly long contracts. So we think that our carriage has been secured as well as that we've gotten great price increases that are representative of the brands and the product that we bring to the distributors' bundles. And again, I think I would point to, we've had a great year, and I think the resounding success we've had in driving impressions is seen by distributors as well as, as they look at what we put in our bundle. So again, I think, again, we've been calling it's going to be a little bit of a choppy 2016, but we're feeling very good based on the agreements that we've struck, looking as we lap those in 2017 and beyond. Again, secondly, then I would refer to our full year guidance to keep you guidance guardrai [ph]."

I think, on the ad front, based on the impressions growth, looking at how well we've done in the upfront, feeling very confident with the advertising. And in fact, I think, based on what's going on the industry, we're well positioned with the reliance that we have on driving advertising revenue. Again, I just spoke that we're going to lap this rate equalization. So again, on the price front, we're feeling very strong, and we continue to secure new subscribers and new shelf space across the landscape as well as look at what we can do on the Lifestyle Studios. As far as margins, we've been talking about programming. We've been moderating that. We saw some increases over the past few years as we ramped up our spending for Travel Channel, what we've always said is that has moderated. We have looked at across the portfolio. But as Kathleen and her team find something that's working and driving investment on the top line, we would make investment to that, because it is the best investment we can make overall as a company. But at that point on the U.S, I think we're very good stewards of our capital and of our expenses. So again, I think it's going to be a very good year, and we'll give you more on margins as we look at the -- coming out of our budget cycle. But I don't see any big speed bumps looking forward."

But what it is doing is creating a greater connection with our audience, particularly the younger audience, and we do believe and we do research on this so we have some degree of evidence that we are driving younger viewers in particular to be more connected to our television programming as well. In addition, just the kind of shows that are being put on, in particular, outside of HGTV, Flip or Flop and Brother vs. Brother, certain kinds of programming attracts the millennial audience better than others, and so we tend to focus on that for some of our social convergent content as well. But you're right. It's a holistic approach. That's why we restructured ourselves in terms of our organization this past year to take advantage of that, and we look forward ahead to make more connections across more platforms in every way we possibly can and then monetize them in every way we can."

The fact -- and we talked about this on the calls many time is, it's two-edged sword that our distribution economics are way they are. We're an easy group of networks to be included in skinny bundles for all the obvious reasons.

If anything, I'm probably more confident than I've ever been about the position of our networks and going forward. I do think, as Lori alluded to -- I think some of the smaller networks across the industry are to be under a little bit more pressure. But the good news for us is both DIY and cooking are actually extensions of our big brands and bring some very important advertising slots to our distribution partners as well.

So pricing actually better in Q2 than it was in Q1. Per our numbers, I don't think your audiences were up about the same amount in both Q1 and Q2 year-over-year, low single-digit number, and yet your domestic ad revenues was higher in Q1, like 14% growth versus 9% growth in Q2. So just something else must be going on if you had higher pricing, the same audiences, but lower revenue growth. So what are we missing? Is it mix? Is it something just about the mix Q2 versus Q1, something about sell out percentage? Any help you could do give us would be greatly appreciated."

Basically, our ad sales team is a great partner to our programming and marketing teams, and collectively, we just believe in our strength, and don't feel the need to expand the inventory that we sold in the upfront this year, and that's, as I said, been very consistent over a number of years because the performance of our networks has been so consistent."

So on the programming-only front, if I could see the largest impact this year -- but again, we've been talking about our overall investment on the portfolio, how that's moderated. It's a little bit of a leading indicator of what you'll see on the amortization. But again, the programming teams have to make the right scheduling decisions which does have an impact. And yes, we did have an impact from changing our amort. But I think you're going to see that continue to moderate and there'll be huge moderation when we look at the fourth quarter. In fact, with the marketing spend and programming, I think we've highlighted that we think Q3 is going to be where we continue to invest. And you're going to see a little bit of margin push there on the U.S. side, but you're going to see expansion probably on the back half related to that shifting of spending. But again, it's back to the hours. We're putting the right amount of hours. The team keeps doing it, and you factor that. So I really just think you're seeing the impact of just the stewardship of Kathleen and her team managing that 2,500 hours on U.S. side the best way they can and maximizing that with the impressions growth. And again, we've moderated on our Travel Channel hours, but I would -- I think I've been pretty consistent saying that Kathleen and her team start to see traction, and then we're driving the revenue, and Steve is out there selling it, you could see as our start to be increased. But again, too early to call that. I think we're quite comfortable. But I think you're looking at -- when you look at our cost of sales, basically on the programming side, it's probably the largest quarter of the year was as far as an impact within the second quarter.

We -- obviously, we do sell digitally. We sell digital impressions. I'd say we have 20% growth in our advertising revenue on the digital side for the U.S. And so there is a different pricing equation when it comes to our digital impressions, whether it's for flat content or video content. If you're talking about, essentially, the winning your feed through TV Everywhere, through a digital delivery platform Roku, all those things, Apple TV, Amazon Fire, or our own apps or distributors' apps, if it's the linear feed, that pricing would be the same as the television network. If it's dynamic ad insertion post day 3, which we're seeing some growth in, that's priced as the digital buy, and so have a different pricing components. So I guess the quick answer is that yes, there is a different equation when it comes to a pure digital buy. But because this is all evolving and what we hope we'll be more viewing of our linear networks through digital platforms, that would be rolled up into the standard television buy within C3. So it's a little bit complicated right now, but I hope that helps give you some idea of how we're looking at it."

Scripps Networks Interactive again delivered another quarter of strong operating performance. I could not be prouder of the great work our entire organization has produced so far this year. 
Just a quick review on the second quarter of 2016. Total operating revenues grew 22%. Consolidated advertising revenues grew 29%. Advertising revenues for the U.S. networks increased 9% and surpassed $0.5 billion this quarter for the first time ever. Consolidated adjusted segment profit increased 14%, and we closed a record broadcast upfront that puts the company in a great position for 2017. 
Now Burton and Lori will go into the details on the quarter in just a few minutes. But first, I want to highlight some of the results delivered by our strong brands. HGTV sustained its strong ratings performance and achieved the highest-rated second quarter in network history among all the key demographics. This strategy that we've implemented at Travel Channel continues to deliver sustained success with the network’s third consecutive quarter of primetime ratings growth. Travel Channel is a powerful brand with great growth potential, and we have exciting plans in place to build on this momentum. 
And TVN Group delivered another solid quarter with total market share up 3% over last year, solidifying their position as the leading network group in Poland. Our family of networks leads the way in lifestyle programming in the United States and around the world. They're really unmatched in the industry for the savvy, well-informed, upscale audiences that they deliver. The record advertising performance we reported today, and the record upfront we just closed, speak to our leadership in using lifestyle content to connect the advertisers with consumers. 
In the midst of ever-changing and expanded viewer options, our networks remain essential to distributors and deliver consistent performance and high-quality audiences that our distribution partners seek. The unique nature of our networks and the audiences they attract means that both our ratings and our impressions remain robust. We're active in the virtual MVPD space, talking with new and prospective entrants as we continue to expand our engagement with audiences on nontraditional linear services. 
We're also actively extending the reach of our popular TV content as well, with short-form originals on the various digital and mobile platforms. Burton will share some of the recent successes we've achieved with Scripps Lifestyle Studios in just a few moments. 
On the advertising side, as I mentioned, we recently concluded our upfront negotiations, and we're delighted with the results. I just want to say thanks to Steven Gigliotti, Jon Steinlauf and everyone in our sales organization for the incredible job they're doing. 
Advertisers are lining up like never before to secure their place in our entertaining and family-friendly programming, and that has resulted in a record-breaking year for that team.  
Our International segment continues to deliver impressive results. The teams are hard at work assessing and delivering on the wealth of opportunities available to our lifestyle brands around the world. Over the past several months, we've expanded our footprint in key markets across South America, Europe and Asia Pacific. 
For example, we've taken important steps toward the global rollout of HGTV, a key priority for Scripps Networks. In June, HGTV launched in New Zealand. Additionally, we believe there is substantial opportunity for HGTV in Europe. And I'll look forward to us making more announcements on that front in the coming months. 
TVN Group, Poland's leading multi-platform media business, continues to exceed even our own high expectations. Audience levels are climbing steadily, and revenues continues to grow. TVN has proven to be a transformative acquisition, converting our International Networks segment into a growing and profitable endeavor as it continues to break new ground developing and monetizing compelling original content for Polish audiences. 
Today, our International Networks, including our TVN portfolio, are distributed in more than 175 countries and territories around the world and broadcast in 29 languages, all on our way to 300 million cumulative subscribers. 
Scripps Networks Interactive continues to reach new heights. Couldn't be prouder of all we've accomplished so far in 2016, both at our networks in the United States and at our international networks. And we're really about the prospects for the remainder of the year, and the year ahead are just as positive, and we're very confident in the path ahead. 
Again, I want to thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. And with that, let me turn it over to Burton, who has additional details on second quarter results. Burton?"

We continue to perform at a high level and reached some significant milestones in the second quarter. Total day ratings for adults, 25 to 54 improved at every one of our 6 U.S. networks during the quarter. In addition, sales prime ratings were up at 5 of the 6 networks. This success story is built on strong, consistent networks that deliver on their promise to audiences day in and day out. This is not a hits-driven business, although we have plenty of those too. Our networks keep viewers watching at a high level through all day parts, and as a result, provide a must-have service to distributors and a must-spend environment to advertisers. 
At HGTV, it was the highest-rated second quarter ever among all key demographics and a third highest-rated quarter ever for sales prime. HGTV extended its leadership position as the #1 network for upscale women 25 to 54 in sales prime for nearly 10 consecutive years. In addition, viewership among the key millennials demographic grew 6% compared with 2015, driven by popular shows like Flip or Flop and Brother vs. Brother. 
At Food Network, our coviewing strategy continues to deliver. Coviewership reached its highest level in over 5 years, with shows like Cake Wars, Kids Barbecue Championship and Chopped Junior appealing to adults and kids alike. In addition, total day ratings for adults 25 to 54 were up 4% at Food Network in the quarter, thanks to a strategic shift in daytime program scheduling, coupled with new premieres like Cooks vs. Cons, over time we expect this to help boost primetime viewership too. 
Travel Channel is gaining momentum and reported its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sales prime ratings were up an impressive 11% among adults 25 to 54. Ratings grew in 6 out of 7 nights of the week, 4 of them by more than 20%. Additionally, time spent viewing on Travel Channel increased by more than 10 minutes, a testament to the moves we've made over the last few months. And our dive into summer programming, which concluded this past Sunday, was an absolute hit with viewers. The stunt helped drive double-digit increases in Sunday prime ratings over the full quarter. 
Travel Channel represents one of the most significant growth opportunities for the company, and its recent progress reinforces management view that we are advancing the network in the right direction. 
DIY Network had another very strong showing, delivering its most-watched quarter ever in sales prime among adults 25 to 54. Barnwood Builders and Vanilla Ice Project led the way with strong ratings. 
Cooking Channel also scored the highest-rated and most-watched quarter in its history for sales prime among adults and women 25 to 54. The network also set a new record for time spent viewing. 
Finally, Great American Country had its best quarter in almost 9 years, growing ratings by more than 50%. 
Our new Scripps Lifestyle Studios continues to pave the digital path for our company, and we saw many successes in the second quarter, including almost 20% growth in U.S. digital revenues. Total digital subscribers on Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat have grown 20% since January, while video views on our Facebook pages have increased 123%.
Food Network continues to show strong growth in demand in its online platforms, where it currently has more than 10 million fans on Facebook and more than 1 million subscribers on its Snapchat Discover channel. In addition, HGTV had a milestone in June, reaching 5 million fans on Facebook and 1 million followers on Instagram. 
Now during the quarter, we've shifted some organizational responsibilities in the digital group and brought all content, digital and linear, under the oversight of Chief Content Officer Kathleen Finch, as we seek to build audiences across all platforms. 
At our International Networks, the last several quarters have been especially exciting, as the company grows outside the United States. In Poland, TVN had another successful quarter. TVN's family of networks saw revenue growth in the mid-single digits in local currency compared with the prior year. As Ken mentioned, for the second quarter, TVN group saw its total commercial audience share increase 3%. Also, TVN, the broadcast channel, strengthened its #1 position in its key demographic, reaching 15% market share. TVN24 has maintained its leadership in Poland among news channels, while thematic networks TTV and TVN Fabula have substantially increased market share over the last 6 months. 
TVN is a great fit for our international portfolio. We couldn't be more pleased with the impressive results we’ve realized to date. We're also expanding into new markets. We recently announced the upcoming launch of HGTV for the first time in the EMEA region. The channel will debut in the Middle East and North Africa in November. And late last month, we announced our intent to introduce Food Network and Travel Channel to audiences in Israel for the first time, beginning in September. 
In the second quarter, UKTV achieved a 10% share of commercial impacts for the first time in its history and was the fastest-growing network group in the U.K.
2016 continues to set new records for the company. As we grow, we're redoubling our efforts to create an ever-deeper connection with our consumers across all of our brands. 
And now I'll turn it over to Lori, who will review the company's financial performance."
6469353,372220210,1031828,"Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. Since you've seen our results, we'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, and then open it up for Q&A.

Since you've seen our results, we'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, and then open it up for Q&A. 
Consolidated revenues in the second quarter totaled $893 million, an increase of 22% compared with the prior year. The growth was primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, coupled with ratings improvements and expansion of our international business through the acquisition of TVN last year. Consolidated adjustment segment profit increased 14%, fueled by the strong revenue growth during the second quarter and the inclusion of TVN. Consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 8% compared with the prior year. 
The improvement in adjusted EPS was primarily due to the improved operating performance, which was partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with the financing for the acquisition of TVN as well as the assumed debt of TVN, and lower equity and earnings of affiliates driven by the sale of our investment in FOX Sports South in the first quarter of 2016. 
At our U.S. Networks segment, revenues increased 5%, driven by strong advertising demand for our Lifestyle Network, partially offset by a decline in distribution revenues. 
For advertising revenues, increases in CPM pricing, coupled with ratings improvement, drove a 9% year-over-year increase in the second quarter. Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter, with CPMs up mid- to high teens year-over-year and up mid- to high 20% over the broadcast upfront. 
Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, automotive, home improvement and consumer packaged goods. These categories are consistent with the historical performance of the second quarter. 
As Ken mentioned earlier, our ad sales team achieved a record-setting upfront. We drove both rate and volume without using any additional inventory. We expect to achieve low double-digit price increases on the same amount of inventory as last year. The strength of scatter market has continued into the third quarter. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing is up mid- to high teens year-over-year and up high 20s over the calendar upfront. 
Industry subscriber declines and the previously disclosed onetime rate equalization of certain distributor agreements related to consolidation drove a 4% decrease in U.S. Networks' distribution revenues. The declines in rates and subscribers were partially offset by previously negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top broadband providers. 
During the second quarter, we finalized a long-term agreement with one of our biggest distributers, which resulted in a onetime true-up during the quarter. This does not impact our full year revenue outlook.  Overall, we are extremely pleased with how the negotiations concluded. 
Looking forward, this deal, in combination with other previously negotiated deals, sets the company up for mid- to high single-digit rate growth in the future. 
On the expense side, cost of services for the U.S Networks increased 18%, as planned, in the second quarter, as a result of our continued investment in the quality and variety of programming on our network. 
We noted last quarter that we shifted some marketing and promotional expenses to later quarters. Due to the continued advertising strengths and ratings improvements, we were once again able to defer marketing expenses out of the second quarter. We still expect to spend these marketing dollars, but it will be later in the year.
Reflecting the increases in advertising revenues, mostly offset by increases in programming-related expenses, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. Networks increased 1%. 
International Networks' revenues increased significantly to $147 million from $22 million, due to the inclusion of TVN in the second quarter of 2016. TVN revenues grew by mid-single digits in local currency compared with the same time a year ago. 
International adjusted segment profit was $37 million compared with an adjusted segment loss of $10 million in the second quarter of 2015. This $47 million improvement is primarily due to the inclusion of TVN. 
As a reminder, TVN historically operates at higher margins in the second and fourth quarters and at lower margins in the first and third quarters. In addition to our consolidated results, we have international operations reported in our equity earnings. In total, equity in earnings of affiliates was $22 million, down 20% compared with the prior year. The decline is primarily related to the sale of our investment in FOX Sports South earlier this year. 
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the second quarter at approximately 2.9x gross leverage, down from 3.2 at the end of 2015. Also, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We plan to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our leverage and invest in M&A, both domestically and internationally. Given those goals, we did not buy back any shares during the quarter. 
Now for our 2016 full year guidance, which is based on consolidated company result. Grounded in the results we have seen to date, we are reiterating all of our previously issued guidance. And with that, we are ready for your questions."

And then relatively, in the past -- and I think, just now in your prepared remarks, you said that you expect distribution revenue growth to revert to mid- to high single-digit growth at least in the future. So I wonder if you could bridge for us the 4% decline in the 2Q with the expectation for mid- to high single-digit growth in the future. For example, what's the expectation for distribution revenue for the balance of the year? So why don't we start with those? And then I have a quick follow-up."

Just as we finalized agreements, you'll see some lumpiness in how we record things. But I think I would point again to our full year guidance, we're still on track. And as we look at the back half, I think it would be fair to say, as we continue to see the impact from equalization, that we would see maybe low single-digit declines as we go out of 2016. But as we look into 2017, we are quite encouraged based on the deals that we've done. And again, that's what I was referring to is that, with the agreements we've done, including the one that we just concluded, that we expect mid- to high-single digit price CAGRs for the foreseeable future. And these are fairly long contracts. So we think that our carriage has been secured as well as that we've gotten great price increases that are representative of the brands and the product that we bring to the distributors' bundles. And again, I think I would point to, we've had a great year, and I think the resounding success we've had in driving impressions is seen by distributors as well as, as they look at what to put in their bundles. So again, I think, again, we've been calling it's going to be a little bit of a choppy 2016, but we're feeling very good based on the agreements that we've struck, looking as we lap those in 2017 and beyond. Again, Anthony, and I would refer to our full year guidance to keep you guidance -- guardrails [ph]."

I think, on the ad front, based on the impressions growth, looking at how well we've done in the upfront, feeling very confident with the advertising. And in fact, I think, based on what's going on the industry, we're well positioned with the reliance that we have on driving advertising revenue. Again, I just spoke that we're going to lap this rate equalization. So again, on the price front, we're feeling very strong, and we continue to secure new subscribers and new shelf space across the landscape as well as look at what we can do on the Lifestyle Studios. As far as margins, we've been talking about programming. We've been moderating that. We saw some increases over the past few years as we ramped up our spending for Travel Channel. What we've always said is that has moderated. We have looked at across the portfolio. But if Kathleen and her team find something that's working and driving investment on the top line, we would make investment to that, because it is the best investment we can make overall as a company. But at that point on the U.S, I think we're very good stewards of our capital and of our expenses. So again, I think it's going to be a very good year, and we'll give you more on margins as we look at the -- coming out of our budget cycle. But I don't see any big speed bumps looking forward."

But what it is doing is creating a greater connection with our audience, particularly the younger audience, and we do believe and we do research in this so we have some degree of evidence that we are driving younger viewers in particular to be more connected to our television programming as well. In addition, just the kinds of shows that are being put on, in particular, outside of HGTV, Flip or Flop and Brother vs. Brother, certain kinds of programming attracts the millennial audience better than others, and so we tend to focus on that for some of our social convergent content as well. But you're right. It's a holistic approach. That's why we restructured ourselves in terms of our organization this past year to take advantage of that, and we’ll forge ahead to make more connections across more platforms in every way we possibly can and then monetize them in every way we can."

We’re must-have networks, especially if you plan on delivering an upscale women audience. And I don't know how you start with any business plan and say, ""We're not going to.""  The fact -- and we talked about this on the calls many time is, it's two-edged sword that our distribution economics are where they are. We're an easy group of networks to be included in skinny bundles for all the obvious reasons. So my confidence couldn't be higher as we continue to have discussions, which we mentioned in our comments, even in the MVPD world. If anything, I'm probably more confident than I've ever been about the position of our networks, and going forward, I do think, as Lori alluded to, I think some of the smaller networks across the industry are to be under a little bit more pressure. But the good news for us is both DIY and Cooking are actually extensions of our big brands and bring some very important advertising slots to our distribution partners as well.

I think it's interesting to look -- if you look back at your Q1, I think scatter pricing was healthy, but low double digit is what you've cited. And in Q2, you just cited mid- to high teens scatter-over-scatter. So pricing’s actually better in Q2 than it was in Q1. Per our numbers, it looked like your audiences were up about the same amount in both Q1 and Q2 year-over-year, low single-digit number, and yet your domestic ad revenue was higher in Q1, like 14% growth versus 9% growth in Q2. So just something else must be going on if you had higher pricing, the same audiences, but lower revenue growth. So what are we missing? Is it mix? Is it something just about the mix Q2 versus Q1, something about sell out percentage? Any help you could do -- give us would be greatly appreciated."

Basically, our ad sales team is a great partner to our programming and marketing teams, and collectively, we just believe in our strength, and don't feel the need to expand the inventory that we sold in the upfront this year, and that's, as I said, been very consistent over a number of years because the performance of our networks has been so consistent."

So on the programming-only front, you’re probably going to see the largest impact this year -- but again, we've been talking about our overall investment on the portfolio, how that's moderated. It's a little bit of a leading indicator of what you'll see on the amortization. But again, the programming teams have to make the right scheduling decisions, which does have an impact. And yes, we did have an impact from changing our amort. But I think you're going to see that continue to moderate, and there'll be huge moderation when we look at the fourth quarter. In fact, with the marketing spend and programming, I think we've highlighted that we think Q3 is going to be where we continue to invest. And you're going to see a little bit of margin push there on the U.S. side, but you're going to see expansion probably on the back half related to that shifting of spending. But again, it's back to the hours. We're putting the right amount of hours. The team keeps doing it, and you factor that. So I really just think you're seeing the impact of just the stewardship of Kathleen and her team managing that 2,500 hours on the U.S. side the best way they can and maximizing that with the impressions growth. And again, we've moderated on our Travel Channel hours, but I would -- I think I've been pretty consistent saying if Kathleen and her team start to see traction, and then we're driving the revenue, and Steve is out there selling it, you could see those hours start to be increased. But again, too early to call that. I think we're quite comfortable. But I think you're looking at -- when you look at our cost of sales, basically on the programming side, it's probably the largest quarter of the year, the second quarter.

We -- obviously, we do sell digitally. We sell digital impressions. I said we have 20% growth in our advertising revenue on the digital side for the U.S. And so there is a different pricing equation when it comes to our digital impressions, whether it's for flat content or video content. If you're talking about, essentially, the linear feed through TV Everywhere, through a digital delivery platform, Roku, all those things, Apple TV, Amazon Fire, or our own apps or our distributors' apps, if it's the linear feed, that pricing would be the same as the television network. If it's dynamic ad insertion post day 3, which we're seeing some growth in, that's priced as a digital buy, and so it’d have a different pricing components. So I guess the quick answer is that yes, there is a different equation when it comes to a pure digital buy. But because this is all evolving and what we hope will be more viewing of our linear networks through digital platforms, that would be rolled up into the standard television buy within C3. So it's a little bit complicated right now, but I hope that helps give you some idea of how we're looking at it."

Scripps Networks Interactive again delivered another quarter of strong operating performance. I could not be prouder of the great work our entire organization has produced so far this year. 
Just a quick review on the second quarter of 2016. Total operating revenues grew 22%. Consolidated advertising revenues grew 29%. Advertising revenues for the U.S. networks increased 9% and surpassed $0.5 billion this quarter for the first time ever. Consolidated adjusted segment profit increased 14%, and we closed a record broadcast upfront that puts the company in a great position for 2017. 
Now Burton and Lori will go into the details on the quarter in just a few minutes. But first, I want to highlight some of the results delivered by our strong brands. HGTV sustained its strong ratings performance and achieved the highest-rated second quarter in network history among all the key demographics. This strategy that we've implemented at Travel Channel continues to deliver sustained success with the network’s third consecutive quarter of primetime ratings growth. Travel Channel is a powerful brand with great growth potential, and we have exciting plans in place to build on this momentum. 
And TVN Group delivered another solid quarter with total market share up 3% over last year, solidifying their position as the leading network group in Poland. Our family of networks leads the way in lifestyle programming in the United States and around the world. They're really unmatched in the industry for the savvy, well-informed, upscale audiences that they deliver. The record advertising performance we reported today, and the record upfront we just closed, speak to our leadership in using lifestyle content to connect the advertisers with consumers. 
In the midst of ever-changing and expanded viewer options, our networks remain essential to distributors and deliver consistent performance and high-quality audiences that our distribution partners seek. The unique nature of our networks and the audiences they attract means that both our ratings and our impressions remain robust. We're active in the virtual MVPD space, talking with new and prospective entrants as we continue to expand our engagement with audiences on nontraditional linear services. 
We're also actively extending the reach of our popular TV content as well, with short-form originals on the various digital and mobile platforms. Burton will share some of the recent successes we've achieved with Scripps Lifestyle Studios in just a few moments. 
On the advertising side, as I mentioned, we recently concluded our upfront negotiations, and we're delighted with the results. I just want to say thanks to Steven Gigliotti, Jon Steinlauf and everyone in our sales organization for the incredible job they're doing. 
Advertisers are lining up like never before to secure their place in our entertaining and family-friendly programming, and that has resulted in a record-breaking year for that team. 
Our International segment continues to deliver impressive results. The teams are hard at work assessing and delivering on the wealth of opportunities available to our lifestyle brands around the world. Over the past several months, we've expanded our footprint in key markets across South America, Europe and Asia Pacific. 
For example, we've taken important steps toward the global rollout of HGTV, a key priority for Scripps Networks. In June, HGTV launched in New Zealand. Additionally, we believe there is substantial opportunity for HGTV in Europe. And I'll look forward to us making more announcements on that front in the coming months. 
TVN Group, Poland's leading multi-platform media business, continues to exceed even our own high expectations. Audience levels are climbing steadily, and revenues continues to grow. TVN has proven to be a transformative acquisition, converting our International Networks segment into a growing and profitable endeavor as it continues to break new ground developing and monetizing compelling original content for Polish audiences. 
Today, our International Networks, including our TVN portfolio, are distributed in more than 175 countries and territories around the world and broadcast in 29 languages, all on our way to 300 million cumulative subscribers. 
Scripps Networks Interactive continues to reach new heights. Couldn't be prouder of all we've accomplished so far in 2016, both at our networks in the United States and at our international networks. And we're really about the prospects for the remainder of the year, and the year ahead are just as positive, and we're very confident in the path ahead. 
Again, I want to thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. And with that, let me turn it over to Burton, who has additional details on second quarter results. Burton?"

We continue to perform at a high level and reached some significant milestones in the second quarter. Total day ratings for adults, 25 to 54 improved at every one of our 6 U.S. networks during the quarter. In addition, sales prime ratings were up at 5 of the 6 networks. This success story is built on strong, consistent networks that deliver on their promise to audiences day in and day out. This is not a hits-driven business, although we have plenty of those too. Our networks keep viewers watching at a high level through all day parts, and as a result, provide a must-have service to distributors and a must-spend environment to advertisers. 
At HGTV, it was the highest-rated second quarter ever among all key demographics and a third highest-rated quarter ever for sales prime. HGTV extended its leadership position as the #1 network for upscale women 25 to 54 in sales prime for nearly 10 consecutive years. In addition, viewership among the key millennials demographic grew 6% compared with 2015, driven by popular shows like Flip or Flop and Brother vs. Brother. 
At Food Network, our coviewing strategy continues to deliver. Coviewership reached its highest level in over 5 years, with shows like Cake Wars, Kids Barbecue Championship and Chopped Junior appealing to adults and kids alike. In addition, total day ratings for adults 25 to 54 were up 4% at Food Network in the quarter, thanks to a strategic shift in daytime program scheduling, coupled with new premieres like Cooks vs. Cons, over time we expect this to help boost primetime viewership too. 
Travel Channel is gaining momentum and reported its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sales prime ratings were up an impressive 11% among adults 25 to 54. Ratings grew in 6 out of 7 nights of the week, 4 of them by more than 20%. Additionally, time spent viewing on Travel Channel increased by more than 10 minutes, a testament to the moves we've made over the last few months. And our dive into summer programming, which concluded this past Sunday, was an absolute hit with viewers. The stunt helped drive double-digit increases in Sunday prime ratings over the full quarter. 
Travel Channel represents one of the most significant growth opportunities for the company, and its recent progress reinforces management view that we are advancing the network in the right direction. 
DIY Network had another very strong showing, delivering its most-watched quarter ever in sales prime among adults 25 to 54. Barnwood Builders and Vanilla Ice Project led the way with strong ratings. 
Cooking Channel also scored the highest-rated and most-watched quarter in its history for sales prime among adults and women 25 to 54. The network also set a new record for time spent viewing. 
Finally, Great American Country had its best quarter in almost 9 years, growing ratings by more than 50%. 
Our new Scripps Lifestyle Studios continues to pave the digital path for our company, and we saw many successes in the second quarter, including almost 20% growth in U.S. digital revenues. Total digital subscribers on Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat have grown 20% since January, while video views on our Facebook pages have increased 123%.
Food Network continues to show strong growth in demand in its online platforms, where it currently has more than 10 million fans on Facebook and more than 1 million subscribers on its Snapchat Discover channel. In addition, HGTV had a milestone in June, reaching 5 million fans on Facebook and 1 million followers on Instagram. 
Now during the quarter, we've shifted some organizational responsibilities in the digital group and brought all content, digital and linear, under the oversight of Chief Content Officer Kathleen Finch, as we seek to build audiences across all platforms. 
At our International Networks, the last several quarters have been especially exciting, as the company grows outside the United States. In Poland, TVN had another successful quarter. TVN's family of networks saw revenue growth in the mid-single digits in local currency compared with the prior year. As Ken mentioned, for the second quarter, TVN group saw its total commercial audience share increase 3%. Also, TVN, the broadcast channel, strengthened its #1 position in its key demographic, reaching 15% market share. TVN24 has maintained its leadership in Poland among news channels, while thematic networks TTV and TVN Fabula have substantially increased market share over the last 6 months. 
TVN is a great fit for our international portfolio. We couldn't be more pleased with the impressive results we’ve realized to date. We're also expanding into new markets. We recently announced the upcoming launch of HGTV for the first time in the EMEA region. The channel will debut in the Middle East and North Africa in November. And late last month, we announced our intent to introduce Food Network and Travel Channel to audiences in Israel for the first time, beginning in September. 
In the second quarter, UKTV achieved a 10% share of commercial impacts for the first time in its history and was the fastest-growing network group in the U.K.
2016 continues to set new records for the company. As we grow, we're redoubling our efforts to create an ever-deeper connection with our consumers across all of our brands. 
And now I'll turn it over to Lori, who will review the company's financial performance."

Since you've seen our results, we'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, and then open it up for Q&A.

Since you've seen our results, we'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, and then open it up for Q&A. 
Consolidated revenues in the second quarter totaled $893 million, an increase of 22% compared with the prior year. The growth was primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, coupled with ratings improvements and expansion of our international business through the acquisition of TVN last year. Consolidated adjustment segment profit increased 14%, fueled by the strong revenue growth during the second quarter and the inclusion of TVN. Consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 8% compared with the prior year. 
The improvement in adjusted EPS was primarily due to the improved operating performance, which was partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with the financing for the acquisition of TVN as well as the assumed debt of TVN, and lower equity and earnings of affiliates driven by the sale of our investment in FOX Sports South in the first quarter of 2016. 
At our U.S. Networks segment, revenues increased 5%, driven by strong advertising demand for our Lifestyle Network, partially offset by a decline in distribution revenues. 
For advertising revenues, increases in CPM pricing, coupled with ratings improvement, drove a 9% year-over-year increase in the second quarter. Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter, with CPMs up mid- to high teens year-over-year and up mid- to high 20% over the broadcast upfront. 
Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, automotive, home improvement and consumer packaged goods. These categories are consistent with the historical performance of the second quarter. 
As Ken mentioned earlier, our ad sales team achieved a record-setting upfront. We drove both rate and volume without using any additional inventory. We expect to achieve low double-digit price increases on the same amount of inventory as last year. The strength of scatter market has continued into the third quarter. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing is up mid- to high teens year-over-year and up high 20s over the calendar upfront. 
Industry subscriber declines and the previously disclosed onetime rate equalization of certain distributor agreements related to consolidation drove a 4% decrease in U.S. Networks' distribution revenues. The declines in rates and subscribers were partially offset by previously negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top broadband providers. 
During the second quarter, we finalized a long-term agreement with one of our biggest distributers, which resulted in a onetime true-up during the quarter. This does not impact our full year revenue outlook. Overall, we are extremely pleased with how the negotiations concluded. 
Looking forward, this deal, in combination with other previously negotiated deals, sets the company up for mid- to high single-digit rate growth in the future. 
On the expense side, cost of services for the U.S Networks increased 18%, as planned, in the second quarter, as a result of our continued investment in the quality and variety of programming on our network. 
We noted last quarter that we shifted some marketing and promotional expenses to later quarters. Due to the continued advertising strengths and ratings improvements, we were once again able to defer marketing expenses out of the second quarter. We still expect to spend these marketing dollars, but it will be later in the year.
Reflecting the increases in advertising revenues, mostly offset by increases in programming-related expenses, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. Networks increased 1%. 
International Networks' revenues increased significantly to $147 million from $22 million, due to the inclusion of TVN in the second quarter of 2016. TVN revenues grew by mid-single digits in local currency compared with the same time a year ago. 
International adjusted segment profit was $37 million compared with an adjusted segment loss of $10 million in the second quarter of 2015. This $47 million improvement is primarily due to the inclusion of TVN. 
As a reminder, TVN historically operates at higher margins in the second and fourth quarters and at lower margins in the first and third quarters. In addition to our consolidated results, we have international operations reported in our equity earnings. In total, equity in earnings of affiliates was $22 million, down 20% compared with the prior year. The decline is primarily related to the sale of our investment in FOX Sports South earlier this year. 
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the second quarter at approximately 2.9x gross leverage, down from 3.2 at the end of 2015. Also, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We plan to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our leverage and invest in M&A, both domestically and internationally. Given those goals, we did not buy back any shares during the quarter. 
Now for our 2016 full year guidance, which is based on consolidated company result. Grounded in the results we have seen to date, we are reiterating all of our previously issued guidance. And with that, we are ready for your questions."

And then relatively, in the past -- and I think, just now in your prepared remarks, you said that you expect distribution revenue growth to revert to mid- to high single-digit growth at least in the future. So I wonder if you could bridge for us the 4% decline in the 2Q with the expectation for mid- to high single-digit growth in the future. For example, what's the expectation for distribution revenue for the balance of the year? So why don't we start with those? And then I have a quick follow-up."

Just as we finalized agreements, you'll see some lumpiness in how we record things. But I think I would point again to our full year guidance, we're still on track. And as we look at the back half, I think it would be fair to say, as we continue to see the impact from equalization, that we would see maybe low single-digit declines as we go out of 2016. But as we look into 2017, we are quite encouraged based on the deals that we've done. And again, that's what I was referring to is that, with the agreements we've done, including the one that we just concluded, that we expect mid- to high-single digit price CAGRs for the foreseeable future. And these are fairly long contracts. So we think that our carriage has been secured as well as that we've gotten great price increases that are representative of the brands and the product that we bring to the distributors' bundles. And again, I think I would point to, we've had a great year, and I think the resounding success we've had in driving impressions is seen by distributors as well as, as they look at what to put in their bundles. So again, I think, again, we've been calling it's going to be a little bit of a choppy 2016, but we're feeling very good based on the agreements that we've struck, looking as we lap those in 2017 and beyond. Again, Anthony, and I would refer to our full year guidance to keep you guidance -- guardrails [ph]."

I think, on the ad front, based on the impressions growth, looking at how well we've done in the upfront, feeling very confident with the advertising. And in fact, I think, based on what's going on the industry, we're well positioned with the reliance that we have on driving advertising revenue. Again, I just spoke that we're going to lap this rate equalization. So again, on the price front, we're feeling very strong, and we continue to secure new subscribers and new shelf space across the landscape as well as look at what we can do on the Lifestyle Studios. As far as margins, we've been talking about programming. We've been moderating that. We saw some increases over the past few years as we ramped up our spending for Travel Channel. What we've always said is that has moderated. We have looked at across the portfolio. But if Kathleen and her team find something that's working and driving investment on the top line, we would make investment to that, because it is the best investment we can make overall as a company. But at that point on the U.S, I think we're very good stewards of our capital and of our expenses. So again, I think it's going to be a very good year, and we'll give you more on margins as we look at the -- coming out of our budget cycle. But I don't see any big speed bumps looking forward."

But what it is doing is creating a greater connection with our audience, particularly the younger audience, and we do believe and we do research in this so we have some degree of evidence that we are driving younger viewers in particular to be more connected to our television programming as well. In addition, just the kinds of shows that are being put on, in particular, outside of HGTV, Flip or Flop and Brother vs. Brother, certain kinds of programming attracts the millennial audience better than others, and so we tend to focus on that for some of our social convergent content as well. But you're right. It's a holistic approach. That's why we restructured ourselves in terms of our organization this past year to take advantage of that, and we’ll forge ahead to make more connections across more platforms in every way we possibly can and then monetize them in every way we can."

We’re must-have networks, especially if you plan on delivering an upscale women audience. And I don't know how you start with any business plan and say, ""We're not going to."" The fact -- and we talked about this on the calls many time is, it's two-edged sword that our distribution economics are where they are. We're an easy group of networks to be included in skinny bundles for all the obvious reasons. So my confidence couldn't be higher as we continue to have discussions, which we mentioned in our comments, even in the MVPD world. If anything, I'm probably more confident than I've ever been about the position of our networks, and going forward, I do think, as Lori alluded to, I think some of the smaller networks across the industry are to be under a little bit more pressure. But the good news for us is both DIY and Cooking are actually extensions of our big brands and bring some very important advertising slots to our distribution partners as well.

I think it's interesting to look -- if you look back at your Q1, I think scatter pricing was healthy, but low double digit is what you've cited. And in Q2, you just cited mid- to high teens scatter-over-scatter. So pricing’s actually better in Q2 than it was in Q1. Per our numbers, it looked like your audiences were up about the same amount in both Q1 and Q2 year-over-year, low single-digit number, and yet your domestic ad revenue was higher in Q1, like 14% growth versus 9% growth in Q2. So just something else must be going on if you had higher pricing, the same audiences, but lower revenue growth. So what are we missing? Is it mix? Is it something just about the mix Q2 versus Q1, something about sell out percentage? Any help you could do -- give us would be greatly appreciated."

Basically, our ad sales team is a great partner to our programming and marketing teams, and collectively, we just believe in our strength, and don't feel the need to expand the inventory that we sold in the upfront this year, and that's, as I said, been very consistent over a number of years because the performance of our networks has been so consistent."

So on the programming-only front, you’re probably going to see the largest impact this year -- but again, we've been talking about our overall investment on the portfolio, how that's moderated. It's a little bit of a leading indicator of what you'll see on the amortization. But again, the programming teams have to make the right scheduling decisions, which does have an impact. And yes, we did have an impact from changing our amort. But I think you're going to see that continue to moderate, and there'll be huge moderation when we look at the fourth quarter. In fact, with the marketing spend and programming, I think we've highlighted that we think Q3 is going to be where we continue to invest. And you're going to see a little bit of margin push there on the U.S. side, but you're going to see expansion probably on the back half related to that shifting of spending. But again, it's back to the hours. We're putting the right amount of hours. The team keeps doing it, and you factor that. So I really just think you're seeing the impact of just the stewardship of Kathleen and her team managing that 2,500 hours on the U.S. side the best way they can and maximizing that with the impressions growth. And again, we've moderated on our Travel Channel hours, but I would -- I think I've been pretty consistent saying if Kathleen and her team start to see traction, and then we're driving the revenue, and Steve is out there selling it, you could see those hours start to be increased. But again, too early to call that. I think we're quite comfortable. But I think you're looking at -- when you look at our cost of sales, basically on the programming side, it's probably the largest quarter of the year, the second quarter.

We -- obviously, we do sell digitally. We sell digital impressions. I said we have 20% growth in our advertising revenue on the digital side for the U.S. And so there is a different pricing equation when it comes to our digital impressions, whether it's for flat content or video content. If you're talking about, essentially, the linear feed through TV Everywhere, through a digital delivery platform, Roku, all those things, Apple TV, Amazon Fire, or our own apps or our distributors' apps, if it's the linear feed, that pricing would be the same as the television network. If it's dynamic ad insertion post day 3, which we're seeing some growth in, that's priced as a digital buy, and so it’d have a different pricing components. So I guess the quick answer is that yes, there is a different equation when it comes to a pure digital buy. But because this is all evolving and what we hope will be more viewing of our linear networks through digital platforms, that would be rolled up into the standard television buy within C3. So it's a little bit complicated right now, but I hope that helps give you some idea of how we're looking at it."

As always, we're happy you're able to be with us today. It's no exaggeration to say that Scripps Networks Interactive is really hitting a high mark. This year, we've successfully grown our ratings, our advertising and international revenues, our digital audiences and our international reach. We've done that by focusing on what we're good at and delivering consistent environments that consumers and advertisers love. This is sustainable growth, driven by the strength of our brands and our content, not driven by special events, sports or election coverage. We've also finalized long-term contracts with key distributors that secure significant carriage and mid- to high single-digit rate escalators into the early 2020s. Plus, we're included on new OTT platforms, enabling us to reach new audiences away from traditional linear TV services.
Now Burt and Lori will go into the details on the quarter shortly, but first, I'd like to take just a few minutes to speak about the broader strategy and our vision for growing the company. Over the last 22 years, we have built our business upon a number of key pillars. Number one, growing our brands and our audience; number two, maximizing how we monetize; number three, managing our costs wisely; number four, expanding our footprint into new markets; and number five, reaching new audiences on emerging platforms and services.
Looking at those one by one, we're seeing some significant traction in 2016. First, we have grown our brands. These brands, particularly HGTV, Food Network and increasingly, Travel Channel, remain powerhouse content brands, with unique appeal to consumers in both the United States and around the world. That appeal is clearly reflected in our results. In fact, in the United States, 5 of our 6 networks are up in sales prime year-to-date, an incredible achievement, given the competition from Olympics and the presidential election. Scripps Networks Interactive was the only network group whose impression gains were not driven by news during the 2015-2016 television season, a testament really to the enduring appeal of our content.
In the current media landscape, where consumers have more options than ever, strong brands win. We've worked tirelessly to develop remarkable brands with unique positioning. HGTV and Food Network are already must-have brands, and we're building another right now at Travel Channel. We've hit upon strong consistent programming that resonates with a growing high-income audience. As we intended, Travel Channel is becoming the go-to place for compelling travel entertainment.
And speaking of must-have brands, in the 2016 brand relevance index recently published by Profit, Food Network was recognized as a top 50 brand that consumers can't live without. In fact, Food Network ranked #36 and was the only cable or broadcast television brand to make the index. Pretty remarkable. The reason we're able to grow our networks, amid the current shifting macro environment, is that our audiences know that regardless of the time of day or day of week, they can find high-quality content on our networks. Our programming is inspiring, trustworthy and engaging, and consumers respond by tuning in and staying tuned.
Secondly, we maximized our monetization by delivering our advertisers the lucrative upscale audience they covet. Our environment is naturally optimized for advertisers. We inspire viewers to improve their lives, and our advertisers provide them with the messages and the tools to take action. Our advertising partners know that our brands consistently deliver and engage audiences better than anyone else in the industry, as revealed in the 2016 brand identity study by Beta Research. Not only do our viewers tune in to our quality programming, they watch the commercials. And importantly, they're inclined to buy what they see. When you create strong brands with must-have content like Fixer Upper or Chopped, you become increasingly essential to distributors. While increased consolidation in the distribution space makes negotiations more complex, our networks deliver clear value on both price and popularity.
Now as a result, we've successfully renegotiated important long-term deals, and we continue to enter future negotiations with confidence, thanks to the size and nature of our audience. And we're also seeing distributors looking to include our networks in their OTT and skinny bundle services, including the recently announced DIRECTV Now. Our brands are included on all the virtual MVPDs that have launched to date, and we're excited about how consumers are responding to those packages.
With one of the most loyal and consistent viewer basis in the media industry, our networks could be termed the ESPN for women. Just like ESPN, HGTV and Food Network are cornerstone brands that adults, but in particular women, tune to time and time again. In fact, according to Nielsen Research, viewers of HGTV and Food Network, especially women, tune in more times per week and stay tuned for longer periods of time than viewers of ESPN. So as you can expect, our networks deliver an outsized proportion of the value consumers derive from their TV packages. In short, our must-have lifestyle brands are essential to the consumer, which makes them invaluable to distributors and advertisers and allows us to maximize our monetization.
Now turning to cost management. Our track record on managing overhead, I think, speaks for itself. We've done a good job of investing in content, and that investment consistently generates revenue growth. As I've said before many times, creating great content is the best method to accumulate sustainable returns. But we also pay a lot of attention to our investment levels to ensure that we not only incur the cost to deliver the best possible return to our overall business, but it just continues to be a good investment. The uniqueness of our content, married to the fact that we fully own it, presents a tremendous value proposition. We take full advantage of our content across multiple platforms and geographies in a way that most other media companies cannot, helping drive deeper levels of monetization for every dollar of investment. A great example of this comes from our acquisition of Poland's leading media company, TVN. Already a strong business in its own right, our expertise in lifestyle enables us to secure greater value from the business through utilizing lifestyle content, formats and brands in the Polish market. We strive to be good cost stewards for the company, and managing our expenses effectively is a vital principle in our success.
Now beyond the United States, we have tremendous opportunity to grow our brands, and that leads me to the fourth pillar of growth, and that's to expand our global footprint. The last few years have been particularly exciting. Food Network has successfully expanded throughout Latin America, and for the first time recently, launched in Mexico. Just this past Friday, we announced additional distribution in Brazil, where Food Network is now available in nearly 7 million homes. The reception we've had in these new markets is highly encouraging. We're also making great strides towards the global rollout of HGTV, a top priority for our international team. This year, HGTV launched in New Zealand, increased distribution across Asia and just this past Wednesday, began airing in 24 countries across the Middle East and North Africa. Moreover, we'll launch HGTV in Poland next year. This will be HGTV's largest launch ever outside the United States. And needless to say, we're very excited. Additionally, we're working to increase our other brands' presence on the TVN platform over time. And speaking of TVN, it's been more than a year since we acquired the Polish media standout, and we've made good progress. The Polish economy is among the best in the region. And TVN, with its own robust broadcast, pay TV and DTT channels, along with our leading OTT service player, has exceeded our high expectations. TVN achieved 23% market share during the quarter, even against a strong competitive environment that included the Olympics and popular soccer broadcasts. While advertising in Poland has softened slightly in recent months, TVN continues to outperform the market in both ratings and in revenue growth. And we're also excited to launch Cooking Channel in Canada in partnership with Corus Entertainment. Cooking Channel, which is the perfect pairing to Food Network Canada, will be launching on December 12.
Lastly, emerging audiences and new distribution platforms bring scores of exciting opportunities, which our digital services are aiming to capitalize on. We want to reach consumers wherever and whenever they demand high-quality lifestyle content. And we're working to ensure that we reach the next generation of lifestyle enthusiasts and to create content that is purposefully designed for digital formats.
Since its launch late last year, Scripps Lifestyle Studios has driven a significant increase in our online and social media engagement and content creation. Burton's going to share some of our fantastic results coming out of the studios shortly.
We maintain the same vision that we always have, to inspire and inform the lifestyle categories that we dominate, whether the content is delivered through linear television, skinny or fat bundles, short-form digital video or TV Everywhere, that vision really does not change. But the ways in which we make that content come to life will evolve to stay ahead of consumer preferences, just like we've always done. In many ways, it feels as if the industry is merely moving towards a model that Scripps Networks Interactive is positioned to excel at. We own our own content, which means we're better able to exploit our programming across all platforms. We have a focused number of strong brands that really resonate with consumers and in an environment where powerful brands win. We have categories that are a perfect fit for advertisers. Our networks are focused on genres that lead themselves ideally to digital and mobile platforms. And we believe our model is ideally positioned to capitalize in this current marketplace. Our networks have come a long way since we introduced HGTV in 1994. We've become the unequivocal leaders in lifestyle programming. I believe we have the right plan and definitely the right team in place to continue to excel in this fast-paced media world.
I want to thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive.
And now let me turn it over to Burton, who has details on our third quarter results. Burton?"

I'm pleased to say that in the third quarter our strong operating performance continued. HGTV had another impressive quarter for ratings. It was the highest-rated third quarter ever among all key demographics, and it was the fourth highest-rated quarter in network history for sales, prime and total day. In addition, HGTV ranked as the #1 cable network among women 25 to 54. This is even more amazing, really, when you consider that we had the impact of the Olympics and the U.S. election during the quarter. Viewership among millennials continues to gain traction at HGTV. Sales prime for millennials improved 27% in September, driven in particular by the hit show, Flip or Flop: Selling Summer. This series was the #1 show on our networks among millennial viewers in the quarter. Food Network ranked #6 among women 25 to 54, improving on its prior year position for the quarter. Among millennials, Food Network was a top 10 network, driven by premiers of Cooks vs. Cons and top-performing show, Food Network Star. At Travel Channel, we continue to see the positive results from our programming investments. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter for year-over-year growth. Sales prime ratings were up 11% among adults 25 to 54, and impressions were up 5%.
A recent success was Travel Channel's 4-part special, Expedition Unknown: Hunt for the Yeti. The show ranked among the top 20 ad-supported cable shows for its time slot among adults 25 to 54 and generated ratings that were up 30% from the year-ago time slot. With more than 7 million viewers tuning into the series, Expedition Unknown: Hunt for the Yeti was one of Travel Channel's all-time top-performing shows for October.
Recently, we aired All-Star Halloween Spectacular, the first-ever programming simulcast between our big 3 networks. The special event brought together multiple network stars as they engaged in a Hollywood-themed adventure, all for the benefit of charity. Our strategy was to leverage the scale of each brand in an innovative way. We had more than 5 million viewers across the 3 networks watch the simulcast. And given the level of success, we expect to do more programming that takes advantage of the broad reach of our combined networks and digital footprints.
At DIY Network, the third quarter now ranks as the highest-rated and most-watched third quarter ever. Sales prime ratings increased 17% for adults 25 to 54 and 22% for women 25 to 54 versus a year ago.
Cooking Channel scored its highest-rated and most-watched quarter in the network's history for sales prime among both adults and women 25 to 54. And finally, Great American Country continued its double-digit growth, improving 29% for ratings and 24% for impressions versus the prior year.
At Scripps Lifestyle Studios, our growth continues to hit new and exciting levels. Scripps Lifestyle Studios achieved approximately 1.5 billion video views across all our digital platforms, which include our owned and operated websites, social networks and TV Everywhere. This represents a 50% improvement over the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, our digital teams published more than 1,200 new content videos. Scripps Lifestyle Studios averaged 250 million unique visitors monthly on all of our digital platforms during the quarter. I'm pleased to say that for October, we exceeded that impressive pace and had more than 350 million unique visitors on all of our digital platforms.
In October, Tubular Labs, a leading social video measurement company, ranked Food Network #2 for social videos in the food category, behind only BuzzFeed's Tasty. Food Network received more than 745 million video views last month. And at the fourth annual Cynopsis Digital Model D Awards, which honor the best in online video content, Food Network won the award for Best Social Media Campaign for its use of Facebook and the award for Best Web Video for its feature on Square Deviled Eggs. All 3 of our big networks received multiple honorable mentions at the awards ceremony, a testament to the incredibly creative content our digital teams are producing.
Now on TV Everywhere, the platform is showing signs of growth, with 19.3 million views in the third quarter. We're pleased with the progress we've made with TV Everywhere usage, and we hope to see even more. Overall, it was a successful quarter with some remarkable results for Scripps Lifestyle Studios.
Finally, we assessed and analyzed the SVOD universe and have made the strategic decision not to extend our SVOD agreement with Netflix past the end of this year. In the end, it really is not the kind of dual revenue model that best monetizes our content over the long term.
Now turning to our International Networks. The last several quarters have been especially exciting as the company continues to grow. July marked 1 year since we finalized our acquisition of TVN. The Polish network group delivered another successful quarter, with revenues growing mid-single digits in local currency compared with the prior year. Ratings for the network group increased 3% for the target audience. In fact, TVN was the only major network group in Poland to increase market share in the quarter. With 23% market share, TVN has solidly established its leadership position among all the network groups in Poland. We couldn't be more excited to bring HGTV to Polish audiences next year. As Ken mentioned, expanding HGTV globally is a key goal for the company. Our central European location provides a great launching pad for our expansion plans and growth on the continent. For example, TVN will begin to manage the Food Network and Travel Channel brands in Poland to help drive programming production opportunities and operating efficiencies. Previously, the international team in London managed these networks. Integrating our lifestyle brands into TVN was a primary objective that we hoped to accomplish when we initially explored the acquisition.
At UKTV, share of commercial impact was 10% in the quarter, another all-time high for the network group. UKTV Networks' Dave and Drama continue to dominate as the #1 and #2 nonpublic service broadcast networks in the country, helping extend UKTV's leadership position in the U.K.
2016 continues to be a fantastic year for our company. We're optimistic about the wealth of growth opportunities available for our lifestyle content, both in the United States and internationally.
And now, I'll turn it over to Lori, who will review the company's financial performance."
6469353,404662266,1078109,"Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2016",2016-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Burton. Good morning, everyone.This morning, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, provide some comments on guidance and then open it up for Q&A.Consolidated revenues in the third quarter totaled $803 millio",826,"Thanks, Burton. Good morning, everyone.
This morning, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, provide some comments on guidance and then open it up for Q&A.
Consolidated revenues in the third quarter totaled $803 million, an increase of 3.5% compared with the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, coupled with overall ratings and impressions growth and increases in our international business. In line with our expectations coming into the quarter, consolidated adjusted segment profit decreased 2%, primarily due to the increase in programming costs, partially offset by the advertising and international revenue growth.
Consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% compared with the prior year, primarily due to a reduction of interest expense as we deleveraged and gains on foreign currency transactions. These items were partially offset by a decrease in adjusted segment profit and a reduction of equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily related to the sale of our investment in Fox Sports South in the first quarter of 2016.
At our U.S. Networks segment, revenues grew 4%, driven by strong advertising demand for our Lifestyle Networks, partially offset by the expected and temporary decline in distribution revenues. For advertising revenues, increases in CPM pricing, coupled with ratings improvement, drove a 7% year-over-year increase in the third quarter. Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter with CPM high teens year-over-year and up mid to high 20% over the broadcast upfront. Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, automotive and financial. These categories are consistent with the historical performance of the third quarter. The strength of the scatter continued into the fourth quarter, scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing is up mid to high teens year-over-year and up high teens to mid-20s over the broadcast upfront. As a result of the rate equalization impacting 2016, coupled with industry subscriber declines, distribution revenues for U.S. Networks decreased 2.5%. The declines in rates and subscribers were partially offset by negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top broadband providers. 
On the expense side, as a result of the plan difference in the timing of programming premieres between 2016 and 2015, cost of services for the U.S. Networks increased 13% in the third quarter. However, programming expense cost is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2016 as we will premiere fewer programs compared with the prior year. 
We noted in previous quarters that we've shifted some marketing and commercial expenses to later in the year due to the continued advertising strengths and ratings improvements, we were once again able to defer market expenses out of the third quarter. As a result, we expect to realize a significant increase in marketing and promotion expense in the fourth quarter. Reflecting the increase in advertising revenues, offset by the decrease in distribution revenues and an increase in programming-related expenses, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. Networks declined 1%. 
International Networks revenue increased 4% to $123 million on a reported basis. However, the majority of international revenues are generated by TVN. And in local currency, the revenues increased 6% compared with the same time a year ago. 
International adjusted segment profit increased 31% to $15 million compared with the third quarter of 2015. This improvement reflects the increase in revenues as well as operating efficiencies from the ongoing rationalization of our international support structure. 
In addition to our consolidated operating results and our equity earnings, including certain remaining U.S. minority interest, are our unconsolidated international operations. These include UKTV, Food Network, HGTV and DIY Network in Canada and some TVN minority investment. These international properties now comprise the majority of our equity income. In total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $8.5 million, down from $23 million in the prior year. The decline is primarily related to the sale of our investment in FOX Sports South earlier this year and the timing of revenue recognition at certain minority investments. 
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the third quarter with approximately 2.8x gross leverage, down from 3.2x at the end of 2015. Based on the expected retirement of debt in the fourth quarter, we should end the year at approximately 2.5x gross leverage. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We plan to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our leverage and invest in M&A both domestically and internationally. Given those goals, we did not buy back any shares during the quarter. 
Looking at guidance for the remainder of 2016. We are reiterating all of our previously issued guidance. And in line with past practice, we will address 2017 on our next earnings call. We feel positive about the trends we are seeing and how the business is positioned, including our ability to grow revenue, adjusted segment profit and free cash flow. 
And with that, we will open up the call for your questions."

The number of hours at Travel Channel has grown as a result. That's purposeful. It isn't where Food and HGTV are in terms of the number of hours. That's also purposeful. We don't want to get ahead of itself. We do think we're reaching a level where the growth in our programming spending is going to moderate year to year. We won't see it grow at the same rate. That said, we always say internally and externally, if we find a hit on Travel Channel that we can produce in quantity that we know will result in higher ratings and therefore higher ad revenue, we'll make that investment in programming.

Our universe assumptions aren't any better than anyone else's, but I would say, looking at what experiencing this year probably a good proxy for that. So we're net 1% to 2% on our core network. That's probably a reasonable estimate going forward. I think digital networks are a little bit higher, just based on the skinny bundles and what's happening there. But again, I think what's more important as we turn the quarter, we're going to go see -- quarter -- year-over-year quarter declines to where we're going to see growth again.

The digital tier networks, they were designed to be in digital tiers from the get-go, many, many years ago in the case of [indiscernible] for example.

We're very, very happy with it, too, considering that we just launched the Scripps Lifestyle Studios less than a year ago. The quick answer is, it depends. So on TV Everywhere, of course, within C3, that's the standard mix of our television advertising. That's included on the linear network in the C3 ratings. When it comes to dynamic ad insertions, insertion on video, typically, CPMs are higher. Of course, the volume that you need is much greater, which is why the actual revenue numbers are smaller. So that said, this is why we're making this push. We want to have a huge amount of growth in the viewing of our short-form digital video content. Our ad sales team is confident they can monetize, but we started this concerted effort less than a year ago. And we're very happy with the results we've seen so far, but we're going to keep watching it in 2017. As far as younger goes, that also depends. It depends on the platform, on Snapchat, much, much younger for our Food Network content. On our owned and operated websites and apps, for example, that's a little more consistent with our network median age, a bit younger, though, overall. And then social media, it's kind of a mix, but generally speaking, it is younger."

It's a question I think I've been getting for 20-some years. It's about the quality of the brands. I mean, we're perfectly happy sitting here domestically with 6 brands that are performing very well. You heard 5 of the 6 are up in impressions and in ratings. I don't know what else you can do to send a message to distributors and advertises than success. And so whether you have 6 channels, 20 channels, it's about quality, and it's about the ability to come to the table and offer brands that are relevant and valuable to our distribution partners. And again, I think you're hearing today, in all of these skinny bundles, and looking to 2017, which we're look -- we'll see some increased distribution growth in revenue and subscription revenue, yes, we're big enough. Look, expect to continue to be a consolidated world, but that's been the case for the past 15 years. We've seen consolidation on the cable distribution side. It's just now this getting to be some heft. But I think, for example, if I may, we have -- we have a comment on M&A, but the one takeaway from the AT&T-Time Warner announcement is content is valuable, and it's going to continue to be more valuable if it's quality and original and this great storytelling, and in our opinion, it's a lifestyle targeted.

Also, to your point, it is more in the tools that our ad sales teams have to sell. So sometimes, these teams are being sold as part of a typical linear deal, so you may not see all the value actually being allocated to digital. I think we have to be very careful. In fact, I'm a little nervous about digital numbers as we go into the future. Because I think its way to become so integrated that it's really internal allocation how you're doing this. But we do know that they're imported and other helping to drive. And without these things, that would not be a good position for us to be in long term.

As always, we're happy you're able to be with us today. It's no exaggeration to say that Scripps Networks Interactive is really hitting a high mark. This year, we've successfully grown our ratings, our advertising and international revenues, our digital audiences and our international reach. We've done that by focusing on what we're good at and delivering consistent environments that consumers and advertisers love. This is sustainable growth, driven by the strength of our brands and our content, not driven by special events, sports or election coverage. We've also finalized long-term contracts with key distributors that secure significant carriage and mid- to high single-digit rate escalators into the early 2020s. Plus, we're included on new OTT platforms, enabling us to reach new audiences away from traditional linear TV services.
Now Burt and Lori will go into the details on the quarter shortly, but first, I'd like to take just a few minutes to speak about the broader strategy and our vision for growing the company. Over the last 22 years, we have built our business upon a number of key pillars. Number one, growing our brands and our audience; number two, maximizing how we monetize; number three, managing our costs wisely; number four, expanding our footprint into new markets; and number five, reaching new audiences on emerging platforms and services.
Looking at those one by one, we're seeing some significant traction in 2016. First, we have grown our brands. These brands, particularly HGTV, Food Network and increasingly, Travel Channel, remain powerhouse content brands, with unique appeal to consumers in both the United States and around the world. That appeal is clearly reflected in our results. In fact, in the United States, 5 of our 6 networks are up in sales prime year-to-date, an incredible achievement, given the competition from Olympics and the presidential election. Scripps Networks Interactive was the only network group whose impression gains were not driven by news during the 2015-2016 television season, a testament really to the enduring appeal of our content.
In the current media landscape, where consumers have more options than ever, strong brands win. We've worked tirelessly to develop remarkable brands with unique positioning. HGTV and Food Network are already must-have brands, and we're building another right now at Travel Channel. We've hit upon strong consistent programming that resonates with a growing high-income audience. As we intended, Travel Channel is becoming the go-to place for compelling travel entertainment.
And speaking of must-have brands, in the 2016 brand relevance index recently published by Profit, Food Network was recognized as a top 50 brand that consumers can't live without. In fact, Food Network ranked #36 and was the only cable or broadcast television brand to make the index. Pretty remarkable. The reason we're able to grow our networks, amid the current shifting macro environment, is that our audiences know that regardless of the time of day or day of week, they can find high-quality content on our networks. Our programming is inspiring, trustworthy and engaging, and consumers respond by tuning in and staying tuned.
Secondly, we maximized our monetization by delivering our advertisers the lucrative upscale audience they covet. Our environment is naturally optimized for advertisers. We inspire viewers to improve their lives, and our advertisers provide them with the messages and the tools to take action. Our advertising partners know that our brands consistently deliver and engage audiences better than anyone else in the industry, as revealed in the 2016 brand identity study by Beta Research. Not only do our viewers tune in to our quality programming, they watch the commercials. And importantly, they're inclined to buy what they see. When you create strong brands with must-have content like Fixer Upper or Chopped, you become increasingly essential to distributors. While increased consolidation in the distribution space makes negotiations more complex, our networks deliver clear value on both price and popularity.
Now as a result, we've successfully renegotiated important long-term deals, and we continue to enter future negotiations with confidence, thanks to the size and nature of our audience. And we're also seeing distributors looking to include our networks in their OTT and skinny bundle services, including the recently announced DIRECTV Now. Our brands are included on all the virtual MVPDs that have launched to date, and we're excited about how consumers are responding to those packages.
With one of the most loyal and consistent viewer basis in the media industry, our networks could be termed the ESPN for women. Just like ESPN, HGTV and Food Network are cornerstone brands that adults, but in particular women, tune to time and time again. In fact, according to Nielsen Research, viewers of HGTV and Food Network, especially women, tune in more times per week and stay tuned for longer periods of time than viewers of ESPN. So as you can expect, our networks deliver an outsized proportion of the value consumers derive from their TV packages. In short, our must-have lifestyle brands are essential to the consumer, which makes them invaluable to distributors and advertisers and allows us to maximize our monetization.
Now turning to cost management. Our track record on managing overhead, I think, speaks for itself. We've done a good job of investing in content, and that investment consistently generates revenue growth. As I've said before many times, creating great content is the best method to accumulate sustainable returns. But we also pay a lot of attention to our investment levels to ensure that we not only incur the cost to deliver the best possible return to our overall business, but it just continues to be a good investment. The uniqueness of our content, married to the fact that we fully own it, presents a tremendous value proposition. We take full advantage of our content across multiple platforms and geographies in a way that most other media companies cannot, helping drive deeper levels of monetization for every dollar of investment. A great example of this comes from our acquisition of Poland's leading media company, TVN. Already a strong business in its own right, our expertise in lifestyle enables us to secure greater value from the business through utilizing lifestyle content, formats and brands in the Polish market. We strive to be good cost stewards for the company, and managing our expenses effectively is a vital principle in our success.
Now beyond the United States, we have tremendous opportunity to grow our brands, and that leads me to the fourth pillar of growth, and that's to expand our global footprint. The last few years have been particularly exciting. Food Network has successfully expanded throughout Latin America, and for the first time recently, launched in Mexico. Just this past Friday, we announced additional distribution in Brazil, where Food Network is now available in nearly 7 million homes. The reception we've had in these new markets is highly encouraging. We're also making great strides towards the global rollout of HGTV, a top priority for our international team. This year, HGTV launched in New Zealand, increased distribution across Asia and just this past Wednesday, began airing in 24 countries across the Middle East and North Africa. Moreover, we'll launch HGTV in Poland next year. This will be HGTV's largest launch ever outside the United States. And needless to say, we're very excited. Additionally, we're working to increase our other brands' presence on the TVN platform over time. And speaking of TVN, it's been more than a year since we acquired the Polish media standout, and we've made good progress. The Polish economy is among the best in the region. And TVN, with its own robust broadcast, pay TV and DTT channels, along with our leading OTT service player, has exceeded our high expectations. TVN achieved 23% market share during the quarter, even against a strong competitive environment that included the Olympics and popular soccer broadcasts. While advertising in Poland has softened slightly in recent months, TVN continues to outperform the market in both ratings and in revenue growth. And we're also excited to launch Cooking Channel in Canada in partnership with Corus Entertainment. Cooking Channel, which is the perfect pairing to Food Network Canada, will be launching on December 12.
Lastly, emerging audiences and new distribution platforms bring scores of exciting opportunities, which our digital services are aiming to capitalize on. We want to reach consumers wherever and whenever they demand high-quality lifestyle content. And we're working to ensure that we reach the next generation of lifestyle enthusiasts and to create content that is purposefully designed for digital formats.
Since its launch late last year, Scripps Lifestyle Studios has driven a significant increase in our online and social media engagement and content creation. Burton's going to share some of our fantastic results coming out of the studios shortly.
We maintain the same vision that we always have, to inspire and inform the lifestyle categories that we dominate, whether the content is delivered through linear television, skinny or fat bundles, short-form digital video or TV Everywhere, that vision really does not change. But the ways in which we make that content come to life will evolve to stay ahead of consumer preferences, just like we've always done. In many ways, it feels as if the industry is merely moving towards a model that Scripps Networks Interactive is positioned to excel at. We own our own content, which means we're better able to exploit our programming across all platforms. We have a focused number of strong brands that really resonate with consumers and in an environment where powerful brands win. We have categories that are a perfect fit for advertisers. Our networks are focused on genres that lead themselves ideally to digital and mobile platforms. And we believe our model is ideally positioned to capitalize in this current marketplace. Our networks have come a long way since we introduced HGTV in 1994. We've become the unequivocal leaders in lifestyle programming. I believe we have the right plan and definitely the right team in place to continue to excel in this fast-paced media world.
I want to thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive.
And now let me turn it over to Burton, who has details on our third quarter results. Burton?"

I'm pleased to say that in the third quarter our strong operating performance continued. HGTV had another impressive quarter for ratings. It was the highest-rated third quarter ever among all key demographics, and it was the fourth highest-rated quarter in network history for sales, prime and total day. In addition, HGTV ranked as the #1 cable network among women 25 to 54. This is even more amazing, really, when you consider that we had the impact of the Olympics and the U.S. election during the quarter. Viewership among millennials continues to gain traction at HGTV. Sales prime for millennials improved 27% in September, driven in particular by the hit show, Flip or Flop: Selling Summer. This series was the #1 show on our networks among millennial viewers in the quarter. Food Network ranked #6 among women 25 to 54, improving on its prior year position for the quarter. Among millennials, Food Network was a top 10 network, driven by premiers of Cooks vs. Cons and top-performing show, Food Network Star. At Travel Channel, we continue to see the positive results from our programming investments. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter for year-over-year growth. Sales prime ratings were up 11% among adults 25 to 54, and impressions were up 5%.
A recent success was Travel Channel's 4-part special, Expedition Unknown: Hunt for the Yeti. The show ranked among the top 20 ad-supported cable shows for its time slot among adults 25 to 54 and generated ratings that were up 30% from the year-ago time slot. With more than 7 million viewers tuning into the series, Expedition Unknown: Hunt for the Yeti was one of Travel Channel's all-time top-performing shows for October.
Recently, we aired All-Star Halloween Spectacular, the first-ever programming simulcast between our big 3 networks. The special event brought together multiple network stars as they engaged in a Hollywood-themed adventure, all for the benefit of charity. Our strategy was to leverage the scale of each brand in an innovative way. We had more than 5 million viewers across the 3 networks watch the simulcast. And given the level of success, we expect to do more programming that takes advantage of the broad reach of our combined networks and digital footprints.
At DIY Network, the third quarter now ranks as the highest-rated and most-watched third quarter ever. Sales prime ratings increased 17% for adults 25 to 54 and 22% for women 25 to 54 versus a year ago.
Cooking Channel scored its highest-rated and most-watched quarter in the network's history for sales prime among both adults and women 25 to 54. And finally, Great American Country continued its double-digit growth, improving 29% for ratings and 24% for impressions versus the prior year.
At Scripps Lifestyle Studios, our growth continues to hit new and exciting levels. Scripps Lifestyle Studios achieved approximately 1.5 billion video views across all our digital platforms, which include our owned and operated websites, social networks and TV Everywhere. This represents a 50% improvement over the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, our digital teams published more than 1,200 new content videos. Scripps Lifestyle Studios averaged 250 million unique visitors monthly on all of our digital platforms during the quarter. I'm pleased to say that for October, we exceeded that impressive pace and had more than 350 million unique visitors on all of our digital platforms.
In October, Tubular Labs, a leading social video measurement company, ranked Food Network #2 for social videos in the food category, behind only BuzzFeed's Tasty. Food Network received more than 745 million video views last month. And at the fourth annual Cynopsis Digital Model D Awards, which honor the best in online video content, Food Network won the award for Best Social Media Campaign for its use of Facebook and the award for Best Web Video for its feature on Square Deviled Eggs. All 3 of our big networks received multiple honorable mentions at the awards ceremony, a testament to the incredibly creative content our digital teams are producing.
Now on TV Everywhere, the platform is showing signs of growth, with 19.3 million views in the third quarter. We're pleased with the progress we've made with TV Everywhere usage, and we hope to see even more. Overall, it was a successful quarter with some remarkable results for Scripps Lifestyle Studios.
Finally, we assessed and analyzed the SVOD universe and have made the strategic decision not to extend our SVOD agreement with Netflix past the end of this year. In the end, it really is not the kind of dual revenue model that best monetizes our content over the long term.
Now turning to our International Networks. The last several quarters have been especially exciting as the company continues to grow. July marked 1 year since we finalized our acquisition of TVN. The Polish network group delivered another successful quarter, with revenues growing mid-single digits in local currency compared with the prior year. Ratings for the network group increased 3% for the target audience. In fact, TVN was the only major network group in Poland to increase market share in the quarter. With 23% market share, TVN has solidly established its leadership position among all the network groups in Poland. We couldn't be more excited to bring HGTV to Polish audiences next year. As Ken mentioned, expanding HGTV globally is a key goal for the company. Our central European location provides a great launching pad for our expansion plans and growth on the continent. For example, TVN will begin to manage the Food Network and Travel Channel brands in Poland to help drive programming production opportunities and operating efficiencies. Previously, the international team in London managed these networks. Integrating our lifestyle brands into TVN was a primary objective that we hoped to accomplish when we initially explored the acquisition.
At UKTV, share of commercial impact was 10% in the quarter, another all-time high for the network group. UKTV Networks' Dave and Drama continue to dominate as the #1 and #2 nonpublic service broadcast networks in the country, helping extend UKTV's leadership position in the U.K.
2016 continues to be a fantastic year for our company. We're optimistic about the wealth of growth opportunities available for our lifestyle content, both in the United States and internationally.
And now, I'll turn it over to Lori, who will review the company's financial performance."
6469353,404662266,1078361,"Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2016",2016-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Burton. Good morning, everyone.This morning, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, provide some comments on guidance and then open it up for Q&A.Consolidated revenues in the third quarter totaled $803 millio",826,"Thanks, Burton. Good morning, everyone.
This morning, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, provide some comments on guidance and then open it up for Q&A.
Consolidated revenues in the third quarter totaled $803 million, an increase of 3.5% compared with the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, coupled with overall ratings and impressions growth and increases in our international business. In line with our expectations coming into the quarter, consolidated adjusted segment profit decreased 2%, primarily due to the increase in programming costs, partially offset by the advertising and international revenue growth.
Consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% compared with the prior year, primarily due to a reduction of interest expense as we deleveraged and gains on foreign currency transactions. These items were partially offset by a decrease in adjusted segment profit and a reduction of equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily related to the sale of our investment in Fox Sports South in the first quarter of 2016.
At our U.S. Networks segment, revenues grew 4%, driven by strong advertising demand for our lifestyle networks, partially offset by the expected and temporary decline in distribution revenues. For advertising revenues, increases in CPM pricing, coupled with ratings improvement, drove a 7% year-over-year increase in the third quarter. Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter, with CPM high teens year-over-year and up mid to high 20% over the broadcast upfront. Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, automotive and financial. These categories are consistent with the historical performance of the third quarter. The strength of the scatter continued into the fourth quarter, scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing is up mid- to high teens year-over-year and up high teens to mid-20s over the broadcast upfront.
As a result of the rate equalization impacting 2016 coupled with industry subscriber declines, distribution revenues for U.S. Networks decreased 2.5%. The declines in rates and subscribers were partially offset by negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top broadband providers.
On the expense side. As a result of the planned difference in the timing of programming premieres between 2016 and 2015, cost of services for the U.S. Networks increased 13% in the third quarter. However, programming expense growth is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2016 as we will premiere fewer programs compared with the prior year.
We noted in previous quarters that we've shifted some marketing and promotional expenses to later in the year. Due to the continued advertising strength and ratings improvements, we were once again able to defer market expenses out of the third quarter. As a result, we expect to realize a significant increase in marketing and promotion expense in the fourth quarter. Reflecting the increase in advertising revenues offset by the decrease in distribution revenues and an increase in programming-related expenses, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. Networks declined 1%.
International Networks revenue increased 4% to $123 million on a reported basis. However, the majority of international revenues are generated by TVN. And in local currency, the revenues increased 6% compared with the same time a year ago.
International adjusted segment profit increased 31% to $15 million compared with the third quarter of 2015. This improvement reflects the increase in revenues as well as operating efficiencies from the ongoing rationalization of our international support structure.
In addition to our consolidated operating results and our equity earnings, including certain remaining U.S. minority interests, are our unconsolidated international operations. These include UKTV, Food Network, HGTV and DIY Network in Canada and some TVN minority investments. These international properties now comprise the majority of our equity income. In total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $8.5 million, down from $23 million in the prior year. The decline is primarily related to the sale of our investment in Fox Sports South earlier this year and the timing of revenue recognition at certain minority investments.
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the third quarter a approximately 2.8x gross leverage, down from 3.2x at the end of 2015. Based on the expected retirement of debt in the fourth quarter, we should end the year at approximately 2.5x gross leverage. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We plan to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our leverage and invest in M&A, both domestically and internationally. Given those goals, we did not buy back any shares during the quarter.
Looking at guidance for the remainder of 2016. We are reiterating all of our previously issued guidance. And in line with past practice, we will address 2017 on our next earnings call. We feel positive about the trends we are seeing and how the business is positioned, including our ability to grow revenue, adjusted segment profit and free cash flow. 
And with that, we will open up the call for your questions."

They've continued into this year, and our programming team is developing even more. We did talk about growing our programming investment there for exactly this reason. The number of hours at Travel Channel has grown as a result. That's purposeful. It isn't where Food and HGTV are in terms of the number of hours. That's also purposeful. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We do think we're reaching a level where the growth in our programming spending is going to moderate year to year. We won't see it grow at the same rate. That said, we always say internally and externally, if we find a hit on Travel Channel that we can produce in quantity that we know will result in higher ratings and therefore, higher ad revenue, we'll make that investment in programming. So I think your basic assessment is correct. Moderation in that growth rate, but we're clearly, clearly seeing the investment there pay off."

Well, Anthony, I think, again, you very well-articulated what we've said previously that we are expecting, based on past negotiations and even those that we're continuing to go through, that on the rate side, that we're going to be at that mid- to high single-digit price CAGRs, so the drag will be the subscriber assumptions there. Our universe assumptions aren't any better than anyone else's, but I would say, looking at what you're experiencing this year is probably a good proxy for that. So we're net 1% to 2% on our core network. That's probably a reasonable estimate going forward. I think digital networks are a little bit higher, just based on the skinny bundles and what's happening there. But again, I think what's more important as we turn the corner, we're going to go from seeing year-over -- quarter -- year-over-year quarter declines to where we're going to see growth again. So looking forward, I think 2017 is going to be a much more positive story on the distribution front here at SNI."

The bigger-picture question is, are the better economics that you're getting on the 3 flagship fully distributed networks offsetting the contraction in distribution that you're witnessing for the noncore networks?"

I think, basically, what we've said all along about the distribution of our 3 fully distributed networks holds when it comes to new distribution opportunities. These are designed to be included in the most distributed packages on all of these virtual MVPDs and OTT services. That's what we've negotiated for. We continue to do that in talks with any new player coming in. And actually, that's what we've achieved. The digital tier networks, they were designed to be on digital tiers from the get-go, many, many years ago in the case of DIY, for example. And the way that our monetization works, they can be on digital tiers and still allow us to do just fine. Lori, did you want to add something on that?"

What you're seeing is the impact primarily of consolidation impacting those networks as well as migration, where we had quite a sweet deal with the U-verse deal as those subscribers migrate off.

We're very, very happy with it, too, considering that we just launched the Scripps Lifestyle Studios less than a year ago. The quick answer is, it depends. So on TV Everywhere, of course, within C3, that's the standard mix of our television advertising. That's included on the linear network in the C3 ratings. When it comes to dynamic ad insertions, insertion on video, typically, CPMs are higher. Of course, the volume that you need is much greater, which is why the actual revenue numbers are smaller. So that said, this is why we're making this push. We want to have a huge amount of growth in the viewing of our short-form digital video content. Our ad sales team is confident they can monetize, but we started this concerted effort less than a year ago. And we're very happy with the results we've seen so far, but we're going to keep watching it in 2017. As far as younger goes, that also depends.

So as you hear numbers that we're probably talking about in the digital studio, short-form video, et cetera, it's just giving our ad sales team more and more information about how to deal with this, how to go to advertisers, how to go to our clients. And let's be honest, at the end of the day, there's still a question about how, in some cases, digital is really ""working?"" Is it ringing the cash register? But the important thing is for a linear television company to be in the early-stage development and be in these discussions and be in these sales pitches makes a lot of sense. And just for Thanksgiving, I'm going to send you the Square Deviled Egg Video because I know you'll use it."

It's a question, I think, I've been getting for 20-some years. It's about the quality of the brands. I mean, we're perfectly happy sitting here domestically with 6 brands that are performing very well. You heard 5 of the 6 are up in impressions and in ratings. I don't know what else you can do to send a message to distributors and advertises than success. And so whether you have 6 channels, 20 channels, it's about quality, and it's about the ability to come to the table and offer brands that are relevant and valuable to our distribution partners. And again, I think you're hearing today in all of the skinny bundles and looking to 2017, which we're look -- we'll see some increased distribution growth in subscription revenue. Yes, we're big enough. It -- look, it's going to continue to be a consolidated world, but that's been the case for the past 15 years. We've seen consolidation on the cable distribution side. It's just now there's getting to be some heft. But I think, for example, if I may, I wouldn't -- we never comment on M&A, but the one takeaway from the AT&T and Time Warner announcement is content is valuable, and it's going to continue to be more valuable if it's quality and original and there's great storytelling, and in our opinion, it's lifestyle targeted. So long-winded answer to say, yes, we're in good shape, and I wouldn't trade our position with anybody else right now."

So as Lori said, sitting around the table and being minority investors in companies that are truly targeting millennials and allowing us to, if you will, learn along with them, I think, is invaluable 5 years down the road.

Burton, the one that I caught on to, correct me if I heard this wrong, I think you said 1.5 billion digital -- maybe that was views? You can correct me if I picked up the wrong stat you said there, but I'm sure that's a lot of growth. It's a big number. So my question is this, how does that relate to the 36 million or so of, I guess, advertising revenue that you report as -- from your digital businesses? Are those sort of -- both mapped to the same thing? Or is there other revenue in other places that maps there? And if they are the same thing, is there anything wrong with just doing the math of dividing 1.5 billion views by $36 million of revenue?

That number was close to nothing in terms of video views a year ago, so it is a remarkable increase. It's extremely purposeful. We set ourselves a task. If you go back to our call year ago, I think we did first talk about launching the Scripps Lifestyle Studios because we saw an opportunity here. We are -- 1.5 billion sounds like a lot, but it's not anywhere near where we want to be, to be honest, because of the math. You need a lot of views, even at a high CPM, and I'm going to let Lori comment if she wants to on your calculation, and so we've still got a ways to go, but we've made a good start."

But I would also point out that, again, and Ken made this point earlier, that some of this is more R&D as we learned. A lot of times, the views come ahead of the monetization. So again, I think as we go into 2017, we'll continue to ramp this up and continue to see more monetization tied to the engagement that we're driving. Also, to your point, it is more in the -- more of the tools that our ad sales teams can go out and sell. So sometimes, these things are being sold as part of a typical linear deal, so you may not see all the value actually being allocated to digital. So I think we have to be very careful. In fact, I'm a little nervous about digital numbers as we go into the future because I think it's going to become so integrated that it's really internal allocation how you're doing this. But we do know that they're important and they're helping to drive. And without these things, that would not be a good position for us to be in long term.

As always, we're happy you're able to be with us today. It's no exaggeration to say that Scripps Networks Interactive is really hitting a high mark. This year, we've successfully grown our ratings, our advertising and international revenues, our digital audiences and our international reach. We've done that by focusing on what we're good at and delivering consistent environments that consumers and advertisers love. This is sustainable growth, driven by the strength of our brands and our content, not driven by special events, sports or election coverage. We've also finalized long-term contracts with key distributors that secure significant carriage and mid- to high single-digit rate escalators into the early 2020s. Plus, we're included on new OTT platforms, enabling us to reach new audiences away from traditional linear TV services.
Now Burt and Lori will go into the details on the quarter shortly, but first, I'd like to take just a few minutes to speak about the broader strategy and our vision for growing the company. Over the last 22 years, we have built our business upon a number of key pillars. Number one, growing our brands and our audience; number two, maximizing how we monetize; number three, managing our costs wisely; number four, expanding our footprint into new markets; and number five, reaching new audiences on emerging platforms and services.
Looking at those one by one, we're seeing some significant traction in 2016. First, we have grown our brands. These brands, particularly HGTV, Food Network and increasingly, Travel Channel, remain powerhouse content brands, with unique appeal to consumers in both the United States and around the world. That appeal is clearly reflected in our results. In fact, in the United States, 5 of our 6 networks are up in sales prime year-to-date, an incredible achievement, given the competition from Olympics and the presidential election. Scripps Networks Interactive was the only network group whose impression gains were not driven by news during the 2015-2016 television season, a testament really to the enduring appeal of our content.
In the current media landscape, where consumers have more options than ever, strong brands win. We've worked tirelessly to develop remarkable brands with unique positioning. HGTV and Food Network are already must-have brands, and we're building another right now at Travel Channel. We've hit upon strong consistent programming that resonates with a growing high-income audience. As we intended, Travel Channel is becoming the go-to place for compelling travel entertainment.
And speaking of must-have brands, in the 2016 Brand Relevance Index recently published by Prophet, Food Network was recognized as a top 50 brand that consumers can't live without. In fact, Food Network ranked #36 and was the only cable or broadcast television brand to make the index. Pretty remarkable. The reason we're able to grow our networks, amid the current shifting macro environment, is that our audiences know that regardless of the time of day or day of week, they can find high-quality content on our networks. Our programming is inspiring, trustworthy and engaging, and consumers respond by tuning in and staying tuned.
Secondly, we maximize our monetization by delivering our advertisers the lucrative upscale audience they covet. Our environment is naturally optimized for advertisers. We inspire viewers to improve their lives, and our advertisers provide them with the messages and the tools to take action. Our advertising partners know that our brands consistently deliver and engage audiences better than anyone else in the industry, as revealed in the 2016 brand identity study by Beta Research. Not only do our viewers tune in to our quality programming, they watch the commercials. And importantly, they're inclined to buy what they see. When you create strong brands with must-have content like Fixer Upper or Chopped, you become increasingly essential to distributors. While increased consolidation in the distribution space makes negotiations more complex, our networks deliver clear value on both price and popularity.
Now as a result, we've successfully renegotiated important long-term deals, and we continue to enter future negotiations with confidence, thanks to the size and nature of our audience. And we're also seeing distributors looking to include our networks in their OTT and skinny bundle services, including the recently announced DIRECTV Now. Our brands are included on all the virtual MVPDs that have launched to date, and we're excited about how consumers are responding to those packages.
With one of the most loyal and consistent viewer bases in the media industry, our networks could be termed the ESPN for women. Just like ESPN, HGTV and Food Network are cornerstone brands that adults, but in particular women, tune to time and time again. In fact, according to Nielsen Research, viewers of HGTV and Food Network, especially women, tune in more times per week and stay tuned for longer periods of time than viewers of ESPN. So as you can expect, our networks deliver an outsized proportion of the value consumers derive from their TV packages. In short, our must-have lifestyle brands are essential to the consumer, which makes them invaluable to distributors and advertisers and allows us to maximize our monetization.
Now turning to cost management. Our track record on managing overhead, I think, speaks for itself. We've done a good job of investing in content, and that investment consistently generates revenue growth. As I've said before many times, creating great content is the best method to accumulate sustainable returns. But we also pay a lot of attention to our investment levels to ensure that we not only incur the cost to deliver the best possible return to our overall business, but it just continues to be a good investment. The uniqueness of our content, married to the fact that we fully own it, presents a tremendous value proposition. We take full advantage of our content across multiple platforms and geographies in a way that most other media companies cannot, helping drive deeper levels of monetization for every dollar of investment. A great example of this comes from our acquisition of Poland's leading media company, TVN. Already a strong business in its own right, our expertise and lifestyle enables us to secure greater value from the business through utilizing lifestyle content, formats and brands in the Polish market. We strive to be good cost stewards for the company, and managing our expenses effectively is a vital principle in our success.
Now beyond the United States, we have tremendous opportunity to grow our brands, and that leads me to the fourth pillar of growth, and that's to expand our global footprint. The last few years have been particularly exciting. Food Network has successfully expanded throughout Latin America, and for the first time recently, launched in Mexico. Just this past Friday, we announced additional distribution in Brazil, where Food Network is now available in nearly 7 million homes. The reception we've had in these new markets is highly encouraging. We're also making great strides towards the global rollout of HGTV, a top priority for our international team. This year, HGTV launched in New Zealand, increased distribution across Asia and just this past Wednesday, began airing in 24 countries across the Middle East and North Africa. Moreover, we'll launch HGTV in Poland next year. This will be HGTV's largest launch ever outside the United States. And needless to say, we're very excited. Additionally, we're working to increase our other brands' presence on the TVN platform over time. And speaking of TVN, it's been more than a year since we acquired the Polish media standout, and we've made good progress. The Polish economy is among the best in the region. And TVN, with its own robust broadcast, pay TV and DTT channels, along with our leading OTT service player, has exceeded our high expectations. TVN achieved 23% market share during the quarter, even against a strong competitive environment that included the Olympics and popular soccer broadcasts. While advertising in Poland has softened slightly in recent months, TVN continues to outperform the market in both ratings and in revenue growth. And we're also excited to launch Cooking Channel in Canada in partnership with Corus Entertainment. Cooking Channel, which is the perfect pairing to Food Network Canada, will be launching on December 12.
Lastly, emerging audiences and new distribution platforms bring scores of exciting opportunities, which our digital services are aiming to capitalize on. We want to reach consumers wherever and whenever they demand high-quality lifestyle content. And we're working to ensure that we reach the next generation of lifestyle enthusiasts and to create content that is purposefully designed for digital formats.
Since its launch late last year, Scripps Lifestyle Studios has driven a significant increase in our online and social media engagement and content creation. Burton's going to share some of our fantastic results coming out of the studios shortly.
We maintain the same vision that we always have, to inspire and inform the lifestyle categories that we dominate, whether the content is delivered through linear television, skinny or fat bundles, short-form digital video or TV Everywhere, that vision really does not change. But the ways in which we make that content come to life will evolve to stay ahead of consumer preferences, just like we've always done. In many ways, it feels as if the industry is merely moving towards a model that Scripps Networks Interactive is positioned to excel in. We own our own content, which means we're better able to exploit our programming across all platforms. We have a focused number of strong brands that really resonate with consumers in an environment where powerful brands win. We have categories that are a perfect fit for advertisers. Our networks are focused on genres that lead themselves ideally to digital and mobile platforms. And we believe our model is ideally positioned to capitalize in this current marketplace. Our networks have come a long way since we introduced HGTV in 1994. We've become the unequivocal leaders in lifestyle programming. I believe we have the right plan and definitely the right team in place to continue to excel in this fast-paced media world.
I want to thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive.
And now let me turn it over to Burton, who has details on our third quarter results. Burton?"

I'm pleased to say that in the third quarter our strong operating performance continued. HGTV had another impressive quarter for ratings. It was the highest-rated third quarter ever among all key demographics, and it was the fourth highest-rated quarter in network history for sales, prime and total day. In addition, HGTV ranked as the #1 cable network among women 25 to 54. This is even more amazing, really, when you consider that we had the impact of the Olympics and the U.S. election during the quarter. Viewership among millennials continues to gain traction at HGTV. Sales prime for millennials improved 27% in September, driven in particular by the hit show, Flip or Flop: Selling Summer. This series was the #1 show on our networks among millennial viewers in the quarter. Food Network ranked #6 among women 25 to 54, improving on its prior year position for the quarter. Among millennials, Food Network was a top 10 network, driven by premiers of Cooks vs. Cons and top-performing show, Food Network Star. At Travel Channel, we continue to see the positive results from our programming investments. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter for year-over-year growth. Sales prime ratings were up 11% among adults 25 to 54, and impressions were up 5%.
A recent success was Travel Channel's 4-part special, Expedition Unknown: Hunt for the Yeti. The show ranked among the top 20 ad-supported cable shows for its time slot among adults 25 to 54 and generated ratings that were up 30% from the year-ago time slot. With more than 7 million viewers tuning into the series, Expedition Unknown: Hunt for the Yeti was one of Travel Channel's all-time top-performing shows for October.
Recently, we aired All-Star Halloween Spectacular, the first-ever programming simulcast between our big 3 networks. The special event brought together multiple network stars as they engaged in a Hollywood-themed adventure, all for the benefit of charity. Our strategy was to leverage the scale of each brand in an innovative way. We had more than 5 million viewers across the 3 networks watch the simulcast. And given the level of success, we expect to do more programming that takes advantage of the broad reach of our combined networks and digital footprints.
At DIY Network, the third quarter now ranks as the highest-rated and most-watched third quarter ever. Sales prime ratings increased 17% for adults 25 to 54 and 22% for women 25 to 54 versus a year ago.
Cooking Channel scored its highest-rated and most-watched quarter in the network's history for sales prime among both adults and women 25 to 54. And finally, Great American Country continued its double-digit growth, improving 29% for ratings and 24% for impressions versus the prior year.
At Scripps Lifestyle Studios, our growth continues to hit new and exciting levels. Scripps Lifestyle Studios achieved approximately 1.5 billion video views across all our digital platforms, which include our owned and operated websites, social networks and TV Everywhere. This represents a 50% improvement over the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, our digital teams published more than 1,200 new content videos. Scripps Lifestyle Studios averaged 250 million unique visitors monthly on all of our digital platforms during the quarter. I'm pleased to say that for October, we exceeded that impressive pace and had more than 350 million unique visitors on all of our digital platforms.
In October, Tubular Labs, a leading social video measurement company, ranked Food Network #2 for social videos in the food category, behind only BuzzFeed's Tasty. Food Network received more than 745 million video views last month. And at the fourth annual Cynopsis Digital Model D Awards, which honor the best in online video content, Food Network won the award for Best Social Media Campaign for its use of Facebook and the award for Best Web Video for its feature on Square Deviled Eggs. All 3 of our big networks received multiple honorable mentions at the awards ceremony, a testament to the incredibly creative content our digital teams are producing.
Now on TV Everywhere, the platform is showing signs of growth, with 19.3 million views in the third quarter. We're pleased with the progress we've made with TV Everywhere usage, and we hope to see even more. Overall, it was a successful quarter with some remarkable results for Scripps Lifestyle Studios.
Finally, we assessed and analyzed the SVOD universe and have made the strategic decision not to extend our SVOD agreement with Netflix past the end of this year. In the end, it really is not the kind of dual revenue model that best monetizes our content over the long term.
Now turning to our International Networks. The last several quarters have been especially exciting as the company continues to grow. July marked 1 year since we finalized our acquisition of TVN. The Polish network group delivered another successful quarter, with revenues growing mid-single digits in local currency compared with the prior year. Ratings for the network group increased 3% for the target audience. In fact, TVN was the only major network group in Poland to increase market share in the quarter. With 23% market share, TVN has solidly established its leadership position among all the network groups in Poland. We couldn't be more excited to bring HGTV to Polish audiences next year. As Ken mentioned, expanding HGTV globally is a key goal for the company. Our central European location provides a great launching pad for our expansion plans and growth on the continent. For example, TVN will begin to manage the Food Network and Travel Channel brands in Poland to help drive programming production opportunities and operating efficiencies. Previously, the international team in London managed these networks. Integrating our lifestyle brands into TVN was a primary objective that we hoped to accomplish when we initially explored the acquisition.
At UKTV, share of commercial impact was 10% in the quarter, another all-time high for the network group. UKTV Networks' Dave and Drama continue to dominate as the #1 and #2 nonpublic service broadcast networks in the country, helping extend UKTV's leadership position in the U.K.
2016 continues to be a fantastic year for our company. We're optimistic about the wealth of growth opportunities available for our lifestyle content, both in the United States and internationally.
And now, I'll turn it over to Lori, who will review the company's financial performance."

Good morning, everyone.This morning, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, provide some comments on guidance and then open it up for Q&A.Consolidated revenues in the third quarter totaled $803 millio",827,"Thanks, Burton. Good morning, everyone.
This morning, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, provide some comments on guidance and then open it up for Q&A.
Consolidated revenues in the third quarter totaled $803 million, an increase of 3.5% compared with the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, coupled with overall ratings and impressions growth and increases in our international business. In line with our expectations coming into the quarter, consolidated adjusted segment profit decreased 2%, primarily due to the increase in programming costs, partially offset by the advertising and international revenue growth.
Consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% compared with the prior year, primarily due to a reduction of interest expense as we deleveraged, and gains on foreign currency transactions. These items were partially offset by a decrease in adjusted segment profit and a reduction of equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily related to the sale of our investment in Fox Sports South in the first quarter of 2016.
At our U.S. Networks segment, revenues grew 4%, driven by strong advertising demand for our lifestyle networks, partially offset by the expected and temporary decline in distribution revenues. For advertising revenues, increases in CPM pricing, coupled with ratings improvement, drove a 7% year-over-year increase in the third quarter. Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter, with CPM high teens year-over-year and up mid to high 20% over the broadcast upfront. Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, automotive and financial. These categories are consistent with the historical performance of the third quarter. The strength of the scatter has continued into the fourth quarter, scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing is up mid- to high teens year-over-year and up high teens to mid-20s over the broadcast upfront.
As a result of the rate equalization impacting 2016 coupled with industry subscriber declines, distribution revenues for U.S. Networks decreased 2.5%. The declines in rates and subscribers were partially offset by negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top broadband providers.
On the expense side. As a result of the planned difference in the timing of programming premieres between 2016 and 2015, cost of services for the U.S. Networks increased 13% in the third quarter. However, programming expense growth is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2016 as we will premiere fewer programs compared with the prior year.
We noted in previous quarters that we've shifted some marketing and promotional expenses to later in the year. Due to the continued advertising strength and ratings improvements, we were once again able to defer market expenses out of the third quarter. As a result, we expect to realize a significant increase in marketing and promotion expense in the fourth quarter. Reflecting the increase in advertising revenues offset by the decrease in distribution revenues and an increase in programming-related expenses, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. Networks declined 1%.
International Networks revenue increased 4% to $123 million on a reported basis. However, the majority of international revenues are generated by TVN. And in local currency, the revenues increased 6% compared with the same time a year ago.
International adjusted segment profit increased 31% to $15 million compared with the third quarter of 2015. This improvement reflects the increase in revenues as well as operating efficiencies from the ongoing rationalization of our international support structure.
In addition to our consolidated operating results and our equity earnings, including certain remaining U.S. minority interests, are our unconsolidated international operations. These include UKTV, Food Network, HGTV and DIY Network in Canada and some TVN minority investments. These international properties now comprise the majority of our equity income. In total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $8.5 million, down from $23 million in the prior year. The decline is primarily related to the sale of our investment in Fox Sports South earlier this year and the timing of revenue recognition at certain minority investments.
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the third quarter at approximately 2.8x gross leverage, down from 3.2x at the end of 2015. Based on the expected retirement of debt in the fourth quarter, we should end the year at approximately 2.5x gross leverage. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We plan to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our leverage and invest in M&A, both domestically and internationally. Given those goals, we did not buy back any shares during the quarter.
Looking at guidance for the remainder of 2016. We are reiterating all of our previously issued guidance. And in line with past practice, we will address 2017 on our next earnings call. We feel positive about the trends we are seeing and how the business is positioned, including our ability to grow revenue, adjusted segment profit and free cash flow. 
And with that, we will open up the call for your questions."

They've continued into this year, and our programming team is developing even more. We did talk about growing our programming investment there for exactly this reason. The number of hours at Travel Channel has grown as a result. That's purposeful. It isn't where Food and HGTV are in terms of the number of hours. That's also purposeful. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We do think we're reaching a level where the growth in our programming spending is going to moderate year to year. We won't see it grow at the same rate. That said, we always say internally and externally, if we find a hit on Travel Channel that we can produce in quantity that we know will result in higher ratings and therefore, higher ad revenue, we'll make that investment in programming. So I think your basic assessment is correct. Moderation in that growth rate, but we're clearly, clearly seeing the investment there pay off."

Our universe assumptions aren't any better than anyone else's, but I would say, looking at what you're experiencing this year is probably a good proxy for that. So we're net 1% to 2% on our core network. That's probably a reasonable estimate going forward. I think digital networks are a little bit higher, just based on the skinny bundles and what's happening there. But again, I think what's more important as we turn the corner, we're going to go from seeing year-over -- quarter -- year-over-year quarter declines to where we're going to see growth again. So looking forward, I think 2017 is going to be a much more positive story on the distribution front here at SNI."

These are designed to be included in the most distributed packages on all of these virtual MVPDs and OTT services. That's what we've negotiated for. We continue to do that in talks with any new player coming in. And actually, that's what we've achieved. The digital tier networks, they were designed to be on digital tiers from the get-go, many, many years ago in the case of DIY, for example. And the way that our monetization works, they can be on digital tiers and still allow us to do just fine. Lori, did you want to add something on that?"

I will say, on the advertising, they're performing just as well. In fact, we're seeing phenomenal growth there. What you're seeing is the impact primarily of consolidation impacting those networks as well as migration, where we had quite a sweet deal with the U-verse deal as those subscribers migrate off. So again, I think very strong performance again on the ad side. And again, most of our economics, as you well know, come from those 3 big networks anyway."

So my question to you, Ken, is are you big enough? You got these 3 strong networks, and they got to be in every bundle.

It's a question, I think, I've been getting for 20-some years. It's about the quality of the brands. I mean, we're perfectly happy sitting here domestically with 6 brands that are performing very well. You heard 5 of the 6 are up in impressions and in ratings. I don't know what else you can do to send a message to distributors and advertises than success. And so whether you have 6 channels, 20 channels, it's about quality, and it's about the ability to come to the table and offer brands that are relevant and valuable to our distribution partners. And again, I think you're hearing today in all of the skinny bundles and looking to 2017, which we're look -- we'll see some increased distribution growth in subscription revenue. Yes, we're big enough. It -- look, it's going to continue to be a consolidated world, but that's been the case for the past 15 years. We've seen consolidation on the cable distribution side. It's just now there's getting to be some heft. But I think, for example, if I may, I wouldn't -- we never comment on M&A, but the one takeaway from the AT&T and Time Warner announcement is content is valuable, and it's going to continue to be more valuable if it's quality is original and there's great storytelling, and in our opinion, it's lifestyle targeted. So long-winded answer to say, yes, we're in good shape, and I wouldn't trade our position with anybody else right now."

You can correct me if I picked up the wrong stat you said there, but I'm sure that's a lot of growth. It's a big number. So my question is this, how does that relate to the $36 million or so of, I guess, advertising revenue that you report as -- from your digital businesses? Are those sort of -- both mapped to the same thing? Or is there other revenue in other places that maps there? And if they are the same thing, is there anything wrong with just doing the math of dividing 1.5 billion views by $36 million of revenue?

That number was close to nothing in terms of video views a year ago, so it is a remarkable increase. It's extremely purposeful. We set ourselves a task. If you go back to our call a year ago, I think we did first talk about launching the Scripps Lifestyle Studios because we saw an opportunity here. We are -- 1.5 billion sounds like a lot, but it's not anywhere near where we want to be, to be honest, because of the math.

But I would also point out that, again, and Ken made this point earlier, that some of this is more R&D as we learned. A lot of times, the views come ahead of the monetization. So again, I think as we go into 2017, we'll continue to ramp this up and continue to see more monetization tied to the engagement that we're driving. Also, to your point, it is more in the -- more of the tools that our ad sales teams can go out and sell. So sometimes, these things are being sold as part of a typical linear deal, so you may not see all the value actually being allocated to digital. So I think we have to be very careful. In fact, I'm a little nervous about digital numbers as we go into the future because I think it's going to become so integrated that it's really internal allocation how you're doing this. But we do know that they're important and they're helping to drive. And without these things, that would not be a good position for us to be in long term.

As always, we're happy you're able to be with us today. It's no exaggeration to say that Scripps Networks Interactive is really hitting a high mark. This year, we've successfully grown our ratings, our advertising and international revenues, our digital audiences and our international reach. We've done that by focusing on what we're good at and delivering consistent environments that consumers and advertisers love. This is sustainable growth, driven by the strength of our brands and our content, not driven by special events, sports or election coverage. We've also finalized long-term contracts with key distributors that secure significant carriage and mid- to high single-digit rate escalators into the early 2020s. Plus, we're included on new OTT platforms, enabling us to reach new audiences away from traditional linear TV services.
Now Burt and Lori will go into the details on the quarter shortly, but first, I'd like to take just a few minutes to speak about the broader strategy and our vision for growing the company. Over the last 22 years, we have built our business upon a number of key pillars. Number one, growing our brands and our audience; number two, maximizing how we monetize; number three, managing our costs wisely; number four, expanding our footprint into new markets; and number five, reaching new audiences on emerging platforms and services.
Looking at those one by one, we're seeing some significant traction in 2016. First, we have grown our brands. These brands, particularly HGTV, Food Network and increasingly, Travel Channel, remain powerhouse content brands, with unique appeal to consumers in both the United States and around the world. That appeal is clearly reflected in our results. In fact, in the United States, 5 of our 6 networks are up in sales prime year-to-date, an incredible achievement, given the competition from Olympics and the presidential election. Scripps Networks Interactive was the only network group whose impression gains were not driven by news during the 2015-2016 television season, a testament really to the enduring appeal of our content.
In the current media landscape, where consumers have more options than ever, strong brands win. We've worked tirelessly to develop remarkable brands with unique positioning. HGTV and Food Network are already must-have brands, and we're building another right now at Travel Channel. We've hit upon strong consistent programming that resonates with a growing high-income audience. As we intended, Travel Channel is becoming the go-to place for compelling travel entertainment.
And speaking of must-have brands, in the 2016 Brand Relevance Index recently published by Prophet, Food Network was recognized as a top 50 brand that consumers can't live without. In fact, Food Network ranked #36 and was the only cable or broadcast television brand to make the index. Pretty remarkable. The reason we're able to grow our networks, amid the current shifting macro environment, is that our audiences know that regardless of the time of day or day of week, they can find high-quality content on our networks. Our programming is inspiring, trustworthy and engaging, and consumers respond by tuning in and staying tuned.
Secondly, we maximize our monetization by delivering our advertisers the lucrative upscale audience they covet. Our environment is naturally optimized for advertisers. We inspire viewers to improve their lives, and our advertisers provide them with the messages and the tools to take action. Our advertising partners know that our brands consistently deliver and engage audiences better than anyone else in the industry, as revealed in the 2016 brand identity study by Beta Research. Not only do our viewers tune in to our quality programming, they watch the commercials. And importantly, they're inclined to buy what they see. When you create strong brands with must-have content like Fixer Upper or Chopped, you become increasingly essential to distributors. While increased consolidation in the distribution space makes negotiations more complex, our networks deliver clear value on both price and popularity.
Now as a result, we've successfully renegotiated important long-term deals, and we continue to enter future negotiations with confidence, thanks to the size and nature of our audience. And we're also seeing distributors looking to include our networks in their OTT and skinny bundle services, including the recently announced DIRECTV Now. Our brands are included on all the virtual MVPDs that have launched to date, and we're excited about how consumers are responding to those packages.
With one of the most loyal and consistent viewer bases in the media industry, our networks could be termed the ESPN for women. Just like ESPN, HGTV and Food Network are cornerstone brands that adults, but in particular women, tune to time and time again. In fact, according to Nielsen Research, viewers of HGTV and Food Network, especially women, tune in more times per week and stay tuned for longer periods of time than viewers of ESPN. So as you can expect, our networks deliver an outsized proportion of the value consumers derive from their TV packages. In short, our must-have lifestyle brands are essential to the consumer, which makes them invaluable to distributors and advertisers and allows us to maximize our monetization.
Now turning to cost management. Our track record on managing overhead, I think, speaks for itself. We've done a good job of investing in content, and that investment consistently generates revenue growth. As I've said before many times, creating great content is the best method to accumulate sustainable returns. But we also pay a lot of attention to our investment levels to ensure that we not only incur the cost to deliver the best possible return to our overall business, but it just continues to be a good investment. The uniqueness of our content, married to the fact that we fully own it, presents a tremendous value proposition. We take full advantage of our content across multiple platforms and geographies in a way that most other media companies cannot, helping drive deeper levels of monetization for every dollar of investment. A great example of this comes from our acquisition of Poland's leading media company, TVN. Already a strong business in its own right, our expertise and lifestyle enables us to secure greater value from the business through utilizing lifestyle content, formats and brands in the Polish market. We strive to be good cost stewards for the company, and managing our expenses effectively is a vital principle in our success.
Now beyond the United States, we have tremendous opportunity to grow our brands, and that leads me to the fourth pillar of growth, and that's to expand our global footprint. The last few years have been particularly exciting. Food Network has successfully expanded throughout Latin America, and for the first time recently, launched in Mexico. Just this past Friday, we announced additional distribution in Brazil, where Food Network is now available in nearly 7 million homes. The reception we've had in these new markets is highly encouraging. We're also making great strides towards the global rollout of HGTV, a top priority for our international team. This year, HGTV launched in New Zealand, increased distribution across Asia and just this past Wednesday, began airing in 24 countries across the Middle East and North Africa. Moreover, we'll launch HGTV in Poland next year. This will be HGTV's largest launch ever outside the United States. And needless to say, we're very excited. Additionally, we're working to increase our other brands' presence on the TVN platform over time. And speaking of TVN, it's been more than a year since we acquired the Polish media standout, and we've made good progress. The Polish economy is among the best in the region. And TVN, with its own robust broadcast, pay TV and DTT channels, along with our leading OTT service player, has exceeded our high expectations. TVN achieved 23% market share during the quarter, even against a strong competitive environment that included the Olympics and popular soccer broadcasts. While advertising in Poland has softened slightly in recent months, TVN continues to outperform the market in both ratings and in revenue growth. And we're also excited to launch Cooking Channel in Canada in partnership with Corus Entertainment. Cooking Channel, which is the perfect pairing to Food Network Canada, will be launching on December 12.
Lastly, emerging audiences and new distribution platforms bring scores of exciting opportunities, which our digital services are aiming to capitalize on. We want to reach consumers wherever and whenever they demand high-quality lifestyle content. And we're working to ensure that we reach the next generation of lifestyle enthusiasts and to create content that is purposefully designed for digital formats.
Since its launch late last year, Scripps Lifestyle Studios has driven a significant increase in our online and social media engagement and content creation. Burton's going to share some of our fantastic results coming out of the studios shortly.
We maintain the same vision that we always have, to inspire and inform the lifestyle categories that we dominate, whether the content is delivered through linear television, skinny or fat bundles, short-form digital video or TV Everywhere, that vision really does not change. But the ways in which we make that content come to life will evolve to stay ahead of consumer preferences, just like we've always done. In many ways, it feels as if the industry is merely moving towards a model that Scripps Networks Interactive is positioned to excel in. We own our own content, which means we're better able to exploit our programming across all platforms. We have a focused number of strong brands that really resonate with consumers in an environment where powerful brands win. We have categories that are a perfect fit for advertisers. Our networks are focused on genres that lead themselves ideally to digital and mobile platforms. And we believe our model is ideally positioned to capitalize in this current marketplace. Our networks have come a long way since we introduced HGTV in 1994. We've become the unequivocal leaders in lifestyle programming. I believe we have the right plan and definitely the right team in place to continue to excel in this fast-paced media world.
I want to thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive.
And now let me turn it over to Burton, who has details on our third quarter results. Burton?"

I'm pleased to say that in the third quarter our strong operating performance continued. HGTV had another impressive quarter for ratings. It was the highest-rated third quarter ever among all key demographics, and it was the fourth highest-rated quarter in network history for sales, prime and total day. In addition, HGTV ranked as the #1 cable network among women 25 to 54. This is even more amazing, really, when you consider that we had the impact of the Olympics and the U.S. election during the quarter. Viewership among millennials continues to gain traction at HGTV. Sales prime for millennials improved 27% in September, driven in particular by the hit show, Flip or Flop: Selling Summer. This series was the #1 show on our networks among millennial viewers in the quarter. Food Network ranked #6 among women 25 to 54, improving on its prior year position for the quarter. Among millennials, Food Network was a top 10 network, driven by premiers of Cooks vs. Cons and top-performing show, Food Network Star. At Travel Channel, we continue to see the positive results from our programming investments. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter for year-over-year growth. Sales prime ratings were up 11% among adults 25 to 54, and impressions were up 5%.
A recent success was Travel Channel's 4-part special, Expedition Unknown: Hunt for the Yeti. The show ranked among the top 20 ad-supported cable shows for its time slot among adults 25 to 54 and generated ratings that were up 30% from the year-ago time slot. With more than 7 million viewers tuning into the series, Expedition Unknown: Hunt for the Yeti was one of Travel Channel's all-time top-performing shows for October.
Recently, we aired All-Star Halloween Spectacular, the first-ever programming simulcast between our big 3 networks. The special event brought together multiple network stars as they engaged in a Hollywood-themed adventure, all for the benefit of charity. Our strategy was to leverage the scale of each brand in an innovative way. We had more than 5 million viewers across the 3 networks watch the simulcast. And given the level of success, we expect to do more programming that takes advantage of the broad reach of our combined networks and digital footprints.
At DIY Network, the third quarter now ranks as the highest-rated and most-watched third quarter ever. Sales prime ratings increased 17% for adults 25 to 54 and 22% for women 25 to 54 versus a year ago.
Cooking Channel scored its highest-rated and most-watched quarter in the network's history for sales prime among both adults and women 25 to 54. And finally, Great American Country continued its double-digit growth, improving 29% for ratings and 24% for impressions versus the prior year.
At Scripps Lifestyle Studios, our growth continues to hit new and exciting levels. Scripps Lifestyle Studios achieved approximately 1.5 billion video views across all our digital platforms, which include our owned and operated websites, social networks and TV Everywhere. This represents a 50% improvement over the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, our digital teams published more than 1,200 new content videos. Scripps Lifestyle Studios averaged 250 million unique visitors monthly on all of our digital platforms during the quarter. I'm pleased to say that for October, we exceeded that impressive pace and had more than 350 million unique visitors on all of our digital platforms.
In October, Tubular Labs, a leading social video measurement company, ranked Food Network #2 for social videos in the food category, behind only BuzzFeed's Tasty. Food Network received more than 745 million video views last month. And at the fourth annual Cynopsis Digital Model D Awards, which honor the best in online video content, Food Network won the award for Best Social Media Campaign for its use of Facebook and the award for Best Web Video for its feature on Square Deviled Eggs. All 3 of our big networks received multiple honorable mentions at the awards ceremony, a testament to the incredibly creative content our digital teams are producing.
Now on TV Everywhere, the platform is showing signs of growth, with 19.3 million views in the third quarter. We're pleased with the progress we've made with TV Everywhere usage, and we hope to see even more. Overall, it was a successful quarter with some remarkable results for Scripps Lifestyle Studios.
Finally, we assessed and analyzed the SVOD universe and have made the strategic decision not to extend our SVOD agreement with Netflix past the end of this year. In the end, it really is not the kind of dual revenue model that best monetizes our content over the long term.
Now turning to our International Networks. The last several quarters have been especially exciting as the company continues to grow. July marked 1 year since we finalized our acquisition of TVN. The Polish network group delivered another successful quarter, with revenues growing mid-single digits in local currency compared with the prior year. Ratings for the network group increased 3% for the target audience. In fact, TVN was the only major network group in Poland to increase market share in the quarter. With 23% market share, TVN has solidly established its leadership position among all the network groups in Poland. We couldn't be more excited to bring HGTV to Polish audiences next year. As Ken mentioned, expanding HGTV globally is a key goal for the company. Our central European location provides a great launching pad for our expansion plans and growth on the continent. For example, TVN will begin to manage the Food Network and Travel Channel brands in Poland to help drive programming production opportunities and operating efficiencies. Previously, the international team in London managed these networks. Integrating our lifestyle brands into TVN was a primary objective that we hoped to accomplish when we initially explored the acquisition.
At UKTV, share of commercial impact was 10% in the quarter, another all-time high for the network group. UKTV Networks' Dave and Drama continue to dominate as the #1 and #2 nonpublic service broadcast networks in the country, helping extend UKTV's leadership position in the U.K.
2016 continues to be a fantastic year for our company. We're optimistic about the wealth of growth opportunities available for our lifestyle content, both in the United States and internationally.
And now, I'll turn it over to Lori, who will review the company's financial performance."
6469353,404662266,1080550,"Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2016",2016-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Burton. Good morning, everyone.This morning, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, provide some comments on guidance and then open it up for Q&A.Consolidated revenues in the third quarter totaled $803 millio",827,"Thanks, Burton. Good morning, everyone.
This morning, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, provide some comments on guidance and then open it up for Q&A.
Consolidated revenues in the third quarter totaled $803 million, an increase of 3.5% compared with the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, coupled with overall ratings and impressions growth and increases in our international business. In line with our expectations coming into the quarter, consolidated adjusted segment profit decreased 2%, primarily due to the increase in programming costs, partially offset by the advertising and international revenue growth.
Consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% compared with the prior year, primarily due to a reduction of interest expense as we deleveraged, and gains on foreign currency transactions. These items were partially offset by a decrease in adjusted segment profit and a reduction of equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily related to the sale of our investment in Fox Sports South in the first quarter of 2016.
At our U.S. Networks segment, revenues grew 4%, driven by strong advertising demand for our lifestyle networks, partially offset by the expected and temporary decline in distribution revenues. For advertising revenues, increases in CPM pricing, coupled with ratings improvement, drove a 7% year-over-year increase in the third quarter. Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter, with CPM high teens year-over-year and up mid to high 20% over the broadcast upfront. Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, automotive and financial. These categories are consistent with the historical performance of the third quarter. The strength of the scatter has continued into the fourth quarter, scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing is up mid- to high teens year-over-year and up high teens to mid-20s over the broadcast upfront.
As a result of the rate equalization impacting 2016 coupled with industry subscriber declines, distribution revenues for U.S. Networks decreased 2.5%. The declines in rates and subscribers were partially offset by negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top broadband providers.
On the expense side. As a result of the planned difference in the timing of programming premieres between 2016 and 2015, cost of services for the U.S. Networks increased 13% in the third quarter. However, programming expense growth is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2016 as we will premiere fewer programs compared with the prior year.
We noted in previous quarters that we've shifted some marketing and promotional expenses to later in the year. Due to the continued advertising strength and ratings improvements, we were once again able to defer market expenses out of the third quarter. As a result, we expect to realize a significant increase in marketing and promotion expense in the fourth quarter. Reflecting the increase in advertising revenues offset by the decrease in distribution revenues and an increase in programming-related expenses, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. Networks declined 1%.
International Networks revenue increased 4% to $123 million on a reported basis. However, the majority of international revenues are generated by TVN. And in local currency, the revenues increased 6% compared with the same time a year ago.
International adjusted segment profit increased 31% to $15 million compared with the third quarter of 2015. This improvement reflects the increase in revenues as well as operating efficiencies from the ongoing rationalization of our international support structure.
In addition to our consolidated operating results and our equity earnings, including certain remaining U.S. minority interests, are our unconsolidated international operations. These include UKTV, Food Network, HGTV and DIY Network in Canada and some TVN minority investments. These international properties now comprise the majority of our equity income. In total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $8.5 million, down from $23 million in the prior year. The decline is primarily related to the sale of our investment in Fox Sports South earlier this year and the timing of revenue recognition at certain minority investments.
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the third quarter at approximately 2.8x gross leverage, down from 3.2x at the end of 2015. Based on the expected retirement of debt in the fourth quarter, we should end the year at approximately 2.5x gross leverage. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We plan to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our leverage and invest in M&A, both domestically and internationally. Given those goals, we did not buy back any shares during the quarter.
Looking at guidance for the remainder of 2016. We are reiterating all of our previously issued guidance. And in line with past practice, we will address 2017 on our next earnings call. We feel positive about the trends we are seeing and how the business is positioned, including our ability to grow revenue, adjusted segment profit and free cash flow. 
And with that, we will open up the call for your questions."

And it really is the result of what we talked about throughout 2015, which was putting on a lot of pilots that we tried. A number of them were successful. They've continued into this year, and our programming team is developing even more. We did talk about growing our programming investment there for exactly this reason. The number of hours at Travel Channel has grown as a result. That's purposeful. It isn't where Food and HGTV are in terms of the number of hours. That's also purposeful. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We do think we're reaching a level where the growth in our programming spending is going to moderate year to year. We won't see it grow at the same rate. That said, we always say internally and externally, if we find a hit on Travel Channel that we can produce in quantity that we know will result in higher ratings and therefore, higher ad revenue, we'll make that investment in programming. So I think your basic assessment is correct. Moderation in that growth rate, but we're clearly, clearly seeing the investment there pay off."

Our universe assumptions aren't any better than anyone else's, but I would say, looking at what you're experiencing this year is probably a good proxy for that. So we're net 1% to 2% on our core network. That's probably a reasonable estimate going forward. I think digital networks are a little bit higher, just based on the skinny bundles and what's happening there. But again, I think what's more important as we turn the corner, we're going to go from seeing year-over -- quarter -- year-over-year quarter declines to where we're going to see growth again. So looking forward, I think 2017 is going to be a much more positive story on the distribution front here at SNI."

I think, basically, what we've said all along about the distribution of our 3 fully distributed networks holds when it comes to new distribution opportunities.

The digital tier networks, they were designed to be on digital tiers from the get-go, many, many years ago in the case of DIY, for example.

So that said, this is why we're making this push. We want to have a huge amount of growth in the viewing of our short-form digital video content.

And so whether you have 6 channels, 20 channels, it's about quality, and it's about the ability to come to the table and offer brands that are relevant and valuable to our distribution partners. And again, I think you're hearing today in all of the skinny bundles and looking to 2017, which we're look -- we'll see some increased distribution growth in subscription revenue. Yes, we're big enough. It -- look, it's going to continue to be a consolidated world, but that's been the case for the past 15 years. We've seen consolidation on the cable distribution side. It's just now there's getting to be some heft.

So long-winded answer to say, yes, we're in good shape, and I wouldn't trade our position with anybody else right now."

I think this continues to be pretty much in our wheelhouse, and that is the recognition that things are changing, and they will continue to change. So when we look to the future audiences of HGTV and Food Network and Travel Channel, instead of waiting for them to ""grow"" into our brands, we're out right now learning as much about we can as their particular lifestyle and their particular needs, which sometimes cannot necessarily be incorporated into programming when you're targeting 30-plus. So as Lori said, sitting around the table and being minority investors in companies that are truly targeting millennials and allowing us to, if you will, learn along with them, I think, is invaluable 5 years down the road. And you'll see that in some of the things that we'll continue to do to bring younger viewers and younger users on board."

Burton, the one that I caught on to, correct me if I heard this wrong, I think you said 1.5 billion digital -- maybe that was views? You can correct me if I picked up the wrong stat you said there, but I'm sure that's a lot of growth. It's a big number. So my question is this, how does that relate to the $36 million or so of, I guess, advertising revenue that you report as -- from your digital businesses? Are those sort of -- both mapped to the same thing? Or is there other revenue in other places that maps there? And if they are the same thing, is there anything wrong with just doing the math of dividing 1.5 billion views by $36 million of revenue? That would tell me about a $24 CPM, I think, if there was 1 ad per view. Anything wrong with that math?"

Just another bit of chest thumping, although we don't want to get ahead of ourselves here for our digital team. That number was close to nothing in terms of video views a year ago, so it is a remarkable increase. It's extremely purposeful. We set ourselves a task. If you go back to our call a year ago, I think we did first talk about launching the Scripps Lifestyle Studios because we saw an opportunity here. We are -- 1.5 billion sounds like a lot, but it's not anywhere near where we want to be, to be honest, because of the math. You need a lot of views, even at a high CPM, and I'm going to let Lori comment if she wants to on your calculation, and so we've still got a ways to go, but we've made a good start."

But I would also point out that, again, and Ken made this point earlier, that some of this is more R&D as we learned. A lot of times, the views come ahead of the monetization. So again, I think as we go into 2017, we'll continue to ramp this up and continue to see more monetization tied to the engagement that we're driving. Also, to your point, it is more in the -- more of the tools that our ad sales teams can go out and sell. So sometimes, these things are being sold as part of a typical linear deal, so you may not see all the value actually being allocated to digital. So I think we have to be very careful. In fact, I'm a little nervous about digital numbers as we go into the future because I think it's going to become so integrated that it's really internal allocation how you're doing this. But we do know that they're important and they're helping to drive. And without these things, that would not be a good position for us to be in long term. But I would say, we're still learning on how we're going to monetize these and package these in with the broader offerings."
