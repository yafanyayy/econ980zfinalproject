Welcome to The Hershey Company's Fourth Quarter 2015 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session with them; Michele Buck, President North America; and myself.
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on our current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes that presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss 4Q results, excluding net free tax charges of $39 million or $0.10 per share diluted, primarily related to the productivity initiative announced in June, a non-service-related pension expense and acquisition and integration charges. Our discussions of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. With that out of the way, let turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

We've made progress against many of our strategic initiatives in 2015, and despite a difficult environment in the second half of the year, we delivered adjusted earnings per share diluted growth within the targeted range we provided during our second quarter conference call. 
Fourth quarter net sales on a constant currency basis were slightly below our expectations and declined about 3%. North America gross margin expansion resulted in solid operating profit growth, and we continue to hold the line on overall expense control. Hershey U.S. CMG retail takeaways sequentially improved for Q3 to Q4, increase plus 2.5%, although market share was off about 0.2 point performance was good, and we gained market share in both Halloween and holiday. Our fourth quarter marketplace performance is similar to the full year. Specifically, combined fourth quarter retail takeaway and one of our largest retailers and within the dollar and drug channels, was a solid plus 6%. The drug classic trade was driven by our position initiatives while the other 2 channels were winners from a consumer trips perspective. However, in the remaining channels, our combined retail takeaway was only slightly up. While small, we also had meaningful gains in none measure channels such as e-commerce and food service. For the full year, Hershey U.S. CMG retail takeaway increased 2.4% and was largely in line with category growth. As a result for the 52 weeks ended December 26, 2015, Hershey U.S. market share was an industry-leading 31.3%. 
Following a period of relatively consistent marketplace access where we outperformed the category, our momentum slowed in the second half of 2015 and was relatively in line with the CMG category as a result of increased competitive activity within CMG and broader snacks. 
Over the last 3 years, the average growth rate of the CMG category was about 2.3% below the long-term historical average of 3% to 4%. As we previously discussed, the category is being impacted by many of the same issues involving new categories, including change in shopping habits, like channel shifting; increased competitive activity in some retailers adjusting their merchandising practices; and a proliferation of broader snack SKUs. As a result, going forward, we estimate that CMG category growth will be in the 2.5% to 3% range. Our goal is to outpace the category and gain shares on an annual basis. Additionally, we have good visibility into our developing snacks portfolio and expect positive sales contributions from it in 2016. 
Given our solid CMG position in North America and the investments we'll continue to make in our snacks business, we expect our North American segment to generate a long-term constant currency annual net sales growth of 3% to 4%. 
As we look to 2016 and beyond, we're taking actions that we believe will enable us to regain our North America market placement momentum over our strategic planning cycles. 
Some of the things you'll see in the marketplace in 2016 to address broader snacking, income bifurcation and lower trips include a broad-based launch of substantial snacking items, including Brookside bars, Snack Mix and Snack Bites canisters; as well as increased distribution of Krave meat snacks. You'll see incremental investments related to core CMG merchandising and display activity and the introduction of branded pods that bring our brands to life in store. Although note that this will result in higher trade promotion as we strive to maintain the right mix of quality merchandising and related promotional price points. 
We'll also launch Cadbury chocolates in a stand-up targeting the mass premium market and begin a 500-store test featuring Scharffen Berger and the organic brands. And with Alan Candy Sugar confectionery items in pig bags to appeal to the cost-conscious consumers. This is just a brief summary of some of the activity we have in North America this year.
Now for an update on our international business. In late December, we reached an agreement to acquire the remaining 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, subject to government approval. While the category in business has experienced slower growth, we're committed to the China market and the acquisition of Golden Monkey is important to Hershey's future growth. We believe in the complementary advantages of Hershey and Golden Monkey and the opportunity that we have with these businesses together. 
Earlier this month, we kicked off the year of the Golden Monkey campaign. The key elements of the campaign include activating TV and mobile advertising and executing merchandising and display of retail. This is well underway as it started in early January. 
Our China chocolate fourth quarter net sales results were less than our expectations as we adjusted our selling for Chinese New Year, given category softness. 
In Q4, the contraction of the China chocolate category accelerated and was down about 13%. As a result for the full year, the category was about flat versus last year. In a slowing category and our overweighting and hypermarkets, this has impacted our performance negatively. 
In 2015, Hershey retail takeaway was off 11% and market share declined 1.1 points to 8.5%. Similar to what we've discussed over the last year, category performance is being impacted by macroeconomic issues and the related impact it's having on consumer shopping behavior and confidence. And given the China news flow that we've all seen, it continues to be difficult to gauge the consumer's behavior. We're focused on the integration of our businesses and building distribution in our portfolio. And while small, our e-commerce business in China is a bright spot. 
In the fourth quarter, our e-commerce business increased over 75%, driven by solid China single day performance. For the year, our China chocolate e-commerce retail takeaways outpaced the category. In 2016, we'll continue to invest in our e-commerce platform, increase Brookside distribution and trial and focus on channel development. 
In Mexico, net sales in local currency for the quarter were about flat versus previous year. For the full year, local currency sales increased 6%. Within the chocolate category, we're seeing investments by all major manufacturers in the form of new products in core brand investments. As a result, our chocolate marketplace performance has lagged in the category. 
Chocolate market share in the modern trade in Mexico for the year is off as our retail takeaway of about 4% lagged category growth of about 12%. In 2016, within the modern trade, we'll concentrate on portfolio core chocolate Hershey's and Kisses franchises and our small but profitable grocery-branded items. Our traditional trade initiative Sigma is progressing, and we expect our market share here to improve this year. 
In Brazil, local currency net sales in Q4 were slightly down versus last year given a macroeconomic environment and competitive activity. 
In 2015, we were the fastest-growing chocolate company in Brazil as retail takeaway increased about 13%, resulting in a share gain of 0.2 point. In 2015, we successfully exited a JV and established our own sales team in secured logistics agreement. 
In 2016, we expect the growth will be driven by Hershey's brand, mainly through pricing and core innovation.
Constant currency net sales in India declined in line with estimates around the phase out of our edible oils product. This completes our transition to a confectionery and snacks-based portfolio. We believe the macroeconomic environment and competitive activity in the international markets where we operate will continue to be a headwind for the chocolate category and Hershey in 2016. 
Therefore, we estimate constant currency international and other segment net sales growth of mid- to high single digits in 2016. Over the long term, we expect global economies and category trends to improve, and our international business on a constant currency basis will contribute about 1 point to our overall long-term sales targets. 
Despite the aforementioned macroeconomic issues facing consumers and competitive activity, we believe the global confectionery category will continue to grow. We'll continue to invest in our core brands in the U.S. as well as capabilities related to knowledge and insights. And despite the slowdown in international markets, we'll build on the strategies we've established as they'll benefit the company over the long term. We'll also make investments in our existing snacks platform as it will provide us with another lever of growth. These initiatives should enable us to achieve long-term constant currency net sales growth of 3% to 5%. Given the scale advantages of our North America business and a balanced approach to international investments, the company expects to generate long-term earnings per share diluted growth of 6% to 8%. 
Patricia will provide you with all the financial details, but we believe our innovation, advertising, consumer investments and insights work within our confectionery and snacks business should enable us to deliver on our 2016 objectives. Although note that sales and earnings were built throughout the year as our Q1 profile will continue to be pressured. 
For the full year, excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange of about 1 point, constant currency net sales growth is expected to be around 3%, resulting in an increase of adjusted earnings per share diluted of about 6%. 
As we look to the long-term, I remain encouraged by our prospects. Hershey has many opportunities to leverage its U.S. scale, global brands and core capabilities. Additionally, we're continuously examining our manufacturing footprint and overall cost structure and believe opportunities exist to maintain and improve margins. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, and we'll continue to be disciplined and opened to sources of growth via M&A. I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with some additional details on our financial results."

Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Fourth quarter net sales of $1.91 billion decreased 5% versus last year and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.08, an increase of 3.8% versus last year. Excluding t",1877,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Fourth quarter net sales of $1.91 billion decreased 5% versus last year and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.08, an increase of 3.8% versus last year. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.9 points, net sales declined 3.1%. Pricing and net acquisitions and divestitures were a 1 point and a 40 basis point benefit, respectively, offset by 4.5 points of lower volume due to slightly lower sales in North America versus estimates and the expected sales decline in China.
Fourth quarter North America net sales were slightly below expectations due to a decline in spreads in baking chips sales due to increased competitive activity; a focus on inventory levels at select retailers, most likely looking to manage working capital; and slightly lower seasonal sales than anticipated. 
Excluding the 1 point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 1.2% versus the year-ago period. Net price realization in this segment was a 2.3 point benefit and volume was off 1.4 points. On a net basis, the Alan Candy and Krave acquisitions and divestiture were a 30 basis point benefit. 
Total international and other segment net sales for the fourth quarter declined about 27% versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates and trade promotion were unfavorable by 5.7 and 4.2 points, respectively. 
In October, Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition sales were a 1.1 point benefit. The international and other segment core business volume was off about 18 points, due primarily to the China chocolate business and Golden Monkey November and December performance that was less than a year ago.
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin increased 80 basis points in the fourth quarter. However, this was less than our forecast. Gross margin expansion was driven by net price realization, which was off versus our estimates. Supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by obsolescence, other supply chain costs due to lower volumes and slightly higher commodities. We did benefit from lower dairy. However, this was offset by the higher cost of simple ingredients. 
Recall during fourth quarter, we nationally debuted Holiday Hershey's Kisses milk chocolates and Hershey's milk chocolate bars with simple ingredients and no artificial flavors. These are some of the first products of Hershey's to transition to simple ingredients, a commitment announced last year. 
Operating profit in the fourth quarter increased 1.3% versus last year, resulting in operating profit margin of 19.9%. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and lower SM&A, selling, marketing and administrative expenses. SM&A, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing and acquisitions into the future, declined 5.9%, driven by the implementation of the business productivity initiatives announced in June and the company's continued focus on nonessential SM&A spending. Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined around 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by planned reductions in international spending. 
North America on-air advertising was higher in the fourth quarter. Although advertising and related consumer marketing expense for the quarter was in line with the year-ago period as production costs were less than anticipated. For the full year, North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 3.1%. Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. As J.P. mentioned earlier, we reach an agreement late in December to acquire the remaining 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey. The agreement is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016 subject to government approval. We are concentrating on bringing the businesses together and focus on optimizing the structure for top line growth. This is still a work in progress and we'll share our plans with you in the future. 
In the near-term, the business will not get back to the operating income level of 2014 and will be a drag on total company operating profit in 2016. China chocolate category performance continues to be below the historical growth rate of 11% to 12%. 
In fourth quarter, the China chocolate category was down about 13% as marketplace trends float across all channels, affecting all major manufacturers. This contraction impacted our Chinese New Year sell-in. China chocolate category growth in 2016 is expected to be flat to slightly up versus 2016. We estimate that our retail takeaway will be relatively in line with category performance. 
In 2016, our China chocolate operating loss is expected to improve versus 2015 as we expect trade promotion to be lower. However, margins will be pressured given the decline in growth in sales volume. 
Mexico fourth quarter net sales in local currency were about flat versus last year. For the full year, local currency sales increased 6%. 
Brazil fourth quarter local currency net sales were down slightly versus last year, given  the tough macroeconomic environment and competitive activity. As a result, we're managing our cost and focusing on core brand SKUs that we think will enable us to improve our profitability in these 2 markets. 
India fourth quarter local currency sales declined about 60% and were in line with our estimates as we phased out sales of edible oils at the end of the third quarter. We expect this to continue to be a headwind for the first 8 months of 2016. 
Moving down to P&L. Fourth quarter interest expense of $19.2 million declined $2.1 million versus last year or 9.7%. 
For the full year, interest expense was $76 million and was in line with our previous estimate. In 2016, we expect interest expense to be about $85 million to $90 million. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29.3% and 33.2% for the full year, slightly better than our estimates. 
In the fourth quarter, we recorded $25 million within the other income and expense line related to the previously mentioned U.S. government investment tax credits. 
In 2016, we expect to purchase about the same amount of tax credits as we did last year, which should result in an adjusted tax rate similar to 2015. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 219 [ph] million shares, down 5 million versus last year and about a $0.02 benefit in the quarter, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.08 or an increase of 3.8% versus a year ago. 
Now let me provide a quick recap of year-to-date results. Year-to-date net sales decreased 0.5%. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 1.1% versus the year-ago period. Operating profit increased 1.8%, resulting in operating profit margin of 20%. Year-to-date adjusted gross margins was 46% versus 44.9% last year or 110 basis points higher as a result of net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher input costs and slightly higher commodity costs. 
Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share diluted increased about 3.5% to $4.12 per share. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the fourth quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's fourth quarter by $40 million. Accounts receivable were higher by $2 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $15 million and accounts payable declined by $8 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $119 million in the fourth quarter and $357 million for the year, in line with our forecast. This included capital related to the manufacturing facility in Malaysia. 
In 2016, we expect CapEx to be in the $285 million to $295 million range. 
During the fourth quarter, depreciation and amortization was $62 million and dividends paid were $123 million. No shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter under approved program. And to date, $230 million of outstanding shares have been repurchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015. 
For the full year, the company repurchased $403 million of outstanding shares. In addition, the company repurchased $15 million of common shares in the quarter and $180 million year-to-date to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.
This morning, we announced that the board approved an additional $500 million share repurchase program that will commence after the current program is completed. This authorization is the result of the company's strong balance sheet and confidence that will deliver long-term earnings per share diluted growth of 6% to 8%. 
We believe this business model will enable the company to generate meaningful and predictable cash flow from operations. 
As such, we'll continue to have board-level discussions related to capital structure, including dividend increases, value-added share buybacks and M&A opportunities. Cash-on-hand at the end of the quarter was $347 million. This is lower than a year ago, primarily due to acquisitions and share buybacks. 
In 2015, we faced a number of challenges as a result of changing shopping behavior and greater levels of competition. Our plans for 2016 and beyond reflect the reality of the current retail and consumer environment. We are confident in our ability over the long term to execute at retail and provide consumers with CMG and snack products that can drive growth. 
As J.P. mentioned, we'll continue to invest in our core brands in the U.S. and key international market and build on the strategies we have established as they will benefit the company over the long-term. We'll also make incremental investments in our existing snacks platform as it will provide us with another level -- lever of growth. 
This initiative should enable us to achieve long-term constant currency net sales growth of 3% to 5%. 
Given the scale advantages of our North America CMG business, snacks margins that are lower than the company average and a balanced approach to international investments, the company expects to generate long-term adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of 6% to 8%. 
For the full year, excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange of about 1 point, constant currency net sales growth is expected to increase around 3%. The company expects gross margin to be about the same as last year. The business productivity initiatives announced on June is on track, and the company is also focused on nonessential SM&A spending as it continues to leverage existing resources. 
Additionally, we'll continue to invest in advertising and related consumer marketing, including a greater shift to digital and mobile communications. As a result, the company expects adjusted earnings per share diluted to increase around 6%. 
Before we open it up to Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on some of the items pressuring the first quarter. First, Easter is a week shorter this year. Also, merchandising and display space would be lower at select retailers as we will not lap our new floor designs until late in the second quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, some of them are also focusing on carrying lower levels of inventory. As J.P. stated, direct trade would also be higher to ensure that we maintain the right mix of quality merchandising and promotional price points. Competition for this space in the store is robust. And we continue to listen to the consumer and invest in simple ingredients, which we're currently purchasing at a slight premium to traditional ingredients. 
Thank you for your time this morning, and we'll now take any questions you may have."

We're doing well in jars, and we've seen some price value issues in the consumables. And then I'd say the other pieces when it comes to CMG, we gain share in the season.

So I think we've been fairly clear in terms of how we talked about the confectionery environment. If I go beyond broader snacks, the comment I would make, specifically to meat snacks, is that in the premium segment that we compete, the meat snacks business continues to be up about 25%. Overall, meat has slowed a bit in terms of growth. And of course, for part of our focus is continue to build distribution around the Krave business. And then, also, you'll see us introducing some extended items to the current line that we have as we build out that distribution. So from that standpoint, I don't think it's a significant difference. It's probably a positive for us. If you think about broader snacking, I think I had said in the previous call that if you look over the last 18 to 24 months, there was about 80 SKUs which have been added in that segment. And therefore, it's more fragmented as before it gets consumer different alternatives for trial. And therefore, we've seen some competitiveness and a little bit of competitive pressure from there. But I think, again, it comes back to making sure in each segment that we compete that we're winning merchandising and display as we talked about earlier.

So while we don't have all of the analytics back on the spend based on what we know to date, we felt pretty good about it. And one other thing I would just point out is, as you look at the takeaway, as we've launched Snack Mix and Snack Bites, which is key innovation on our core brands, it's actually -- the Snack Mix piece is rolling into the salty snack category and not CMG. So as you look at everyday takeaway, just keep that in mind."

But when you're thinking and looking at the consumer, I know you do a lot of consumer-insights work. Do you see any big mega regions or shifts by the consumer that are things that you could adjust to? You mentioned in the release today that the consumer wants simpler ingredients.

If you look at the chocolate category, it was up. We were up pretty consistent with the category. If you look at non-chocolate, we actually lagged in the category. And then if you look at gum and also mint, we would have outperformed the category on those segments. We have deemphasized a little bit the level of activity that we've had in some of our sweets business. And so that's certainly showing up in the business. One brand in particular was a great brand. But if we just look at the absolute programming we've had on a brand like Twizzlers, it was a little bit lower. And that ended up showing up some in the overall business. If you look at the sweets business in some of the channels where it does well, you can also follow that with, call it, income cohorts. And one of the things that we're doing in 2016 is using our candy acquisition to leverage a portfolio there on peg bags in where we -- in select places where we think that can really benefit us. So we did see within that segment, an opportunity, and we're going to try to leverage that as well. And then some of our competitors also had the emphasis on some of those brands which also would have had an influence in our performance as well."

Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements, which are forward looking. These statements are based on our current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. 
The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss 4Q results, excluding net free tax charges of $39 million or $0.10 per share diluted, primarily related to the productivity initiative announced in June, a non-service-related pension expense and acquisition and integration charges. Our discussions of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. 
With that out of the way, let turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

We made progress against many of our strategic initiatives in 2015. And despite a difficult environment in the second half of the year, we delivered adjusted earnings per share diluted growth within the targeted range we provided during our second quarter conference call.
Fourth quarter net sales on a constant currency basis were slightly below our expectations and declined about 3%. North America gross margin expansion resulted in solid operating profit growth, and we continued to hold the line on overall expense control. Hershey U.S. CMG retail takeaway sequentially improved from Q3 to Q4, and increased plus 2.5%, although market share was off about 0.2 point. Seasonal Performance was good, and we gained market share in both Halloween and holiday. 
Our fourth quarter marketplace performance was similar to the full year. Specifically, combined fourth quarter retail takeaway at one of our largest retailers and within the dollar and drug channels, was a solid plus 6%. The drug class of trade was driven by our precision initiatives, while the other 2 channels were winners from a consumer trips perspective. However, in the remaining channels, our combined retail takeaway was only slightly up. While small, we also had meaningful gains in non-measured channels such as e-commerce and food service. For the full year, Hershey U.S. CMG retail takeaway increased 2.4% and was largely in line with category growth. As a result for the 52 weeks ended December 26, 2015, Hershey U.S. market share was an industry-leading 31.3%. Following a period of relatively consistent marketplace success, where we outperformed the category, our momentum slowed in the second half of 2015 and was relatively in line with the CMG category as a result of increased competitive activity within CMG and broader snacks. Over the last 3 years, the average growth rate of the CMG category was about 2.3%, below the long-term historical average of 3% to 4%. As we previously discussed, the category is being impacted by many of the same issues facing other food categories, including change in shopping habits, like channel shifting; increased competitive activity and some retailers adjusting their merchandising practices; and a proliferation of broader snack SKUs. As a result, going forward, we estimate that CMG category growth will be in the 2.5% to 3% range. Our goal is to outpace the category and gain share on an annual basis. Additionally, we have good visibility into our developing snacks portfolio and expect positive sales contributions from it in 2016. 
Given our solid CMG position in North America and the investments we'll continue to make in our snacks business, we expect our North American segment to generate long-term, constant currency annual net sales growth of 3% to 4%. As we look to 2016 and beyond, we're taking actions that we believe will enable us to regain our North America market placement momentum over our strategic planning cycles. 
Some of the things you'll see in the marketplace in 2016 to address broader snacking, income bifurcation and lower trips include a broad-based launch of substantial snacking items, including Brookside bars, Snack Mix and Snack Bites canisters as well as increased distribution of Krave meat snacks. You'll see incremental investments related to core CMG merchandising and display activity and the introduction of branded pods that bring our brands to life in store. Although, note that this will result in higher trade promotion as we strive to maintain the right mix of quality merchandising and related promotional price points. 
We'll also launch Cadbury chocolates in a stand-up pouch targeting the mass premium market and begin a 500-store test featuring Scharffen Berger and Dagoba organic brands. And we'll introduce Allan Candy sugar confectionery items in peg bags to appeal to the cost-conscious consumer. This is just a brief summary of some of the activity we have in North America this year.
Now for an update on our international business. In late December, we reached an agreement to acquire the remaining 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, subject to government approval. While the category of business has experienced slower growth, we're committed to the China market, and the acquisition of Golden Monkey is important to Hershey's future growth. We believe in the complementary advantages of Hershey and Golden Monkey and the opportunity that we have with these businesses together. 
Earlier this month, we kicked off the year of the Golden Monkey campaign. The key elements of the campaign include activating TV and mobile advertising and executing merchandising and display at retail. This is well underway as it started in early January. 
Our China chocolate fourth quarter net sales results were less than our expectations as we adjusted our sell-in for Chinese New Year, given category softness. In Q4, the contraction of the China chocolate category accelerated and was down about 13%. As a result for the full year, the category was about flat versus last year. In a slowing category and our overweighting in hypermarkets, this has impacted our performance negatively. 
In 2015, Hershey retail takeaway was off 11%, and market share declined 1.1 points to 8.5%. Similar to what we've discussed over the last year, category performance is being impacted by macroeconomic issues and the related impact it's having on consumer shopping behavior and confidence. And given the China news flow that we've all seen, it continues to be difficult to gauge the consumer's behavior. We're focused on the integration of our businesses and building distribution on our portfolio. And while small, our e-commerce business in China is a bright spot. 
In the fourth quarter, our e-commerce business increased over 75%, driven by solid China Singles Day performance. For the year, our China chocolate e-commerce retail takeaway outpaced the category. In 2016, we'll continue to invest in our e-commerce platform, increase Brookside distribution and trial and focus on channel development. 
In Mexico, net sales in local currency for the quarter were about flat versus previous year. For the full year, local currency sales increased 6%. Within the chocolate category, we're seeing investments by all major manufacturers in the form of new products and core brand investments. As a result, our chocolate marketplace performance has lagged the category. 
Chocolate market share in the modern trade in Mexico for the year is off, as our retail takeaway of about 4% lagged category growth of about 12%. In 2016, within the modern trade, we'll concentrate on portfolio core chocolate Hershey's and Kisses franchises and our small but profitable grocery-branded items. Our traditional trade initiative with Sigma is progressing, and we expect our market share here to improve this year. 
In Brazil, local currency net sales in Q4 were slightly down versus last year, given the macroeconomic environment and competitive activity. In 2015, we were the fastest-growing chocolate company in Brazil as retail takeaway increased about 13%, resulting in a share gain of 0.2 point. In 2015, we successfully exited the Bauducco JV and established our own sales team and secured logistics agreements. In 2016, we expect that growth will be driven by Hershey's brand, mainly through pricing and core innovation.
Constant currency net sales in India declined in line with estimates around the phase out of our edible oils products. This completes our transition to a confectionery and snacks-based portfolio. We believe the macroeconomic environment and competitive activity in the international markets where we operate will continue to be a headwind for the chocolate category and Hershey in 2016. 
Therefore, we estimate constant currency International and Other segment net sales growth of mid- to high single digits in 2016. Over the long term, we expect global economies and category trends to improve, and that our national business and our international business on a constant currency basis will contribute about 1 point to our overall long-term sales target. 
Despite the aforementioned macroeconomic issues facing consumers and competitive activity, we believe the global confectionery category will continue to grow. We'll continue to invest in our core brands in the U.S. as well as capabilities related to knowledge and insights. And despite the slowdown in international markets, we'll build on the strategies that we've established as they'll benefit the company over the long term. We'll also make incremental investments in our existing snacks platform as it will provide us with another lever of growth. These initiatives should enable us to achieve long-term, constant currency net sales growth of 3% to 5%. Given the scale advantages of our North America business and a balanced approach to international investments, the company expects to generate long-term earnings per share diluted growth of 6% to 8%. 
Patricia will provide you with all the financial details, but we believe our innovation, advertising, consumer investments and insights work within our confectionery and snacks business should enable us to deliver on our 2016 objectives. Although note that sales and earnings will build throughout the year as our Q1 profile will continue to be pressured. 
For the full year, excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange of about 1 point, constant currency net sales growth is expected to be around 3%, resulting in an increase of adjusted earnings per share diluted of about 6%. As we look to the long-term, I remain encouraged by our prospects. Hershey has many opportunities to leverage its U.S. scale, global brands and core capabilities. Additionally, we're continuously examining our manufacturing footprint and overall cost structure and believe opportunities exist to maintain and improve margins. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, and we'll continue to be disciplined and open to sources of growth via M&A. 
I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with some additional details on our financial results."

Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Fourth quarter net sales of $1.91 billion decreased 5% versus last year and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.08, an increase of 3.8% versus last year. Excluding t",1878,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Fourth quarter net sales of $1.91 billion decreased 5% versus last year and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.08, an increase of 3.8% versus last year. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.9 points, net sales declined 3.1%. Pricing and net acquisitions and divestitures were 1 point and a 40 basis point benefit, respectively, offset by 4.5 points of lower volume due to slightly lower sales in North America versus estimates and the expected sales decline in China.
Fourth quarter North America net sales were slightly below expectations due to a decline in spreads and baking chips sale due to increased competitive activity; a focus on inventory levels at select retailers, most likely looking to manage working capital; and slightly lower seasonal sales than anticipated. Excluding the 1 point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 1.2% versus the year-ago period. Net price realization in this segment was a 2.3 point benefit, and volume was off 1.4 points. On a net basis, the Allan Candy and Krave acquisitions and the Mauna Loa divestiture were a 30 basis point benefit. 
Total International and Other segment net sales for the fourth quarter declined about 27% versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates and trade promotion were unfavorable by 5.7 and 4.2 points, respectively. And October, Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition sales were a 1.1 point benefit. The International and Other segment core business volume was off about 18 points, due primarily to the China chocolate business and Golden Monkey November and December performance that was less than a year ago.
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin increased 80 basis points in the fourth quarter, however, this was less than our forecast. Gross margin expansion was driven by net price realization, which was off versus our estimates; supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by obsolescence; other supply chain costs due to lower volumes; and slightly higher commodities. We did benefit from lower dairy, however, this was offset by the higher cost of simple ingredients. 
Recall during fourth quarter, we nationally debuted Holiday Hershey's Kisses Milk Chocolates and Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars made with simple ingredients and no artificial flavors. These are some of the first products of Hershey's to transition to simple ingredients, a commitment announced last year. 
Operating profit in the fourth quarter increased 1.3% versus last year, resulting in operating profit margin of 19.9%. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and lower SM&A, selling, marketing and administrative expenses. SM&A, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing in acquisitions and divestitures, declined 5.9%, driven by the implementation of the business productivity initiative announced in June and the company's continued focus on nonessential SM&A spending. Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined around 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by planned reductions in international spending. 
North America on-air advertising was higher in the fourth quarter, although advertising and related consumer marketing expense for the quarter was in line with the year-ago period, as production costs were less than anticipated. For the full year, North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 3.1%. 
Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. As J.P. mentioned earlier, we reach an agreement in late December to acquire the remaining 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey. The agreement is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, subject to government approval. We are concentrating on bringing the businesses together and focused on optimizing the structure for top line growth. This is still a work in progress, and we'll share our plans with you in the future. In the near term, the business will not get back to the operating income level of 2014 and will be a drag on total company operating profit in 2016. 
China chocolate category performance continues to be below the historical growth rate of 11% to 12%. In fourth quarter, the China chocolate category was down about 13% as marketplace trends slowed across all channels, affecting all major manufacturers. This contraction impacted our Chinese New Year sell-in. China chocolate category growth in 2016 is expected to be flat to slightly up versus 2015. We estimate that our retail takeaway will be relatively in line with category performance.
In 2016, our China chocolate operating loss is expected to improve versus 2015, as we expect trade promotion to be lower. However, margins will be pressured given the decline in growth sales volume. 
Mexico fourth quarter net sales in local currency were about flat versus last year. For the full year, local currency sales increased 6%. Brazil fourth quarter local currency net sales were down slightly versus last year, given the tough macroeconomic environment and competitive activity. As a result, we're managing our cost and focusing on core brand SKUs that we think will enable us to improve our profitability in these 2 markets. 
India fourth quarter local currency sales declined about 60% and were in line with estimates as we phased out sales of edible oils at the end of the third quarter. We expect this to continue to be a headwind for the first 8 months of 2016. 
Moving down to P&L. Fourth quarter interest expense of $19.2 million declined $2.1 million versus last year or 9.7%. For the full year, interest expense was $76 million and was in line with our previous estimate. In 2016, we expect interest expense to be about $85 million to $90 million. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29.3% and 33.2% for the full year, slightly better than our estimates. 
In the fourth quarter, we recorded $25 million within the other income and expense line related to the previously mentioned U.S. government investment tax credits. In 2016, we expect to purchase about the same amount of tax credits as we did last year, which should result in an adjusted tax rate that's similar to 2015. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 219 million shares, down 5 million versus last year and about a $0.02 benefit in the quarter, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.08 or an increase of 3.8% versus a year ago. 
Now let me provide a quick recap of year-to-date results. Year-to-date net sales decreased 0.5%. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 1.1% versus the year-ago period. Operating profit increased 1.8%, resulting in operating profit margin of 20%. Year-to-date adjusted gross margin was 46% versus 44.9% last year, or 110 basis points higher as a result of net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher input costs and slightly higher commodity costs. Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share diluted increased about 3.5% to $4.12 per share. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the fourth quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's fourth quarter by $40 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $2 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $15 million and accounts payable declined by $8 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $119 million in the fourth quarter and $357 million for the year, in line with our forecast. This included capital related to the manufacturing facility in Malaysia. In 2016, we expect CapEx to be in the $285 million to $295 million range. 
During the fourth quarter, depreciation and amortization was $62 million and dividends paid were $123 million. No shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter under approved program. And to date, $230 million of outstanding shares have been repurchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015. 
For the full year, the company repurchased $403 million of outstanding shares. In addition, the company repurchased $15 million of common shares in the quarter and $180 million year-to-date to replace share issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.
This morning, we announced that the board approved an additional $500 million share repurchase program that will commence after the current program is completed. This authorization is the result of the company's strong balance sheet and confidence that we'll deliver long-term earnings per share diluted growth of 6% to 8%. 
We believe this business model will enable the company to generate meaningful and predictable cash flow from operations. As such, we'll continue to have board-level discussions related to capital structure, including dividend increases, value-added share buybacks and M&A opportunities. 
Cash-on-hand at the end of the quarter was $347 million. This is lower than a year ago, primarily due to acquisitions and share buybacks. 
In 2015, we faced a number of challenges as a result of changing shopping behavior and greater levels of competition. Our plans for 2016 and beyond reflect the reality of the current retail and consumer environment. We are confident in our ability over the long term to execute at retail and provide consumers with CMG and snack products that can drive growth. 
As J.P. mentioned, we'll continue to invest in our core brands in the U.S. and key international market and build on the strategies we have established as they will benefit the company over the long term. We'll also make incremental investments in our existing snacks platform, as it will provide us with another level -- lever of growth. These initiatives should enable us to achieve long-term, constant currency net sales growth of 3% to 5%. 
Given the scale advantages of our North America CMG business, snacks margins that are lower than the company average and a balanced approach to international investments, the company expects to generate long-term adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of 6% to 8%. 
For the full year, excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange of about 1 point, constant currency net sales growth is expected to increase around 3%. The company expects gross margin to be about the same as last year. The business productivity initiative announced in June is on track, and the company is also focused on nonessential SM&A spending, as it continues to leverage existing resources. 
Additionally, we'll continue to invest in advertising and related consumer marketing, including a greater shift to digital and mobile communications. As a result, the company expects adjusted earnings per share diluted to increase around 6%. 
Before we open it up to Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on some of the items pressuring the first quarter. First, Easter is a week shorter this year. Also, merchandising and display space will be lower at select retailers as we will not lap our new floor designs until late in second quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, some of them are also focusing on carrying lower levels of inventory. 
As J.P. stated, direct trade would also be higher to ensure that we maintain the right mix of quality merchandising and promotional price points. Competition for this space in the store is robust. And we continue to listen to the consumer and invest in simple ingredients, which we're currently purchasing at a slight premium to traditional ingredients. 
Thank you for your time this morning, and we'll now take any questions you may have."

So we had solid growth, but we didn't gain as much as we anticipated because, frankly, we saw more competitive activity during the marketplace.

So I think we've been fairly clear in terms of how we've talked about the confectionery environment. If I go beyond broader snacks, the comment I would make, specifically to meat snacks, is that in the premium segment that we compete, the meat snacks business continues to be up about 25%.

And then, also, you'll see us introducing some extended items in the current line that we have as we build out that distribution. So from that standpoint, I don't think it's a significant difference. It's probably a positive for us. If you think about broader snacking, I think I'd said on a previous call that, as you look over the last 18 to 24 months, there was about 80 SKUs, which have been added in that segment. And therefore, it's more fragmented than it has before. It gives the consumer different alternatives for trial.

We have deemphasized a little bit the level of activity that we've had in some of our sweets business, and so that's certainly showing up in the business. One brand in particular, it was a great brand. But if we just look at the absolute programming we've had on a brand like Twizzlers, it was a little bit lower, and that ended up showing up some in the overall business. If you look at the sweets business in some of the channels where it does well, you can also follow that with, call it, income cohorts. And one of the things that we're doing in 2016 is using our Allan Candy acquisition to leverage a portfolio there on peg bags in select places where we think that can really benefit us. So we did see within that segment, an opportunity, and we're going to try to leverage that as well.

Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements, which are forward looking. These statements are based on our current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. 
The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss 4Q results, excluding net free tax charges of $39 million or $0.10 per share diluted, primarily related to the productivity initiative announced in June, a non-service-related pension expense and acquisition and integration charges. Our discussions of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.

We made progress against many of our strategic initiatives in 2015. And despite a difficult environment in the second half of the year, we delivered adjusted earnings per share diluted growth within the targeted range we provided during our second quarter conference call.
Fourth quarter net sales on a constant currency basis were slightly below our expectations and declined about 3%. North America gross margin expansion resulted in solid operating profit growth, and we continued to hold the line on overall expense control. Hershey U.S. CMG retail takeaway sequentially improved from Q3 to Q4, and increased plus 2.5%, although market share was off about 0.2 point. Seasonal Performance was good, and we gained market share in both Halloween and holiday. 
Our fourth quarter marketplace performance was similar to the full year. Specifically, combined fourth quarter retail takeaway at one of our largest retailers and within the dollar and drug channels, was a solid plus 6%. The drug class of trade was driven by our precision initiatives, while the other 2 channels were winners from a consumer trips perspective. However, in the remaining channels, our combined retail takeaway was only slightly up. While small, we also had meaningful gains in non-measured channels such as e-commerce and food service. For the full year, Hershey U.S. CMG retail takeaway increased 2.4% and was largely in line with category growth. As a result for the 52 weeks ended December 26, 2015, Hershey's U.S. market share was an industry-leading 31.3%. Following a period of relatively consistent marketplace success, where we outperformed the category, our momentum slowed in the second half of 2015 and was relatively in line with the CMG category as a result of increased competitive activity within CMG and broader snacks. Over the last 3 years, the average growth rate of the CMG category was about 2.3%, below the long-term historical average of 3% to 4%. As we previously discussed, the category is being impacted by many of the same issues facing other food categories, including change in shopping habits, like channel shifting; increased competitive activity and some retailers adjusting their merchandising practices; and a proliferation of broader snack SKUs. As a result, going forward, we estimate that CMG category growth will be in the 2.5% to 3% range. Our goal is to outpace the category and gain share on an annual basis. Additionally, we have good visibility into our developing snacks portfolio and expect positive sales contributions from it in 2016. 
Given our solid CMG position in North America and the investments we'll continue to make in our snacks business, we expect our North American segment to generate long-term, constant currency annual net sales growth of 3% to 4%. As we look to 2016 and beyond, we're taking actions that we believe will enable us to regain our North America market placement momentum over our strategic planning cycles. 
Some of the things you'll see in the marketplace in 2016 to address broader snacking, income bifurcation and lower trips include a broad-based launch of substantial snacking items, including Brookside bars, Snack Mix and Snack Bites canisters as well as increased distribution of Krave meat snacks. You'll see incremental investments related to core CMG merchandising and display activity and the introduction of branded pods that bring our brands to life in store. Although, note that this will result in higher trade promotion as we strive to maintain the right mix of quality merchandising and related promotional price points. 
We'll also launch Cadbury chocolates in a stand-up pouch targeting the mass premium market and begin a 500-store test featuring Scharffen Berger and Dagoba organic brands. And we'll introduce Allan Candy sugar confectionery items in peg bags to appeal to the cost-conscious consumer. This is just a brief summary of some of the activity we have in North America this year.
Now for an update on our international business. In late December, we reached an agreement to acquire the remaining 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, subject to government approval. While the category of business has experienced slower growth, we're committed to the China market, and the acquisition of Golden Monkey is important to Hershey's future growth. We believe in the complementary advantages of Hershey and Golden Monkey and the opportunity that we have with these businesses together. 
Earlier this month, we kicked off the year of the Golden Monkey campaign. The key elements of the campaign include activating TV and mobile advertising and executing merchandising and display at retail. This is well underway as it started in early January. 
Our China chocolate fourth quarter net sales results were less than our expectations as we adjusted our sell-in for Chinese New Year, given category softness. In Q4, the contraction of the China chocolate category accelerated and was down about 13%. As a result for the full year, the category was about flat versus last year. In a slowing category and our overweighting in hypermarkets, this has impacted our performance negatively. 
In 2015, Hershey retail takeaway was off 11%, and market share declined 1.1 points to 8.5%. Similar to what we've discussed over the last year, category performance is being impacted by macroeconomic issues and the related impact it's having on consumer shopping behavior and confidence. And given the China news flow that we've all seen, it continues to be difficult to gauge the consumer's behavior. We're focused on the integration of our businesses and building distribution on our portfolio. And while small, our e-commerce business in China is a bright spot. 
In the fourth quarter, our e-commerce business increased over 75%, driven by solid China Singles Day performance. For the year, our China chocolate e-commerce retail takeaway outpaced the category. In 2016, we'll continue to invest in our e-commerce platform, increase Brookside distribution and trial and focus on channel development. 
In Mexico, net sales in local currency for the quarter were about flat versus previous year. For the full year, local currency sales increased 6%. Within the chocolate category, we're seeing investments by all major manufacturers in the form of new products and core brand investments. As a result, our chocolate marketplace performance has lagged the category. 
Chocolate market share in the modern trade in Mexico for the year is off, as our retail takeaway of about 4% lagged category growth of about 12%. In 2016, within the modern trade, we'll concentrate on portfolio core chocolate Hershey's and Kisses franchises and our small but profitable grocery-branded items. Our traditional trade initiative with Sigma is progressing, and we expect our market share here to improve this year. 
In Brazil, local currency net sales in Q4 were slightly down versus last year, given the macroeconomic environment and competitive activity. In 2015, we were the fastest-growing chocolate company in Brazil as retail takeaway increased about 13%, resulting in a share gain of 0.2 points. In 2015, we successfully exited the Bauducco JV and established our own sales team and secured logistics agreements. In 2016, we expect that growth will be driven by Hershey's brand, mainly through pricing and core innovation.
Constant currency net sales in India declined in line with estimates around the phase out of our edible oils products. This completes our transition to a confectionery and snacks-based portfolio. We believe the macroeconomic environment and competitive activity in the international markets where we operate will continue to be a headwind for the chocolate category and Hershey in 2016. 
Therefore, we estimate constant currency International and Other segment net sales growth of mid- to high single digits in 2016. Over the long term, we expect global economies and category trends to improve, and that our national business and our international business on a constant currency basis will contribute about 1 point to our overall long-term sales target. 
Despite the aforementioned macroeconomic issues facing consumers and competitive activity, we believe the global confectionery category will continue to grow. We'll continue to invest in our core brands in the U.S. as well as capabilities related to knowledge and insights. And despite the slowdown in international markets, we'll build on the strategies that we've established as they'll benefit the company over the long term. We'll also make incremental investments in our existing snacks platform as it will provide us with another lever of growth. These initiatives should enable us to achieve long-term, constant currency net sales growth of 3% to 5%. Given the scale advantages of our North America business and a balanced approach to international investments, the company expects to generate long-term earnings per share diluted growth of 6% to 8%. 
Patricia will provide you with all the financial details, but we believe our innovation, advertising, consumer investments and insights work within our confectionery and snacks business should enable us to deliver on our 2016 objectives. Although note that sales and earnings will build throughout the year as our Q1 profile will continue to be pressured. 
For the full year, excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange of about 1 point, constant currency net sales growth is expected to be around 3%, resulting in an increase of adjusted earnings per share diluted of about 6%. As we look to the long-term, I remain encouraged by our prospects. Hershey has many opportunities to leverage its U.S. scale, global brands and core capabilities. Additionally, we're continuously examining our manufacturing footprint and overall cost structure and believe opportunities exist to maintain and improve margins. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, and we'll continue to be disciplined and open to sources of growth via M&A. 
I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with some additional details on our financial results."
98873,321572764,922859,"The Hershey Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Fourth quarter net sales of $1.91 billion decreased 5% versus last year and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.08, an increase of 3.8% versus last year. Excluding t",1879,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Fourth quarter net sales of $1.91 billion decreased 5% versus last year and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.08, an increase of 3.8% versus last year. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.9 points, net sales declined 3.1%. Pricing and net acquisitions and divestitures were 1 point and a 40 basis point benefit, respectively, offset by 4.5 points of lower volume due to slightly lower sales in North America versus estimates and the expected sales decline in China.
Fourth quarter North America net sales were slightly below expectations due to a decline in spreads and baking chips sale due to increased competitive activity; a focus on inventory levels at select retailers, most likely looking to manage working capital; and slightly lower seasonal sales than anticipated. Excluding the 1 point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 1.2% versus the year-ago period. Net price realization in this segment was a 2.3 point benefit, and volume was off 1.4 points. On a net basis, the Allan Candy and Krave acquisitions and the Mauna Loa divestiture were a 30 basis point benefit. 
Total International and Other segment net sales for the fourth quarter declined about 27% versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates and trade promotion were unfavorable by 5.7 and 4.2 points, respectively. And October, Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition sales were a 1.1 point benefit. The International and Other segment core business volume was off about 18 points, due primarily to the China chocolate business and Golden Monkey November and December performance that was less than a year ago.
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin increased 80 basis points in the fourth quarter, however, this was less than our forecast. Gross margin expansion was driven by net price realization, which was off versus our estimates; supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by obsolescence; other supply chain costs due to lower volumes; and slightly higher commodities. We did benefit from lower dairy, however, this was offset by the higher cost of simple ingredients. 
Recall during fourth quarter, we nationally debuted Holiday Hershey's Kisses Milk Chocolates and Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars made with simple ingredients and no artificial flavors. These are some of the first products of Hershey's to transition to simple ingredients, a commitment announced last year. 
Operating profit in the fourth quarter increased 1.3% versus last year, resulting in operating profit margin of 19.9%. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and lower SM&A, selling, marketing and administrative expenses. SM&A, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing in acquisitions and divestitures, declined 5.9%, driven by the implementation of the business productivity initiative announced in June and the company's continued focus on nonessential SM&A spending. Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined around 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by planned reductions in international spending. 
North America on-air advertising was higher in the fourth quarter, although advertising and related consumer marketing expense for the quarter was in line with the year-ago period, as production costs were less than anticipated. For the full year, North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 3.1%. 
Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. As J.P. mentioned earlier, we reach an agreement in late December to acquire the remaining 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey. The agreement is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, subject to government approval. We are concentrating on bringing the businesses together and focused on optimizing the structure for top line growth. This is still a work in progress, and we'll share our plans with you in the future. In the near term, the business will not get back to the operating income level of 2014 and will be a drag on total company operating profit in 2016. 
China chocolate category performance continues to be below the historical growth rate of 11% to 12%. In fourth quarter, the China chocolate category was down about 13% as marketplace trends slowed across all channels, affecting all major manufacturers. This contraction impacted our Chinese New Year sell-in. China chocolate category growth in 2016 is expected to be flat to slightly up versus 2015. We estimate that our retail takeaway will be relatively in line with category performance.
In 2016, our China chocolate operating loss is expected to improve versus 2015, as we expect trade promotion to be lower. However, margins will be pressured given the decline in growth sales volume. 
Mexico fourth quarter net sales in local currency were about flat versus last year. For the full year, local currency sales increased 6%. Brazil fourth quarter local currency net sales were down slightly versus last year, given the tough macroeconomic environment and competitive activity. As a result, we're managing our costs and focusing on core brand SKUs that we think will enable us to improve our profitability in these 2 markets. 
India fourth quarter local currency sales declined about 60% and were in line with estimates as we phased out sales of edible oils at the end of the third quarter. We expect this to continue to be a headwind for the first 8 months of 2016. 
Moving down the P&L. Fourth quarter interest expense of $19.2 million declined $2.1 million versus last year or 9.7%. For the full year, interest expense was $76 million and was in line with our previous estimate. In 2016, we expect interest expense to be about $85 million to $90 million. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29.3% and 33.2% for the full year, slightly better than our estimates. 
In the fourth quarter, we recorded $25 million within the other income and expense line related to the previously mentioned U.S. government investment tax credits. In 2016, we expect to purchase about the same amount of tax credits as we did last year, which should result in an adjusted tax rate that's similar to 2015. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 219 million shares, down 5 million versus last year and about a $0.02 benefit in the quarter, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.08 or an increase of 3.8% versus a year ago. 
Now let me provide a quick recap of year-to-date results. Year-to-date net sales decreased 0.5%. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 1.1% versus the year-ago period. Operating profit increased 1.8%, resulting in operating profit margin of 20%. Year-to-date adjusted gross margin was 46% versus 44.9% last year, or 110 basis points higher as a result of net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher input costs and slightly higher commodity costs. Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share diluted increased about 3.5% to $4.12 per share. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the fourth quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's fourth quarter by $40 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $2 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $15 million and accounts payable declined by $8 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $119 million in the fourth quarter and $357 million for the year, in line with our forecast. This included capital related to the manufacturing facility in Malaysia. In 2016, we expect CapEx to be in the $285 million to $295 million range. 
During the fourth quarter, depreciation and amortization was $62 million and dividends paid were $123 million. No shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter under our approved program. And to date, $230 million of outstanding shares have been repurchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015. 
For the full year, the company repurchased $403 million of outstanding shares. In addition, the company repurchased $15 million of common shares in the quarter and $180 million year-to-date to replace share issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.
This morning, we announced that the board approved an additional $500 million share repurchase program that will commence after the current program is completed. This authorization is the result of the company's strong balance sheet and confidence that we'll deliver long-term earnings per share diluted growth of 6% to 8%. 
We believe this business model will enable the company to generate meaningful and predictable cash flow from operations. As such, we'll continue to have board-level discussions related to capital structure, including dividend increases, value-added share buybacks and M&A opportunities. 
Cash-on-hand at the end of the quarter was $347 million. This is lower than a year ago, primarily due to acquisitions and share buybacks. 
In 2015, we faced a number of challenges as a result of changing shopping behavior and greater levels of competition. Our plans for 2016 and beyond reflect the reality of the current retail and consumer environment. We are confident in our ability over the long term to execute at retail and provide consumers with CMG and snack products that can drive growth. 
As J.P. mentioned, we'll continue to invest in our core brands in the U.S. and key international markets and build on the strategies we have established as they will benefit the company over the long term. We'll also make incremental investments in our existing snacks platform, as it will provide us with another level -- lever of growth. These initiatives should enable us to achieve long-term, constant currency net sales growth of 3% to 5%. 
Given the scale advantages of our North America CMG business, snacks margins that are lower than the company average and a balanced approach to international investments, the company expects to generate long-term adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of 6% to 8%. 
For the full year, excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange of about 1 point, constant currency net sales growth is expected to increase around 3%. The company expects gross margin to be about the same as last year. The business productivity initiative announced in June is on track, and the company is also focused on nonessential SM&A spending, as it continues to leverage existing resources. 
Additionally, we'll continue to invest in advertising and related consumer marketing, including a greater shift to digital and mobile communications. As a result, the company expects adjusted earnings per share diluted to increase around 6%. 
Before we open it up to Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on some of the items pressuring the first quarter. First, Easter is a week shorter this year. Also, merchandising and display space will be lower at select retailers as we will not lap their new floor designs until late in second quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, some of them are also focusing on carrying lower levels of inventory. 
As J.P. stated, direct trade would also be higher to ensure that we maintain the right mix of quality merchandising and promotional price points. Competition for this space in the store is robust. And we continue to listen to the consumer and invest in simple ingredients, which we're currently purchasing at a slight premium to traditional ingredients. 
Thank you for your time this morning, and we'll now take any questions you may have."

We're doing well in jars, and we've seen some price value issues in the instant consumables. And then I'd say the other piece is, when it comes to CMG, we gained share in the season. So we had solid growth, but we didn't gain as much as we anticipated because, frankly, we saw more competitive activity during the marketplace. And we have adjusted our plans, coming into the year this year, to really dial up to be even more competitive to regain that share momentum."

So I think we've been fairly clear in terms of how we've talked about the confectionery environment. If I go beyond broader snacks, the comment I would make, specifically to meat snacks, is that in the premium segment that we compete, the meat snacks business continues to be up about 25%. Overall, meat has slowed a bit in terms of growth. And of course, a core part of our focus is continue to build distribution around the Krave business. And then, also, you'll see us introducing some extended items to the current line that we have as we build out that distribution. So from that standpoint, I don't think it's a significant difference. It's probably a positive for us. If you think about broader snacking, I think I'd said on a previous call that, as you look over the last 18 to 24 months, there was about 80 SKUs, which have been added in that segment. And therefore, it's more fragmented than it has before. It gives the consumer different alternatives for trial. And therefore, we've seen some competitiveness and a little bit of competitive pressure from there. But I think, again, it comes back to making sure in each segment that we compete, that we're winning merchandising and display as we talked about earlier.

We have deemphasized a little bit the level of activity that we've had in some of our sweets business, and so that's certainly showing up in the business. One brand in particular, it was a great brand. But if we just look at the absolute programming we've had on a brand like Twizzlers, it was a little bit lower, and that ended up showing up some in the overall business. If you look at the sweets business in some of the channels where it does well, you can also follow that with, call it, income cohorts. And one of the things that we're doing in 2016 is using our Allan Candy acquisition to leverage a portfolio there on peg bags in select places where we think that can really benefit us.

Welcome to the Hershey Company's First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with a review of the results which will then be followed by a Q&A session. Let me remind everyone listening to today's conference call may be contain statements which are for lord looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risks and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copies posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the notes section on the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.
The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss first quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $27.8 million or $0.04 per share diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges, both of these are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.hersheycopany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
And with out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."
98873,330114018,962576,"The Hershey Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark.

However, nonseasonal candied mind and gum or CMG business was below expectation. The nonseasonal softness was more than offset by the timing of some merchandising and programming net sales that occurred in the first quarter that were initially expected to ship in the second quarter, netting to unplanned net sales delivery in North America.
Most of you are aware the soft retail takeaway performance across most of the CPG sector in the first quarter, especially in February. Easter timing in the current and year ago period makes it difficult to properly discern the current nonseasonal or every day candy trance. As a result, our full year net sales forecast reflects a tempering of nonseasonal everyday candy net sales growth.
As I'll discuss in a bit, North America CMG investments, including new products, advertising and increased levels of merchandising and display, accelerate in the second quarter and over the remainder of the year. Given the quality and level of these investments, there could be upside to our outlook.
In the first quarter, we are pleased with the gains we're making in Mexico and Brazil. As expected, China net sales declined in the first quarter. And more about this in a minute.
In January, I told you that we continue to look at our total cost structure. Building on that, today, we announced that we increased our annual savings target from continuous improvement and productivity programs from about $50 million to $70 million per year to about $100 million per year for the 3 years beginning in 2017.
Using a midpoint of the historical target, the incremental $120 million in savings results in a 3-year, $300 million initiative that should enable the company to continue to invest in its brands while also delivering on its earnings objectives.
We are off to a good start and expect that we'll exceed our initial 2016 productivity and savings target by $10 million to $15 million. Program savings will be generated from cost optimization across all segments of the business. Our focus on the cost structure enabled us to exceed our first quarter earnings expectations and deliver EPS growth versus the year-ago period.
This morning, we also announced that we're building on our better snacks portfolio expansion strategy with the purchase of the barkTHINS Snacking Chocolate line. Since its launch in 2013, Mark cents has quickly become a favorite snack brand due to its commitment to using simple ingredients, fair trade cocoa and non-GMO certification. BarkTHINS is a very attractive and uniquely crafted band that essentially created the chocolate thins category, a new form of chocolate snacking. We look forward to build barkTHINS by leveraging Hershey scale and retail. This acquisition builds on our snack strategy and complements our strong core confectionery portfolio, the heart of our company. And it adds strength and diversification to our offerings that allows Hershey to satisfy more consumer needs.
In the current environment, customers and consumers may seem increasingly focused on other snack categories, but the $25 billion CMG category is the largest segment of the $85 billion U.S. snack market. Customers and consumers, especially high-income consumers are increasingly looking for snacking alternatives. However, confection remains 1 of the top-selling snacking categories with household penetration of 94%.
So as you would expect, the majority of our time, effort and investments are focused on the CMG category. For example, we've done some extensive R&D and consumer market research over the last year that will result in a meaningful new product launch by year-end. And the barkTHINS acquisition will give us a chocolate snacking platform or, as we like to call it, snackfection to build upon. We are focused on our organic or innovation and growth as well as acquisition that meet the needs of the candy loyalists. CMG's variety seeking consumers who would like to try new things and consumers looking for better for new reassurance. 
Looking at U.S. marketplace performance, Nielsen retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ended March 26, 2016, benefits from an early Easter. Recall Easter was March 27 in 2016 and April 5 in 2015. As a result, CMG category growth was 8.7% for the 12 weeks ended March 26, 2016, within the xAOC plus C channels. Hershey's retail take away in the xAOC plus C universe increased 8.2%. Market share performance was in line with our expectations. Importantly, chocolate market share increased 0.10 point in Q1. However, this was offset by non-chocolate candy performance. As a reminder, the April Nielsen data will be impacted by the timing of Easter in the year-ago period.
Therefore, CMG and Hershey performance for the April year-to-date period will be less than Q1. Let me now build on my earlier comments and give you some details on our brand and in-store activity over the remainder of the year.
While we have already made investments, results have been solid. Specifically, Reese's market share is up 0.40 point in 2016, driven by new and refreshed television and digital marketing campaigns. Other brands that we're investing in include Kit Kat, where we launched a new Big Kat Kit Kat candy bar that is now available. And look for some interesting millennial-targeted created TV and digital campaigns using a Big Cat, literally storming the streets of New York. The Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey Snack Bites instant consumable items are off to a fast start with industry-leading innovation velocities. They are highly incremental to our base business and we're following it up with take-home canisters.
And we're also excited about some of the big in-store programming events such as our Classics promotion, our new team USA Summer Olympics sponsorship and Hershey's cross category in-store events, which leverages our new mega brand strategy. In the second half of the year, we'll also begin to communicate our simple ingredients message that will focus on Hershey bars and Kisses milk chocolate. And we also continued to gain share in gum with our category leading Ice Breakers brand. We've added additional capacity to meet demand, and we'll be supporting it with a new advertising campaign in Q2.
This is just a brief summary of the some of the strong activity we have in North America that will grow the business in the rest of the year.
Now for an update on our international business. Net sales were in line with our plan. Excluding China, where we knew sales would be down year-over-year as we lacked the slowdown that occurred after the 2015 Chinese New Year sell in, and the discontinued India oil business, constant currency net sales increased about 3.6%.
I was pleased with Mexico and Brazil, where constant currency first quarter net sales increased 4.2% and 9.6%, respectively. And in both markets, chocolate category growth was in the high single-digits.
In Mexico, we're optimizing mix to focus on global chocolate brands and building on our sigma relationship to accelerate coverage and share in the traditional trade. In Brazil, we're continuing to focus on the Hershey mega brand, milk chocolate tablet bars, cookies and cream and the wafer product. Constant currency net sales in India declined versus the year ago period due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business.
The media and vested brands, Jolly Rancher, -- and Hershey syrup where we are of our efforts and investments both all increase double digits. As we enter the second quarter, a new chapter for Hershey's in China begins as we merged the 2 teams into 1 united organization. Our initial plans impact some of our people and functions where there's some overlap. Savings here are not material at this point, but we're working towards balancing our business model in China versus our opportunities.
Importantly, in 2016, Golden Monkey got off to a good start with net sales below last year but in line with our plans and expectations. Most of these sales were made to quality distributors, who pay cash on delivery. We are executing against our plans to bring variety, news and excitement to the golden and munching monkey candy and snacks business. Confectionery innovation is focused on milk candies targeting young families, the better forming segment and Chinese classics, while protein-based snacks is concentrated on additional bean curd flavors and the introduction of a vegan and soy sausage. China chocolate category sales in Q1 declined about 10%, the low-end of our forecasted range. Given the slow start to the year, we adjusted our outlook for the year but still expect double-digit net sales growth in 2016, as we lap the trade funds that were necessary in the second and third quarters of 2015. Additionally, the remainder of the year, we'll be focused on establishing our new over brand message to reengage Hershey's and Kisses consumers.
This is tied into a fully integrated campaign, including TV advertising, digital communications and in-store merchandising that will bring the brands to live. While small, our e-commerce business in China continues to do well. In the first quarter, our e-commerce retail take away increased by 45% driven by Chinese New Year gifting sales. We continue to outpace the category and have a plus 10% share on the e-commerce chocolate market. Over the long term, we expect global economies and category trends to improve and that the investments in our international business to contribute about 1 point to our overall long-term sales target. 
Now to wrap up. From time to time, there are different confluences in the marketplace that can impact snacks and CMG growth. Hershey is always navigated and invested in its core CMG business throughout the cycles and has always ended up in a more solid position.
We are a consumer-centric, brand-building company focused on innovation and growth in every category where we participate, especially confectionery, and we want to satisfy the needs of our retail customers and new and existing consumers.
We take a long-term focus and continue to believe that investing in our business will benefit the company this year and well into the future.
I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results."

Adjusted ea",1526,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. First quarter net sales of $1.83 billion declined 5.6% versus last year, relatively in line with our forecast although partially due to the timing that J.P. referred to. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.10, an increase of about 1% versus last year due to greater-than-expected productivity and cost savings versus our January estimate.
Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.2 points, net sales declined 4.4% and was relatively in line with our forecast. Price realization on seasonal CMG products was more than offset by increased levels of resulting in a net price realization headwind of 50 basis points.
Volume was off [ph] 4.3 points due to a shorter Easter season and planned lower sales in China. Net acquisitions and divestitures were up 40 basis points benefit. By segment, first quarter North America net sales declined 4.3% versus last year due primarily to the shorter Easter season.
Excluding the 40 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales decreased 3.9% versus the year-ago period. Volume was off 3.7 points and a list price increase on seasonal CMG products was more than offset by increased levels of direct trade resulting in a net price realization headwind of 70 basis points.
As we mentioned in January, the direct trade was primarily related to programs in the marketplace. However, the aforementioned softness of every day nonpromoted items resulted in greater-than-accepted unfavorable price mix. The combined Alan Katie and Krave acquisition as well as the model divestiture were 50 basis point benefit. 
Total International and Other segment net sales for the first quarter declined 15.4% versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 7.3 points. The International and Other segment volume was off 8.4 points, due primarily to the net sales decline in China as selling related to Chinese New Year season was lower than last year.
International net price realization was a 1 point benefit and the impact of the model divestiture of 70 basis points headwind. 
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin increased 20 basis points in the first quarter driven by greater-than-expected supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and other supply chain costs.
On a net basis, commodity and packaging costs were slightly favorable. For the full year, we expect gross margin to be slightly down as greater productivity and cost savings and a slightly better environment at least for the time being is more than offset by installation and unfavorable sales mix given the update to our nonseasonal and instant consumable candy outlook in North America.
Operating profit in the first quarter was in line with a year ago period, resulting in operating profit margin of 21.5%, an increase of 120 basis points versus last year. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and lower SM&A, selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined about 10% versus the first quarter of 2015 due to timing. North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense is expected to increase over the remainder of 2016.
SM&A, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, declined 9.3%, driven by the implementation of the business productivity program announced last June and the company's continued focus on efficiency and cost savings initiatives.
Now let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I'm pleased there are total international business delivered on their Q1 plans. As J.P. stated, we're executing against our plans in the key markets of China, Mexico, Brazil and India and making good progress.
Adding to J.P.'s commentary on China, chocolate category contraction was greater than our estimate. Our updated forecast for the year reflects a return to growth, albeit at a lower level. In the broader economy doesn't improve, there could be further risks to our full year China chocolate and Golden Monkey sales forecast.
Distributor demand and net sales of Golden Monkey items have been consistent for the last 2 quarters driven by programs and products that are leveraging promotions associated with the lunar calendar year of the monkey. Given the increased level of in-store programming and innovation, we expect similar results over the next couple of quarters. Combined with a high leverage trade promotion that will be lapping, we're targeting Golden Monkey net sales to increase around 23% this year.
Moving down the corporate P&L, first quarter interest expense of $21 million increased $1.8 million versus last year. For the full year, we expect interest rate -- interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range, greater than our previous estimate of $85 million to $90 million due to the use of commercial paper related to the barks acquisitions -- acquisition. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 35% and in line with last year. In 2016, we expect to purchase about the same amount of tax credits as we did last year, which should result in an adjusted tax rate similar to 2015. In the second quarter, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be about 30% due to timing and purchase of tax credits.
For the first quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 217.5 million shares, down 5.2 million shares versus last year resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.10 or an increase of about 1% versus a year ago. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the first quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's first quarter by $25 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $63 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $25 million and accounts payable declined by $13 million. Total capital additions including software, were $41.4 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be in the $285 million to $295 million range.
During the first quarter, depreciation and amortization was $60 million, and dividends paid were $122 million. In the first quarter, the company repurchased $304 million of outstanding shares. $20 million were repurchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015, and $284 million were repurchased against the $500 million authorization approved in January 2016.
Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $286 million, slightly lower than a year ago. As J.P. mentioned earlier, today we announced the acquisition of the barkTHINS Snacking Chocolate line. We expect that the acquisition will be dilutive in 2016 and '17 primarily due to the booked amortization of intangibles before turning accretive in 2018.
The off cash purchase price and the near-term earnings solution is partially offset by about $50 million to $60 million in cash flow tax benefits associated with the tax amortization of intangible assets in the basis step up. The tax amortization provides a future cash flow benefit. As a result, netting the benefit against the growth acquisition purchase price was also a deal multiple that is similar to other high growth CPG assets.
As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of innovation, variety and use going into the marketplace. In-store merchandising and program activity is greater than last year, and advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase mid-to high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year over the next 3 quarters.
Therefore, for the full year, excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange approximately 1 point and the barkTHINS acquisition of about 0.5 point, net sales growth is expected to accelerate and increase to around 2%. This is less than the previous estimate of about 3% due to the previously mentioned lower-than-expected U.S. nonseasonal CMG growth and economic headwinds in China.
The category -- the company expects gross margin to be slightly lower than last year due to unfavorable mix related with lower nonseasonal sales. The business productivity initiatives announced in June and the incremental CIP savings are on track and should result in reduction in SM&A expenses as we continue to leverage existing resources. As a result, the company expects adjusted earnings per share diluted to increase 3% to 4% including dilution from acquisitions of $0.05 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.24 to $4.28 range. 
Before we open it up to Q&A, just a couple of on the second quarter. We expect constant currency net sales growth in Q2 to be greater than our full year outlook. However, the impact of unfavorable sales mix is greatest in the second quarter and may result in gross margin decline of 50 to 100 basis points. Additionally, advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase the most on a percentage basis versus last year in the second quarter. This is 1 of the levers in our marketing mix model that we believe will result in improved pull or retail takeaway in the second half of the year.
Therefore, we expect the EPS will be -- in the second quarter. Thank you for your time this morning, and we'll now take any questions you may have."

So up until last year, we used and met all the requirements to use GAAP hedge accounting. And that allowed us to put the volatility related to mark-to-market into our other comprehensive income or essentially on the balance sheet. It didn't close through the P&L. We proactively decided to go off of hedge accounting. You may or may not know this, but it's a very onerous requirement to make. A lot of our peers have done this and we looked at the cost benefit of doing this. We just didn't feel that it was worth it, especially since the standard cap getting tougher and tougher to meet. So what do we decided to do and we talked about this, I think, in the third and the fourth quarter, we would say off of hedge accounting and a lot of volatility to slow through the P&L. So that the change, but we also want to call that out for you so that you can see that because it's volatility is not consistent with the earnings that we use internally as well as prior periods. So that's why we adjusted it out in our adjusted GAAP or adjusted earnings. So when you look at the impact in the first quarter, there was no comparable piece of it to be adjusted out last time.

We've always had about $50 million to $70 million of productivity that comes due primarily in the supply chain arena. There's done a terrific job of offsetting underlying COGS inflations, so we end up with flat or good margin expansion based on their efforts. What we've done starting in June of last year is we also had a productivity program that we announced and have been executing on here more in our corporate functions, and we got some benefit of that last year and we're going to get another $40 million of benefit from it this year. That's at the high-end of the range, by the way, of what we announced. We've been overdelivering on that. And then what we announced today is incremental savings, again, in SM&A category of $10 million to $15 million. Now as you know, most of our cost and SM&A, besides specific cost for advertising art cost related and we do have inflation, salary cost inflation and benefits inflation that hit as every year. Think of that as being about 3%. So what we'd like to be able to do is direct offset that, but in general, we're focusing on taking that discipline and continues improvement mindset that the supply chain guys have done so well and really migrating back over to all of our corporate functions to help them and help all of us offset inflation the same way that the supply chain guys have done. And yes, I would say that, that absolutely gives us the fuel to have those marketing and other advertising expenses that we need to ignite the market and push that second half growth that we are looking this year, so it's absolutely a big help for us in achieving that."

I'm not going to go into as much detail as you'd like just for competitive reasons. But let me put it in perspective that snacks today, if you look at the pure snacking type stuff outside of confectionery and outside of our grocery businesses, is really only 2% of our total business. If you put in those other pantry-type businesses, spreads, et cetera, it's about 9% of the business. So confectionery is at the core of who we are and what we do. What we've seen is we've continued to demand and landscape work. If there's an interesting area around what we call snackfection and if you look at some of our recent, like the Reese's mix and bytes products, those have been terrific for us. They don't show up in our market share because they're actually captured in snacks. But we're very, very pleased with how we've progressed there. So I think that what you should take away it is that we are very focused against our core -- innovating around our core and executing against the fundamentals and very competitive and changing snacking environment. But we really see an immediate opportunity in this area of snackfection for the company. And then as you look at how consumers relationship with food has changed, we recognize that the snacking continuum has grown. And so products like Krave, which we're learning a lot from and are very pleased, will always be part of our test and learn and grow strategies, but it doesn't take away from our core focus. And so around portability, one of the things you see is there's new users and consumer rotations that are in -- that we see is a big opportunity. So confection has always been a part of snacking. I think there is been some confusion around when we talk about snacking, it's a bit something different than confection and the fact of the matter is confection has always been snacking, with the biggest part of the snack wheel. And so these new occasions arrive and the opportunities are rates for the company, we want to be able to take advantage of them, succeed to the brands we have and also be able to expand and some of these new segments, and there's a significant blurring across this total snacking category that we think has added some of the lumpiness and challenges for the category as you see so many new items and choices for the consumer. And I think it's all sorts single mark important thing for us is to continue to build on our brand relevance and the consumers have relationships with our brand and that's why we like to talk about being a consumer-centric and brand-building company. We don't think we've lost anything there, but we certainly would tell you that there's lots of opportunities, and we have to be at our best to take advantage of them."

First of all, China for us is probably the best market for a period of time. While the profile may change, I think that well, for some period of time, continue to be in a brand building type mode. Let me just take a step back and maybe clear up a couple of things in terms of how I view what we're currently doing in China. So the first most important thing we needed to do following the recent acquisition, we just gained control of the business, as we've all been quite open and talked about some surprises there and things that we weren't very pleased with, but we feel very good about the efforts of the team has made and that we gained control of what we had there. But we're in the process of creating a solid foundation. It's around work structure. It's around the systems we need to run the business and a big piece of integration. And so that creating the foundation is really where we're at. And then the third phase is that we have to execute against the business we have. Unfortunately, it's a volatile market with some uncertainty right now, so when I talk about being balanced, we have to make sure that we can afford the organization structure and our go-to-market strategies there. But listen, we believe in emerging middle class, we believe in marginalization, we believe that these are markets that over time, we want to be in. So from a quarter-to-quarter basis, it may be tough to make some of those strategic decisions. And then if we execute well, results come. And we'll be able to then do the things that we do well and grow our brands in the market and grow with the category and overcome some of these, what I would believe are more short-term challenges. That's really -- I think importantly, that's how I think about it. And so that's the best way for, I think, you guys to think about it as well."

That means the trial has moved around a lot. At the same time, you have some different things impacting retailers and we've come out of a period of time some uncertainty in economies. And so I think all of those things have made it a more challenging environment, but I don't think those are structural things that were major changes taking place. Now you've heard me talk about consumers have a changing relationship with food. So much of that is really around transparency, as much as it is anything else, where people are wanting to understand ingredients better than they ever have before. As manufacturers, we're all responding to that, certainly, we are as well. But as I take a step back, and's just look at the overall industry as well as the category that we compete and I think many of the things that are happening are far more cyclical than I would think about as structural."

Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance within GAAP. Within the notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted or pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.
The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss first quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $27.8 million or $0.04 per share diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges, both these are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.hersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."
98873,330114018,962989,"The Hershey Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark. In North America, adjusting for the shorter Easter, we were pleased with our seasonal performance. However, nonseasonal candy, mint and gum or CMG business was below expectation.

However, nonseasonal candy, mint and gum or CMG business was below expectation. The nonseasonal softness was more than offset by the timing of some merchandising and programming net sales that occurred in the first quarter that were initially expected to ship in the second quarter, netting to unplanned net sales delivery in North America.
Most of you are aware of the soft retail takeaway performance across most of the CPG sector in the first quarter, especially in February. Easter timing in the current and year-ago period makes it difficult to properly discern the current nonseasonal or every day candy trends. As a result, our full year net sales forecast reflects a tempering of nonseasonal everyday candy net sales growth.
As I'll discuss in a bit, North America CMG investments, including new products, advertising and increased levels of merchandising and display, accelerate in the second quarter and over the remainder of the year. Given the quality and level of these investments, there could be upside to our outlook.
In the first quarter, we're pleased with the gains we're making in Mexico and Brazil. As expected, China net sales declined in the first quarter. And more about this in a minute.
In January, I told you that we continue to look at our total cost structure. Building on that, today, we announced that we increased our annual savings target from continuous improvement and productivity programs from about $50 million to $70 million per year to about $100 million per year for the 3 years beginning in 2017.
Using a midpoint of the historical target, the incremental $120 million in savings results in a 3-year, $300 million initiative that should enable the company to continue to invest in its brands while also delivering on its earnings objectives.
We're off to a good start and expect that we'll exceed our initial 2016 productivity and savings target by $10 million to $15 million. Program savings will be generated from cost optimization across all segments of the business. Our focus on the cost structure enabled us to exceed our first quarter earnings expectations and deliver EPS growth versus the year-ago period.
This morning, we also announced that we're building on our better-for-you snacks portfolio expansion strategy, with the purchase of the barkTHINS Snacking Chocolate line. Since its launch in 2013, barkTHINS has quickly become a favorite snack brand due to its commitment to using simple ingredients, fair trade cocoa and non-GMO certification. BarkTHINS is a very attractive and uniquely-crafted band that essentially created the chocolate thins category, a new form of chocolate snacking. We look forward to building barkTHINS by leveraging Hershey scale of retail. This acquisition builds on our snack strategy and complements our strong core confectionery portfolio, the heart of our company. And it adds strength and diversification to our offerings that allows Hershey to satisfy more consumer needs.
In the current environment, customers and consumers may seem increasingly focused on other snack categories, but the $25 billion CMG category is the largest segment of the $85 billion U.S. snacks market. Customers and consumers, especially high-income consumers are increasingly looking for snacking alternatives. However, confection remains one of the top-selling snacking categories with household penetration of 94%.
So as you would expect, the majority of our time, efforts and investments are focused on the CMG category. For example, we've done some extensive R&D and consumer market research over the last year that will result in a meaningful new product launch by year-end. And the barkTHINS acquisition will give us a chocolate snacking platform, or as we like to call it, snackfection to build upon. We're focused on organic innovation and growth as well as acquisition that meet the needs of the candy loyalists. CMG's variety seeking consumers who like to try new things and consumers looking for better-for-you reassurance. 
Looking at U.S. marketplace performance, Nielsen retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ended March 26, 2016, benefits from an early Easter. Recall Easter was March 27 in 2016 and April 5 in 2015. As a result, CMG category growth was 8.7% for the 12 weeks ended March 26, 2016, within the xAOC+C channels. Hershey's first quarter CMG retail takeaway in the xAOC+C universe increased 8.2%. Market share performance was in line with our expectations. Importantly, chocolate market share increased 0.1 point in Q1. However, this was offset by non-chocolate candy performance. As a reminder, the April Nielsen data will be impacted by the timing of Easter in the year-ago period.
Therefore, CMG and Hershey performance for the April year-to-date period will be less than Q1. Let me now build on my earlier comments and give you some details on our brand and in-store activity over the remainder of the year.
While we have already made investments, results have been solid. Specifically, Reese's market share is up 0.4 point in 2016, driven by new and refreshed television and digital marketing campaigns. Other brands that we're investing in include Kit Kat, where we launched a new Big Kat, Kit Kat candy bar that is now available. And look for some interesting millennial-targeted creative TV and digital campaigns using a Big Kat, literally storming the streets of New York. The Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites instant consumable items are off to a fast start with industry-leading innovation velocities. They are highly incremental to our base business, and we're following it up with take-home canisters.
And we're also excited about some of the big in-store programming events such as our Classics sports promotion, our new team USA Summer Olympics sponsorship and Hershey's cross-category in-store events, which leverages our new mega brand strategy. In the second half of the year, we'll also begin to communicate our simple ingredients message that will focus on Hershey bars and Kisses milk chocolate. And we also continued to gain share in gum, with our category leading Ice Breakers brand. We've added additional capacity to meet demand, and we'll be supporting it with a new advertising campaign in Q2.
This is just a brief summary of some of the strong activity, we have in North America that will grow the business in the rest of the year.
Now for an update on our international business. Net sales were in line with our plan. Excluding China, where we knew sales would be down year-over-year as we lacked the slowdown that occurred after the 2015 Chinese New Year sell in, and the discontinued India oil business, constant currency net sales increased about 3.6%.
I was pleased with Mexico and Brazil, where constant currency first quarter net sales increased 4.2% and 9.6% respectively. And in both markets, chocolate category growth was in the high single-digits.
In Mexico, we're optimizing mix to focus on global chocolate brands and building on our sigma relationship to accelerate coverage and share in the traditional trade. In Brazil, we're continuing to focus on the Hershey mega brand, milk chocolate tablet bars, cookies and cream and the Mais wafer product. Constant currency net sales in India declined versus the year-ago period due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business.
The media and vested brands, Jolly Rancher, SOFIT and Hershey syrup, where we are focusing our efforts and investments both all increased double digits. As we enter the second quarter, a new chapter for Hershey's business in China begins as we merged the 2 teams into 1 united organization. Our initial plans impact some of our people and functions where there's some overlap. Savings here are not material at this point, but we're working towards balancing our business model in China versus our opportunities.
Importantly, in 2016, Golden Monkey got off to a good start, with net sales below last year but in line with our plans and expectations. Most of these sales were made to quality distributors, who paid cash on delivery. We're executing against our plans to bring variety, news and excitement to the golden and Munching Monkey candy and snacks business. Confectionery innovation is focused on milk candies targeting young families, the better forming segment and Chinese classics, while protein-based snacks is concentrated on additional bean curd flavors and the introduction of a vegan and soy sausage. China chocolate category sales in Q1 declined about 10%, the low end of our forecasted range. Given the slow start to the year, we adjusted our outlook for the year but still expect double-digit net sales growth in 2016, as we lap the trade funds that were necessary in the second and third quarters of 2015. Additionally, over the remainder of the year, we'll be focused on establishing our new Hershey over brand message to reengage Hershey's and Kisses consumers.
This is tied into a fully integrated campaign, including TV advertising, digital communications and in-store merchandising that will bring the brands to life. While small, our e-commerce business in China continues to do well. In the first quarter, our e-commerce retail takeaway increased by 45% driven by Chinese New Year gifting sales. We continue to outpace the category and have a plus 10% share of the e-commerce chocolate market. Over the long term, we expect global economies and category trends to improve and that the investments in our international business to contribute about 1 point to our overall long-term sales target. 
Now to wrap up. From time to time, there are different confluences in the marketplace that can impact snacks and CMG growth. Hershey is always navigated and invested in its core CMG business throughout these cycles and has always ended up in a more solid position.
We are a consumer-centric, brand-building company focused on innovation and growth in every category where we participate, especially confectionery, and we want to satisfy the needs of our retail customers and new and existing consumers.
We take a long-term focus and continue to believe that investing in our business will benefit the company this year and well into the future.
I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results."

Adjusted ea",1537,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. First quarter net sales of $1.83 billion declined 5.6% versus last year, relatively in line with our forecast although partially due to the timing that J.P. referred to. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.10, an increase of about 1% versus last year due to greater-than-expected productivity and cost savings versus our January estimate.
Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.2 points, net sales declined 4.4% and was relatively in line with our forecast. Price realization on seasonal CMG products was more than offset by increased levels of direct trades, resulting in a net price realization headwind of 50 basis points.
Volume was off 4.3 points, due to a shorter Easter season and planned lower sales in China. Net acquisitions and divestitures were a 40 basis points benefit. By segment, first quarter North America net sales declined 4.3% versus last year, due primarily to the shorter Easter season.
Excluding the 40 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales decreased 3.9% versus the year-ago period. Volume was off 3.7 points and the list price increase on seasonal CMG products was more than offset by increased levels of direct trade resulting in a net price realization headwind of 70 basis points.
As we mentioned in January, the direct trade was primarily related to programs in the marketplace. However, the aforementioned softness of every day nonpromoted items resulted in greater-than-accepted unfavorable price mix. The combined Alan Candy and Krave acquisitions as well as the Mauna Loa divestiture were a 50 basis point benefit. 
Total International and Other segment net sales for the first quarter declined 15.4% versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 7.3 points. The International and Other segment volume was off 8.4 points, due primarily to the net sales decline in China as selling related to Chinese New Year season was lower than last year.
International net price realization was a one point benefit, and the impact of the Mauna Loa divestiture, a 70 basis points headwind. 
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin increased 20 basis points in the first quarter driven by greater-than-expected supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and other supply chain costs.
On a net basis, commodity and packaging costs were slightly favorable. For the full year, we expect gross margin to be slightly down as greater productivity and cost savings and a slightly better dairy environment at least for the time being is more than offset by installation and unfavorable sales mix, given the update to our nonseasonal and instant consumable candy outlook in North America.
Operating profit in the first quarter was in line with the year-ago period, resulting in operating profit margin of 21.5%, an increase of 120 basis points versus last year. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and lower SM&A, selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined about 10% versus the first quarter of 2015 due to timing. North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense is expected to increase over the remainder of 2016.
SM&A, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, declined 9.3%, driven by the implementation of the business productivity program announced last June and the company's continued focus on efficiency and cost savings initiatives.
Now let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I'm pleased that our total international business delivered on their Q1 plans. As J.P. stated, we're executing against our plans in the key markets of China, Mexico, Brazil and India and making good progress.
Adding to J.P.'s commentary on China, chocolate category contraction was greater than our estimate. Our updated forecast for the year reflects a return to growth, albeit at a lower level. If the broader economy doesn't improve, there could be further risks to our full year China chocolate and Golden Monkey sales forecast.
Distributor demand and net sales of Golden Monkey items have been consistent for the last 2 quarters, driven by programs and products that are leveraging promotions associated with the lunar calendar, year of the Monkey. Given the increased level of in-store programming and innovation, we expect similar results over the next couple of quarters. Combined with a higher level of trade promotion that we'll be lapping, we're targeting Golden Monkey net sales to increase around 20% this year.
Moving down the corporate P&L, first quarter interest expense of $21 million increased $1.8 million versus last year. For the full year, we expect interest rate -- interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range, greater than our previous estimate of $85 million to $90 million due to the use of commercial paper related to the barkTHINS acquisitions -- acquisition. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 35% and in line with last year. In 2016, we expect to purchase about the same amount of tax credits as we did last year, which should result in an adjusted tax rate which is similar to 2015. In the second quarter, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be about 30% due to the timing and purchase of tax credits.
For the first quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 217.5 million shares, down 5.2 million shares versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.10 or an increase of about 1% versus a year ago. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the first quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's first quarter by $25 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $63 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $25 million and accounts payable declined by $13 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $41.4 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be in the $285 million to $295 million range.
During the first quarter, depreciation and amortization was $60 million, and dividends paid were $122 million. In the first quarter, the company repurchased $304 million of outstanding shares. $20 million were repurchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015, and $284 million were repurchased against the $500 million authorization approved in January 2016.
Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $286 million, slightly lower than a year ago. As J.P. mentioned earlier, today we announced the acquisition of the barkTHINS Snacking Chocolate line. We expect that the acquisition will be dilutive in 2016 and '17 primarily due to the booked amortization of intangibles before turning accretive in 2018.
The off cash purchase price and the near-term earnings solution is partially offset by about $50 million to $60 million in cash flow tax benefits associated with the tax amortization of intangible assets in the basis step up. The tax amortization provides a future cash flow benefit. As a result, netting the benefit against the growth acquisition purchase price results in a deal multiple that is similar to other high growth CPG assets.
As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of innovation, variety and use going into the marketplace. In-store merchandising and program activity is greater than last year, and advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase mid- to high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year over the next 3 quarters.
Therefore, for the full year, excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange approximately 1 point and the barkTHINS acquisition of about 0.5 point, net sales growth is expected to accelerate and increase to around 2%. This is less than the previous estimate of about 3% due to the previously mentioned lower-than-expected U.S. nonseasonal CMG growth and macroeconomic headwinds in China.
The category -- the company expects gross margin to be slightly lower than last year due to unfavorable mix related to lower nonseasonal sales. The business productivity initiative announced in June and the incremental CIP savings are on track and should result in a reduction in SM&A expenses as we continue to leverage existing resources. As a result, the company expects adjusted earnings per share diluted to increase 3% to 4% including dilution from acquisitions of $0.05 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.24 to $4.28 range. 
Before we open it up to Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on the second quarter. We expect constant currency net sales growth in Q2 to be greater than our full year outlook. However, the impact of unfavorable sales mix is greatest in the second quarter and may result in gross margin decline of 50 to 100 basis points. Additionally, advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase the most on a percentage basis versus last year in the second quarter. This is one of the levers in our marketing mix model that we believe will result in improved pull or retail takeaway in the second half of the year.
Therefore, we expect the EPS will be pressured in the second quarter. Thank you for your time, this morning, and we'll now take any questions you may have."

So up until last year, we used and met all the requirements to use GAAP hedge accounting. And that allowed us to put the volatility related to mark-to-market into our other comprehensive income are essentially on the balance sheet. It didn't go through the P&L. We proactively decided to go off of hedge accounting. You may or may not know this, but it's a very onerous staff requirement to make, a lot of our peers have done this. And when we looked at the cost benefit of doing this, we just didn't feel that it was worth it, especially since the standard cap getting tougher and tougher to meet. So what do we decided to do, and we talked about this, I think, in the third and the fourth quarter is to go, we would say off of hedge accounting and a lot of volatility to slow through the P&L. So the change, but we also want to call that out for you so that you can see that because it's volatility, it's not consistent with the earnings that we use internally as well as prior periods. So that's why we adjusted it out in our adjusted GAAP or adjusted earnings. So when you look at the impact in the first quarter, there was no comparable piece of it to be adjusted out last time. However, on an adjusted basis, the 2 numbers are comparable. Just we got there by different means. Going forward, as we lap all those quarters, you'll continue to see it coming out of the adjustment in both periods."

We've always had about $50 million to $70 million of productivity that comes through primarily in the supply chain arena. And those guys have done a terrific job of offsetting underlying COGS inflation, so we end up with flat or good margin expansion based on their efforts. What we've done, starting in June of last year is we also had a productivity program that we announced and have been executing on here more in our corporate functions, and we got some benefit of that last year, and we're going to get another $40 million of benefit from it this year. That's at the high end of the range, by the way, of what we announced. We've been overdelivering on that. And then what we announced today is incremental savings, again, in the SM&A category of $10 million to $15 million. Now as you know, most of our costs and SM&A, besides specific costs for advertising are salary cost related, and we do have inflation, salary cost inflation and benefits inflation that hit us every year. Think of that as being about 3%. So what we'd like to do is be able to offset that, but in general, we're focusing on taking that discipline and continuous improvement mindset that the supply chain guys have done so well and really migrating that over to all of our corporate functions to help them and help all of us offset the inflation, the same way that the supply chain guys have done. And yes, I would say that that absolutely gives us the fuel to have those marketing and other advertising expenses that we need to ignite the market and push that second half growth that we're looking towards this year, so it's absolutely a big help for us in achieving that."

We want to make sure that we make good decisions there for the long term. And as we continue to get familiar with our overall go-to-market strategy and how we brought the 2 businesses together, we just want to be prudent in terms of making sure we're making good decisions. At the same time, we do believe that there's opportunities within our China business to go further than we have at the current point in time.

While there were clearly some disappointments in our acquisition of Golden Monkey, the fundamentals of why we bought it are still there. We really like the aspects of the traditional trade. We really like the 2 brands that they bring to our Golden and Monkey -- Munching Monkey, and we think that's a very good complement to our strength in the 3 brands that we have in the chocolate business in China and our focus there on the modern trade a little bit over indexed to hypermarket, which we can certainly see in our results. So the team there has done a nice job of bringing that together. That's -- while that's generated some cost savings and frankly, we're still looking, and I think we'll find some more. I think the really important thing is bringing the 2 businesses together to a point of strength that they each individually have, and that's what J.P. -- I would add to J.P.'s remarks about balance. That's the parts that we're balancing."

You say that you need to reaccelerate the growth. Can you give us a little more color on this meaningful launch that you talked about in the back half of the year? What's the marketing objective of that launch? What's the risk that you're taking, the investment you need to make?

I'm not going to go into as much detail as you'd like just for competitive reasons. But let me put it in perspective that snacks today, if you look at the pure snacking-type stuff outside of confectionery and outside of our grocery business is really only 2% of our total business. If you put in those other pantry-type businesses, spreads, et cetera, it's about 9% of the business. So confectionery is at the core of who we are and what we do. What we've seen is we've continued to do some demand landscape work. If there's an interesting area around what we call snackfection and if you look at some of our recent, like the Reese's mix and bytes products, those have been terrific for us. They don't show up in our market share because they're actually captured in snacks. But we're very, very pleased with how we've progressed there. So I think that what you should take away is that we are very focused against our core -- innovating around our core and executing against the fundamentals and very competitive and changing snacking environment. But we really see an immediate opportunity in this area of snackfection for the company. And then as you look at how consumers' relationship with food has changed, we recognize that the snacking continuum has grown. And so products like Krave, which we're learning a lot from and are very pleased, will always be part of our test and learn and grow strategies, but it doesn't take away from our core focus. And so around portability, one of the things that you see is there's new users and consumer occasions that are in -- that we see as a big opportunity. So confection has always been a part of snacking. I think there's been some confusion around when we talk about snacking. It's a bit something different than confection and the fact of the matter is confection has always been snacking. We're the biggest part of the snack wheel. And so these new occasions arise and new opportunities arise for the company, we want to be able to take advantage of them, succeed with the brands we have and then also be able to expand in some of these new segments. And there's a significant blurring across this total snacking category that we think has added some of the lumpiness and challenges for the category as you see so many new items and choices for the consumer. And I think as that all sorts out the single most important thing for us is to continue to build on our brand relevance, and that's why consumers have relationships with our brands and that's why we like to talk about being a consumer-centric and brand-building company. We don't think we've lost anything there, but we certainly would tell you that there's lots of opportunities, and we have to be at our best to take advantage of them."

First of all, China for us is probably the best market for a period of time. While that profile may change, I think that we'll, for some period of time, continue to be in a brand-building type mode. Let me just take a step back and maybe clear up a couple of things in terms of how I view what we're currently doing in China. So the first most important thing we needed to do following the recent acquisition, we just gained control of the business, as we've all been quite open and talked about there were some surprises there and things that we weren't very pleased with, but we feel very good about the efforts the team has made, and then we gained control of what we have there. We're in a process of creating a solid foundation. It's around work structure. It's around the systems we need to run the business and a big piece of the integration, and so that creating the foundation is really where we're at. And then the third phase is that we have to execute against the business we have. Unfortunately, it's a volatile market with some uncertainty right now, so when I talk about being balanced, we have to make sure that we can afford the organization structure and our go-to-market strategies there. But listen, we believe in the emerging middle class. We believe in marginalization, we think these are markets that over time, we want to be in. So from a quarter-to-quarter basis, it may be tough to make some of those strategic decisions. And then if we execute well, results come. And we'll be able to then do the things that we do well and grow our brands in the market, and grow with the category and overcome some of these, what I would believe are more short-term challenges. That's really -- I think importantly, that's how I think about it. And so that's the best way for, I think, you guys to think about it as well."

Big Kat just launching, we're sponsor of the Olympics, which is going to be huge for merchandising perspective and as we told you guys last year, where we started to see some softness and share at the end of the year, we made a decision to invest, to be more competitive and just given the time line it takes to get those dollars into marketplace, that really kicks in beginning in May. We have the birthday execution that's really going to expand, so just a lot of activity coming in the back part of the year that we have a lot of confidence in.

That means the trial has moved around a lot. At the same time, you have some different things impacting retailers, and we've come out of a period of time of some uncertainty in economies. And so I think all of those things have made it a more challenging environment, but I don't think those are structural things where major changes have taken place. Now you've heard me talk about consumers have a changing relationship with food. So much of that is really around transparency, as much as it is anything else, where people are wanting to understand ingredients better than they ever have before.

And then I hope that at the federal level, there is clarity brought to this question because it becomes an inter-state commerce issue if you have different states taking different approaches, would make it very confusing for manufacturing -- manufacturers. And so I do hope that there's some clarity around how labeling happens if it's required on a broader basis. And then as you know, we've committed to transparency.

Bilbrey, Chairman President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with a review of the results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session. 
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectation, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. 
If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance within GAAP. Within the notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted or pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.
The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. 
As a result, we will discuss first quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $27.8 million or $0.04 per share diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges. Both of these are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.hersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."
98873,330114018,963247,"The Hershey Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark.

However, nonseasonal candy, mint and gum or CMG business was below expectation. The nonseasonal softness was more than offset by the timing of some merchandising and programming net sales that occurred in the first quarter that were initially expected to ship in the second quarter, netting to on-plan net sales delivery in North America.
Most of you are aware of the soft retail takeaway performance across most of the CPG sector in the first quarter, especially in February. Easter timing in the current and year-ago period makes it difficult to properly discern the current nonseasonal or everyday candy trends. As a result, our full year net sales forecast reflects a tempering of nonseasonal everyday candy net sales growth.
As I'll discuss in a bit, North America CMG investments, including new products, advertising and increased levels of merchandising and display, accelerates in the second quarter and over the remainder of the year. Given the quality and level of these investments, there could be upside to our outlook.
In the first quarter, we're pleased with the gains we're making in Mexico and Brazil. As expected, China net sales declined in the first quarter. And more about this in a minute.
In January, I told you that we continued to look at our total cost structure. Building on that, today, we announced that we increased our annual savings target from continuous improvement and productivity programs from about $50 million to $70 million per year to about $100 million per year for the 3 years beginning in 2017.
Using the midpoint of the historical target, the incremental $120 million in savings results in a 3-year $300 million initiative that should enable the company to continue to invest in its brands while also delivering on its earnings objectives.
We're off to a good start and expect that we'll exceed our initial 2016 productivity and savings target by $10 million to $15 million. Program savings will be generated from cost optimization across all segments of the business. Our focus on the cost structure enabled us to exceed our first quarter earnings expectations and deliver EPS growth versus the year-ago period.
This morning, we also announced that we're building on our better-for-you snacks portfolio expansion strategy, with the purchase of the barkTHINS snacking chocolate line. Since its launch in 2013, barkTHINS has quickly become a favorite snack brand due to its commitment to using simple ingredients, fair trade cocoa and non-GMO certification. BarkTHINS is a very attractive and uniquely crafted band that essentially created the chocolate thins category, a new form of chocolate snacking. We look forward to building barkTHINS by leveraging Hershey's scale at retail. This acquisition builds on our snack strategy and complements our strong core confectionery portfolio, the heart of our company. And it adds strength and diversification to our offerings that allows Hershey to satisfy more consumer needs.
In the current environment, customers and consumers may seem increasingly focused on other snack categories, but the $25 billion CMG category is the largest segment of the $85 billion U.S. snacks market. Customers and consumers, especially high-income consumers, are increasingly looking for snacking alternatives. However, confection remains one of the top-selling snacking categories, with household penetration of 94%.
So as you would expect, the majority of our time, efforts and investments are focused on the CMG category. For example, we've done some extensive R&D and consumer market research over the last year that will result in a meaningful new product launch by year-end. And the barkTHINS acquisition will give us a chocolate snacking platform, or as we like to call it, SNACK-FECTION, to build upon. We're focused on organic innovation and growth, as well as acquisition that meet the needs of the candy loyalists; CMG's variety seeking consumers who like to try new things and consumers looking for better-for-you reassurance. 
Looking at U.S. marketplace performance, Nielsen retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ended March 26, 2016, benefits from an early Easter. Recall Easter was March 27 in 2016 and April 5 in 2015. As a result, CMG category growth was 8.7% for the 12 weeks ended March 26, 2016, within the xAOC+C channels. Hershey's first quarter CMG retail takeaway in the xAOC+C universe increased 8.2%. Market share performance was in line with our expectations. Importantly, chocolate market share increased 0.1 point in Q1. However, this was offset by non-chocolate candy performance. 
As a reminder, the April Nielsen data will be impacted by the timing of Easter in the year-ago period. Therefore, CMG and Hershey performance for the April year-to-date period will be less than Q1. 
Let me now build on my earlier comments and give you some details on our brand and in-store activity over the remainder of the year. Where we have already made investments, results have been solid. Specifically, Reese's market share is up 0.4 point in 2016, driven by new and refreshed television and digital marketing campaigns. Other brands that we're investing in include Kit Kat, where we launched a new Big Kat, Kit Kat candy bar that is now available. And look for some interesting millennial-targeted creative TV and digital campaigns using a Big Kat literally storming the streets of New York. The Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites instant consumable items are off to a fast start with industry-leading innovation velocities. They're highly incremental to our base business, and we're following it up with take-home canisters.
And we're also excited about some of the big in-store programming events such as our classic S'mores promotion, our new team USA Summer Olympics sponsorship and Hershey's cross-category in-store events, which leverages our new mega brand strategy. In the second half of the year, we'll also begin to communicate our simple ingredients message that will focus on Hershey bars and Kisses Milk Chocolate. And we also continue to gain share in gum, with our category leading Ice Breakers brand. We've added additional capacity to meet demand, and will be supporting it with a new advertising campaign in Q2.
This is just a brief summary of some of the strong activity, we have in North America that will grow the business in the rest of the year.
Now for an update on our international business. Net sales were in line with our plan. Excluding China, where we knew sales would be down year-over-year as we lapped the slowdown that occurred after the 2015 Chinese New Year sell-in and the discontinued India oil business, constant-currency net sales increased about 3.6%.
I was pleased with Mexico and Brazil, where constant-currency first quarter net sales increased 4.2% and 9.6% respectively. And in both markets, chocolate category growth was in the high single-digits.
In Mexico, we're optimizing mix to focus on global chocolate brands and building on our Sigma relationship to accelerate coverage and share in the traditional trade. In Brazil, we're continuing to focus on the Hershey mega brand, milk chocolate tablet bars, Cookies 'N' Creme and the Mais wafer product. Constant-currency net sales in India declined versus the year-ago period due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business.
The media and vested brands, Jolly Rancher, SOFIT and Hershey syrup, where we are focusing our efforts and investments both, all increased double digits. 
As we enter the second quarter, a new chapter for Hershey's business in China begins as we've merged the 2 teams into 1 united organization. Our initial plans impact some of our people and functions where there's some overlap. Savings here are not material at this point, but we're working towards balancing our business model in China versus our opportunities.
Importantly, in 2016, Golden Monkey got off to a good start, with net sales below last year, but in line with our plans and expectations. Most of these sales were made to quality distributors who paid cash on delivery. We're executing against our plans to bring variety, news and excitement to the Golden and Munching Monkey candy and snacks business. Confectionery innovation is focused on milk candies targeting young families, the better forming segment and Chinese classics, while protein-based snacks is concentrated on additional bean curd flavors and the introduction of a vegan and soy sausage. 
China chocolate category sales in Q1 declined about 10%, the low end of our forecasted range. Given the slow start to the year, we adjusted our outlook for the year, but still expect double-digit net sales growth in 2016, as we lap the trade funds that were necessary in the second and third quarters of 2015. 
Additionally, over the remainder of the year, we'll be focused on establishing our new Hershey [ph] over-brand message to reengage Hershey's and Kisses consumers. This is tied into a fully integrated campaign, including TV advertising, digital communications and in-store merchandising that will bring the brands to life. 
While small, our e-commerce business in China continues to do well. In the first quarter, our e-commerce retail takeaway increased by 45% driven by Chinese New Year gifting sales. We continue to outpace the category and have a plus 10% share of the e-commerce chocolate market. Over the long term, we expect global economies and category trends to improve and that the investments in our international business to contribute about 1 point to our overall long-term sales target. 
Now to wrap up. From time to time, there are different confluences in the marketplace that can impact snacks and CMG growth. Hershey has always navigated and invested in its core CMG business throughout these cycles and has always ended up in a more solid position.
We are a consumer-centric, brand-building company focused on innovation and growth in every category where we participate, especially confectionery, and we want to satisfy the needs of our retail customers and new and existing consumers.
We take a long-term focus and continue to believe that investing in our business will benefit the company this year and well into the future.
I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results."

Adjusted ea",1530,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. First quarter net sales of $1.83 billion declined 5.6% versus last year, relatively in line with our forecast although partially due to the timing that J.P. referred to. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.10, an increase of about 1% versus last year due to greater-than-expected productivity and cost savings versus our January estimate.
Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.2 points, net sales declined 4.4% and was relatively in line with our forecast. Price realization on seasonal CMG products was more than offset by increased levels of direct trades, resulting in a net price realization headwind of 50 basis points.
Volume was off 4.3 points, due to a shorter Easter season and planned lower sales in China. Net acquisitions and divestitures were a 40 basis points benefit. By segment, first quarter North America net sales declined 4.3% versus last year, due primarily to the shorter Easter season.
Excluding the 40 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales decreased 3.9% versus the year-ago period. Volume was off 3.7 points and the list price increase on seasonal CMG products was more than offset by increased levels of direct trade resulting in a net price realization headwind of 70 basis points.
As we mentioned in January, the direct trade was primarily related to programs in the marketplace. However, the aforementioned softness of everyday nonpromoted items resulted in greater-than-expected unfavorable price mix. The combined Allan Candy and Krave acquisitions, as well as the Mauna Loa divestiture, were a 50 basis point benefit. 
Total International and Other segment net sales for the first quarter declined 15.4% versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 7.3 points. The International and Other segment volume was off 8.4 points, due primarily to the net sales decline in China as sell-in related to Chinese New Year season was lower than last year.
International net price realization was a 1 point benefit, and the impact of the Mauna Loa divestiture, a 70 basis points headwind. 
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin increased 20 basis points in the first quarter driven by greater-than-expected supply chain productivity and cost-savings initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and other supply chain costs.
On a net basis, commodity and packaging costs were slightly favorable. For the full year, we expect gross margin to be slightly down as greater productivity and cost savings and a slightly better dairy environment, at least for the time being, is more than offset by inflation and unfavorable sales mix, given the update to our nonseasonal and instant consumable candy outlook in North America.
Operating profit in the first quarter was in line with the year-ago period, resulting in operating profit margin of 21.5%, an increase of 120 basis points versus last year. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and lower SM&A, selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined about 10% versus the first quarter of 2015 due to timing. North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense is expected to increase over the remainder of 2016.
SM&A, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, declined 9.3%, driven by the implementation of the business productivity program announced last June and the company's continued focus on efficiency and cost-savings initiatives.
Now let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I'm pleased that our total international business delivered on their Q1 plans. As J.P. stated, we're executing against our plans in the key markets of China, Mexico, Brazil and India and making good progress.
Adding to J.P.'s commentary on China, chocolate category contraction was greater than our estimate. Our updated forecast for the year reflects a return to growth, albeit at a lower level. If the broader economy doesn't improve, there could be further risk to our full year China chocolate and Golden Monkey sales forecast.
Distributor demand and net sales of Golden Monkey items have been consistent for the last 2 quarters, driven by programs and products that are leveraging promotions associated with the lunar calendar, year of the Monkey. Given the increased level of in-store programming and innovation, we expect similar results over the next couple of quarters. Combined with the higher level of trade promotion that we'll be lapping, we're targeting Golden Monkey net sales to increase around 20% this year.
Moving down the corporate P&L, first quarter interest expense of $21 million increased $1.8 million versus last year. For the full year, we expect interest rate -- interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range, greater than our previous estimate of $85 million to $90 million due to the use of commercial paper related to the barkTHINS acquisitions -- acquisition. 
The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 35% and in line with last year. In 2016, we expect to purchase about the same amount of tax credits as we did last year, which should result in an adjusted tax rate that's similar to 2015. In the second quarter, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be about 30% due to the timing and purchase of tax credits.
For the first quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 217.5 million shares, down 5.2 million shares versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.10 or an increase of about 1% versus a year ago. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the first quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's first quarter by $25 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $63 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $25 million and accounts payable declined by $13 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $41.4 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be in the $285 million to $295 million range.
During the first quarter, depreciation and amortization was $60 million, and dividends paid were $122 million. In the first quarter, the company repurchased $304 million of outstanding shares. $20 million were repurchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015, and $284 million were repurchased against the $500 million authorization approved in January 2016.
Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $286 million, slightly lower than a year ago. 
As J.P. mentioned earlier, today we announced the acquisition of the barkTHINS snacking chocolate line. We expect that the acquisition will be dilutive in 2016 and '17, primarily due to the book amortization of intangibles before turning accretive in 2018.
The all-cash purchase price and the near-term earnings solution is partially offset by about $50 million to $60 million in cash flow net tax benefits associated with the tax amortization of intangible assets in the basis step-up. The tax amortization provides a future cash flow benefit. As a result, netting the benefit against the growth acquisition purchase price results in a deal multiple that is similar to other high-growth CPG assets.
As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of innovation, variety and news going into the marketplace. In-store merchandising and program activity is greater than last year, and advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase mid- to high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year over the next 3 quarters.
Therefore, for the full year, excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange of approximately 1 point and the barkTHINS acquisition of about 0.5 point, net sales growth is expected to accelerate and increase to around 2%. This is less than the previous estimate of about 3% due to the previously mentioned lower-than-expected U.S. nonseasonal CMG growth and macroeconomic headwinds in China.
The category, the company expects gross margin to be slightly lower than last year due to unfavorable mix related to lower nonseasonal sales. The business productivity initiative announced in June and the incremental CIP savings are on track and should result in a reduction in SM&A expenses as we continue to leverage existing resources. As a result, the company expects adjusted earnings per share diluted to increase 3% to 4%, including dilution from acquisitions of $0.05 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.24 to $4.28 range. 
Before we open it up to Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on the second quarter. We expect constant-currency net sales growth in Q2 to be greater than our full year outlook. However, the impact of unfavorable sales mix is greatest in the second quarter and may result in gross margin decline of 50 to 100 basis points. 
Additionally, advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase the most on a percentage basis versus last year in the second quarter. This is one of the levers in our marketing mix model that we believe will result in improved pull or retail takeaway in the second half of the year. Therefore, we expect the EPS will be pressured in the second quarter.

So up until last year, we used and met all the requirements to use GAAP hedge accounting. And that allowed us to put the volatility related to mark-to-market into our other comprehensive income or, essentially, on the balance sheet. It didn't flow through the P&L. We proactively decided to go off of hedge accounting. You may or may not know this, but it's a very onerous FASB requirement to make, a lot of our peers have done this. And when we looked at the cost benefit of doing this, we just didn't feel that it was worth it, especially since the standard kept getting tougher and tougher to meet. So what do we decided to do, and we talked about this, I think in the third and the fourth quarter, is to go, we would say off of hedge accounting and allow that volatility to flow through the P&L. So the change -- but we also wanted to call that out for you so that you can see that because it's volatility that's not consistent with the earnings that we use internally as well as prior periods. So that's why we adjusted it out in our adjusted GAAP or our adjusted earnings. So when you look at the impact in the first quarter, there was no comparable piece of it to be adjusted out last time. However, on an adjusted basis, the 2 numbers are comparable. Just we got there by different means. Going forward, as we lap all those quarters, you'll continue to see it coming out of the adjustment in both periods."

What we want to do is match the ultimate mark-to-market that we have on the hedging contract with the period that we actually buy the underlying commodity. So for example, if we buy cocoa forward and in 1 quarter it might be some positive, in the next quarter it might be negative, by the time we buy the cocoa, we want -- that's when we want to recognize the net impact of that volatility, so that it ties to the time that we're actually buying the cocoa, and we get the net overall hedge price for the cocoa.

We've always had about $50 million to $70 million of productivity that's come through, primarily in the supply chain arena. And those guys have done a terrific job of offsetting underlying COGS, inflation, so we end up with flat or good margin expansion based on their efforts. What we've done, starting in June of last year, is we also had a productivity program that we announced and have been executing on here more in our corporate function, and we got some benefit of that last year, and we're going to get another $40 million of benefit from it this year. That's at the high end of the range, by the way, of what we announced. We've been over-delivering on that. And then, what we announced today is incremental savings, again, in the SM&A category of $10 million to $15 million. Now, as you know, most of our costs in SM&A, besides specific costs for advertising, are salary cost related, and we do have inflation, salary cost inflation and benefits inflation that hit us every year. Think of that as being about 3%. So what we'd like to do is be able to offset that, but in general, we're focusing on taking that discipline and continuous improvement mindset that the supply chain guys have done so well and really migrating that over to all of our corporate function to help them and help all of us offset the inflation, the same way that the supply chain guys have done. And yes, I would say that that absolutely gives us the fuel to have those marketing and other advertising expenses that we need to ignite the market and push that second half growth that we're looking towards this year, so it's absolutely a big help for us in achieving that."

I'm not going to go into as much detail as you'd like just for competitive reasons. But let me put it in perspective that snacks today, if you look at the pure snacking-type stuff outside of confectionery and outside of our grocery business, it's really only 2% of our total business. If you put in those other pantry-type businesses, spreads, et cetera, it's about 9% of the business. So confectionery is at the core of who we are and what we do. What we've seen is we've continued to do some demand landscape work, is there's an interesting area around what we call SNACK-FECTION and if you look at some of our recent, like the Reese's mix and bites products, those have been terrific for us. They don't show up in our market share because they're actually captured in snacks. But we're very, very pleased with how we've progressed there. So I think that what you should take away is, is that we are very focused against our core -- innovating around our core and executing against the fundamentals in a very competitive and changing snacking environment. But we really see an immediate opportunity in this area of SNACK-FECTION for the company. And then, as you look at how consumers' relationship with food has changed, we recognize that the snacking continuum has grown. And so products like Krave, which we're learning a lot from and are very pleased, will always be part of our test and learn and grow strategies, but it doesn't take away from our core focus. And so around portability, one of the things that you see is there's new users and consumer occasions that are in -- that we see as a big opportunity. So confection has always been a part of snacking. I think there's been some confusion around when we talk about snacking. It's a bit something different than confection and the fact of the matter is confection has always been snacking. We're the biggest part of the snack wheel. And so as these new occasions arise and new opportunities arise for the company, we want to be able to take advantage of them, succeed with the brands we have and then also be able to expand in some of these new segments. And there's a significant blurring across this total snacking category that we think has added some of the lumpiness and challenges for the category as you see so many new items and choices for the consumer. And I think as that all sorts out, the single most important thing for us is to continue to build on our brand relevance, and that's why consumers have relationships with our brands and that's why we like to talk about being a consumer-centric and brand-building company. We don't think we've lost anything there, but we certainly would tell you that there's lots of opportunities, and we have to be at our best to take advantage of them."

First of all, China for us is probably an invest market for a period of time. While that profile may change, I think that will, for some period of time, continue to be in a brand-building type mode. Let me just take a step back and maybe clear up a couple of things in terms of how I view what we're currently doing in China. So the first most important thing we needed to do following the recent acquisition was just gain control of the business. As we've all been quite open and talked about, there were some surprises there and things that we weren't very pleased with, but we feel very good about the efforts the team has made, and that we've gained control of what we have there. We're in a process of creating a solid foundation. It's around the org structure. It's around the systems we need to run the business and a big piece of the integration, and so that creating the foundation is really where we're at. And then the third phase is, is that we have to execute against the business we have. Unfortunately, it's a volatile market with some uncertainty right now, so when I talk about being balanced, we have to make sure that we can afford the organization structure and our go-to-market strategies there. But listen, we believe in emerging middle class. We believe in urbanization. We think these are markets that, over time, we want to be in. So from a quarter-to-quarter basis, it may be tough to make some of those strategic decisions. And then if we execute well, results come. And we'll be able to then do the things that we do well and grow our brands in the market, and grow with the category and overcome some of these, what I would believe are more short-term challenges. That's really -- I think importantly, that's how I think about it. And so that's the best way for, I think, you guys to think about it as well."

We're rapidly expanding gum behind the capacity expansion investment we made last year, and the advertising with a new campaign that's just going on here now. Snack Mix and Snack Bites, we've actually been constrained and not actually even able to service enough. We've had to cut off all merchandising because of how well those items have done, so we're really going to be able to get behind that in a bigger way as the year goes on. Big Kat just launching, we're sponsor of the Olympics, which is going to be huge for merchandising perspective and as we told you guys last year, when we started to see some softness and share at the end of the year, we made a decision to invest, to be more competitive. And just given the time line it takes to get those dollars in the marketplace, that really kicks in beginning in May. We have the birthday execution that's really going to expand, so just a lot of activity coming in the back part of the year that we have a lot of confidence in. And we're cautiously optimistic about some of the potential anomalies we may have seen in Q1 in February, but we want to be prudent about the marketplace and balancing that with the aggressive programming we have rest of year."

I think one of the events that makes this current period of time unique is the amount of choice that there is in the market relative to what I think we've historically seen. That means the trial has moved around a lot. At the same time, you have some different things impacting retailers, and we've come out of a period of time of some uncertainty in economies. And so I think all of those things have made it a more challenging environment, but I don't think those are structural things where major changes have taken place. Now you've heard me talk about consumers have a changing relationship with food. So much of that is really around transparency, as much as it is anything else, where people are wanting to understand ingredients better than they ever have before and as manufacturers were all responding to that, certainly, we are as well. But as I take a step back, and just look at the overall industry, as well as the category that we compete in, I think many of the things that are happening are far more cyclical than I would think about them as structural."

Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on our current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC.
If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance within GAAP. Within the notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.
The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss second quarter results excluding net pretax charges of $13.9 million or $0.17 per share diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.hersheycompany.com.
Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these items.

I look forward to sharing what we've learned in the near future as it will be a catalyst of our go-to-market confectionery and SNACK-FECTION strategy over the upcoming strategic planning cycle. The feedback we've received from consumers to date is that sweet snacking, think chocolate and textural ingredients as well as other food value inclusions, such as nuts, seeds, cookie pieces, berries, et cetera, are high diet components that are a gain weight to permissible indulgence and suite snacking throughout the day. In fact, some of the initial work done here has resulted in an exciting SNACK-FECTION item that we'll be launching late in the fourth quarter.
Looking at U.S. marketplace performance, total Hershey U.S. retail take away for the 12 weeks ending July 9, 2016, within the xAOC+C channels increased 0.5% with market share of 0.1 points. This represents all Hershey manufactured products sold at retail, such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave, chocolate syrup and snack bars.
For the year-to-date period, ending July 9, 2016, candy, mint and gum, or CMG, category growth was 0.8% and was impacted by a shorter Easter season.  Nonseasonal CMG category growth progressed in the second quarter, however, it was less than estimated as we anticipated better results given both competitive and Hershey activity in the marketplace.
For the 12 weeks ending July 9, 2016, CMG category growth was plus 1.2%. Hershey's U.S. CMG market share in the second quarter was 30.8%, off 0.7 points versus the same period last year.
We believe the initiatives that we are executing against in the second half of the year and into 2017 will result into improved marketplace performance. Our number 1 priority is to restore Hershey's marketplace momentum within the very profitable U.S. market, where we've combine solid execution that leverages our scale with strong innovation and investment, our business is responding. More on this in a bit.
Our response and go-to-market strategy to fast-changing retail and consumer trends over last year or so has not been sufficient to deliver consistent top line growth that we expect from our business. To overcome the current low growth environment that's impacting much of the center of the store, we're focusing on 3 important areas of our business model. That's innovation, our marketing mix modeling and our cost structure.
Innovation is a big opportunity for us. Over the last 4 to 5 years, we had good confectionery success. Some products over delivered versus our expectations and are still doing well today, and some of the new items from last year have under delivered with lower volumes then we modeled. While innovation is hard work, our best innovation has been tied to consumer insights coming from our demand landscape, where it leveraged across big brands and platforms and driven by our go-to-market capability.
Combining this work under the leadership of Michele Buck as COO will add both focus and speed to the process. As consumers relationship with food and chocolate have evolved, we've tested different concepts of our marketing mix modeling. There continues to be a lot to learn with regard to efficiency and effectiveness as we balance our efforts across levers like direct rate, advertising, digital communications and consumer promotion.
Technology will also play a role as we leverage productive analytics and new tools that indicate the optimal ratio related to promotional spending and long-term brand building initiatives.
As I have said many times, we're a consumer centric, brand building company and we will invest in our brands and people. To do this and deliver on our financial commitments, we continue to examine our cost structure. We'll deliver approximately $135 million in cost savings this year and at least $100 million per year from 2017 through 2019.  Furthermore, we've intensified our focus on analysis of our global cost structure and business model to determine additional cost savings opportunities that we believe exist. While early, the initial work underway indicates that there are bigger opportunities to unlock these cost savings. Our overall goal in all of this is to create a streamlined structure that enables us to invest for growth and serve our retail customers and consumers in the most efficient and effective way possible while increasing our margins and profitability.
Looking at some of our 2016 innovation and advertising successes, I'm pleased with the early results related to the launch of Kit Kat Big Kat, Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites as new products. Performance of our Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites products has been strong and recent data indicates an acceleration behind TV activation. Additional gains are expected in the third quarter as canister merchandising constraints were lifted and we have more capacity that's come online to meet demand.
The Kit Kat Big Kat is an example of an instant consumable focused launch combined with new core branch advertising, which is driving growth of the entire franchise. Big Kat is the #1 new item at some of our largest customers and in the C-store channel, it's exceeding our expectations. And we're also excited about the Reeses Pieces Cup, which will only be available with an instant consumable item. Demand from retailers has been double our planning. Product began shipping earlier this month and is available in stores now.
As it relates to the second half of the year, we believe we'll see a sequential improvement in our marketplace results over the remainder of the year, driven by new advertising copy, innovation and higher levels of in-store merchandising and display, starting in July with the Summer Olympics in Rio. Our company, for the first time ever, is an official sponsor of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams. Packaging that proudly displays patriotic coloring such as red, white and blue lettering on our iconic Hershey's Milk Chocolate bar began in the second quarter. And our namesake brand, Hershey's, recently launched its first ever team USA named advertising campaign, Hello From Home, which is an extension of our Hello Happy Hershey mega brand campaign that we discussed last quarter. For this campaign, we have a trio of team USA athletes and that includes gymnast, Simone Biles; gold-medal wrestler, Jordan Boroughs; and 2012 U.S. Paralympic gold medalist, Mallory. Reeses is also participating in the Olympics with a new ad campaign featuring Winter Olympics gold medalist, Lindsey Vaughn, trying out various summer sports. To do summer like a winter olympian added a lighthearted humorous campaign that shows Miss Vaughn attempting event including archery, fencing and rhythmic gymnastics, with just a bit of humor and spoof. Some of the other Olympic related activity that we're excited about includes our Krave Meat Snack adding swimmer, Michael Phelps and soccer player, Carli Lloyd, to its promotional team. Sponsorship of the U.S. Women's National Field Hockey team in its bid to compete in Rio and to celebrate the success of team USA, we're providing fans with a once-in-a-lifetime experience to congratulate the athletes upon their return from Rio during the special visit to the U.S. Olympic Training Center.
This is a just a brief summary of some of the activity we have planned in North America that we believe will result in improved retail takeaway trends over the remainder of the year.
Now for an update on our International business, where second quarter net sales growth were slightly better than planned and up about 14% versus last year. Excluding China, whose gains were driven by lower levels of direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances as well as the discontinued India oil business, constant currency net sales increased about 2%.
I was particularly pleased with Mexico and Brazil, where combine constant currency second quarter net sales increased about 13%. And in both markets, year-to-date chocolate category growth is solid, up mid-single digits. In Mexico, our market share is off versus last year as we look to optimize product mix with a focus on global chocolate brands that will deliver sales, better profitability and market share growth over the long term.
In Brazil, market share is up slightly for the year driven by our focus on the Hershey mega brand and our differentiated portfolio that includes milk chocolate, Cookies 'N' Creme as a consumable and tablet bars and Hershey's Mais wafer products.
Net sales in India declined versus a year ago product due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business. The media invested bands, Jolly Rancher, SOFIT and Hershey's syrup, where we're focusing our efforts and investments, were up and continue to do well in the marketplace.
In China, growth sales declined in line with our estimate. The summer months are typically the low season for chocolate consumption. China chocolate category performance in the second quarter sequentially improved versus the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. In fact, the category was fractionally higher in June and we're cautiously optimistic that it gets better from here. We're executing against our plans to bring variety, news and excitement to the Hershey's Milk Chocolates, Hershey's Kisses and Golden Monkey and Munching Monkey candy and snack brands as we expect will drive solid growth and net sales growth in the second half of the year.
Over the long term, we expect global economies and category trends to improve and that the investments in our International business will continue about and contribute 1 point of our overall long-term sales algorithm.
Now to wrap up. We're a consumer-centric, brand-building company focused on innovation and growth in every category where we participate to supply the needs of our retail customers and consumers. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to analyze our cost structure as we look for additional margin enhancing opportunities that give us the flexibility to offset higher input costs and invest in our brand. We take a long term focus and believe that investing in our business will benefit the company this year and well into the future.
Now I'll turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with detail on our financial results."
98873,374510385,1014993,"The Hershey Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.64 billion increased 3.7% versus last year, slightly greater than our estimate due to timing in the U.S. and better International performance.Adjust",1476,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.64 billion increased 3.7% versus last year, slightly greater than our estimate due to timing in the U.S. and better International performance.
Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $0.85, an increase of about 9% versus last year, greater than our estimate due to the timing of investment tax credits, more on this in a bit, sales that were slightly great than forecast and lower advertising expect versus our previous estimate.
Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 80 basis points, net sales increased 4.5%. Net price realization was relatively in line with our estimates and a 90 basis point benefit. Lower International and Other segment direct trade and returns discounts and allowances, as we lap year ago challenges in China, more than offset higher North America direct trade, supporting in-store merchandising and display and related promotional price points.
Volume was at 3.1 point contribution in net sales growth driven by North American performance. Acquisitions were worth 50 basis points due primarily to barkTHINS.
By segment, second quarter North America net sales increased 3.2%. Excluding the 30 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 3.5% versus the year-ago period.
Volume was a 4.5 point contribution to sales growth and slightly benefited from the timing a select merchandising program net sales that occurred in the second quarter that were expected to ship in the third quarter. Increased levels of direct trade supporting greater levels of in-store merchandising and display resulted in net price realization headwind of 1.6 points. Acquisitions were 60 basis point benefit.
Total International and Other segment net sales for the second quarter increased 7.6% versus last year and were better than our estimate. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 5.5 points. International and Other segment volume was off 7.2 points due primarily to lower sales in China and the discontinuance of the edible oil business in India. Net price realization was a 20.3 point benefit as direct trade and returns discounts and allowances in China were meaningfully lower as we lap the year-ago challenges.
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin declined by 120 basis points in the second quarter as productivity and cost savings were offset by higher commodity costs, including a favorable purchase price variance versus standard in the year-ago period, unfavorable sales mix and higher supply chain cost related to the startup of the Malaysia manufacturing facility.
For the full year, we continue to expect the gross margin will be slightly down versus a year ago. We remain focused on our cost structure. The productivity initiatives we've discussed over the last year are on track and delivering the targeted savings. Our efforts here are yielding further opportunities, as evidenced by our full-year savings of about $135 million, which is now more than our previous estimate.
Adjusted operating profit in the second quarter increased 2.1%, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 18.1% versus 18.3%. The decline in adjusted operating profit margin was driven by our lower gross margins.
Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 5%, less than our previous estimate as we continue to analyze the components of our marketing mix modeling to determine the right level of direct trade, TV advertising, digital marketing and consumer promotion.
North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense was up meaningfully in the second quarter and is at healthy levels in the second half of the year to drive net sales and retail take away growth.
SM&A, excluding advertising and the barkTHINS acquisition, declined 2.6%, while unallocated corporate expense was lower by $200,000 versus last year. Savings from the business productivity programs and the focus on efficiency and cost savings initiatives that we outlined last quarter drove the decline although this was partially offset by the timing of employee-related costs and unexpected corporate fees that were about a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter.
Now let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I'm pleased that our total International business delivered on their Q2 plans. Adding to J.P.'s commentary on China, chocolate category performance in Q2 was in line with our forecast. We remain optimistic about the long-term outlook in China and for our brand. However, consumer spending still appears to be mixed. Therefore, our full-year sales outlook in China is slightly lower than our previous estimate. Specifically, China gross sales are forecasted to decline in 2016. However, net sales are expected to increase 10% to 20% as we don't anticipate the same level of direct trade returns, discounts and allowances as last year.
Constant currency net sales growth of core brands in Mexico and Brazil increased nicely. Excluding China, International and Other segment operating profit increased about 5%.
Moving down the P&L. First quarter [ph] interest expense of $21 million increased $2.4 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 31.4%, relatively in line with our estimate and lower than the prior year ago period of 35.3%, largely as a result of investment tax credits. However, due to timing differences, the corresponding book expense for a portion of the credit investment, which is recorded in the other income and expense line, will not be recognized until the second half of the year. We estimate this was about a $0.03 benefit in Q2. But this is just timing and for the full year, we expect to purchase about $50 million of investment tax credits, which should result in an adjusted tax rate that's slightly lower than 2015. In the second half of the year, we expect the tax rate to be about 32% and other income and expense of about $35 million related to the corresponding book expense for the purchase of tax credits.
For the second quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 214.5 million shares, down 5.1 million versus last year, resulting in adjusted minutes per share diluted of $0.85 or an increase of about 9.1% versus a year ago.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the second quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's second quarter by $5 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $40 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $3 million and accounts payable increased by $32 million.
Total capital additions including software were $62.7 million in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be in the $265 million to $275 million range, about $20 million less than our previous estimate.
During the second quarter, depreciation and amortization was $97 million and dividends paid were $121 million. In the second quarter, the company repurchased $117 million of common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. In addition, the company repurchased $32 million of common shares in the second quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.
Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $250 million, slightly lower than year ago.
As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of innovation, variety, news and in-store merchandising and programming in the marketplace. And we continue to refine our marketing mix modeling to ensure we have the optimal level of direct trade, advertising and consumer promotion supporting our brands. Advertising and related consumer marketing expense is lower versus our previous estimate. We feel good about our marketing mix modeling investments in 2016 and believe we have the right balance of spend in second half of the year that will result in a sequential improvement in marketplace performance.
The company estimates that full year 2016 net sales will increase around 1%, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of about 50 basis points and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 1 point. Constant currency net sales growth of around 2% is less than the previews estimate of about 2.5% primarily due to our expectation of lower U.S. CMG category growth over the remainder of the year and macroeconomic challenges in China impacting purchasing behavior.
The business productivity initiative announced last year in June and the incremental cost savings we discussed in April and today are on track. As a result, we continue to expect that adjusted earnings per share diluted will increase 3% to 4%, including dilution from acquisitions of $0.05 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.24 to $4.28 range.
Thank you for your time this morning, and I'll now turn it over to Mark."

Some of that work is still continuing, obviously, but we really gone through and done the sales organization work and combined those. That's gone well. We've taken what was the Hershey piece and the Golden Monkey piece and really try to consolidate those distributors. So it's a bit blended from where we've started with Golden Monkey and Hershey, but we really feel as though our go-to-market position is in the best shape that it's been. We're selling things. So as I like to think about it kind of in a simple way, are we making stuff, shipping it, selling it and collecting money? And all of those things are working for us. So I think that the market in China, as you've heard from a lot of companies, is pressured. I think we would align with that. The consumer, obviously, has to show up, but we feel good about where we're at. And we'll continue, though, I would say, as I've said before, make sure we're rightsizing our businesses to the opportunities. And certainly, we'll continue to focus against that. And then, as you think about the overall P&L, the impact that China restructure on our P&L this year is really relatively limited, so we think that'll continue to also help us as we go forward."

But I think what we've seen is that if you call on the last call, we talked about the number of new entrants that's happened, especially in the snack bars relative to the whole snacking space. And some of those entrants, I think, have gotten trial not only because they're new, but I think there's also been a different pricing delta that the obstacle to trial has been lowered. And so, I think the level of activity probably speaks more to what the net value to the customer could have been across all of the different options and opportunities available to them. So I think going forward, while we are looking a lot at our whole revenue management approach and making sure that we really got that right, we're thinking a lot about this particular question. And I do think there's some influence there as there's been trial in the category, and I would just come back to my other comments around innovation is, that it is very clear that those brands and companies who have done well in innovation have gotten a disproportionate share of the consumer's attention. And those -- that's the real quality driver, in my mind. So if you come back to what I said earlier, we're really, really focused against 3 things in our business model and it's the innovation. We're really looking at our marketing mix model because based on the previous question, you're right, allocation and resources across different pieces of the business. I think there's some things -- we learned there. And of course, we want to run approval business and invest in our brands and our people.

Welcome to The Hershey Company Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session.
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on our current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. 
Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss second quarter results excluding net pretax charges of $13.9 million or $0.17 per share diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these items.
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

Second quarter sales and earnings performance was slightly better than our expectations primarily due to timing in the U.S. International and Other segment operating and the marketplace",1750,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. Second quarter sales and earnings performance was slightly better than our expectations primarily due to timing in the U.S. International and Other segment operating and the marketplace performance was a bit greater than our expectations, and we're making progress against our strategic initiatives. The integration related to the barkTHINS acquisition is well underway, and we're excited about the opportunity here and how it fits into our broader SNACK-FECTION strategy.
Work continues on the snacking insights and consumer market segmentation that I mentioned last quarter. We're making progress, and I look forward to sharing what we've learned in the near future as it will be a catalyst of our go-to-market confectionery and SNACK-FECTION strategy over the upcoming strategic planning cycle. 
The feedback we've received from consumers to date is that sweet snacking, think chocolate and textural ingredients, as well as other food value inclusions, such as nuts, seeds, cookie pieces, berries, et cetera, are high-value components that are a gateway to permissible indulgence and sweet snacking throughout the day. In fact, some of the initial work done here has resulted in an exciting SNACK-FECTION item that we'll be launching late in the fourth quarter.
Looking at U.S. marketplace performance. Total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending July 9, 2016, within the xAOC+C channels increased 0.5%, with market share off 0.1 points. This represents all Hershey manufactured products sold at retail, such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave, chocolate syrup and snack bars.
For the year-to-date period ending July 9, 2016, candy, mint and gum, or CMG, category growth was 0.8% and was impacted by a shorter Easter season. Nonseasonal CMG category growth progressed in the second quarter. However, it was less than estimated as we anticipated better results given both competitive and Hershey activity in the marketplace.
For the 12 weeks ending July 9, 2016, CMG category growth was plus 1.2%. Hershey's U.S. CMG market share in the second quarter was 30.8%, off 0.7 points versus the same period last year.
We believe the initiatives that we are executing against in the second half of the year and into 2017 will result in improved marketplace performance. Our #1 priority is to restore Hershey's marketplace momentum within the very profitable U.S. market. Where we've combined solid execution that leverages our scale with strong innovation and investment, our business is responding. More on this in a bit.
Our response in go-to-market strategy to fast-changing retail and consumer trends over the last year or so has not been sufficient to deliver consistent top line growth that we expect from our business. To overcome the current low growth environment that's impacting much of the center of the store, we're focusing on 3 important areas of our business model. That's innovation, our marketing mix modeling and our cost structure.
Innovation is a big opportunity for us. Over the last 4 to 5 years, we had good confectionery success. Some products overdelivered versus our expectations and are still doing well today. And some of the new items from last year have underdelivered with lower volumes than we modeled. While innovation is hard work, our best innovation has been tied to consumer insights coming from our demand landscape work and leveraged across big brands and platforms and driven by our go-to-market capability. Combining this work under the leadership of Michele Buck as COO will add both focus and speed to the process. 
As consumers' relationship with food and shopping habits have evolved, we've tested different concepts of our marketing mix modeling. There continues to be a lot to learn with regard to efficiency and effectiveness as we balance our efforts across levers like direct trade, advertising, digital communications and consumer promotion.
Technology will also play a role as we leverage predictive analytics and new tools that indicate the optimal ratio related to promotional spending and long-term brand-building initiatives.
As I have said many times, we're a consumer-centric, brand-building company, and we will invest in our brands and people. To do this and deliver on our financial commitments, we continue to examine our cost structure. We'll deliver approximately $135 million in cost savings this year and at least $100 million per year from 2017 through 2019. 
Furthermore, we've intensified our focus on analysis of our global cost structure and business model to determine additional cost savings opportunities that we believe exist. While early, the initial work underway indicates that there are bigger opportunities to unlock these cost savings. 
Our overall goal in all of this is to create a streamlined structure that enables us to invest for growth and serve our retail customers and consumers in the most efficient and effective way possible while increasing our margins and profitability.
Looking at some of our 2016 innovation and advertising successes. I'm pleased with the early results related to the launch of Kit Kat Big Kat, Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites as new products. Performance of our Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites products has been strong, and recent data indicates an acceleration behind TV activation. Additional gains are expected in the third quarter as canister merchandising constraints were lifted and we have more capacity that's come online to meet demand.
The Kit Kat Big Kat is an example of an instant consumable-focused launch combined with new core branch advertising, which is driving growth of the entire franchise. Big Kat is the #1 new item at some of our largest customers, and in the C-store channel, it's exceeding our expectations. 
And we're also excited about the Reese's Pieces Cup, which will only be available as an instant consumable item. Demand from retailers has been double our planning. Product began shipping earlier this month and is available in stores now.
As it relates to the second half of the year, we believe we'll see a sequential improvement in our marketplace results over the remainder of the year, driven by new advertising copy, innovation and higher levels of in-store merchandising and display, starting in July with the Summer Olympics in Rio. 
Our company, for the first time ever, is an official sponsor of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams. 
Packaging that proudly displays patriotic coloring, such as red, white and blue lettering, on our iconic Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar began in the second quarter. And our namesake brand, Hershey's, recently launched its first ever Team USA-themed advertising campaign, Hello From Home, which is an extension of our Hello Happy Hershey mega brand campaign that we discussed last quarter. For this campaign, we have a trio of Team USA athletes that includes gymnast, Simone Biles; gold-medal wrestler, Jordan Burroughs and 2012 U.S. Paralympic gold medalist, Mallory Weggemann. 
Reese's is also participating in the Olympics with a new ad campaign featuring Winter Olympics gold medalist, Lindsey Vonn, trying out various summer sports. To do summer like a winter Olympian added a lighthearted humorous campaign that shows Ms. Vonn attempting events, including archery, dressage, fencing and rhythmic gymnastics, with just a bit of humor and spoof. 
Some of the other Olympic-related activity that we're excited about includes our Krave meat snacks adding swimmer, Michael Phelps, and soccer player, Carli Lloyd, to its promotional team; sponsorship of the U.S. Women's National Field Hockey Team in its bid to compete in Rio; and to celebrate the success of Team USA, we're providing fans with a once-in-a-lifetime experience to congratulate the athletes upon their return from Rio during a special visit to the U.S. Olympic Training Center.
Now this is a just a brief summary of some of the activity we have planned in North America that we believe will result in improved retail takeaway trends over the remainder of the year.
Now for an update on our International business, where second quarter net sales growth were slightly better than planned and up about 14% versus last year. Excluding China, whose gains were driven by lower levels of direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances as well as the discontinued India oil business, constant-currency net sales increased about 2%.
I was particularly pleased with Mexico and Brazil, where combined constant-currency second quarter net sales increased about 13%. And in both markets, year-to-date chocolate category growth is solid, up mid-single digits. 
In Mexico, our market share is off versus last year as we look to optimize product mix with a focus on global chocolate brands that will deliver sales, better profitability and market share growth over the long term.
In Brazil, market share is up slightly for the year, driven by our focus on the Hershey mega brand and our differentiated portfolio that includes Milk Chocolate, Cookies 'N' Creme instant consumable and tablet bars and Hershey's Mais wafer products.
Net sales in India declined versus the year ago period due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business. The media invested bands, Jolly Rancher, SOFIT and HERSHEY'S Syrup, where we're focusing our efforts and investments, were up and continue to do well in the marketplace.
In China, growth sales declined in line with our estimate. The summer months are typically the low season for chocolate consumption. China chocolate category performance in the second quarter sequentially improved versus the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. In fact, the category was fractionally higher in June, and we're cautiously optimistic that it gets better from here. We're executing against our plans to bring variety, news and excitement to the Hershey's Milk Chocolates, Hershey's Kisses and Golden Monkey and Munching Monkey candy and snacks brands as we expect it will drive solid growth and net sales growth in the second half of the year.
Over the long term, we expect global economies and category trends to improve and that the investments in our International business will continue about and contribute 1 point of our overall long-term sales algorithm.
Now to wrap up. We're a consumer-centric, brand-building company focused on innovation and growth in every category where we participate to satisfy the needs of our retail customers and consumers. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to analyze our cost structure as we look for additional margin-enhancing opportunities that give us the flexibility to offset higher input costs and invest in our brand. We take a long-term focus and believe that investing in our business will benefit the company this year and well into the future.
Now I'll turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with detail on our financial results."

Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.64 billion increased 3.7% versus last year, slightly greater than our estimate due to timing in the U.S. and better International performance.Adjust",1481,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.64 billion increased 3.7% versus last year, slightly greater than our estimate due to timing in the U.S. and better International performance.
Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $0.85, an increase of about 9% versus last year, greater than our estimate due to the timing of investment tax credits, more on this in a bit, sales that were slightly greater than forecast and lower advertising expense versus our previous estimate.
Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 80 basis points, net sales increased 4.5%. Net price realization was relatively in line with our estimates and a 90 basis point benefit. Lower International and Other segment direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances, as we lap year ago challenges in China, more than offset higher North America direct trade, supporting in-store merchandising and display and related promotional price points.
Volume was a 3.1-point contribution to net sales growth, driven by North American performance. Acquisitions were worth 50 basis points due primarily to barkTHINS.
By segment, second quarter North America net sales increased 3.2%. Excluding the 30 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 3.5% versus the year ago period. Volume was a 4.5-point contribution to sales growth and slightly benefited from the timing of select merchandising program net sales that occurred in the second quarter that were expected to ship in the third quarter. Increased levels of direct trade, supporting greater levels of in-store merchandising and display, resulted in net price realization headwind of 1.6 points. Acquisitions were a 60 basis point benefit.
Total International and Other segment net sales for the second quarter increased 7.6% versus last year and were better than our estimate. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 5.5 points. International and Other segment volume was off 7.2 points due primarily to lower sales in China and the discontinuance of the edible oil business in India. Net price realization was a 20.3-point benefit as direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances in China were meaningfully lower as we lap the year ago challenges.
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin declined by 120 basis points in the second quarter as productivity and cost savings were offset by higher commodity costs, including a favorable purchase price variance versus standard in the year ago period; unfavorable sales mix; and higher supply chain costs related to the start-up of the Malaysia manufacturing facility. For the full year, we continue to expect that gross margin will be slightly down versus a year ago. 
We remain focused on our cost structure. The productivity initiatives we have discussed over the last year are on track and delivering the targeted savings. Our efforts here are yielding further opportunities, as evidenced by our full year savings of about $135 million, which is now more than our previous estimate.
Adjusted operating profit in the second quarter increased 2.1%, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 18.1% versus 18.3%. The decline in adjusted operating profit margin was driven by our lower gross margins.
Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 5%, less than our previous estimate as we continue to analyze the components of our marketing mix modeling to determine the right level of direct trade, TV advertising, digital marketing and consumer promotion.
North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense was up meaningfully in the second quarter and is at healthy levels in the second half of the year to drive net sales and retail takeaway growth.
SM&A, excluding advertising and the barkTHINS acquisition, declined 2.6%, while unallocated corporate expense was lower by $200,000 versus last year. Savings from the business productivity programs and the focus on efficiency and cost savings initiatives that we outlined last quarter drove the decline, although this was partially offset by the timing of employee-related costs and unexpected corporate fees that were about a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter.
Now let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I'm pleased that our total International business delivered on their Q2 plans. Adding to J.P.'s commentary on China, chocolate category performance in Q2 was in line with our forecast. We remain optimistic about the long-term outlook in China and for our brand. However, consumer spending still appears to be mixed. Therefore, our full year sales outlook in China is slightly lower than our previous estimate. Specifically, China gross sales are forecasted to decline in 2016. However, net sales are expected to increase 10% to 20% as we don't anticipate the same level of direct trade, returns, discounts and allowances as last year.
Constant-currency net sales growth of core brands in Mexico and Brazil increased nicely. Excluding China, International and Other segment operating profit increased about 5%.
Moving down the P&L. First quarter (sic) [second quarter] interest expense of $21 million increased $2.4 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 31.4%, relatively in line with our estimate and lower than the prior period -- year ago period of 35.3%, largely as a result of investment tax credits. 
However, due to timing differences, the corresponding book expense for a portion of the credit investment, which is recorded in the other income and expense line, will not be recognized until the second half of the year. We estimate this was about a $0.03 benefit in Q2. But this is just timing. And for the full year, we expect to purchase about $50 million of investment tax credits, which should result in an adjusted tax rate that's slightly lower than 2015. 
In the second half of the year, we expect the tax rate to be about 32% and other income and expense of about $35 million related to the corresponding book expense for the purchase of tax credits.
For the second quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 214.5 million shares, down 5.1 million versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.85 or an increase of about 9.1% versus a year ago.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the second quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year second quarter by $5 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $40 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $3 million, and accounts payable increased by $32 million.
Total capital additions, including software, were $62.7 million in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be in the $265 million to $275 million range, about $20 million less than our previous estimate.
During the second quarter, depreciation and amortization was $97 million, and dividends paid were $121 million. 
In the second quarter, the company repurchased $117 million of common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. In addition, the company repurchased $32 million of common shares in the second quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.
Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $250 million, slightly lower than year ago.
As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of innovation, variety, news and in-store merchandising and programming in the marketplace. And we continue to refine our marketing mix modeling to ensure we have the optimal level of direct trade, advertising and consumer promotion supporting our brands. Advertising and related consumer marketing expense is lower versus our previous estimate. We feel good about our marketing mix modeling investments in 2016 and believe we have the right balance of spend in second half of the year that will result in a sequential improvement in marketplace performance.
The company estimates that full year 2016 net sales will increase around 1%, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of about 50 basis points and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 1 point. 
Constant-currency net sales growth of around 2% is less than the previous estimate of about 2.5% primarily due to our expectation of lower U.S. CMG category growth over the remainder of the year and macroeconomic challenges in China impacting purchasing behavior.
The business productivity initiative announced last year in June and the incremental cost savings we discussed in April and today are on track. As a result, we continue to expect that adjusted earnings per share diluted will increase 3% to 4%, including dilution from acquisitions of $0.05 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.24 to $4.28 range.

That's really a -- more of a onetime or every couple year impact. We've seen some more activity in some of the indulgent categories in the second quarter. And frankly, there was a little bit greater interaction with some of those categories than we had anticipated. And we do believe we have some opportunities to further optimize our marketing mix modeling, as J.P. discussed.

I think we pulled back at a time that some others in the marketplace actually accelerated. So as we look to next year, we are certainly adjusting our approach. We think that variety and news are absolutely key, and that's really where our focus will be, to dial up efforts, in combination with the strong innovation that we feel really good about on chocolate, around things like core news, like Big Kat, Reese's Pieces Cup and then big sustainable scale innovation on chocolate, like the big one that we have coming towards the end of the year.

So I -- let me talk about the pricing piece a little bit, and then we can touch again on sort of the snack wheel stuff. But I think what we have seen is that if you recall, on the last call, we talked about the number of new entrants that's happened, especially in snack bars relative to the whole snacking space. And some of those entrants, I think, have gotten trial not only because they're new, but I think there's also been a different pricing delta that the obstacle to trial has been lowered. And so I think the level of activity probably speaks more to what the net value to the consumer could have been across all of the different options and opportunities available to them. So I think going forward, while we are looking a lot at our whole revenue management approach and making sure that we've really got that right, we're thinking a lot about this particular question. And I do think there's some influence there as there's been trial in the category. And I would just come back to my other comment around innovation, is it's is very clear that those brands and companies who have done well in innovation have gotten a disproportionate share of the consumers' attention. And those -- that's the real quality driver, in my mind. So if you come back to what I said earlier, we're really, really focused against 3 things in our business model. And it's the innovation. We're really looking at our marketing mix model because, based on the previous question, you're right, allocation and resources across different pieces of the business, I think there are some things we learned there. And then of course, we want to run a frugal business and invest in our brands and our people. And those are the 3 things, I think, you should take away from what we're really talking about today."

So our most successful innovations are clearly grounded in deep consumer insights, and we've certainly gone -- leveraged a lot of insights and research as we've developed this proposition and feel quite good about it. As J.P. said, it really does play between those themes in SNACK-FECTION of marrying cookie and chocolate obviously. And it also really plays on some deep insights around the palate. If you think about the kind of creamy crunchy palate, sweet and salty we see in the marketplace has demonstrated a lot of growth. And we're seeing with younger consumers in particular, there is strong interest in complex eats that this really delivers upon. That will provide incremental usage versus our portfolio, which tends to be more of a -- kind of a straight, creamy palate. So if you think about the textural experiences consumers are looking for and the new users that we're able to bring in, we're feeling really good about it."

Welcome to The Hershey Company Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session.
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on our current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. 
Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss second quarter results excluding net pretax charges of $13.9 million or $0.17 per share diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these items.
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

Second quarter sales and earnings performance was slightly better than our expectations primarily due to timing in the U.S. International and Other segment operating and marketplace performance was a bit greater than our expectations, and we're making progress against our strategic initiatives. The integration related to the barkTHINS acquisition is well under way, and we're excited about the opportunity here and how it fits into our broader SNACK-FECTION strategy.
Work continues on the snacking insights and consumer market segmentation that I mentioned last quarter. We're making progress, and I look forward to sharing what we've learned in the near future, as it will be a catalyst of our go-to-market confectionery and SNACK-FECTION strategy over the upcoming strategic planning cycle. 
The feedback we've received from consumers to date is that sweet snacking, think chocolate and textural ingredients, as well as other food value inclusions, such as nuts, seeds, cookie pieces, berries, et cetera, are high-value components that are a gateway to permissible indulgence and sweet snacking throughout the day. In fact, some of the initial work done here has resulted in an exciting SNACK-FECTION item that we'll be launching late in the fourth quarter.
Looking at U.S. marketplace performance. Total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending July 9, 2016 within the xAOC+C channels increased 0.5%, with market share off 0.1 points. This represents all Hershey manufactured products sold at retail, such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave, chocolate syrup and snack bars.
For the year-to-date period ending July 9, 2016, candy, mint and gum, or CMG, category growth was 0.8% and was impacted by a shorter Easter season. Nonseasonal CMG category growth progressed in the second quarter. However, it was less than estimated as we anticipated better results given both competitive and Hershey activity in the marketplace.
For the 12 weeks ending July 9, 2016, CMG category growth was plus 1.2%. Hershey's U.S. CMG market share in the second quarter was 30.8%, off 0.7 points versus the same period last year.
We believe the initiatives that we are executing against in the second half of the year and into 2017 will result in improved marketplace performance. Our #1 priority is to restore Hershey's marketplace momentum within the very profitable U.S. market. Where we've combined solid execution that leverages our scale with strong innovation and investment, our business is responding. More on this in a bit.
Our response in go-to-market strategy to fast-changing retail and consumer trends over the last year or so has not been sufficient to deliver consistent top line growth that we expect from our business. To overcome the current low growth environment that's impacting much of the center of the store, we're focusing on 3 important areas of our business model. That's innovation, our marketing mix modeling and our cost structure.
Innovation is a big opportunity for us. Over the last 4 to 5 years, we had good confectionery success. Some products overdelivered versus our expectations and are still doing well today. And some of the new items from last year have underdelivered with lower volumes than we modeled. While innovation is hard work, our best innovation has been tied to consumer insights coming from our demand landscape work and leveraged across big brands and platforms and driven by our go-to-market capability. Combining this work under the leadership of Michele Buck as COO will add both focus and speed to the process. 
As consumers' relationship with food and shopping habits have evolved, we've tested different concepts of our marketing mix modeling. There continues to be a lot to learn with regard to efficiency and effectiveness as we balance our efforts across levers like direct trade, advertising, digital communications and consumer promotion.
Technology will also play a role as we leverage predictive analytics and new tools that indicate the optimal ratio related to promotional spending and long-term brand-building initiatives.
As I have said many times, we're a consumer-centric, brand-building company, and we will invest in our brands and people. To do this and deliver on our financial commitments, we continue to examine our cost structure. We'll deliver approximately $135 million in cost savings this year and at least $100 million per year from 2017 through 2019. 
Furthermore, we've intensified our focus on analysis of our global cost structure and business model to determine additional cost savings opportunities that we believe exist. While early, the initial work under way indicates that there are bigger opportunities to unlock these cost savings. 
Our overall goal in all of this is to create a streamlined structure that enables us to invest for growth and serve our retail customers and consumers in the most efficient and effective way possible while increasing our margins and profitability.
Looking at some of our 2016 innovation and advertising successes. I'm pleased with the early results related to the launch of Kit Kat Big Kat, Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites as new products. Performance of our Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites products has been strong, and recent data indicates an acceleration behind TV activation. Additional gains are expected in the third quarter as canister merchandising constraints were lifted and we have more capacity that's come online to meet demand.
The Kit Kat Big Kat is an example of an instant consumable-focused launch combined with new core branch advertising, which is driving growth of the entire franchise. Big Kat is the #1 new item at some of our largest customers, and in the C-store channel, it's exceeding our expectations. 
And we're also excited about the Reese's Pieces Cup, which will only be available as an instant consumable item. Demand from retailers has been double our planning. Product began shipping earlier this month and is available in stores now.
As it relates to the second half of the year, we believe we'll see a sequential improvement in our marketplace results over the remainder of the year, driven by new advertising copy, innovation and higher levels of in-store merchandising and display, starting in July with the Summer Olympics in Rio. 
Our company, for the first time ever, is an official sponsor of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams. 
Packaging that proudly displays patriotic coloring, such as red, white and blue lettering on our iconic Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar, began in the second quarter. And our namesake brand, Hershey's, recently launched its first ever Team USA-themed advertising campaign, Hello From Home, which is an extension of our Hello Happy Hershey mega brand campaign that we discussed last quarter. For this campaign, we have a trio of Team USA athletes that includes gymnast, Simone Biles; gold-medal wrestler, Jordan Burroughs and 2012 U.S. Paralympic gold medalist, Mallory Weggemann. 
Reese's is also participating in the Olympics with a new ad campaign featuring Winter Olympics gold medalist, Lindsey Vonn, trying out various summer sports. The ""Do Summer like a Winter Olympian"" ad is a lighthearted, humorous campaign that shows Ms. Vonn attempting events, including archery, dressage, fencing and rhythmic gymnastics, with just a bit of humor and spoof. 
Some of the other Olympic-related activity that we're excited about includes our Krave meat snacks adding swimmer, Michael Phelps, and soccer player, Carli Lloyd, to its promotional team; sponsorship of the U.S. Women's National Field Hockey Team in its bid to compete in Rio; and to celebrate the success of Team USA, we're providing fans with a once-in-a-lifetime experience to congratulate the athletes upon their return from Rio during a special visit to the U.S. Olympic Training Center.
Now this is a just a brief summary of some of the activity we have planned in North America that we believe will result in improved retail takeaway trends over the remainder of the year.
Now for an update on our International business, where second quarter net sales growth was slightly better than planned and up about 14% versus last year. Excluding China, whose gains were driven by lower levels of direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances, as well as the discontinued India oil business, constant-currency net sales increased about 2%.
I was particularly pleased with Mexico and Brazil, where combined constant-currency second quarter net sales increased about 13%. And in both markets, year-to-date chocolate category growth is solid, up mid-single digits. 
In Mexico, our market share is off versus last year as we look to optimize product mix with a focus on global chocolate brands that will deliver sales, better profitability and market share growth over the long term.
In Brazil, market share is up slightly for the year, driven by our focus on the Hershey mega brand and our differentiated portfolio that includes Milk Chocolate, Cookies 'N' Creme instant consumables and tablet bars and Hershey's Mais wafer products.
Net sales in India declined versus the year ago period due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business. The media invested bands, Jolly Rancher, SOFIT and HERSHEY'S Syrup, where we're focusing our efforts and investments, were up and continue to do well in the marketplace.
In China, growth sales declined in line with our estimate. The summer months are typically the low season for chocolate consumption. China chocolate category performance in the second quarter sequentially improved versus the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. In fact, the category was fractionally higher in June, and we're cautiously optimistic that it gets better from here. We're executing against our plans to bring variety, news and excitement to the Hershey's Milk Chocolates, Hershey's Kisses and Golden Monkey and Munching Monkey candy and snacks brands as we expect will drive solid growth and net sales growth in the second half of the year.
Over the long term, we expect global economies and category trends to improve and that the investments in our International business will continue about and contribute 1 point of our overall long-term sales algorithm.
Now to wrap up. We're a consumer-centric, brand-building company focused on innovation and growth in every category where we participate to satisfy the needs of our retail customers and consumers. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to analyze our cost structure as we look for additional margin-enhancing opportunities that give us the flexibility to offset higher input costs and invest in our brands. We take a long-term focus and believe that investing in our business will benefit the company this year and well into the future.
Now I'll turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with detail on our financial results."
98873,374510385,1015662,"The Hershey Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.64 billion increased 3.7% versus last year, slightly greater than our estimate due to timing in the U.S. and better International performance.Adjust",1481,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.64 billion increased 3.7% versus last year, slightly greater than our estimate due to timing in the U.S. and better International performance.
Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $0.85, an increase of about 9% versus last year, greater than our estimate due to the timing of investment tax credits, more on this in a bit; sales that were slightly greater than forecast; and lower advertising expense versus our previous estimate.
Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 80 basis points, net sales increased 4.5%. Net price realization was relatively in line with our estimates and a 90 basis point benefit. Lower International and Other segment direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances, as we lap year ago challenges in China, more than offset higher North America direct trade, supporting in-store merchandising and display and related promotional price points.
Volume was a 3.1-point contribution to net sales growth, driven by North American performance. Acquisitions were worth 50 basis points due primarily to barkTHINS.
By segment, second quarter North America net sales increased 3.2%. Excluding the 30 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 3.5% versus the year ago period. Volume was a 4.5-point contribution to sales growth and slightly benefited from the timing of select merchandising program net sales that occurred in the second quarter that were expected to ship in the third quarter. Increased levels of direct trade, supporting greater levels of in-store merchandising and display, resulted in net price realization headwinds of 1.6 points. Acquisitions were a 60 basis point benefit.
Total International and Other segment net sales for the second quarter increased 7.6% versus last year and were better than our estimate. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 5.5 points. International and Other segment volume was off 7.2 points due primarily to lower sales in China and the discontinuance of the edible oil business in India. Net price realization was a 20.3-point benefit as direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances in China were meaningfully lower as we lap the year ago challenges.
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin declined by 120 basis points in the second quarter as productivity and cost savings were offset by higher commodity costs, including a favorable purchase price variance versus standard in the year ago period; unfavorable sales mix; and higher supply chain costs related to the start-up of the Malaysia manufacturing facility. For the full year, we continue to expect that gross margin will be slightly down versus a year ago. 
We remain focused on our cost structure. The productivity initiatives we have discussed over the last year are on track and delivering the targeted savings. Our efforts here are yielding further opportunities, as evidenced by our full year savings of about $135 million, which is now more than our previous estimate.
Adjusted operating profit in the second quarter increased 2.1%, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 18.1% versus 18.3%. The decline in adjusted operating profit margin was driven by lower gross margins.
Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 5%, less than our previous estimate, as we continue to analyze the components of our marketing mix modeling to determine the right level of direct trade, TV advertising, digital marketing and consumer promotion.
North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense was up meaningfully in the second quarter and is at healthy levels in the second half of the year to drive net sales and retail takeaway growth.
SM&A, excluding advertising and the barkTHINS acquisition, declined 2.6%, while unallocated corporate expense was lower by $200,000 versus last year. Savings from the business productivity programs and the focus on efficiency and cost savings initiatives that we outlined last quarter drove the declines, although this was partially offset by the timing of employee-related costs and unexpected corporate fees that were about a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter.
Now let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I'm pleased that our total International business delivered on their Q2 plans. Adding to J.P.'s commentary on China, chocolate category performance in Q2 was in line with our forecast. We remain optimistic about the long-term outlook in China and for our brands. However, consumer spending still appears to be mixed. Therefore, our full year sales outlook in China is slightly lower than our previous estimate. Specifically, China gross sales are forecasted to decline in 2016. However, net sales are expected to increase 10% to 20% as we don't anticipate the same level of direct trade, returns, discounts and allowances as last year.
Constant-currency net sales growth of core brands in Mexico and Brazil increased nicely. Excluding China, International and Other segment operating profit increased about 5%.
Moving down the P&L. First quarter (sic) [second quarter] interest expense of $21 million increased $2.4 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 31.4%, relatively in line with our estimate and lower than the prior period -- year ago period of 35.3%, largely as a result of investment tax credits. 
However, due to timing differences, the corresponding book expense for a portion of the credit investments, which is recorded in the other income and expense line, will not be recognized until the second half of the year. We estimate this was about a $0.03 benefit in Q2. But this is just timing. And for the full year, we expect to purchase about $50 million of investment tax credits, which should result in an adjusted tax rate that's slightly lower than 2015. 
In the second half of the year, we expect the tax rate to be about 32% and other income and expense of about $35 million related to the corresponding book expense for the purchase of tax credits.
For the second quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 214.5 million shares, down 5.1 million versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.85 or an increase of about 9.1% versus a year ago.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the second quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's second quarter by $5 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $40 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $3 million, and accounts payable increased by $32 million.
Total capital additions, including software, were $62.7 million in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be in the $265 million to $275 million range, about $20 million less than our previous estimate.
During the second quarter, depreciation and amortization was $97 million, and dividends paid were $121 million. 
In the second quarter, the company repurchased $117 million of common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. In addition, the company repurchased $32 million of common shares in the second quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.
Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $250 million, slightly lower than the year ago.
As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of innovation, variety, news and in-store merchandising and programming in the marketplace. And we continue to refine our marketing mix modeling to ensure we have the optimal level of direct trade, advertising and consumer promotion supporting our brands. Advertising and related consumer marketing expense is lower versus our previous estimate. We feel good about our marketing mix modeling investments in 2016 and believe we have the right balance of spend in second half of the year that will result in a sequential improvement in marketplace performance.
The company estimates that full year 2016 net sales will increase around 1%, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of about 50 basis points and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 1 point. 
Constant-currency net sales growth of around 2% is less than the previous estimate of about 2.5%, primarily due to our expectation of lower U.S. CMG category growth over the remainder of the year and macroeconomic challenges in China impacting purchasing behavior.
The business productivity initiative announced last year in June and the incremental cost savings we discussed in April and today are on track. As a result, we continue to expect that adjusted earnings per share diluted will increase 3% to 4%, including dilution from acquisitions of $0.05 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.24 to $4.28 range.
Thank you for your time this morning, and I'll now turn it over to Mark."

And we do believe we have some opportunities to further optimize our marketing mix modeling, as J.P. discussed.

So just trying to get a sense for how much of the work you need to do is really in getting immediate consumption changed or is it really equal, both at-home and immediate consumption?"

In terms of our acquisition and integration work there, I would tell you that we're making really good progress against the integration. Some of that work is still continuing, obviously, but we've really gone through and done the sales organization work and combined those. That's gone well. We've taken what was the Hershey piece and the Golden Monkey piece and really tried to consolidate those distributors. So it's a bit blended from where we started with Golden Monkey and Hershey, but we really feel as though our go-to-market position is in the best shape that it's been. We're selling things. So as I like to think about it kind of in a simple way, are we making stuff, shipping it, selling it and collecting money? And all of those things are working for us. So I think that the market in China, as you've heard from a lot of companies, is pressured. I think we would align with that. The consumer obviously has to show up, but we feel good about where we're at. And we'll continue, though, I would say, to, as I've said before, make sure we're rightsizing all of our businesses to the opportunities. And certainly, we'll continue to focus against that. And then as you think about the overall P&L, the impact of China restructure on our P&L this year is really relatively limited. So we think that'll continue to also help us as we go forward."

So as we move through the year, you have the benefit of that volume that won't necessarily be a piece of the takeaway, so you might have a bit of a disconnect there in the second half. It shouldn't be significant. But as we've talked about our expectations in terms of the balance of the year, it does take into consideration the first half of the year and where we've seen the category growth be and that's probably where you also have seen some of the moderation on the outlook and expectation there.

So I -- let me talk about the pricing piece a little bit, and then we can touch again on sort of the snack wheel stuff. But I think what we have seen is that if you recall on the last call we talked about the number of new entrants that's happened, especially in snack bars relative to the whole snacking space. And some of those entrants, I think, have gotten trial not only because they're new, but I think there's also been a different pricing delta that the obstacle to trial has been lowered. And so I think the level of activity probably speaks more to what the net value to the consumer could have been across all of the different options and opportunities available to them. So I think going forward, while we are looking a lot at our whole revenue management approach and making sure that we really got that right, we're thinking a lot about this particular question. And I do think there's some influence there as there's been trial in the category. And I would just come back to my other comment around innovation, is it's is very clear that those brands and companies who have done well in innovation have gotten a disproportionate share of the consumers' attention. And those -- that's the real quality driver, in my mind. So if you come back to what I said earlier, we're really, really focused against 3 things in our business model. And it's the innovation. We're really looking at our marketing mix model, because, based on the previous question, you're right, allocation and resources across different pieces of the business, I think there are some things we learned there. And then of course, we want to run a frugal business and invest in our brands and our people. And those are the 3 things, I think, you should take away from what we're really talking about today."

If you think about the kind of the creamy crunchy palate, sweet and salty we see in the marketplace has demonstrated a lot of growth. And we're seeing with younger consumers in particular, there is strong interest in complex eats that this really delivers upon that will provide incremental usage versus our portfolio, which tends to be more of a -- kind of a straight, creamy palate.

It's many times a platform, and it allows you then to expand even across brands because you've identified a need state that's really important. If you look at how we classify innovation, actually, our numbers versus our innovation targets are actually pretty good this year. I mean, it's not that they're wildly different, but what you have to really achieve is that stickiness and then the thing that it gets you to the platform innovation. So we have a really good pipeline of things in front of us. And so I don't think it's about all of a sudden having to start focusing against innovation. It's really making sure that we're bringing the right innovation to the market with the right investment and productivity. So that's really how I think about it.

Welcome to The Hershey Company Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session.
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on our current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. 
Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss second quarter results excluding net pretax charges of $13.9 million or $0.17 per share diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these items.
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

Second quarter sales and earnings performance was slightly better than our expectations primarily due to timing in the U.S. International and Other segment operating and marketplace performance was a bit greater than our expectations, and we're making progress against our strategic initiatives. The integration related to the barkTHINS acquisition is well under way, and we're excited about the opportunity here and how it fits into our broader SNACK-FECTION strategy.
Work continues on the snacking insights and consumer market segmentation that I mentioned last quarter. We're making progress, and I look forward to sharing what we've learned in the near future, as it will be a catalyst of our go-to-market confectionery and SNACK-FECTION strategy over the upcoming strategic planning cycle. 
The feedback we've received from consumers to date is that sweet snacking, think chocolate and textural ingredients, as well as other food value inclusions, such as nuts, seeds, cookie pieces, berries, et cetera, are high-value components that are a gateway to permissible indulgence and sweet snacking throughout the day. In fact, some of the initial work done here has resulted in an exciting SNACK-FECTION item that we'll be launching late in the fourth quarter.
Looking at U.S. marketplace performance. Total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending July 9, 2016 within the xAOC+C channels increased 0.5%, with market share off 0.1 points. This represents all Hershey manufactured products sold at retail, such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave, chocolate syrup and snack bars.
For the year-to-date period ending July 9, 2016, candy, mint and gum, or CMG, category growth was 0.8% and was impacted by a shorter Easter season. Nonseasonal CMG category growth progressed in the second quarter. However, it was less than estimated as we anticipated better results given both competitive and Hershey activity in the marketplace.
For the 12 weeks ending July 9, 2016, CMG category growth was plus 1.2%. Hershey's U.S. CMG market share in the second quarter was 30.8%, off 0.7 points versus the same period last year.
We believe the initiatives that we are executing against in the second half of the year and into 2017 will result in improved marketplace performance. Our #1 priority is to restore Hershey's marketplace momentum within the very profitable U.S. market. Where we've combined solid execution that leverages our scale with strong innovation and investment, our business is responding. More on this in a bit.
Our response in go-to-market strategy to fast-changing retail and consumer trends over the last year or so has not been sufficient to deliver consistent top line growth that we expect from our business. To overcome the current low growth environment that's impacting much of the center of the store, we're focusing on 3 important areas of our business model. That's innovation, our marketing mix modeling and our cost structure.
Innovation is a big opportunity for us. Over the last 4 to 5 years, we had good confectionery success. Some products overdelivered versus our expectations and are still doing well today. And some of the new items from last year have underdelivered with lower volumes than we modeled. While innovation is hard work, our best innovation has been tied to consumer insights coming from our demand landscape work and leveraged across big brands and platforms and driven by our go-to-market capability. Combining this work under the leadership of Michele Buck as COO will add both focus and speed to the process. 
As consumers' relationship with food and shopping habits have evolved, we've tested different concepts of our marketing mix modeling. There continues to be a lot to learn with regard to efficiency and effectiveness as we balance our efforts across levers like direct trade, advertising, digital communications and consumer promotion.
Technology will also play a role as we leverage predictive analytics and new tools that indicate the optimal ratio related to promotional spending and long-term brand-building initiatives.
As I have said many times, we're a consumer-centric, brand-building company, and we will invest in our brands and people. To do this and deliver on our financial commitments, we continue to examine our cost structure. We'll deliver approximately $135 million in cost savings this year and at least $100 million per year from 2017 through 2019. 
Furthermore, we've intensified our focus on analysis of our global cost structure and business model to determine additional cost savings opportunities that we believe exist. While early, the initial work under way indicates that there are bigger opportunities to unlock these cost savings. 
Our overall goal in all of this is to create a streamlined structure that enables us to invest for growth and serve our retail customers and consumers in the most efficient and effective way possible while increasing our margins and profitability.
Looking at some of our 2016 innovation and advertising successes. I'm pleased with the early results related to the launch of Kit Kat Big Kat, Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites as new products. Performance of our Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites products has been strong, and recent data indicates an acceleration behind TV activation. Additional gains are expected in the third quarter as canister merchandising constraints were lifted and we have more capacity that's come online to meet demand.
The Kit Kat Big Kat is an example of an instant consumable-focused launch combined with new core branch advertising, which is driving growth of the entire franchise. Big Kat is the #1 new item at some of our largest customers, and in the C-store channel, it's exceeding our expectations. 
And we're also excited about the Reese's Pieces Cup, which will only be available as an instant consumable item. Demand from retailers has been double our planning. Product began shipping earlier this month and is available in stores now.
As it relates to the second half of the year, we believe we'll see a sequential improvement in our marketplace results over the remainder of the year, driven by new advertising copy, innovation and higher levels of in-store merchandising and display, starting in July with the Summer Olympics in Rio. 
Our company, for the first time ever, is an official sponsor of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams. 
Packaging that proudly displays patriotic coloring, such as red, white and blue lettering on our iconic Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar, began in the second quarter. And our namesake brand, Hershey's, recently launched its first ever Team USA-themed advertising campaign, Hello From Home, which is an extension of our Hello Happy Hershey mega brand campaign that we discussed last quarter. For this campaign, we have a trio of Team USA athletes that includes gymnast, Simone Biles; gold-medal wrestler, Jordan Burroughs and 2012 U.S. Paralympic gold medalist, Mallory Weggemann. 
Reese's is also participating in the Olympics with a new ad campaign featuring Winter Olympics gold medalist, Lindsey Vonn, trying out various summer sports. The ""Do Summer like a Winter Olympian"" ad is a lighthearted, humorous campaign that shows Ms. Vonn attempting events, including archery, dressage, fencing and rhythmic gymnastics, with just a bit of humor and spoof. 
Some of the other Olympic-related activity that we're excited about includes our Krave meat snacks adding swimmer, Michael Phelps, and soccer player, Carli Lloyd, to its promotional team; sponsorship of the U.S. Women's National Field Hockey Team in its bid to compete in Rio; and to celebrate the success of Team USA, we're providing fans with a once-in-a-lifetime experience to congratulate the athletes upon their return from Rio during a special visit to the U.S. Olympic Training Center.
Now this is a just a brief summary of some of the activity we have planned in North America that we believe will result in improved retail takeaway trends over the remainder of the year.
Now for an update on our International business, where second quarter net sales growth was slightly better than planned and up about 14% versus last year. Excluding China, whose gains were driven by lower levels of direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances, as well as the discontinued India oil business, constant-currency net sales increased about 2%.
I was particularly pleased with Mexico and Brazil, where combined constant-currency second quarter net sales increased about 13%. And in both markets, year-to-date chocolate category growth is solid, up mid-single digits. 
In Mexico, our market share is off versus last year as we look to optimize product mix with a focus on global chocolate brands that will deliver sales, better profitability and market share growth over the long term.
In Brazil, market share is up slightly for the year, driven by our focus on the Hershey mega brand and our differentiated portfolio that includes Milk Chocolate, Cookies 'N' Creme instant consumables and tablet bars and Hershey's Mais wafer products.
Net sales in India declined versus the year ago period due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business. The media invested bands, Jolly Rancher, SOFIT and HERSHEY'S Syrup, where we're focusing our efforts and investments, were up and continue to do well in the marketplace.
In China, growth sales declined in line with our estimate. The summer months are typically the low season for chocolate consumption. China chocolate category performance in the second quarter sequentially improved versus the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. In fact, the category was fractionally higher in June, and we're cautiously optimistic that it gets better from here. We're executing against our plans to bring variety, news and excitement to the Hershey's Milk Chocolates, Hershey's Kisses and Golden Monkey and Munching Monkey candy and snacks brands as we expect will drive solid growth and net sales growth in the second half of the year.
Over the long term, we expect global economies and category trends to improve and that the investments in our International business will continue about and contribute 1 point of our overall long-term sales algorithm.
Now to wrap up. We're a consumer-centric, brand-building company focused on innovation and growth in every category where we participate to satisfy the needs of our retail customers and consumers. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to analyze our cost structure as we look for additional margin-enhancing opportunities that give us the flexibility to offset higher input costs and invest in our brands. We take a long-term focus and believe that investing in our business will benefit the company this year and well into the future.
Now I'll turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with detail on our financial results."

Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.64 billion increased 3.7% versus last year, slightly greater than our estimate due to timing in the U.S. and better International performance.Adjust",1481,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.64 billion increased 3.7% versus last year, slightly greater than our estimate due to timing in the U.S. and better International performance.
Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $0.85, an increase of about 9% versus last year, greater than our estimate due to the timing of investment tax credits, more on this in a bit; sales that were slightly greater than forecast; and lower advertising expense versus our previous estimate.
Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 80 basis points, net sales increased 4.5%. Net price realization was relatively in line with our estimates and a 90 basis point benefit. Lower International and Other segment direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances, as we lap year ago challenges in China, more than offset higher North America direct trade, supporting in-store merchandising and display and related promotional price points.
Volume was a 3.1-point contribution to net sales growth, driven by North American performance. Acquisitions were worth 50 basis points due primarily to barkTHINS.
By segment, second quarter North America net sales increased 3.2%. Excluding the 30 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 3.5% versus the year ago period. Volume was a 4.5-point contribution to sales growth and slightly benefited from the timing of select merchandising program net sales that occurred in the second quarter that were expected to ship in the third quarter. Increased levels of direct trade, supporting greater levels of in-store merchandising and display, resulted in net price realization headwinds of 1.6 points. Acquisitions were a 60 basis point benefit.
Total International and Other segment net sales for the second quarter increased 7.6% versus last year and were better than our estimate. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 5.5 points. International and Other segment volume was off 7.2 points due primarily to lower sales in China and the discontinuance of the edible oil business in India. Net price realization was a 20.3-point benefit as direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances in China were meaningfully lower as we lap the year ago challenges.
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin declined by 120 basis points in the second quarter as productivity and cost savings were offset by higher commodity costs, including a favorable purchase price variance versus standard in the year ago period; unfavorable sales mix; and higher supply chain costs related to the start-up of the Malaysia manufacturing facility. For the full year, we continue to expect that gross margin will be slightly down versus a year ago. 
We remain focused on our cost structure. The productivity initiatives we have discussed over the last year are on track and delivering the targeted savings. Our efforts here are yielding further opportunities, as evidenced by our full year savings of about $135 million, which is now more than our previous estimate.
Adjusted operating profit in the second quarter increased 2.1%, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 18.1% versus 18.3%. The decline in adjusted operating profit margin was driven by lower gross margins.
Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 5%, less than our previous estimate, as we continue to analyze the components of our marketing mix modeling to determine the right level of direct trade, TV advertising, digital marketing and consumer promotion.
North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense was up meaningfully in the second quarter and is at healthy levels in the second half of the year to drive net sales and retail takeaway growth.
SM&A, excluding advertising and the barkTHINS acquisition, declined 2.6%, while unallocated corporate expense was lower by $200,000 versus last year. Savings from the business productivity programs and the focus on efficiency and cost savings initiatives that we outlined last quarter drove the declines, although this was partially offset by the timing of employee-related costs and unexpected corporate fees that were about a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter.
Now let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I'm pleased that our total International business delivered on their Q2 plans. Adding to J.P.'s commentary on China, chocolate category performance in Q2 was in line with our forecast. We remain optimistic about the long-term outlook in China and for our brands. However, consumer spending still appears to be mixed. Therefore, our full year sales outlook in China is slightly lower than our previous estimate. Specifically, China gross sales are forecasted to decline in 2016. However, net sales are expected to increase 10% to 20% as we don't anticipate the same level of direct trade, returns, discounts and allowances as last year.
Constant-currency net sales growth of core brands in Mexico and Brazil increased nicely. Excluding China, International and Other segment operating profit increased about 5%.
Moving down the P&L. First quarter (sic) [second quarter] interest expense of $21 million increased $2.4 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 31.4%, relatively in line with our estimate and lower than the prior period -- year ago period of 35.3%, largely as a result of investment tax credits. 
However, due to timing differences, the corresponding book expense for a portion of the credit investments, which is recorded in the other income and expense line, will not be recognized until the second half of the year. We estimate this was about a $0.03 benefit in Q2. But this is just timing. And for the full year, we expect to purchase about $50 million of investment tax credits, which should result in an adjusted tax rate that's slightly lower than 2015. 
In the second half of the year, we expect the tax rate to be about 32% and other income and expense of about $35 million related to the corresponding book expense for the purchase of tax credits.
For the second quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 214.5 million shares, down 5.1 million versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.85 or an increase of about 9.1% versus a year ago.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the second quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's second quarter by $5 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $40 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $3 million, and accounts payable increased by $32 million.
Total capital additions, including software, were $62.7 million in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be in the $265 million to $275 million range, about $20 million less than our previous estimate.
During the second quarter, depreciation and amortization was $97 million, and dividends paid were $121 million. 
In the second quarter, the company repurchased $117 million of common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. In addition, the company repurchased $32 million of common shares in the second quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.
Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $250 million, slightly lower than the year ago.
As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of innovation, variety, news and in-store merchandising and programming in the marketplace. And we continue to refine our marketing mix modeling to ensure we have the optimal level of direct trade, advertising and consumer promotion supporting our brands. Advertising and related consumer marketing expense is lower versus our previous estimate. We feel good about our marketing mix modeling investments in 2016 and believe we have the right balance of spend in second half of the year that will result in a sequential improvement in marketplace performance.
The company estimates that full year 2016 net sales will increase around 1%, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of about 50 basis points and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 1 point. 
Constant-currency net sales growth of around 2% is less than the previous estimate of about 2.5%, primarily due to our expectation of lower U.S. CMG category growth over the remainder of the year and macroeconomic challenges in China impacting purchasing behavior.
The business productivity initiative announced last year in June and the incremental cost savings we discussed in April and today are on track. As a result, we continue to expect that adjusted earnings per share diluted will increase 3% to 4%, including dilution from acquisitions of $0.05 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.24 to $4.28 range.
Thank you for your time this morning, and I'll now turn it over to Mark."

That's really a -- more of a onetime or every couple year impact. We've seen some more activity in some of the indulgent categories in the second quarter. And frankly, there was a little bit greater interaction with some of those categories than we had anticipated. And we do believe we have some opportunities to further optimize our marketing mix modeling, as J.P. discussed.

I think we pulled back at a time that some others in the marketplace actually accelerated. So as we look to next year, we are certainly adjusting our approach. We think that variety and news are absolutely key, and that's really where our focus will be, to dial up efforts, in combination with the strong innovation that we feel really good about on chocolate, around things like core news, like Big Kat, Reese's Pieces Cup, and then big sustainable scale innovation on chocolate, like the big one that we have coming towards the end of the year.

So I -- let me talk about the pricing piece a little bit, and then we can touch again on sort of the snack wheel stuff. But I think what we have seen is that if you recall on the last call we talked about the number of new entrants that's happened, especially in snack bars relative to the whole snacking space. And some of those entrants, I think, have gotten trial not only because they're new, but I think there's also been a different pricing delta that the obstacle to trial has been lowered. And so I think the level of activity probably speaks more to what the net value to the consumer could have been across all of the different options and opportunities available to them. So I think going forward, while we are looking a lot at our whole revenue management approach and making sure that we really got that right, we're thinking a lot about this particular question. And I do think there's some influence there as there's been trial in the category. And I would just come back to my other comment around innovation, is it's is very clear that those brands and companies who have done well in innovation have gotten a disproportionate share of the consumers' attention. And those -- that's the real quality driver, in my mind. So if you come back to what I said earlier, we're really, really focused against 3 things in our business model. And it's the innovation. We're really looking at our marketing mix model, because, based on the previous question, you're right, allocation and resources across different pieces of the business, I think there are some things we learned there. And then of course, we want to run a frugal business and invest in our brands and our people. And those are the 3 things, I think, you should take away from what we're really talking about today."

So our most successful innovations are clearly grounded in deep consumer insights, and we've certainly gone -- leveraged a lot of insights and research as we've developed this proposition and feel quite good about it. As J.P. said, it really does play between those themes in SNACK-FECTION of marrying cookie and chocolate obviously. And it also really plays on some deep insights around the palate. If you think about the kind of the creamy crunchy palate, sweet and salty we see in the marketplace has demonstrated a lot of growth. And we're seeing with younger consumers in particular, there is strong interest in complex eats that this really delivers upon that will provide incremental usage versus our portfolio, which tends to be more of a -- kind of a straight, creamy palate. So if you think about the textural experiences consumers are looking for and the new users that we're able to bring in, we're feeling really good about it."

If you look at how we classify innovation, actually, our numbers versus our innovation targets are actually pretty good this year.

Welcome to The Hershey Company Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session.
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty.  Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section.  Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally.  These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss third quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $72.4 million or $0.23 per share diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

It's been an honor and a privilege to be the 11th CEO of The Hershey Company. I'm proud of all that we've accomplished as a team over the last 5 to 6 years and plan to be fully engaged on a day-to-day basis as CEO over the next 8 months or so as we drive the business forward and regain momentum.  I will also continue to work closely with my management team as we review our global go-to-market approach that we discussed in July. We're making progress and expect to discuss these value creation strategies [ph] with you in early 2017. 
Importantly, we believe that The Hershey Company will continue to be successful in the marketplace. We have a solid framework in place related to customer capabilities and consumer insights, especially in the North American segment that should enable us to execute against the demand landscape work that we've been updating. This is in conjunction with the progress that we've made in our R&D pipeline and faster innovation cycle in our core CMG business and snackfection initiatives. 
As part of our overall commitment to research and development, we're very pleased to announce our participation in the new University of Pennsylvania's Pennovation Center, whose grand opening is today. The Pennovation Center is a bridge that brings together corporations with the need, curious educators and student scientists in the university's new hub for innovation that will focus on research, development and entrepreneurialism. 
Let me add some perspective to our international operations. We've experienced macroeconomic challenges and slowdown in some of our key development markets. With this said, under the right conditions, we know our brands can be successful, as evidenced by the market share gain that we've attained, where we focused on our core brand-building efforts. However, given an uncertain outlook in these markets over the near term, we will continue to assess our investment mix across the enterprise to align with both our long-term strategic intent and best growth and margin-enhancing activities. We believe that it's appropriate to continuously assess market opportunities and evolve the best approach to meet our growth and profit focus. We simply see this as part of our ongoing operating philosophy. We plan to share further details with you at our investor event early in the year. 
For now, I can tell you that we're striving for an organization that's more agile, flexible and focused on the consumer, brand-building and cost efficiency across our entire business. This will drive improved gross margin and EBIT margin. Our commitment to growth and cost control will enable us to continue to deliver strong cash flow growth and generate value for all shareholders. 
As it relates to 2017, it's a bit early to discuss specifics, but we think there is a set-up to deliver top quartile performance versus the peer group. A longer Easter season and planned innovation driven by Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch and barkTHINS' acceleration should benefit top line growth. 
We have visibility into our cost structure and $100 million in productivity savings that we discussed earlier in the year that should lead to EBIT margin expansion in 2017. 
Third quarter sales, marketplace performance and operating income were relatively in line with expectations. Earnings per share exceeded our forecasts, driven by a lower tax rate, and Patricia will have more on this in a bit. 
As we anticipated, U.S. marketplace performance sequentially improved versus last quarter and was within our targeted range. Total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ended October 8, 2016, within the xAOC+C channels increased 0.6%, with market share the same as the year-ago period. This represents all Hershey manufactured products sold at retail, such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave, chocolate syrup and snack bars. 
Importantly, trends in our chocolate business improved due to a shorter Easter and the timing of innovation, chocolate retail takeaway was off about 0.5% in the first half of the year and was up 0.6% in the third quarter, resulting in a market share gain of 0.5 points.  We expect that the fourth quarter total Hershey and CMG performance will continue to sequentially improve. 
Our brands responded positively to the investments we discussed last quarter. Specifically, marketplace results in the quarter were driven by our performance in August as in-store merchandising and display activity and on-air advertising GRPs were solid, supporting U.S. Olympics programming and the launch of Reese's Pieces Cups. Our marketing mix for these programs was balanced between direct trade in both TV and digital advertising. You'll see more of this next year as we look to optimize our marketing mix model. 
Innovation and targeted 360-degree programs, where we got our marketing mix right, has worked for us so far in 2016. Variety [ph] and news on the Reese's franchise, driven by our NCAA relationship, which has been extended to the fall football season, and the launch of Reese's Pieces Cup, has resulted in the Reese's brands retail takeaway close [ph] to 8% in the third quarter. End results were similar for the Kit Kat franchise, given the success of the Big Kat new product launch. And Hershey's Kisses, up 7.2% in the recent 12-week period, is also quietly having a good year, driven by birthday-themed packaging and programming. 
We're getting incremental quality merchandising in other parts of the store, where wrapping paper and birthday cards can be found [ph] leveraging the emotional connectivity the brand has with consumers. And our Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites continue to do well and give us confidence that our close-in snack strategy will gain traction over time.  The same successful principles will be applied to Hershey's chocolate, where current brand performance isn't where we really want it to be. We believe the launch and related support of Hershey’s Cookie Layer Crunch will reenergize and make the brand fresh. 
Consumer demand for multi-textural eating experiences across varying snacking occasions is increasing and this product fills [ph] whitespace opportunity and should partially source volume from the cookie category.  We're leveraging our iconic Hershey chocolate bar and pairing it with layers of cookie -- crunchy cookie bits and decadent fillings to offer an indulgent textured snacking experience. Easy for me to say. This is one of the most anticipated innovations from the iconic Hershey's brand in many years. Based on prelaunch testing, Hershey’s Cookie Layer Crunch earned some of the highest consumer scores of any product ever launched by the company and will come in 3 flavors: caramel, vanilla cream and mint. Each piece is perfectly portion controlled at 90 to 100 calories and will be available at select retailers starting in December. 
So we're making progress, but there's still a lot of work to do as we enter the fourth quarter and look to 2017, where our our priority is to restore Hershey's marketplace momentum with the very profitable U.S. market. We believe these initiatives and ones that we've yet to disclose will result in improved and consistent marketplace performance over this strategic planning cycle. As such, we believe the candy, mint and gum is an attractive category capable of solid growth over the long term when supported with the right mix of customer and consumer marketing. 
Net sales in India declined versus the year-ago period due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business. The media-invested brands, JOLLY RANCHER, SOFIT and HERSHEY'S Syrup and Spreads, where we're focusing our efforts and investments, increased about 20%. 
In China, the modern trade hypermarket environment continues to be challenging across many categories. Our gross sales in China declined in line with our estimate, with net sales up about 15% on a constant currency basis. 
Chocolate category performance in the third quarter was sluggish and down about 4%. Our marketplace performance was in line with our expectation, with market share off about 1 point. We're executing against our plan and over the remainder of the year, have a balanced consumer proposition of variety, news and marketing across the Hershey's milk chocolate, Hershey's Kisses and Golden Monkey candy and snack brands. 
Our China e-commerce business has been relatively consistent and continues to post solid results, albeit off a smaller base. We estimate that our e-commerce business has about a 10 [ph] share of the market in China and look to build on that over the remainder of the year, driven by Singles Day in November. 
Now to wrap up. Despite the macroeconomic challenges facing the consumer, the broader snacks category, including indulgent snacks, continues to grow across retail channels. We're committed to our marketing mix modeling, trade, TV advertising and digital media as well as investments related to innovation, consumer marketing and insights that we believe will enable Hershey to deliver consistent and predictable top and bottom line growth. 
As I stated earlier, we feel good about our preliminary 2017 plans that are still taking shape. We're a growth and EBIT margin-focused company with a goal of increasing margins on an annual basis via both cost control and importantly, top line growth. 
Hershey has many opportunities to leverage its global brands in U.S. scale. We're optimistic about our future and focused on what we need to do to succeed. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, and our executive management team and the Board of Directors are confident that we'll continue to build value for all Hershey's shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results."

Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $2 billion increased 2.2%, in line with our forecast. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.29, an increased of about 10% versus last year,",1300,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $2 billion increased 2.2%, in line with our forecast. 
Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.29, an increased of about 10% versus last year, greater than our estimate due to shift of advertising and related consumer marketing expense to the fourth quarter and the 280 basis point decline in the adjusted tax rate that was greater than anticipated. More on both of these in a bit. 
Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 20 basis points, net sales increased 2.4%. As expected, net price realization was relatively in line with our estimates and a 70 basis point benefit, primarily due to lower International and  Other segment direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances as we lap the year-ago challenges in China.  Volume was a 1 point contribution to net sales growth, driven by our performance in the U.S. Acquisitions were a 70 basis point benefit due to barkTHINS, which we acquired in the second quarter. 
By segment, third quarter North America net sales increased 1.8%. Volume was a 1.1 point benefit and driven by the U.S. business, where volume was up 1.7 points. Canada net sales and volume were off, as planned, as solid new product performance was more than offset by select SKU rationalization. Acquisitions were an 80 point -- 80 basis point benefit. And net price realization, a 10 basis point headwind. 
Total International and Other segment net sales for the third quarter increased 5.3% versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 2.2 points. International and Other segment volume was up 10 basis points, as solid Latin America and select export market performance was partially offset by lower sales in China, the discontinuance of the edible oil business in India and a little softness in the global retail and licensing business.  Net price realization was a 7.4 point benefit as direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances in China were lower. 
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin declined by 40 basis points in the third quarter as productivity and cost savings were offset by unfavorable sales mix from excess packaging and higher supply chain costs, driven by initial year absorption of overhead related to the Malaysia manufacturing facility.  For the full year, we continue to expect that gross margin will be slightly down versus a year ago. 
As J.P. mentioned, we remain focused on our cost structure. The productivity initiatives we've discussed this year are on track, and we plan to deliver approximately $135 million in cost savings this year and at least $100 million per year from 2017 through 2019. 
Adjusted operating profit in the third quarter increased 7.6%, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 22.3% versus 21.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating profit was driven by an increase in gross profit and lower marketing expense. 
As expected, total advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined about 9.6% in the third quarter. This is partially due to  timing. Recall, advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 5% in the second quarter, and we expect that it will increase in the fourth quarter as well. 
North America and International and Other segment, SM&A, excluding advertising in the barkTHINS acquisition, declined 5.5%, driven by savings from the previously discussed business productivity programs. 
Unallocated corporate expense increased 3.5% or $4 million as efficiency and cost savings initiatives were offset by higher employee-related costs, an increase in corporate depreciation and amortization and JV minority interest expense. 
Now let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I'm pleased that our total international business delivered on their Q3 plans. As J.P. stated, we're executing against our plans in the key markets of China, Mexico, Brazil and India. Adding to his commentary on China, chocolate category performance in brick-and-mortar continues to be choppy. Consumer spending still appears to be mixed within the modern trade box. China gross sales are forecasted to decline in 2016. However, net sales are expected to increase as we don't anticipate the same level of direct trade, returns, discounts and allowances as last year.  Constant currency net sales  Mexico and Brazil increased nicely. International and Other segment operating profit increased meaningfully, and I'm pleased with the progression. As J.P. said, we are committed to profitability in this segment. 
Moving down the P&L. Interest expense of $24.4 million increased $5.7 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 30.7%, lower than our estimate as R&D tax credits were greater than anticipated. 
As expected, the other income and expense line item includes the book expense related to corresponding tax credits that we mentioned last quarter. For the full year, we expect the tax rate to be about 100 basis points lower than last year. 
For the third quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 215.2 million shares, down 4.9 million versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.29 or an increase of about 10.3% versus a year ago. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's third quarter by $20 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $1 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $30 million, and accounts payable increased by $9 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $64.1 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be at the low end of our $265 million to $275 million range. 
During the third quarter, adjusted depreciation and amortization was $61.5 million, and dividends paid were $128.6 million. In the third quarter, the company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization.  In addition, the company did not repurchase any common shares in the third quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.  Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $333 million, slightly lower than a year ago. 
As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year and into 2017, we have a lot of innovation, variety and seasonal merchandising and programming in the marketplace. We have good visibility in the Holiday orders and demand related to the upcoming launch of Hershey’s Cookie Layer Crunch. We feel good about our marketing mix modeling investments and believe that we have the right balance of spend over the remainder of the year as total trade and advertising is higher in the fourth quarter versus last year.  We believe these investments should result in a continued sequential improvement in U.S. retail takeaway. 
For the full year 2016, net sales will increase around 1%, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of about 50 basis points and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 75 basis points. 
We continue to expect that gross margin will be slightly below last year, due primarily to unfavorable sales mix. Business productivity and cost savings programs are on track with our targets. And as we discussed earlier, the tax rate is expected to be slightly favorable versus our previous expectations.  As a result, the company expects adjusted earnings per share diluted for 2016 to increase 4% to 5%, including barkTHINS' dilution  of $0.5 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.28 to $4.32 range versus the previous estimate of $4.24 to $4.28.

In terms of the advertising and related marketing expense, we -- as I said in my remarks, we've been running above in the second quarter.

I think you've laid out some of the part to our gross margin that we're very focused on. I agree with you that the snacks and some of of the international margins, gross margins are lower than they are.

You've mentioned commodities. Commodities will go up, and they'll will go on and down, and we keep our eye on them we always have some disability going forward in our commodity expenses so that we can price accordingly and respond accordingly. But I don't subscribe to the fact that there aren't any improvements we can make in our gross margin. And I want to call out one of the things that our U.S. plants are doing here in terms of the methodology we call lean, which is really bringing even more cost out of the production process. And that's something that we're in the process right now of -- we have in several of our plans and we're rolling out 2 more plans.

And then, of course, cost control, where we are heavily focused in us that we are focused on some additional platform worked going forward there. So I would say that innovation is absolute key. Scale platform innovation has proven to be one of the greatest drivers for our category. I'm encouraged about some of the innovation that we have this past year and I think that we've seen the results that in the market place to collect that didn't want to the second half but good Reese’s Pieces, cup has been incredibly well and Snack Mix was also a great innovation. But drove criminality, of course, it wasn't shared to the conception categories actually hoped in salty snacks. So it is a key lever and having assembled big platform innovation give sustaining innovation over multiyear part of tremendous one of the biggest focus is for us is making sure that we have sticky innovations, so it doesn't just launch and come out. But I agree with you that as we look to next year, both in terms of our business, as well as the category, we think that the level of innovation is really going to help drive CMG category growth and bring consumers to our category.

First of all, Crunchers this strategy we've spoken to a bit about around snackfection, which is thinking broadly about where our core confectionery trademarks, which are so powerful can play to bring in new users and the Celeste cost more it snacking occasions with consumers. So if you look at Crunchers, you could see the product has great trademarks and great chocolate but very different eating experience, which is much more of a much double, crunchy product, which will put those propositions in a whole different consumer use education. So it really fits in that strategy of expanding snacking occasions across the broader marketplace and you'll see that in the marketplace some time with first half of the year but we are really excited about that. Relative to your broader question on some of the other factors at play in the category, one that I would bring up is just the timing of Easter is always a key factor for the category and certainly, some of years that's a benefit and some years, it's not. This year is one of the shortest Easter is, next year we have that going into our favor, so we're excited about that. And relative to display, there has been some pressure on the category as some of the biggest retailers have been too clean floor policies and given how much floor space concessions has received, I think this category is to get a bit of a bigger hit than some other categories potentially. We believe that we're now behind us with [ph] a good piece of that, and we believe that having great innovation is one of the best ways to gain display and space.

What they think that are very optimistic about this if you just the body total snack wheel, snacking continues to progress. I think it's largely driven by occasions. So we have to compete and do well against those new occasions that exist in the market. But I think, innovation will be an important driver. It's good for the category if you think about it within the total snack wheel that we have great competitors. And so frankly, if there's good innovation, I think, it just reminds consumers the relevance of CMG in total and so I think that's good for all of us. And then we, of course, have to win as well. So what I think you'll hear from us is we get more specific about 2017 is. We're optimistic about some improvement in the category. Growth rate is relatively no snack wheel. We think occasions certainly benefit us as well and then we have to win market share.

It's one of the reasons why Kisses is doing so well because we've now found a way to get that Kisses some of our chocolate product into a new location but we really help create and shape that occasion for consumers and the need for our product during that education.

So as we look at all of the different channels and how consumers are put traffic into stores and then how they're spending per trip, it's all things that we follow pretty closely. And so you're starting to see such -- so imagine that some retailers probably have relatively stable traffic on a going basis than others, depending what your income cohorts are. Might see a bit of a different traffic pattern. So what's happening is, first, you begin to see people come back into the stores and then you begin to see the basket broaden a little bit. So I just want to be cautious that it's not as if everybody is out high-fiving. But as we talked to some of our retailers and as we follow those metrics, there's evidence that the consumer on a more broad base is having a greater frequency in the store. And then we follow what I would simply called the breadth of the basket or the trend or the value of the basket. And we're seeing some improvement there as there as well. It's different by channel and you would see some retailers having different experiences. At some retail segment still talk a little bit about to volatility that they're seeing but again, the good news is that fairly broadly we're seeing an uptick in trips. And then as the economy I think, continues to firm a bit, there will be some confidence around the spend of those consumers and that's part of what the makes us optimistic about 2017 is if you think about the 3 elements of our business, seasons, the everyday business and then, of course, it if it's consumable, it's a consumable come it's very much and first the people obviously being in the store we've going to have our products on the floor when they're in the store with our advertising is working hard for us, you see that everyday business, which is a wonderful margin business for both us and the retailers do well. So it really comes back to these elements Michele talked about earlier for us, strong innovation, making sure that we've got the right marketing mix modeling and then business model that we've talked about will explain more in greater get together in the spring. It's really going to be the 3 buckets of focus for us as a company."

Welcome to The Hershey Company Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session.
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss third quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $72.4 million or $0.23 per share diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

Before we discuss the details of our third quarter results, I'd like to add some context to the press release we issued on October 14. 
It's been an honor and a privilege to be the 11th CEO of The Hershey Company. I'm proud of all that we've accomplished as a team over the last 5 to 6 years and plan to be fully engaged on a day-to-day basis as CEO over the next 8 months or so as we drive the business forward and regain momentum. I will also continue to work closely with my management team as we review our global go-to-market approach that we discussed in July. We're making progress and expect to discuss these value-creation strategies with you in early 2017. 
Importantly, we believe that The Hershey Company will continue to be successful in the marketplace. We have a solid framework in place related to customer capabilities and consumer insights, especially in the North American segment that should enable us to execute against the demand landscape work that we've been updating. This is in conjunction with the progress that we've made in our R&D pipeline and faster innovation cycle in our core CMG business and snackfection initiatives. 
As part of our overall commitment to research and development, we're very pleased to announce our participation in the new University of Pennsylvania's Pennovation Center, whose grand opening is today. The Pennovation Center is a bridge that brings together corporations with the need, curious educators and student scientists in the university's new hub for innovation that will focus on research, development and entrepreneurialism. 
Let me add some perspective to our international operations. We've experienced macroeconomic challenges and slowdown in some of our key development markets. With this said, under the right conditions, we know our brands can be successful, as evidenced by the market share gain that we've attained, where we focused on our core brand-building efforts. However, given an uncertain outlook in these markets over the near term, we will continue to assess our investment mix across the enterprise to align with both our long-term strategic intent and best growth and margin-enhancing activities. We believe that it's appropriate to continuously assess market opportunities and evolve the best approach to meet our growth and profit focus. We simply see this as part of our ongoing operating philosophy. We plan to share further details with you at our investor event early in the year. 
For now, I can tell you that we're striving for an organization that's more agile, flexible and focused on the consumer, brand-building and cost efficiency across our entire business. This will drive improved gross margin and EBIT margin. Our commitment to growth and cost control will enable us to continue to deliver strong cash flow growth and generate value for all shareholders. 
As it relates to 2017, it's a bit early to discuss specifics, but we think there is a set-up to deliver top quartile performance versus the peer group. A longer Easter season and planned innovation driven by Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch and barkTHINS' acceleration should benefit top line growth. 
We have visibility into our cost structure and $100 million in productivity savings that we discussed earlier in the year that should lead to EBIT margin expansion in 2017. 
Third quarter sales, marketplace performance and operating income were relatively in line with expectations. Earnings per share exceeded our forecasts, driven by a lower tax rate, and Patricia will have more on this in a bit. 
As we anticipated, U.S. marketplace performance sequentially improved versus last quarter and was within our targeted range. Total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ended October 8, 2016, within the xAOC+C channels increased 0.6%, with market share the same as the year-ago period. This represents all Hershey manufactured products sold at retail, such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave, chocolate syrup and snack bars. 
Importantly, trends in our chocolate business improved due to a shorter Easter and the timing of innovation, chocolate retail takeaway was off about 0.5% in the first half of the year and was up 0.6% in the third quarter, resulting in a market share gain of 0.5 points. We expect that the fourth quarter total Hershey and CMG performance will continue to sequentially improve. 
Our brands responded positively to the investments we discussed last quarter. Specifically, marketplace results in the quarter were driven by our performance in August as in-store merchandising and display activity and on-air advertising GRPs were solid, supporting U.S. Olympics programming and the launch of Reese's Pieces Cups. Our marketing mix for these programs was balanced between direct trade in both TV and digital advertising. You'll see more of this next year as we look to optimize our marketing mix model. 
Innovation and targeted 360-degree programs, where we got our marketing mix right, has worked for us so far in 2016. Variety and news on the Reese's franchise, driven by our NCAA relationship, which has been extended to the fall football season, and the launch of Reese's Pieces Cup, has resulted in the Reese's brands retail takeaway of close to 8% in the third quarter. End results were similar for the Kit Kat franchise, given the success of the Big Kat new product launch. And Hershey's Kisses, up 7.2% in the recent 12-week period, is also quietly having a good year, driven by birthday-themed packaging and programming. 
We're getting incremental quality merchandising in other parts of the store, where wrapping paper and birthday cards can be found leveraging the emotional connectivity the brand has with consumers. And our Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites continue to do well and give us confidence that our close-in snack strategy will gain traction over time. The same successful principles will be applied to Hershey's chocolate, where current brand performance isn't where we really want it to be. We believe the launch and related support of Hershey’s Cookie Layer Crunch will reenergize and make the brand fresh. 
Consumer demand for multi-textural eating experiences across varying snacking occasions is increasing and this product fills whitespace opportunity and should partially source volume from the cookie category. We're leveraging our iconic Hershey chocolate bar and pairing it with layers of cookie -- crunchy cookie bits and decadent fillings to offer an indulgent textured snacking experience. Easy for me to say. This is one of the most anticipated innovations from the iconic Hershey's brand in many years. Based on prelaunch testing, Hershey’s Cookie Layer Crunch earned some of the highest consumer scores of any product ever launched by the company and will come in 3 flavors: caramel, vanilla cream and mint. Each piece is perfectly portion controlled at 90 to 100 calories and will be available at select retailers starting in December. 
So we're making progress, but there's still a lot of work to do as we enter the fourth quarter and look to 2017, where our priority is to restore Hershey's marketplace momentum with the very profitable U.S. market. We believe these initiatives and ones that we've yet to disclose will result in improved and consistent marketplace performance over this strategic planning cycle. As such, we believe the candy, mint and gum is an attractive category capable of solid growth over the long term when supported with the right mix of customer and consumer marketing. 
Net sales in India declined versus the year-ago period due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business. The media-invested brands, JOLLY RANCHER, SOFIT and HERSHEY'S Syrup and Spreads, where we're focusing our efforts and investments, increased about 20%. 
In China, the modern trade hypermarket environment continues to be challenging across many categories. Our gross sales in China declined in line with our estimate, with net sales up about 15% on a constant currency basis. 
Chocolate category performance in the third quarter was sluggish and down about 4%. Our marketplace performance was in line with our expectation, with market share off about 1 point. We're executing against our plan and over the remainder of the year, have a balanced consumer proposition of variety, news and marketing across the Hershey's Milk Chocolate, Hershey's Kisses and Golden Monkey candy and snack brands. 
Our China e-commerce business has been relatively consistent and continues to post solid results, albeit off a smaller base. We estimate that our e-commerce business has about a 10 share of the market in China and look to build on that over the remainder of the year, driven by Singles Day in November. 
Now to wrap up. Despite the macroeconomic challenges facing the consumer, the broader snacks category, including indulgent snacks, continues to grow across retail channels. We're committed to our marketing mix modeling, trade, TV advertising and digital media as well as investments related to innovation, consumer marketing and insights that we believe will enable Hershey to deliver consistent and predictable top and bottom line growth. 
As I stated earlier, we feel good about our preliminary 2017 plans that are still taking shape. We're a growth and EBIT margin-focused company with a goal of increasing margins on an annual basis via both cost control and importantly, top line growth. 
Hershey has many opportunities to leverage its global brands in U.S. scale. We're optimistic about our future and focused on what we need to do to succeed. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, and our executive management team and the Board of Directors are confident that we'll continue to build value for all Hershey's shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results."

Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $2 billion increased 2.2%, in line with our forecast. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.29, an increased of about 10% versus last year,",1300,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $2 billion increased 2.2%, in line with our forecast. 
Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.29, an increased of about 10% versus last year, greater than our estimate due to shift of advertising and related consumer marketing expense to the fourth quarter and the 280 basis point decline in the adjusted tax rate that was greater than anticipated. More on both of these in a bit. 
Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 20 basis points, net sales increased 2.4%. As expected, net price realization was relatively in line with our estimates and a 70 basis point benefit, primarily due to lower International and Other segment direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances as we lap the year-ago challenges in China. Volume was a 1 point contribution to net sales growth, driven by our performance in the U.S. Acquisitions were a 70 basis point benefit due to barkTHINS, which we acquired in the second quarter. 
By segment, third quarter North America net sales increased 1.8%. Volume was a 1.1 point benefit and driven by the U.S. business, where volume was up 1.7 points. Canada net sales and volume were off, as planned, as solid new product performance was more than offset by select SKU rationalization. Acquisitions were an 80 point -- 80 basis point benefit. And net price realization, a 10 basis point headwind. 
Total International and Other segment net sales for the third quarter increased 5.3% versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 2.2 points. International and Other segment volume was up 10 basis points, as solid Latin America and select export market performance was partially offset by lower sales in China, the discontinuance of the edible oil business in India and a little softness in the global retail and licensing business. Net price realization was a 7.4 point benefit as direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances in China were lower. 
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin declined by 40 basis points in the third quarter as productivity and cost savings were offset by unfavorable sales mix from excess packaging and higher supply chain costs, driven by initial year absorption of overhead related to the Malaysia manufacturing facility. For the full year, we continue to expect that gross margin will be slightly down versus a year ago. 
As J.P. mentioned, we remain focused on our cost structure. The productivity initiatives we've discussed this year are on track, and we plan to deliver approximately $135 million in cost savings this year and at least $100 million per year from 2017 through 2019. 
Adjusted operating profit in the third quarter increased 7.6%, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 22.3% versus 21.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating profit was driven by an increase in gross profit and lower marketing expense. 
As expected, total advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined about 9.6% in the third quarter. This is partially due to timing. Recall, advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 5% in the second quarter, and we expect that it will increase in the fourth quarter as well. 
North America and International and Other segment, SM&A, excluding advertising in the barkTHINS acquisition, declined 5.5%, driven by savings from the previously discussed business productivity programs. 
Unallocated corporate expense increased 3.5% or $4 million as efficiency and cost savings initiatives were offset by higher employee-related costs, an increase in corporate depreciation and amortization and JV minority interest expense. 
Now let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I'm pleased that our total international business delivered on their Q3 plans. As J.P. stated, we're executing against our plans in the key markets of China, Mexico, Brazil and India. Adding to his commentary on China, chocolate category performance in brick-and-mortar continues to be choppy. Consumer spending still appears to be mixed within the modern trade box. China gross sales are forecasted to decline in 2016. However, net sales are expected to increase as we don't anticipate the same level of direct trade, returns, discounts and allowances as last year. Constant currency net sales Mexico and Brazil increased nicely. International and Other segment operating profit increased meaningfully, and I'm pleased with the progression. As J.P. said, we are committed to profitability in this segment. 
Moving down the P&L. Interest expense of $24.4 million increased $5.7 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 30.7%, lower than our estimate as R&D tax credits were greater than anticipated. 
As expected, the other income and expense line item includes the book expense related to corresponding tax credits that we mentioned last quarter. For the full year, we expect the tax rate to be about 100 basis points lower than last year. 
For the third quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 215.2 million shares, down 4.9 million versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.29 or an increase of about 10.3% versus a year ago. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's third quarter by $20 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $1 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $30 million, and accounts payable increased by $9 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $64.1 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be at the low end of our $265 million to $275 million range. 
During the third quarter, adjusted depreciation and amortization was $61.5 million, and dividends paid were $128.6 million. In the third quarter, the company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. In addition, the company did not repurchase any common shares in the third quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $333 million, slightly lower than a year ago. 
As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year and into 2017, we have a lot of innovation, variety and seasonal merchandising and programming in the marketplace. We have good visibility in the Holiday orders and demand related to the upcoming launch of Hershey’s Cookie Layer Crunch. We feel good about our marketing mix modeling investments and believe that we have the right balance of spend over the remainder of the year as total trade and advertising is higher in the fourth quarter versus last year. We believe these investments should result in a continued sequential improvement in U.S. retail takeaway. 
For the full year 2016, net sales will increase around 1%, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of about 50 basis points and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 75 basis points. 
We continue to expect that gross margin will be slightly below last year, due primarily to unfavorable sales mix. Business productivity and cost savings programs are on track with our targets. And as we discussed earlier, the tax rate is expected to be slightly favorable versus our previous expectations. As a result, the company expects adjusted earnings per share diluted for 2016 to increase 4% to 5%, including barkTHINS' dilution of $0.5 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.28 to $4.32 range versus the previous estimate of $4.24 to $4.28.

When -- we did have a little bit of an uptick compared to prior year in the third quarter. That really had more to do with some timing issues that we had last year's third quarter than any change in our fundamental run rate. And I expect to see this focus on cost in our SG&A, excluding marketing and related advertising expense, to continue. In terms of the advertising and related marketing expense, we -- as I said in my remarks, we've been running above in the second quarter. We dipped below a little bit in the third quarter, but we expect to have that back up again in the fourth quarter. And that, combined with added investments in trade promotion, we believe will continue to drive momentum in the marketplace. And I'll turn it over to Michele to talk a little bit more about that."

I think you've laid out some of the parts to our gross margin that we're very focused on. I agree with you that the snacks and some of the international margin -- gross margins are lower than they are. In our core U.S. chocolate business, there's not much that does better than core U.S. chocolate in terms of margin. And you see some of that mix impact in terms of what's in the base right now. You've mentioned commodities. Commodities will go up, and they'll go down, and we keep our eye on them. And we always look to have some visibility going forward in our commodity expenses so that we can price accordingly and respond accordingly. But I don't subscribe to the fact that there aren't improvements we can make in our gross margin. And I want to call out one of the things that our U.S. plants are doing here in terms of the methodology we call lean, which is really ringing even more costs out of the production process. And that's something that we're in the process right now of -- we have in several of our plants and were rolling out to more plants. Another thing that we can look at is really on our SKUs and making sure that we have the best, most optimal SKU mix in our portfolio. So while I agree with you there is a little bit of a headwind in terms of the portfolio evolution, I think that we wouldn't want to say that there's nothing that we can do about it. We need to remain enormously focused on gross margin."

On marketing mix, we've talked about this category as a very responsive category, so getting the right balance between advertising and trade and also within advertising, how we spend our dollars and then, of course, cost control, where we are -- have always been focused and, as you know, are focused on some additional platform work going forward there. So I would say that innovation is absolute key. Scale platform innovation has proven to be one of the greatest drivers for our category. I'm encouraged about some of the innovation that we had this past year, and I think that we've seen the results of that in the market place. And a lot that didn't launch until the second half, but Big Kat, Reese's Pieces Cup has done incredibly well. And Snack Mix was also a great innovation that drove incrementality. Of course, it wasn't shared to the confection category. It's actually health and salty snacks. So it is a key lever. And having that sustainable big platform innovation gives us sustaining innovation over a multiyear period of time, and that's one of the biggest focuses, for us, is making sure that we have sticky innovations so that it doesn't just launch and come out. But I agree with you that as we look to next year, both in terms of our business as well as the category, we think that the level of innovation is really going to help to drive CMG category growth and bring consumers to our category.

In Mexico, we've increased distribution opportunities using our Sigma distribution partner, so great result there. India has been taking care of some products that are lower profitability, and you can really see that helping our margin, and we need to continue to do that going forward.

And then stepping up beyond innovation, we crunched some of the numbers over here. It looks like another big source, and so the category weakness has been just a crowd-out in terms of merchandising, display -- and display space, quality merchandising space within retail. If you can elaborate a little bit more, what do you think is driving that? And what do you think can try to reverse the course of that one? I appreciate it."

We've spoken to you a bit about around snackfection, which is thinking broadly about where our core confectionery trademarks, which are so powe",334,"Sure. So I'll address both of those. So first of all, as we look at Crunchers, this fits right in the strategy. We've spoken to you a bit about around snackfection, which is thinking broadly about where our core confectionery trademarks, which are so powerful, can play to bring in new users and be utilized across even more snacking occasions with consumers. So if you look at Crunchers, you can see the product has our great trademarks and great chocolate, but very different eating experience, which is much more of a munchable crunchy product, which will put those propositions in a whole different consumer use education. So it really fits in that strategy of expanding snacking occasions across the broader marketplace, and you'll see that in the marketplace sometime mid first half of the year. But we are really excited about that. Relative to your broader question on some of the other factors at play in the category, one that I would bring up is just the timing of Easter is always a key factor for the category. And certainly, some years, that's a benefit. And some years, it's not. This year is one of the shortest Easters. Next year, we have that going in our favor, so we're excited about that. And relative to display, there has been some pressure on the category as some of the biggest retailers have gone to clean floor policies and. Given how much floor space confection has received, I think this category has taken a little bit of a bigger hit than some other categories potentially. We believe that we're now behind us with lapping a good piece of that, and we believe that having great innovation is one of the best ways to gain display and space. And we're feeling good about some of the initiatives that we've put in place for Holiday, where we're seeing share gains and also the share gains that we saw in Q3. And display has been a piece of that."

So I'm trying to get a sense of if you all of that is enough to accelerate the category growth rate in '17. And obviously, if what Hershey has planned, both what we know and don't yet know, is enough to either hold or gain share in that sort of a more active environment."

So we -- as we look at 2017, we believe that the category has indicators that it will continue to expand. I wouldn't describe that as a planning stance as such it's a hockey stick, but I think we can see that there's firming in the category. Consumers are in stores. And I just think overall, at the macro level, we think people are across all income cohorts beginning to spend a little bit more confidently than they have before. But what I think of that I'm very optimistic about is if you just look at the total snack wheel, snacking continues to progress. I think it's largely driven by occasions. So we have to compete and do well against those new occasions that exist in the market. But I think innovation will be an important driver. It's good for the category if you think about it within the total snack wheel that we have great competitors. And so, frankly, as there's good innovation, I think it just reminds consumers the relevance of CMG in total, and so I think that's good for all of us. And then we, of course, have to win as well. So what I think you'll hear from us as we get more specific about 2017 is we're optimistic about some improvement in the category growth rate that's relative to snack wheel. We think occasions certainly benefit us as well, and then we have to win market share. And that's why we're very focused against an overall business model that helps us win as a part of the top quartile of our peer group. And then we also want to win market share, obviously, within our specific categories. So I'm pretty optimistic about 2017, and those are some of the reasons why. Michele importantly talked about the competitiveness in-store. That was all true. But listen, we're all in the business of growth and meeting the wants and needs of consumers. So we're going to be really focused against executing. We're going to win every day from a market share standpoint, and then the category growth rate should take care of itself."

As we've talked about before, we are very aware of all of the different things that exist. We look at a lot of things. At the same time, we believe we have a great business model, and we don't want to do anything that doesn't really help us build there. I think that when you would see us do smaller things, it's because we believe they fit within a larger platform or have a brand positioning that we can really build around. I don't think we're going to be in the business of just getting a lot of disconnected small things that we can't figure out how to knit together. So we're very thoughtful about how we think the emerging consumer trends are and does that help us get into some of these different places. So M&A is an important thing for us.

So we feel good about each of those acquisitions if I look to Brookside, Krave as well as barkTHINS, though, that one obviously is early. And really, our strategy there is looking at how we can expand our portfolio to either bring in new users or new usage occasions, something that we, perhaps, aren't able to do with our current existing portfolio of brands. So we really think about buying a brand and a full proposition. As I look at Brookside, we've been really pleased with how we've delivered against that acquisition model over the years. We certainly have grown the business. It continues to be important strategically in terms of delivering and getting us more into the mass premium space. And right now, we're focused on consumers love the products. We have great repeat. And our next wave of growth there needs to be to continue to drive incremental trial and bring in additional users to that product that folks love. Krave, we're feeling good about. And if you look at all 3 of these acquisitions, as we create value, we certainly start by creating value by expanding distribution, and that's been the clear first piece of the model; by achieving cost synergy; and then, third, by unleashing and expanding the brand. And that's really the model. We think about each one. Krave, we have nearly doubled the sales on that. Likewise, nearly doubled distribution and are feeling good about where our velocities are in the marketplace and the innovation pipeline we have behind that. And we're seeing similar results that would certainly again [indiscernible] on barkTHINS.

We have high market share, and therefore, we can see across. And we have ubiquitous availability. So as we look at all of the different channels and how consumers are -- put traffic into stores and then how they're spending per trip, it's all things that we follow pretty closely. And so you're starting to see such. So imagine that some retailers probably have relatively stable traffic on a going basis than others depending who their income cohorts are. You might see a bit of a different traffic pattern. So what's happening is, first, you begin to see people come back into the stores, and then you begin to see the basket broaden a little bit. So I just want to be cautious that it's not as if everybody is out high-fiving. But as we talk to some of our retailers and as we follow those metrics, there's evidence that the consumer on a more broad base is having a greater frequency in the store. And then we follow what I would simply called the breadth of the basket or the trend -- or the value of the basket, and we're seeing some improvement there as well. It's different by channel, and you would see some retailers having different experiences. In some retail segments, still talk a little bit about volatility that they're seeing. But again, the good news is that fairly broadly, we're seeing an uptick in trips. And then as the economy, I think, continues to firm a bit, there'll be some confidence around the spend of those consumers. And that's part of what makes us optimistic about 2017 is if you think about the 3 elements of our business, seasons, the everyday business and then, of course, instant consumable, instant consumable is very much influenced by people obviously being in the store. We're going to have our products on the floor when they're in the store. When our advertising is working hard for us, you see that everyday business, which is a wonderful margin business for both us and the retailers, do well. So it really comes back to these elements Michele talked about earlier for us, strong innovation, making sure we've got the right marketing mix modeling and then the business model that we've talked about. And we'll explain more in -- when we get together in the spring. It's really going to be the 3 buckets of focus for us as a company."

Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss third quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $72.4 million or $0.23 per share diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

Before we discuss the details of our third quarter results, I'd like to add some context to the press release we issued on October 14. It's been an honor and a privilege to be the 11th",1604,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. Before we discuss the details of our third quarter results, I'd like to add some context to the press release we issued on October 14. 
It's been an honor and a privilege to be the 11th CEO of The Hershey Company. I'm proud of all that we've accomplished as a team over the last 5 to 6 years and plan to be fully engaged on a day-to-day basis as CEO over the next 8 months or so as we drive the business forward and regain momentum. I will also continue to work closely with my management team as we review our global go-to-market approach that we discussed in July. We're making progress and expect to discuss these value-creation strategies with you in early 2017. 
Importantly, we believe that The Hershey Company will continue to be successful in the marketplace. We have a solid framework in place related to customer capabilities and consumer insights, especially in the North American segment that should enable us to execute against the demand landscape work that we've been updating. This is in conjunction with the progress that we've made in our R&D pipeline and faster innovation cycle in our core CMG business and snackfection initiatives. 
As part of our overall commitment to research and development, we're very pleased to announce our participation in the new University of Pennsylvania's Pennovation Center, whose grand opening is today. The Pennovation Center is a bridge that brings together corporations with the need, curious educators and student scientists in the university's new hub for innovation that will focus on research, development and entrepreneurialism. 
Let me add some perspective to our international operations. We've experienced macroeconomic challenges and slowdown in some of our key development markets. With this said, under the right conditions, we know our brands can be successful, as evidenced by the market share gain that we've attained, where we focused on our core brand-building efforts. However, given an uncertain outlook in these markets over the near term, we will continue to assess our investment mix across the enterprise to align with both our long-term strategic intent and best growth and margin-enhancing activities. We believe that it's appropriate to continuously assess market opportunities and evolve the best approach to meet our growth and profit focus. We simply see this as part of our ongoing operating philosophy. We plan to share further details with you at our investor event early in the year. 
For now, I can tell you that we're striving for an organization that's more agile, flexible and focused on the consumer, brand-building and cost efficiency across our entire business. This will drive improved gross margin and EBIT margin. Our commitment to growth and cost control will enable us to continue to deliver strong cash flow growth and generate value for all shareholders. 
As it relates to 2017, it's a bit early to discuss specifics, but we think there is a set-up to deliver top quartile performance versus the peer group. A longer Easter season and planned innovation driven by Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch and barkTHINS' acceleration should benefit top line growth. 
We have visibility into our cost structure and $100 million in productivity savings that we discussed earlier in the year that should lead to EBIT margin expansion in 2017. 
Third quarter sales, marketplace performance and operating income were relatively in line with expectations. Earnings per share exceeded our forecasts, driven by a lower tax rate, and Patricia will have more on this in a bit. 
As we anticipated, U.S. marketplace performance sequentially improved versus last quarter and was within our targeted range. Total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ended October 8, 2016, within the xAOC+C channels increased 0.6%, with market share the same as the year-ago period. This represents all Hershey manufactured products sold at retail, such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave, chocolate syrup and snack bars. 
Importantly, trends in our chocolate business improved due to a shorter Easter and the timing of innovation, chocolate retail takeaway was off about 0.5% in the first half of the year and was up 0.6% in the third quarter, resulting in a market share gain of 0.5 points. We expect that the fourth quarter total Hershey and CMG performance will continue to sequentially improve. 
Our brands responded positively to the investments we discussed last quarter. Specifically, marketplace results in the quarter were driven by our performance in August as in-store merchandising and display activity and on-air advertising GRPs were solid, supporting U.S. Olympics programming and the launch of Reese's Pieces Cups. Our marketing mix for these programs was balanced between direct trade in both TV and digital advertising. You'll see more of this next year as we look to optimize our marketing mix model. 
Innovation in targeted 360-degree programs, where we got our marketing mix right, has worked for us so far in 2016. Variety and news on the Reese's franchise, driven by our NCAA relationship, which has been extended to the fall football season, and the launch of Reese's Pieces Cup, has resulted in the Reese's brands retail takeaway of close to 8% in the third quarter. End results were similar for the Kit Kat franchise, given the success of the Big Kat new product launch. And Hershey's Kisses, up 7.2% in the recent 12-week period, is also quietly having a good year, driven by birthday-themed packaging and programming. 
We're getting incremental quality merchandising in other parts of the store, where wrapping paper and birthday cards can be found leveraging the emotional connectivity the brand has with consumers. And our Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites continue to do well and give us confidence that our close-in snack strategy will gain traction over time. The same successful principles will be applied to Hershey's chocolate, where current brand performance isn't where we really want it to be. We believe the launch and related support of Hershey’s Cookie Layer Crunch will reenergize and make the brand fresh. 
Consumer demand for multi-textural eating experiences across varying snacking occasions is increasing and this product fills whitespace opportunity and should partially source volume from the cookie category. We're leveraging our iconic Hershey chocolate bar and pairing it with layers of cookie -- crunchy cookie bits and decadent fillings to offer an indulgent textured snacking experience. Easy for me to say. This is one of the most anticipated innovations from the iconic Hershey's brand in many years. Based on prelaunch testing, Hershey’s Cookie Layer Crunch earned some of the highest consumer scores of any product ever launched by the company and will come in 3 flavors: caramel, vanilla cream and mint. Each piece is perfectly portion controlled at 90 to 100 calories and will be available at select retailers starting in December. 
So we're making progress, but there's still a lot of work to do as we enter the fourth quarter and look to 2017, where our priority is to restore Hershey's marketplace momentum with the very profitable U.S. market. We believe these initiatives and ones that we've yet to disclose will result in improved and consistent marketplace performance over this strategic planning cycle. As such, we believe the candy, mint and gum is an attractive category capable of solid growth over the long term when supported with the right mix of customer and consumer marketing. 
Net sales in India declined versus the year-ago period due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business. The media-invested brands, JOLLY RANCHER, SOFIT and HERSHEY'S Syrup and Spreads, where we're focusing our efforts and investments, increased about 20%. 
In China, the modern trade hypermarket environment continues to be challenging across many categories. Our gross sales in China declined in line with our estimate, with net sales up about 15% on a constant currency basis. 
Chocolate category performance in the third quarter was sluggish and down about 4%. Our marketplace performance was in line with our expectation, with market share off about 1 point. We're executing against our plan and over the remainder of the year, have a balanced consumer proposition of variety, news and marketing across the Hershey's Milk Chocolate, Hershey's Kisses and Golden Monkey candy and snack brands. 
Our China e-commerce business has been relatively consistent and continues to post solid results, albeit off a smaller base. We estimate that our e-commerce business has about a 10 share of the market in China and look to build on that over the remainder of the year, driven by Singles Day in November. 
Now to wrap up. Despite the macroeconomic challenges facing the consumer, the broader snacks category, including indulgent snacks, continues to grow across retail channels. We're committed to our marketing mix modeling, trade, TV advertising and digital media as well as investments related to innovation, consumer marketing and insights that we believe will enable Hershey to deliver consistent and predictable top and bottom line growth. 
As I stated earlier, we feel good about our preliminary 2017 plans that are still taking shape. We're a growth and EBIT margin-focused company with a goal of increasing margins on an annual basis via both cost control and importantly, top line growth. 
Hershey has many opportunities to leverage its global brands in U.S. scale. We're optimistic about our future and focused on what we need to do to succeed. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, and our executive management team and the Board of Directors are confident that we'll continue to build value for all Hershey's shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results."
98873,404004727,1065704,"The Hershey Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $2 billion increased 2.2%, in line with our forecast. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.29, an increased of about 10% versus last year,",1301,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $2 billion increased 2.2%, in line with our forecast. 
Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.29, an increased of about 10% versus last year, greater than our estimate due to shift of advertising and related consumer marketing expense to the fourth quarter and the 280 basis point decline in the adjusted tax rate that was greater than anticipated. More on both of these in a bit. 
Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 20 basis points, net sales increased 2.4%. As expected, net price realization was relatively in line with our estimates and a 70 basis point benefit, primarily due to lower International and Other segment direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances as we lap the year-ago challenges in China. Volume was a 1 point contribution to net sales growth, driven by our performance in the U.S. Acquisitions were a 70 basis point benefit due to barkTHINS, which we acquired in the second quarter. 
By segment, third quarter North America net sales increased 1.8%. Volume was a 1.1 point benefit and driven by the U.S. business, where volume was up 1.7 points. Canada net sales and volume were off, as planned, as solid new product performance was more than offset by select SKU rationalization. Acquisitions were an 80 point -- 80 basis point benefit. And net price realization, a 10 basis point headwind. 
Total International and Other segment net sales for the third quarter increased 5.3% versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 2.2 points. International and Other segment volume was up 10 basis points, as solid Latin America and select export market performance was partially offset by lower sales in China, the discontinuance of the edible oil business in India and a little softness in the global retail and licensing business. Net price realization was a 7.4 point benefit as direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances in China were lower. 
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin declined by 40 basis points in the third quarter as productivity and cost savings were offset by unfavorable sales mix from excess packaging and higher supply chain costs, driven by initial year absorption of overhead related to the Malaysia manufacturing facility. For the full year, we continue to expect that gross margin will be slightly down versus a year ago. 
As J.P. mentioned, we remain focused on our cost structure. The productivity initiatives we've discussed this year are on track, and we plan to deliver approximately $135 million in cost savings this year and at least $100 million per year from 2017 through 2019. 
Adjusted operating profit in the third quarter increased 7.6%, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 22.3% versus 21.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating profit was driven by an increase in gross profit and lower marketing expense. 
As expected, total advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined about 9.6% in the third quarter. This is partially due to timing. Recall, advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 5% in the second quarter, and we expect that it will increase in the fourth quarter as well. 
North America and International and Other segment, SM&A, excluding advertising in the barkTHINS acquisition, declined 5.5%, driven by savings from the previously discussed business productivity programs. 
Unallocated corporate expense increased 3.5% or $4 million as efficiency and cost savings initiatives were offset by higher employee-related costs, an increase in corporate depreciation and amortization and JV minority interest expense. 
Now let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I'm pleased that our total international business delivered on their Q3 plans. As J.P. stated, we're executing against our plans in the key markets of China, Mexico, Brazil and India. Adding to his commentary on China, chocolate category performance in brick-and-mortar continues to be choppy. Consumer spending still appears to be mixed within the modern trade box. China gross sales are forecasted to decline in 2016. However, net sales are expected to increase as we don't anticipate the same level of direct trade, returns, discounts and allowances as last year. Constant currency net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased nicely. International and Other segment operating profit increased meaningfully, and I'm pleased with the progression. As J.P. said, we are committed to profitability in this segment. 
Moving down the P&L. Interest expense of $24.4 million increased $5.7 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 30.7%, lower than our estimate as R&D tax credits were greater than anticipated. 
As expected, the other income and expense line item includes the book expense related to corresponding tax credits that we mentioned last quarter. For the full year, we expect the tax rate to be about 100 basis points lower than last year. 
For the third quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 215.2 million shares, down 4.9 million versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.29 or an increase of about 10.3% versus a year ago. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's third quarter by $20 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $1 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $30 million, and accounts payable increased by $9 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $64.1 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be at the low end of our $265 million to $275 million range. 
During the third quarter, adjusted depreciation and amortization was $61.5 million, and dividends paid were $128.6 million. In the third quarter, the company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. In addition, the company did not repurchase any common shares in the third quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $333 million, slightly lower than a year ago. 
As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year and into 2017, we have a lot of innovation, variety and seasonal merchandising and programming in the marketplace. We have good visibility in the Holiday orders and demand related to the upcoming launch of Hershey’s Cookie Layer Crunch. We feel good about our marketing mix modeling investments and believe that we have the right balance of spend over the remainder of the year as total trade and advertising is higher in the fourth quarter versus last year. We believe these investments should result in a continued sequential improvement in U.S. retail takeaway. 
For the full year 2016, net sales will increase around 1%, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of about 50 basis points and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 75 basis points. 
We continue to expect that gross margin will be slightly below last year, due primarily to unfavorable sales mix. Business productivity and cost savings programs are on track with our targets. And as we discussed earlier, the tax rate is expected to be slightly favorable versus our previous expectations. As a result, the company expects adjusted earnings per share diluted for 2016 to increase 4% to 5%, including barkTHINS' dilution of $0.5 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.28 to $4.32 range versus the previous estimate of $4.24 to $4.28.

When -- we did have a little bit of an uptick compared to prior year in the third quarter.

And I expect to see this focus on cost in our SG&A, excluding marketing and related advertising expense, to continue. In terms of the advertising and related marketing expense, we -- as I said in my remarks, we've been running above in the second quarter. We dipped below a little bit in the third quarter, but we expect to have that back up again in the fourth quarter.

We'll be shipping Hershey’s Cookie Layer Crunch, and that will be a bigger benefit to net sales than it will be takeaway. You'll see more of the takeaway towards the end of the quarter and into 2017, and you can think about that as being roughly 1 to 2 points growth for us in Q4. And then lastly, the balance of our growth will really come from overall takeaway across our international and U.S. business.

You've mentioned commodities. Commodities will go up, and they'll go down, and we keep our eye on them. And we always look to have some visibility going forward in our commodity expenses so that we can price accordingly and respond accordingly. But I don't subscribe to the fact that there aren't improvements we can make in our gross margin. And I want to call out one of the things that our U.S. plants are doing here in terms of the methodology we call lean, which is really wringing even more costs out of the production process. And that's something that we're in the process right now of -- we have in several of our plants and were rolling out to more plants. Another thing that we can look at is really on our SKUs and making sure that we have the best, most optimal SKU mix in our portfolio. So while I agree with you there is a little bit of a headwind in terms of the portfolio evolution, I think that we wouldn't want to say that there's nothing that we can do about it. We need to remain enormously focused on gross margin."

So as we'd mentioned, this is an area where we do a lot of testing. We did the BASES test that looked at concept, product delivery as well as our marketing investments behind the proposition.

On marketing mix, we've talked about this category as a very responsive category, so getting the right balance between advertising and trade and also within advertising, how we spend our dollars and then, of course, cost control, where we are -- have always been focused and, as you know, are focused on some additional platform work going forward there. So I would say that innovation is absolutely key. Scale platform innovation has proven to be one of the greatest drivers for our category. I'm encouraged about some of the innovation that we had this past year, and I think that we've seen the results of that in the market place. And a lot that didn't launch until the second half, but Big Kat, Reese's Pieces Cup has done incredibly well. And Snack Mix was also a great innovation that drove incrementality. Of course, it wasn't shared to the confection category. It's actually health and salty snacks. So it is a key lever. And having that sustainable big platform innovation gives us sustaining innovation over a multiyear period of time, and that's one of the biggest focuses, for us, is making sure that we have sticky innovations so that it doesn't just launch and come out. But I agree with you that as we look to next year, both in terms of our business as well as the category, we think that the level of innovation is really going to help to drive CMG category growth and bring consumers to our category. So we're really excited about that."

India has been taking care of some products that are lower profitability, and you can really see that helping our margin, and we need to continue to do that going forward. I think China will continue to be a work in progress as we assess our opportunities against the marketplace that we have there, whether that's in chocolate, which has been a little bit weak, or in the more traditional candies that we have with our Golden and Munching Monkey brands.

So first of all, as we look at Crunchers, this fits right in the strategy. We've spoken to you a bit about around snackfection, which is thinking broadly about where our core confectionery trademarks, which are so powerful, can play to bring in new users and be utilized across even more snacking occasions with consumers. So if you look at Crunchers, you can see the product has our great trademarks and great chocolate, but very different eating experience, which is much more of a munchable crunchy product, which will put those propositions in a whole different consumer use education. So it really fits in that strategy of expanding snacking occasions across the broader marketplace, and you'll see that in the marketplace sometime mid first half of the year. But we are really excited about that. Relative to your broader question on some of the other factors at play in the category, one that I would bring up is just the timing of Easter is always a key factor for the category. And certainly, some years, that's a benefit. And some years, it's not. This year is one of the shortest Easters. Next year, we have that going in our favor, so we're excited about that. And relative to display, there has been some pressure on the category as some of the biggest retailers have gone to clean floor policies and. Given how much floor space confection has received, I think this category has taken a little bit of a bigger hit than some other categories potentially. We believe that we're now behind us with lapping a good piece of that, and we believe that having great innovation is one of the best ways to gain display and space. And we're feeling good about some of the initiatives that we've put in place for Holiday, where we're seeing share gains and also the share gains that we saw in Q3. And display has been a piece of that."

So we -- as we look at 2017, we believe that the category has indicators that it will continue to expand. I wouldn't describe that as a planning stance that says it's a hockey stick, but I think we can see that there's firming in the category. Consumers are in stores. And I just think overall, at the macro level, we think people are across all income cohorts beginning to spend a little bit more confidently than they have before. But what I think of that I'm very optimistic about is if you just look at the total snack wheel, snacking continues to progress. I think it's largely driven by occasions. So we have to compete and do well against those new occasions that exist in the market. But I think innovation will be an important driver. It's good for the category if you think about it within the total snack wheel that we have great competitors. And so, frankly, as there's good innovation, I think it just reminds consumers the relevance of CMG in total, and so I think that's good for all of us. And then we, of course, have to win as well. So what I think you'll hear from us as we get more specific about 2017 is we're optimistic about some improvement in the category growth rate that's relative to snack wheel. We think occasions certainly benefit us as well, and then we have to win market share. And that's why we're very focused against an overall business model that helps us win as a part of the top quartile of our peer group. And then we also want to win market share, obviously, within our specific categories. So I'm pretty optimistic about 2017, and those are some of the reasons why. Michele importantly talked about the competitiveness in-store. That was all true. But listen, we're all in the business of growth and meeting the wants and needs of consumers. So we're going to be really focused against executing. We're going to win every day from a market share standpoint, and then the category growth rate should take care of itself."

And really, our strategy there is looking at how we can expand our portfolio to either bring in new users or new usage occasions, something that we, perhaps, aren't able to do with our current existing portfolio of brands. So we really think about buying a brand and a full proposition. As I look at Brookside, we've been really pleased with how we've delivered against that acquisition model over the years. We certainly have grown the business. It continues to be important strategically in terms of delivering and getting us more into the mass premium space. And right now, we're focused on consumers love the products. We have great repeat. And our next wave of growth there needs to be to continue to drive incremental trial and bring in additional users to that product that folks love. Krave, we're feeling good about. And if you look at all 3 of these acquisitions, as we create value, we certainly start by creating value by expanding distribution, and that's been the clear first piece of the model; by achieving cost synergy; and then, third, by unleashing and expanding the brand. And that's really the model. We think about each one. Krave, we have nearly doubled the sales on that.

We have high market share, and therefore, we can see across. And we have ubiquitous availability. So as we look at all of the different channels and how consumers are -- put traffic into stores and then how they're spending per trip, it's all things that we follow pretty closely. And so you're starting to see such. So imagine that some retailers probably have relatively stable traffic on a going basis than others depending who their income cohorts are. You might see a bit of a different traffic pattern. So what's happening is, first, you begin to see people come back into the stores, and then you begin to see the basket broaden a little bit. So I just want to be cautious that it's not as if everybody is out high-fiving. But as we talk to some of our retailers and as we follow those metrics, there's evidence that the consumer on a more broad base is having a greater frequency in the store. And then we follow what I would simply called the breadth of the basket or the trend -- or the value of the basket, and we're seeing some improvement there as well. It's different by channel, and you would see some retailers having different experiences. In some retail segments, still talk a little bit about volatility that they're seeing. But again, the good news is that fairly broadly, we're seeing an uptick in trips. And then as the economy, I think, continues to firm a bit, there'll be some confidence around the spend of those consumers. And that's part of what makes us optimistic about 2017 is if you think about the 3 elements of our business, seasons, the everyday business and then, of course, instant consumable, instant consumable is very much influenced by people obviously being in the store. We're going to have our products on the floor when they're in the store. When our advertising is working hard for us, you see that everyday business, which is a wonderful margin business for both us and the retailers, do well. So it really comes back to these elements Michele talked about earlier for us, strong innovation, making sure we've got the right marketing mix modeling and then the business model that we've talked about. And we'll explain more in -- when we get together in the spring. It's really going to be the 3 buckets of focus for us as a company."

Welcome to The Hershey Company Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session.
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss third quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $72.4 million or $0.23 per share diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

Before we discuss the details of our third quarter results, I'd like to add some context to the press release we issued on October 14. 
It's been an honor and a privilege to be the 11th CEO of The Hershey Company. I'm proud of all that we've accomplished as a team over the last 5 to 6 years and plan to be fully engaged on a day-to-day basis as CEO over the next 8 months or so as we drive the business forward and regain momentum. I will also continue to work closely with my management team as we review our global go-to-market approach that we discussed in July. We're making progress and expect to discuss these value-creation strategies with you in early 2017. 
Importantly, we believe that The Hershey Company will continue to be successful in the marketplace. We have a solid framework in place related to customer capabilities and consumer insights, especially in the North American segment that should enable us to execute against the demand landscape work that we've been updating. This is in conjunction with the progress that we've made in our R&D pipeline and faster innovation cycle in our core CMG business and snackfection initiatives. 
As part of our overall commitment to research and development, we're very pleased to announce our participation in the new University of Pennsylvania's Pennovation Center, whose grand opening is today. The Pennovation Center is a bridge that brings together corporations with the need, curious educators and student scientists in the university's new hub for innovation that will focus on research, development and entrepreneurialism. 
Let me add some perspective to our international operations. We've experienced macroeconomic challenges and slowdown in some of our key development markets. With this said, under the right conditions, we know our brands can be successful, as evidenced by the market share gain that we've attained, where we focused on our core brand-building efforts. However, given an uncertain outlook in these markets over the near term, we will continue to assess our investment mix across the enterprise to align with both our long-term strategic intent and best growth and margin-enhancing activities. We believe that it's appropriate to continuously assess market opportunities and evolve the best approach to meet our growth and profit focus. We simply see this as part of our ongoing operating philosophy. We plan to share further details with you at our investor event early in the year. 
For now, I can tell you that we're striving for an organization that's more agile, flexible and focused on the consumer, brand-building and cost efficiency across our entire business. This will drive improved gross margin and EBIT margin. Our commitment to growth and cost control will enable us to continue to deliver strong cash flow growth and generate value for all shareholders. 
As it relates to 2017, it's a bit early to discuss specifics, but we think there is a set-up to deliver top quartile performance versus the peer group. A longer Easter season and planned innovation driven by Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch and barkTHINS' acceleration should benefit top line growth. 
We have visibility into our cost structure and $100 million in productivity savings that we discussed earlier in the year that should lead to EBIT margin expansion in 2017. 
Third quarter sales, marketplace performance and operating income were relatively in line with expectations. Earnings per share exceeded our forecasts, driven by a lower tax rate, and Patricia will have more on this in a bit. 
As we anticipated, U.S. marketplace performance sequentially improved versus last quarter and was within our targeted range. Total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ended October 8, 2016, within the xAOC+C channels increased 0.6%, with market share the same as the year-ago period. This represents all Hershey manufactured products sold at retail, such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave, chocolate syrup and snack bars. 
Importantly, trends in our chocolate business improved due to a shorter Easter and the timing of innovation, chocolate retail takeaway was off about 0.5% in the first half of the year and was up 0.6% in the third quarter, resulting in a market share gain of 0.5 points. We expect that the fourth quarter total Hershey and CMG performance will continue to sequentially improve. 
Our brands responded positively to the investments we discussed last quarter. Specifically, marketplace results in the quarter were driven by our performance in August as in-store merchandising and display activity and on-air advertising GRPs were solid, supporting U.S. Olympics programming and the launch of Reese's Pieces Cups. Our marketing mix for these programs was balanced between direct trade in both TV and digital advertising. You'll see more of this next year as we look to optimize our marketing mix model. 
Innovation in targeted 360-degree programs, where we got our marketing mix right, has worked for us so far in 2016. Variety and news on the Reese's franchise, driven by our NCAA relationship, which has been extended to the fall football season, and the launch of Reese's Pieces Cup, has resulted in the Reese's brands retail takeaway of close to 8% in the third quarter. End results were similar for the Kit Kat franchise, given the success of the Big Kat new product launch. And Hershey's Kisses, up 7.2% in the recent 12-week period, is also quietly having a good year, driven by birthday-themed packaging and programming. 
We're getting incremental quality merchandising in other parts of the store, where wrapping paper and birthday cards can be found leveraging the emotional connectivity the brand has with consumers. And our Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites continue to do well and give us confidence that our close-in snack strategy will gain traction over time. The same successful principles will be applied to Hershey's chocolate, where current brand performance isn't where we really want it to be. We believe the launch and related support of Hershey’s Cookie Layer Crunch will reenergize and make the brand fresh. 
Consumer demand for multi-textural eating experiences across varying snacking occasions is increasing and this product fills whitespace opportunity and should partially source volume from the cookie category. We're leveraging our iconic Hershey chocolate bar and pairing it with layers of cookie -- crunchy cookie bits and decadent fillings to offer an indulgent textured snacking experience. Easy for me to say. This is one of the most anticipated innovations from the iconic Hershey's brand in many years. Based on prelaunch testing, Hershey’s Cookie Layer Crunch earned some of the highest consumer scores of any product ever launched by the company and will come in 3 flavors: caramel, vanilla cream and mint. Each piece is perfectly portion controlled at 90 to 100 calories and will be available at select retailers starting in December. 
So we're making progress, but there's still a lot of work to do as we enter the fourth quarter and look to 2017, where our priority is to restore Hershey's marketplace momentum with the very profitable U.S. market. We believe these initiatives and ones that we've yet to disclose will result in improved and consistent marketplace performance over this strategic planning cycle. As such, we believe the candy, mint and gum is an attractive category capable of solid growth over the long term when supported with the right mix of customer and consumer marketing. 
Net sales in India declined versus the year-ago period due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business. The media-invested brands, JOLLY RANCHER, SOFIT and HERSHEY'S Syrup and Spreads, where we're focusing our efforts and investments, increased about 20%. 
In China, the modern trade hypermarket environment continues to be challenging across many categories. Our gross sales in China declined in line with our estimate, with net sales up about 15% on a constant currency basis. 
Chocolate category performance in the third quarter was sluggish and down about 4%. Our marketplace performance was in line with our expectation, with market share off about 1 point. We're executing against our plan and over the remainder of the year, have a balanced consumer proposition of variety, news and marketing across the Hershey's Milk Chocolate, Hershey's Kisses and Golden Monkey candy and snack brands. 
Our China e-commerce business has been relatively consistent and continues to post solid results, albeit off a smaller base. We estimate that our e-commerce business has about a 10 share of the market in China and look to build on that over the remainder of the year, driven by Singles Day in November. 
Now to wrap up. Despite the macroeconomic challenges facing the consumer, the broader snacks category, including indulgent snacks, continues to grow across retail channels. We're committed to our marketing mix modeling, trade, TV advertising and digital media as well as investments related to innovation, consumer marketing and insights that we believe will enable Hershey to deliver consistent and predictable top and bottom line growth. 
As I stated earlier, we feel good about our preliminary 2017 plans that are still taking shape. We're a growth and EBIT margin-focused company with a goal of increasing margins on an annual basis via both cost control and importantly, top line growth. 
Hershey has many opportunities to leverage its global brands in U.S. scale. We're optimistic about our future and focused on what we need to do to succeed. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, and our executive management team and the Board of Directors are confident that we'll continue to build value for all Hershey's shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results."

Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $2 billion increased 2.2%, in line with our forecast. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.29, an increased of about 10% versus last year,",1301,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $2 billion increased 2.2%, in line with our forecast. 
Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.29, an increased of about 10% versus last year, greater than our estimate due to shift of advertising and related consumer marketing expense to the fourth quarter and the 280 basis point decline in the adjusted tax rate that was greater than anticipated. More on both of these in a bit. 
Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 20 basis points, net sales increased 2.4%. As expected, net price realization was relatively in line with our estimates and a 70 basis point benefit, primarily due to lower International and Other segment direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances as we lap the year-ago challenges in China. Volume was a 1 point contribution to net sales growth, driven by our performance in the U.S. Acquisitions were a 70 basis point benefit due to barkTHINS, which we acquired in the second quarter. 
By segment, third quarter North America net sales increased 1.8%. Volume was a 1.1 point benefit and driven by the U.S. business, where volume was up 1.7 points. Canada net sales and volume were off, as planned, as solid new product performance was more than offset by select SKU rationalization. Acquisitions were an 80 point -- 80 basis point benefit. And net price realization, a 10 basis point headwind. 
Total International and Other segment net sales for the third quarter increased 5.3% versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 2.2 points. International and Other segment volume was up 10 basis points, as solid Latin America and select export market performance was partially offset by lower sales in China, the discontinuance of the edible oil business in India and a little softness in the global retail and licensing business. Net price realization was a 7.4 point benefit as direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances in China were lower. 
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin declined by 40 basis points in the third quarter as productivity and cost savings were offset by unfavorable sales mix from excess packaging and higher supply chain costs, driven by initial year absorption of overhead related to the Malaysia manufacturing facility. For the full year, we continue to expect that gross margin will be slightly down versus a year ago. 
As J.P. mentioned, we remain focused on our cost structure. The productivity initiatives we've discussed this year are on track, and we plan to deliver approximately $135 million in cost savings this year and at least $100 million per year from 2017 through 2019. 
Adjusted operating profit in the third quarter increased 7.6%, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 22.3% versus 21.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating profit was driven by an increase in gross profit and lower marketing expense. 
As expected, total advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined about 9.6% in the third quarter. This is partially due to timing. Recall, advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 5% in the second quarter, and we expect that it will increase in the fourth quarter as well. 
North America and International and Other segment, SM&A, excluding advertising in the barkTHINS acquisition, declined 5.5%, driven by savings from the previously discussed business productivity programs. 
Unallocated corporate expense increased 3.5% or $4 million as efficiency and cost savings initiatives were offset by higher employee-related costs, an increase in corporate depreciation and amortization and JV minority interest expense. 
Now let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I'm pleased that our total international business delivered on their Q3 plans. As J.P. stated, we're executing against our plans in the key markets of China, Mexico, Brazil and India. Adding to his commentary on China, chocolate category performance in brick-and-mortar continues to be choppy. Consumer spending still appears to be mixed within the modern trade box. China gross sales are forecasted to decline in 2016. However, net sales are expected to increase as we don't anticipate the same level of direct trade, returns, discounts and allowances as last year. Constant currency net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased nicely. International and Other segment operating profit increased meaningfully, and I'm pleased with the progression. As J.P. said, we are committed to profitability in this segment. 
Moving down the P&L. Interest expense of $24.4 million increased $5.7 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 30.7%, lower than our estimate as R&D tax credits were greater than anticipated. 
As expected, the other income and expense line item includes the book expense related to corresponding tax credits that we mentioned last quarter. For the full year, we expect the tax rate to be about 100 basis points lower than last year. 
For the third quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 215.2 million shares, down 4.9 million versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.29 or an increase of about 10.3% versus a year ago. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's third quarter by $20 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $1 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $30 million, and accounts payable increased by $9 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $64.1 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be at the low end of our $265 million to $275 million range. 
During the third quarter, adjusted depreciation and amortization was $61.5 million, and dividends paid were $128.6 million. In the third quarter, the company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. In addition, the company did not repurchase any common shares in the third quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $333 million, slightly lower than a year ago. 
As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year and into 2017, we have a lot of innovation, variety and seasonal merchandising and programming in the marketplace. We have good visibility in the Holiday orders and demand related to the upcoming launch of Hershey’s Cookie Layer Crunch. We feel good about our marketing mix modeling investments and believe that we have the right balance of spend over the remainder of the year as total trade and advertising is higher in the fourth quarter versus last year. We believe these investments should result in a continued sequential improvement in U.S. retail takeaway. 
For the full year 2016, net sales will increase around 1%, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of about 50 basis points and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 75 basis points. 
We continue to expect that gross margin will be slightly below last year, due primarily to unfavorable sales mix. Business productivity and cost savings programs are on track with our targets. And as we discussed earlier, the tax rate is expected to be slightly favorable versus our previous expectations. As a result, the company expects adjusted earnings per share diluted for 2016 to increase 4% to 5%, including barkTHINS' dilution of $0.5 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.28 to $4.32 range versus the previous estimate of $4.24 to $4.28. 
Thank you for your time this morning, and we'll now take any questions that you have."

When -- we did have a little bit of an uptick compared to prior year in the third quarter. That really had more to do with some timing issues that we had last year's third quarter than any change in our fundamental run rate. And I expect to see this focus on cost in our SG&A, excluding marketing and related advertising expense, to continue. In terms of the advertising and related marketing expense, we -- as I said in my remarks, we've been running above in the second quarter. We dipped below a little bit in the third quarter, but we expect to have that back up again in the fourth quarter. And that, combined with added investments in trade promotion, we believe will continue to drive momentum in the marketplace. And I'll turn it over to Michele to talk a little bit more about that."

We'll be shipping Hershey’s Cookie Layer Crunch, and that will be a bigger benefit to net sales than it will be takeaway. You'll see more of the takeaway towards the end of the quarter and into 2017, and you can think about that as being roughly 1 to 2 points growth for us in Q4. And then lastly, the balance of our growth will really come from overall takeaway across our international and U.S. business.

But the way we think about it, Ken, is we really have more of a business model philosophy around how we want to have that right balance. But we also believe that -- if you noticed in my remarks, I've talked about getting the right mix of growth opportunities and where we invest. And I think it's just basic that we always have to revisit some of those. And given some of the macroeconomic challenges, I think you'll see us try to get those right going forward. And then again, the greater specificity will come in March. So if you work with us on that, I appreciate it."

I think you've laid out some of the parts to our gross margin that we're very focused on. I agree with you that the snacks and some of the international margin -- gross margins are lower than they are. In our core U.S. chocolate business, there's not much that does better than core U.S. chocolate in terms of margin. And you see some of that mix impact in terms of what's in the base right now. You've mentioned commodities. Commodities will go up, and they'll go down, and we keep our eye on them. And we always look to have some visibility going forward in our commodity expenses so that we can price accordingly and respond accordingly. But I don't subscribe to the fact that there aren't improvements we can make in our gross margin. And I want to call out one of the things that our U.S. plants are doing here in terms of the methodology we call lean, which is really wringing even more costs out of the production process. And that's something that we're in the process right now of -- we have in several of our plants and were rolling out to more plants. Another thing that we can look at is really on our SKUs and making sure that we have the best, most optimal SKU mix in our portfolio. So while I agree with you there is a little bit of a headwind in terms of the portfolio evolution, I think that we wouldn't want to say that there's nothing that we can do about it. We need to remain enormously focused on gross margin."

So I would say that innovation is absolutely key. Scale platform innovation has proven to be one of the greatest drivers for our category. I'm encouraged about some of the innovation that we had this past year, and I think that we've seen the results of that in the market place. And a lot that didn't launch until the second half, but Big Kat, Reese's Pieces Cup has done incredibly well. And Snack Mix was also a great innovation that drove incrementality. Of course, it wasn't shared to the confection category. It's actually health and salty snacks. So it is a key lever. And having that sustainable big platform innovation gives us sustaining innovation over a multiyear period of time, and that's one of the biggest focuses, for us, is making sure that we have sticky innovations so that it doesn't just launch and come out. But I agree with you that as we look to next year, both in terms of our business as well as the category, we think that the level of innovation is really going to help to drive CMG category growth and bring consumers to our category. So we're really excited about that."

In Mexico, we've increased distribution opportunities using our Sigma distribution partner, so great result there. India has been taking care of some products that are lower profitability, and you can really see that helping our margin, and we need to continue to do that going forward. I think China will continue to be a work in progress as we assess our opportunities against the marketplace that we have there, whether that's in chocolate, which has been a little bit weak, or in the more traditional candies that we have with our Golden and Munching Monkey brands.

So instant consumables is always a priority for us, given its strong profitability. And so as we look at the past couple of years, we are really focused going forward on how we can continue to drive instant consumable a little bit harder. There has been a bit more competition in that area from some healthy instant consumable offerings. But where we feel good about where we're making progress is the results we've seen from some of the innovation that was instant consumable-focused, both in terms of our Ice Breakers gum, capacity expansion and then the Reese's Pieces Cup and Big Kat. And then you'll see that with Cookie Layer Crunch as well and some other offerings into next year. We've also focused on optimizing some of our merchandising strategies in a way that we think will continue to drive instant consumable a bit harder. So it's certainly a key focus for us."

So first of all, as we look at Crunchers, this fits right in the strategy. We've spoken to you a bit about around snackfection, which is thinking broadly about where our core confectionery trademarks, which are so powerful, can play to bring in new users and be utilized across even more snacking occasions with consumers. So if you look at Crunchers, you can see the product has our great trademarks and great chocolate, but very different eating experience, which is much more of a munchable crunchy product, which will put those propositions in a whole different consumer use education. So it really fits in that strategy of expanding snacking occasions across the broader marketplace, and you'll see that in the marketplace sometime mid first half of the year. But we are really excited about that. Relative to your broader question on some of the other factors at play in the category, one that I would bring up is just the timing of Easter is always a key factor for the category. And certainly, some years, that's a benefit. And some years, it's not. This year is one of the shortest Easters. Next year, we have that going in our favor, so we're excited about that. And relative to display, there has been some pressure on the category as some of the biggest retailers have gone to clean floor policies and. Given how much floor space confection has received, I think this category has taken a little bit of a bigger hit than some other categories potentially. We believe that we're now behind us with lapping a good piece of that, and we believe that having great innovation is one of the best ways to gain display and space. And we're feeling good about some of the initiatives that we've put in place for Holiday, where we're seeing share gains and also the share gains that we saw in Q3. And display has been a piece of that."

So we -- as we look at 2017, we believe that the category has indicators that it will continue to expand. I wouldn't describe that as a planning stance that says it's a hockey stick, but I think we can see that there's firming in the category. Consumers are in stores. And I just think overall, at the macro level, we think people are across all income cohorts beginning to spend a little bit more confidently than they have before. But what I think of that I'm very optimistic about is if you just look at the total snack wheel, snacking continues to progress. I think it's largely driven by occasions. So we have to compete and do well against those new occasions that exist in the market. But I think innovation will be an important driver. It's good for the category if you think about it within the total snack wheel that we have great competitors. And so, frankly, as there's good innovation, I think it just reminds consumers the relevance of CMG in total, and so I think that's good for all of us. And then we, of course, have to win as well. So what I think you'll hear from us as we get more specific about 2017 is we're optimistic about some improvement in the category growth rate that's relative to snack wheel. We think occasions certainly benefit us as well, and then we have to win market share. And that's why we're very focused against an overall business model that helps us win as a part of the top quartile of our peer group. And then we also want to win market share, obviously, within our specific categories. So I'm pretty optimistic about 2017, and those are some of the reasons why. Michele importantly talked about the competitiveness in-store. That was all true. But listen, we're all in the business of growth and meeting the wants and needs of consumers. So we're going to be really focused against executing. We're going to win every day from a market share standpoint, and then the category growth rate should take care of itself."

As we've talked about before, we are very aware of all of the different things that exist. We look at a lot of things. At the same time, we believe we have a great business model, and we don't want to do anything that doesn't really help us build there. I think that when you would see us do smaller things, it's because we believe they fit within a larger platform or have a brand positioning that we can really build around. I don't think we're going to be in the business of just getting a lot of disconnected small things that we can't figure out how to knit together. So we're very thoughtful about how we think the emerging consumer trends are and does that help us get into some of these different places. So M&A is an important thing for us.

So we feel good about each of those acquisitions if I look to Brookside, Krave as well as barkTHINS, though, that one obviously is early. And really, our strategy there is looking at how we can expand our portfolio to either bring in new users or new usage occasions, something that we, perhaps, aren't able to do with our current existing portfolio of brands. So we really think about buying a brand and a full proposition. As I look at Brookside, we've been really pleased with how we've delivered against that acquisition model over the years. We certainly have grown the business. It continues to be important strategically in terms of delivering and getting us more into the mass premium space. And right now, we're focused on consumers love the products. We have great repeat. And our next wave of growth there needs to be to continue to drive incremental trial and bring in additional users to that product that folks love. Krave, we're feeling good about. And if you look at all 3 of these acquisitions, as we create value, we certainly start by creating value by expanding distribution, and that's been the clear first piece of the model; by achieving cost synergy; and then, third, by unleashing and expanding the brand. And that's really the model. We think about each one. Krave, we have nearly doubled the sales on that. Likewise, nearly doubled distribution and are feeling good about where our velocities are in the marketplace and the innovation pipeline we have behind that. And we're seeing similar results that would certainly again allow [ph] on barkTHINS.

We have high market share, and therefore, we can see across. And we have ubiquitous availability. So as we look at all of the different channels and how consumers are -- put traffic into stores and then how they're spending per trip, it's all things that we follow pretty closely. And so you're starting to see such. So imagine that some retailers probably have relatively stable traffic on a going basis than others depending who their income cohorts are. You might see a bit of a different traffic pattern. So what's happening is, first, you begin to see people come back into the stores, and then you begin to see the basket broaden a little bit. So I just want to be cautious that it's not as if everybody is out high-fiving. But as we talk to some of our retailers and as we follow those metrics, there's evidence that the consumer on a more broad base is having a greater frequency in the store. And then we follow what I would simply called the breadth of the basket or the trend -- or the value of the basket, and we're seeing some improvement there as well. It's different by channel, and you would see some retailers having different experiences. In some retail segments, still talk a little bit about volatility that they're seeing. But again, the good news is that fairly broadly, we're seeing an uptick in trips. And then as the economy, I think, continues to firm a bit, there'll be some confidence around the spend of those consumers. And that's part of what makes us optimistic about 2017 is if you think about the 3 elements of our business, seasons, the everyday business and then, of course, instant consumable, instant consumable is very much influenced by people obviously being in the store. We're going to have our products on the floor when they're in the store. When our advertising is working hard for us, you see that everyday business, which is a wonderful margin business for both us and the retailers, do well. So it really comes back to these elements Michele talked about earlier for us, strong innovation, making sure we've got the right marketing mix modeling and then the business model that we've talked about.
