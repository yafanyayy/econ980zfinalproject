Then I want to take a few minutes to talk about long-term value creation for our shareholders, and then we'll leave guidance. 
As you saw in the press release, we had a terrific fourth quarter and our results demonstrated our business model transition is working. The end of the fourth quarter is marked with a key milestone and Autodesk transition to our software-as-a-service business as we hit the end of sale day for perpetual licenses for individual products. While the end of sale went well, what makes our Q4 results particularly good is that they were not driven by a dramatic surge in [indiscernible] opportunity buy-in of perpetual licenses. In fact, our analysis suggests that only a small portion, around 10% of our Q4 unit volume, is related to end-of-sale activity. More importantly, strong subscription growth, both new model and maintenance subscriptions, and a record number of large transactions drove these results. 
Our total unit volume for the fourth quarter was flat compared to the fourth quarter of last year, which was a major accomplishment. Recall that in Q4 last year, we had a significant uptick in demand related to the end of our upgrade program. Said another way, we were able to cover last year's Q4 uptick in unit volume with our new model subscription offering. When you look at total unit volume for the year, we were pleased to see volume of approximately 650,000 [ph] licenses. The total of subscription additions for the quarter was better than expected at 190,000. As we've seen all year, the additions were led by new model subscriptions with strong growth in all 3 types: Desktop, enterprise and cloud subscriptions. 
Desktop subscriptions remain our fastest-growing new model subscription offering and grew nearly 300% year-over-year. More specifically, desktop subscription is thriving with our channel partners. In just the past fourth [ph] quarter, the channel volume of desktop subscription has increased by more than 400%. In Q4, approximately 65% of our desktop subscription volume came through our channel partner, which is up in less than 50% [ph] in Q4 last year. 
What's still also notable is that we achieved our highest quarter for new model subs for the year and highest ever in terms of organic new model sub adds in the same quarter that we hit the end of sale of perpetual licenses for individual products, a remarkable achievement. For the year, we added 50% more new model subs than maintenance subs, even as maintenance attached and renewal rates move to record highs. The growth in new model subscriptions [indiscernible] 74% [ph] constant currency growth in new model ARR. Total recurring revenue grew to 53% of revenue compared to 47% in the fourth quarter last year. 
We're also pleased to see the unit volumes to our [indiscernible] strong growth and we believe that our online business will continue to grow to increase meaningfully. When you add in the business we do directly with enterprise customers, our overall direct business grew to 21% of our revenue volume compared to just 17% and 16% for the past 2 years. We set a record for the number of large deals in the quarter. Overall, a 19% increase in total deal count. The majority of these large deals were flexible enterprise licenses or EBAs, which are helping to drive subscription growth. Specifically, existing enterprise customers that moved from one of the former license [indiscernible] to the newer [indiscernible] CBAs have resulted in subscriber growth 3x [ph] higher than before. That's pretty meaningful. Just as a reminder, for those of you keeping score at home, the new Token Flex CBAs that we signed up this quarter, over 20,000, won't start to show up in accounts until next quarter. 
Large enterprise deals signaled that we are becoming a more strategic and essential quarter to our largest customers. Our long-term vision and position as the thought leader in the industry is an essential part of their commitment to us. To summarize, Q4 provides a nice proof point that the business model transition is working for our customers, our partners and us. I couldn't be happier with the results. 
Now that we've covered the past quarter, let me turn to long-term value creation. Given the short-term impact that the model transition is having on our traditional financial metrics, the recent turmoil in the stock market, growing fears about a global macroeconomic slowdown and the noise created by investors focused on the short-term, I think it's worth stepping back and taking a few minutes to outline how we are creating long-term value for our shareholders. First, we are dramatically increasing the lifetime value of our customers with our new business model. While this creates short-term downward pressure on our traditional financing metrics, we have repeatedly called out how we create significant funding to returns over the next 3 to 5 years. 
Second, we are simplifying our entire go-to-market strategy to align with the concept of being an all-subscription company. This involves a significant increase in our direct customer sales and marketing efforts, both at the enterprise level and to e-commerce. Not only will this change the cost structure, but it will increase -- it will greatly increase our effectivity to serve our customers. 
And the third and most importantly, we are exporting products to deliver more compelling product to recurring customers and dramatically expand the size of our market opportunities. Our early investment in cloud-based design and engineering have given us a once [indiscernible] generation opportunity to reinvent both the construction and manufacturing software market. Mainstream mobile and cloud technologies have opened up the market with more than 100 million potential subscribers. 
Thirdly, we have made substantial investments to achieve our leadership position, and let me be as clear as possible. The technology platforms for the future are all designed in engineering software. Really, all software is the cloud. And the company that wins will have substantial and sustainable long-term advantage. 
To summarize, our framework to building long-term shareholder value is to increase the lifetime value of every customer, change our cost structure, the means by which we reach customers, and finally, build the best cloud-based products and services in the industry. 
So while generalities are important, let me specifically highlight recent activity in terms of these long-term objectives. Most importantly, our business model transition is underway and exceeding expectations. For the second half of this year, we will fully be in the subscription-only mode. Customer and partner reactions to our new business model have been very positive, which gives me great confidence about our approach to the transition. Next, we continue to gauge and making sure of our costs. In Q4, we [indiscernible] flat year-over-year. We recently did a sizable restructuring that balances the need for financial discipline and its ability to invest in critical initiatives that drive the long-term health of the company. In September, we discussed annual operating expense growth of 5% to 6%. The restructuring, combined with other cost-cutting measures, has allowed us to put a significant cap on spending for the next 2 [ph] years. And we're committed to keeping spending growth roughly flat to slightly down through FY '17 and FY '18. 
And finally, our cloud-based products are the undisputed leaders in their respective categories. While many people are focused on the business model shift, many of the leadership positions in the cloud leads to a long-term sustainable competitive advantage. Building a great company over the long term requires balance in the interest of shareholders, employees and customers. Done well, these are not mutually exclusive. [indiscernible] we talked about it's harder to do, and I'm very proud of the many awards we received that recognized our success in doing just that. A few in particular worth mentioning are we were selected fro Fortune's world 25 best multinational workplaces, Fortune's 100 best companies to work for, and we're in the top 5 of Fortune's most admired software companies. We also are getting countless awards for innovation and product leadership. Bringing it all together, we are updating our long-term cash flow market. As for the to FY '20, assuming that the number of outstanding shares remains constant, we will be able to produce about $6 of free cash flow per share. In the following years, free cash flow continues to dramatically increase, and we see a path to free cash flow that [indiscernible] $2.5 billion or more than $11 per share of free cash flow by FY '20. As you are aware, our cash flow generation this year and next will be impacted by the transition from perpetual to term-based licenses. The silver lining is that we now have an opportunity to switch to a new operating structure to support our business needs. This change will result in an increase in our U.S.-based cash by lowering our long-term tax rate. This will greatly help with a long-term structural and balance of our ongoing revenues and cash flows as we move through the business model transition. We will give you more details during this year as our plans materialize. 
As we change to fiscal 2017, we couldn't be more excited about entering this next phase of our business. This year, we'll be the most unique in the company's history as we complete the transition from perpetual licenses to cloud-based subscriptions at the end of Q2. That will be interesting and unique quarterly pattern. None of the traditional seasonality patterns or sales metrics will be applicable. [indiscernible] year-over-year growth rates of traditional financial metrics be helpful in understanding how we're performing through the transition. 
Q1 will be our first quarter with only subscription offerings for individual products. We have a number of sales promotions in place to accelerate our customers' move to desktop subscription. As you think about Q1, the best results for us would be to be higher on subscriptions and lower on revenue. Now this may seem counterintuitive, but, in fact, would result from an accelerated transition to desktop subs. The end of Q2 will be the next major milestone of our business model transition as we start selling perpetual licenses for Suites. We expect the dynamics will most closely resemble what we saw in Q4 with the end of sale for individual products. Q3 will be our first quarter of subscription-only sales across the board and will likely experience potential slowdown. Our Q4 should begin to show more normal sales trends in our new subscription-only model. In our view, the better metrics will track our progress over the next few quarters will be subscription additions and the ARR growth. The entire company has been realigned and is hyperfocused on subscription additions and growth in recurring revenue. We have put in place both the positive and incentives, which is new sales, comp and bonus plans to align with our goal of growing our subscription base by a 20% CAGR over the next 4 years, which will drive a 24% CAGR in the ARR. 
Many of you have asked about impact of the macroeconomic environment on our business. We've said in past several quarters that the global conditions have been unaided. Most of the emerging markets have been a mess, but most of the mature markets have been decent. As we evaluated our strong Q4 results, we didn't see any further degradation in the demand environment. 
However, there is no denying there is clear divergence and sentiment with regards to global macroeconomic conditions. Coupled with the uniqueness of this year, our forecasting process has never been more challenging. As such, we believe it's prudent to taking appropriately conservative approach to our outlook for the year, while remaining confident in our ability to achieve our long-term target. For the year, we're projecting to add approximately 500,000 subscriptions, with new model subscriptions contributing to vast majority of growth. As expected, this will be the year, where the transition cost is the biggest revenue impact as we move more fully into this subscription. 
On the earnings call last quarter, I talked about 1% to 2% [ph] same growth for FY '17. Given that our [indiscernible] annual spend increase starts in about 4% just in healthcare cost, et cetera, some cost actions were already factored into our guidance. And repeatedly about reducing our spend growth while staying the course for the investments required to make both the business model and platform transition. Examples of these investment in building out a low-cost, high-touch inside sales team or in building out our cloud platform and products. We are constantly impacted by cutting spending too much or not reducing it enough could have on the rate and open the success of the transition. We believe our current course of management spend grew flat to moderately down for FY '17 [indiscernible] And as I previously mentioned, we will maintain flat growth throughout FY '18 as well. 
We are [indiscernible] saving the entire framework we laid out at the Investor Day last September, but there are a couple of data points that should be helping you with longer-term modeling. As I said earlier with the updates to the model overall, we see FCF per share of roughly $6 in FY '20, given our current view of topline growth and our spend trajectory. Our revenue production for FY '17 is slightly lower than the framework we provided in September for a few reasons. Continued FX headwinds are pushing revenue down. We are assuming a higher mix of new model sub-based on our recent performance. And as I mentioned earlier, we're taking a more conservative stance, given all the moving parts this year. 
Similar to our view in Q1, hitting the low end of our revenue range, while exceeding our subscription guidance, is a desirable outcome for the year. If we experienced greater-than-expected demand for the last perpetual licenses for Suites, it will likely drive revenue to the high end of guidance or beyond. 
To wrap things up, we're really excited to be 1 step further along in the transition. Our long-term strategy will provide our customers with greater flexibility, more compelling products and a better user experience. In doing so, we're driving higher lifetime customer value, simplify our go-to-market and significantly increasing the size of the available market. Simultaneously, we are reducing our cost structure to celebrate our transition and increase our profitability as well as evolving our operating and tax structure to better meet our future business needs. In short, we are creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business for Autodesk for Autodesk in the years to come. Finally, I'd like to thank all of our employees and our workers who work so hard to make last year a success.

We were pleased in Q4 to see a greater demand, no difference in demand from when we talked about the model. A lot of the upside is driven by greater cost control, so a lot has to do with some of the stuff we outlined for FY '17 and '18. And just as you roll out through the subsequent years, it's just starting from a lower cost base has a tremendous advantage. And in a lot of ways, that's what we were responding to. Many of our investors have said, I understand the transition. I love to where you're getting on the other side. But [indiscernible] control cost's a little bit better through this transition. I think in response to that, that's what we got and that's where we see a lot of it. The other slide shift I'd say is we're more optimistic about the move to the new model. We've seen more positive signs of acceptance by both customers and partners. And remember, a little bit of our reluctance to move more quickly is making sure we had acceptance of both groups and the ability for them to successfully navigate the transition as well as us."

Every emerging economy, developing country, whatever you want to call it practically, thinks. The exception for us was China. So despite the news that you may have read, China continues to perform well. But there are places, where our business in emerging markets is just totally tanked. So when you look at a number of these places, the Middle East, Russia, largely driven by oil, Brazil is bad. So you look there, when you compare geographically, our EMEA results look not as strong as the others. Two factors there. One is EMEA had a fabulous fourth quarter last year; and the second part is really the MEA part. The E part of EMEA did great, but the MEA part just struggled and it really is due to oil and commodities at other stuff. So the geographic part is pretty simple. Don't see a big change, I think relative to what we hear others talking about or reading in newspapers, if anyone still reads newspapers, China is better than you would expect from taking your readings. The only weak point of the developed world that has no doubt there is Japan. So Japan has been weak for a while, currency is an issue. But generally, we saw kind of flat demand. Of course, the market's both construction and manufacturing on Media and Entertainment were all good and there's a lot of difference to cross or I would point to.

And in particular, the number of large transactions that we did, the deal is greater than $1 million. It's heavily driven by our EBAs, our big enterprise agreements. We had a very strong quarter there and, in fact, more than a handful of 8-figure deals there. Now these are all ratable, so you don't see them all dropping in to the revenue stream in Q4, but a handful of 8-figure deals in the largest manufacturing [indiscernible] we've ever done, we just got it done in Q4.

One of the tricks that we kind of referencing and forecasting is that in particular, I think there was a couple of quarters, though it's hard to know which way people will go, Q1 and Q2 in particular, but even extending into Q3. So we're doing our best job on triangulating from what we're hearing from our partners, what we're hearing from our salespeople, top-down models, extrapolation in trends. But to be honest, it's a little bit hard and that's why we have a slightly broader range in terms of guidance and why we gave the slightly paradoxical guidance that I wouldn't mind seeing revenue down. I think I've now done something like 40 [ph] of these earnings calls at the end of the quarter. And I don't think I've ever alluded for revenue to be down, but this maybe -- this is certainly a first. And so it's just different than it's ever been. I can't highlight enough that the next 4 quarters are just going to be a little bit odd. And that's why we pointed to you and I think you are on the right point, which is look at volume. We think volume will be up. Look at ARR, there will be a number of metrics will underlying -- it's really the foundation of the business doing well and for underlying demand.

So many of you have noticed things like promotions in Q1, I think you'll see promotions in Q1 around our new models businesses. I think just the same thing in Q3. That would not be out of the question for us to do stuff like that. So a number of things, but our bias is we'd already do stuff in the end of sale date by 6 months and now we're using all the knobs and leverage we have to continue to put pressure on the system to move to the new model as quickly as possible."

And so I'm not sure if this is something you've looked back, but on a steady state basis in Q3, Q4 and beyond, based on the historical mix that you've seen, the historical volume and subscription pricing, what's the fair range to think about new model ARPS and sort of steady-state, if that makes sense?"

We geared the entire machine from sales comp through the variable comp bonus plans that every employee has. You look at our promos, u look at the way we will point our channel partners next week at our sales kickoff event. It's geared everything towards driving subs. Because the more we drive subs, and in particular, the more we drive the new model subs, ultimately, that's what builds the strength of the modeling and gets us to that vision of fiscal '20 that we've laid out. So ARPS to us is more of a drive number. We're focused on driving subs and driving ARR. And when you divide those 3, you get ARPS. I think, if you wanted to think about a little bit more mechanically, I'll give you 2 pointers. One is the fastest-growing piece of our desktop business, which is what's driving the new model subs as much as anything that's below end, is that the AutoCAD LT, the stock sub. That's not actually going to put downward pressure that ARPS. The second is the way we calculate ARR in a quarterly basis is we total up our recurring revenue for the quarter, multiply that by 4 and you get it annualized, and that's our ARR. And so the linearity in a given quarter will drive the ARR calculation. In other words, the model sales coming in late in the quarter, there's fewer revenue than actually accretive to the reported revenue for the quarter. And so you don't get to see the full effect of it until the following quarter. So there's a little bit of seasonality and linearity effect on ARR at any given quarter, but I think it also throw off your ARPS calculation."

One is that there is always more of the seasonality to our large enterprise deals. Some of it is driven by the end of year. And remember, even though one of the works of this company is our calendar in fiscal numbering, it does give us a second close, so we not only have the customer end of year, but our salespeople haven't ended the year, too. And so there's always been a stronger influence in Q4 because of that. So the second thing is if you go back a handful of years, we had almost no enterprise licenses. That was a nonexistent part of our business and I think we get a number of things over the midterm the change that. One is we build out the Salesforce that did it. We changed the nature of some of our products and better accommodated. We had licensing models that are more what they wanted to do. And I think, our drive, really, to take a leadership position in the industry, whether that's what we're doing a Media and Entertainment or BIM 360 or doing on the cloud and manufacturing has led companies to view Autodesk as a more strategic partner. Other than that, how many years we have to go back before I would find that, a million-dollar deal in the quarter with a big deal? And now it's fairly routine. So we've invested heavily. As we detailed at Analyst Day this year and last year, we think there's a lot more there. We think the offerings enabled us to grow much more quickly. And what we love about it is it does have some trickle-down effect in that all of these companies greatly affect the supply chain. So we're really excited about the enterprise that is, and we're going to continue to keep investing in it. As a matter of fact, the biggest investment chain during the 2008, 2009 downturn when we recognized like our statistical run rate business was falling off and one of the places we could really invest was in the enterprise. And it was really out of ahead of that soul searching in the darkness that we really landed on this. And it's just been a continual success."

I think, again, that we saw [indiscernible] and I said that, I mean, every part of the company to focus on driving subs. And so the easy place to describe right now through this year will be to track how we grow both total and subscriptions, but then more importantly, the new model subscriptions, that's what's going to grow the company longer term. On cash flow, I said a couple of things. Cash flow for Q4 was artificially low. We did have -- we had very interesting linearity in a quarter, where the third [ph] month of the quarter, so January for us, so more than half of our total sales get done. And since we built in that 30, [ph] we had a lot of -- in a normal linearity, a normal 30, 40 or the normal that we have experienced in the past few years, we would've seen about [ph] $95 million more cash flow from ops fall into Q4. But given the linearity in the quarter, given those sales got found late, that's all sitting in receivables. By the way, our receivables is 100% current, so there's not -- there's no risk on that. But it is saying in receivables and will now be collected in Q1. So what it means is there's a headwind on the cash flow from ops just reported for Q4. That will just ripple over into Q1. It you remember, all we said for cash flow, our free cash flow back at Investor Day, we side we thought it would be breakeven to slightly negative for fiscal '17, and that now goes up by about $100 million year-over-year. So think of it being certainly positive, somewhere around that $50 million to $100 million range."

The second and probably more important thing that we're trying to accomplish with collections is to give an incentive for the existing customers, who are on maintenance for Suites, a more attractive thing to move over to. So as we said, we want to try to use the carrot as much is possible to convince our customers, our best customers, who are on maintenance a description to move over.

Our revenue outlook in the out years is still exactly what we outlined. Back to the beginning of your question, I would say relative to September, our expenses are much lower, considerably lower, just to put -- from 5% to 6% that we said was kind of the feeling, now we're talking about flat for the next 2 years and then moderating from there. So it's substantial when you run to model, it has a dramatic effect, particularly having down to flat in the first few years of this transition. The revenue, which we think slightly, but the revenue is not about unit demand, as we said. It's really whether people buy the new model or the old model. And also through this year, we'll still have some variability, and so inability to predict exactly what happens. The good news is we moved to the end of that year, there's only 1 thing that people can buy new from us. And so while in many ways, this is painful to go through the transition, we do hit a point, probably in the middle of next year, where 80% or 90% of the revenue in a quarter comes off the balance sheet. So if I go back to when I first started, you started every quarter in 0, you're now going in a place where you start every quarter with 80% or 90% of the tank full. And that -- we use the word business model transition and maybe some think it's wild, but absolutely, that's really what it means. And so our ability to predict that gets us very good at that point, and your ability to model it gets a very good at that point as you watch as at the ARR."

I mean, to extent you want to discount FY '23, [ph] feel free to. It's a way in the future. I think the FY '20 is there. The problem we have, and really, the reason why we gave details around FY '23 is because FY '20 or FY '21 is still so much in the steep part of the curve. And so if we -- when we were doing that, we're only talking about FY '20, people were saying, is that the terminal? Was it the terminal cash flow? Is that the terminal EPS, is that the terminal operating margin? And it wasn't. And just to the extent now that traditional financial metrics are going to go down predictably as a result of how we account for this, it's just as certain that they come up on the other side. So I think I'm totally fine with people want to discount FY '23. We just wanted to make sure that people understand that that's what our model looks like. And if you back off it and look, we've been [indiscernible] some people who think we should be able to get a lot more, there is some people who get less.

The other thing that I think is really important, and I know you guys do not want to pay too much to listen to your model, but we're running a business, not a spreadsheet. And in our world, the investments we've made in going to cloud-based engineering tools has led us to have a leadership position in that. We deeply believe that the future of all software is in the cloud and in mobile and it opens up big markets. I've always believed for people who invest in Autodesk, this is one of the fundamental tenets you should believe in. There are less difficult ways to get there, but we think the business model transition starts the curve we just talked about with Brent, but if that is going to continue into the out years, that's based on the fact that we expand in to new markets, get new users and win the platform of the future."

I kind of hesitate to do it because it's all been going so [indiscernible], but I'm really just trying to avoid work for a day with Scott over the next couple of days and having the same conversations several dozen different",677,"I just wanted to say 1 thing. I kind of hesitate to do it because it's all been going so [indiscernible], but I'm really just trying to avoid work for a day with Scott over the next couple of days and having the same conversations several dozen different times. Because I've had it in private, even I go down to the coffee store, I get asked by all the industries in our building. And that just a question of what's going on with our activist investors. And so I just want to take that as on and happy to talk about it privately with others. But it seems like a mistake not to address it to some decree, so let me just give you my viewpoint on this. The first thing is that I think the number of the 13 [ph] filers as well as the activist investors have raised legitimate concerns. And one part that kind of troubles me about it is that there are other long-term investors, really constructive investors, who raised some issues in a much better way. And so while we're absolutely talking to the activist investors, I think too much credit is being given to them and not enough credit is being given to our long-term investors, who have asked for change in a constructive way. They've understood kind of the subtleties and complexities of running the business and they truly have taken the time to understand what the challenges and opportunities we face. And so I feel like they're getting the short end of the stick when they really pull the weight and supporting the company over the longer period. Many of my problems with sort of some of the more activist investors is that their focus is extremely short-term and somewhat simplistic. They just ignore some of the complexities of running a business. And let's just get -- lighting up for a second and then I'll return to be more serious, but let me just tell you what my concern is. Is that if you sit on the outside and have lots of good ideas, either give me this oir that for the better or why things should move more quickly, as a matter of fact, if you turn on sports radio or political talk radio, on sports radio, you can hear thousands of people who look at the coach or General Manager, but the ownership is done differently. And I worry about that thing. I watched the game last that, I have a million ideas of what the coach should do, but I don't actually have to do the job. And so in a nutshell, my concern is people who I guess essentially want to turn Autodesk into a men's warehouse. Look, I don't think I need people turn this into men's warehouse and potentially do damage to the company. I don't think they meant to screw it up, but I think they have some simplistic views, and what troubles me is that we see those things that are expressed in our business. Actually, I got a little funny stories. I look up in mens warehouse the other day and they changed the name and the company and the symbol and what I thought was interesting is changing the name makes it actually hard to track the pricing and how it performs. But the symbol is a little bit of a telltale sign. You just look at it, it's spelled T U R D. It's actually T L R D, but it's sort of what it looks and it's probably more like it. So let me just try to end this on a more serious note. We are talking to the activists, we would like to shift the conversation to the activist investors to a more constructive dialogue. There is certainly a possibility that together, we can do that. And most importantly, I just want to say thank you to our long-term shareholders, they understood what the challenges are. They have really the fantastic opportunities that we have. Thanks."

Let's start by wrapping up Q4. Then I want to take a few minutes to talk about long-term value creation for our shareholders, and then we'll end with guidance.
As you saw in the press release, we had a terrific fourth quarter, and our results demonstrated our business model transition is working. The end of the fourth quarter marked a key milestone in Autodesk's transition to a software-as-a-service business as we hit the end-of-sale date for perpetual licenses for individual products. While the end-of-sale went well, what makes our Q4 results particularly good is that they were not driven by a dramatic surge in last opportunity buy-in of perpetual licenses. In fact, our analysis suggests that only a small portion, around 10% of our Q4 unit volume, is related to end-of-sale activity. More importantly, strong subscription growth, both new model and maintenance subscriptions, and a record number of large transactions drove these results.
Our total unit volume for the fourth quarter was flat compared to the fourth quarter last year, which was a major accomplishment. Recall that in Q4 last year, we had a significant uptick in demand related to the end of our upgrade program. Said another way, we were able to cover last year's Q4 uptick in unit volume with our new model subscription offering. When we look at total unit volume for the year, we were pleased to see volume of approximately 650,000 licenses. The total of subscription additions for the quarter was better than expected at 190,000. As we've seen all year, the additions were led by new model subscriptions with strong growth in all 3 types: desktop, enterprise and cloud subscriptions.
Desktop subscription remains our fastest-growing new model subscription offering and grew nearly 300% year-over-year. More specifically, desktop subscription is thriving with our channel partners. In just the past 4 quarters, the channel volume of desktop subscription has increased by more than 400%. In Q4, approximately 65% of our desktop subscription volume came through our channel partner, which is up from less than 50% in Q4 last year.
What's still also notable is that we achieved our highest quarter for new model subs for the year and highest ever in terms of organic new model sub adds in the same quarter that we hit the end-of-sale of perpetual licenses for individual products, a remarkable achievement. For the year, we added 50% more new model subs than maintenance subs, even as maintenance attach and renewal rates move to record highs. The growth in new model subscriptions fueled 74% constant currency growth in new model ARR. Total recurring revenue grew to 53% of revenue compared to 47% in the fourth quarter last year.
We're also pleased to see that unit volumes throughout Easter grew stronger, and we believe that our online business will continue to increase meaningfully. When you add in the business we do directly with enterprise customers, our overall direct business grew to 21% of our revenue volume compared to just 17% and 16% for the past 2 years. We set a record for the number of large deals in the quarter, overall, a 19% increase in total deals done. The majority of these large deals were flexible enterprise licenses or EBAs, which are helping drive subscription growth. Specifically, existing enterprise customers that moved from one of our older license agreements to the newer Token Flex EBAs have resulted in subscriber growth 3x higher than before. That's pretty meaningful. Just as a reminder, for those of you keeping score at home, the new Token Flex EBAs that we signed up this quarter, over 20,000, won't start to show up in accounts until next quarter.
Large enterprise deals signal that we are becoming a more strategic and essential partner to our largest customers. Our long-term vision and position as the thought leader in the industry is an essential part of their commitment to us. To summarize, Q4 provides a nice proof point that the business model transition is working for our customers, our partners and us. I couldn't be happier with the results.
Now that we've covered the past quarter, let me turn to long-term value creation. Given the short-term impact that the model transition is having -- been having on our traditional financial metrics, the recent turmoil in the stock market, growing fears about a global macroeconomic slowdown and the noise created by investors focused on the short term, I think it's worth stepping back and taking a few minutes to outline how we are creating long-term value for our shareholders. First, we are dramatically increasing the lifetime value of our customers with our new business model. While this creates short-term downward pressure on our traditional financial metrics, we have repeatedly called out how it creates significant financial returns over the next 3 to 5 years.
Second, we are simplifying our entire go-to-market strategy to align with the concept of being an all-subscription company. This involves a significant increase in our direct customer sales and marketing efforts, both at the enterprise level and through e-commerce. Not only will this change the cost structure, but it will increase -- it will greatly increase how effectively we serve our customers.
And third and most importantly, we are exploiting the cloud to deliver more compelling products to our current customers and dramatically expand the size of our market opportunities. Our early investment in cloud-based design and engineering tools have given us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead in both the construction and manufacturing software market. Mainstream mobile and cloud technologies have opened up the market with more than 100 million potential subscribers.
Thirdly, we have made substantial investments to achieve our leadership position. And let me be as clear as possible, the technology platform for the future, for all design and engineering software, really, all software is the cloud. And the company that wins will have substantial and sustainable long-term advantage.
To summarize, our framework to building long-term shareholder value is to increase the lifetime value of every customer, change our cost structure, the means by which we reach customers and, finally, build the best cloud-based products and services in the industry.
So while generalities are important, let me specifically highlight recent activity in terms of these long-term objectives. Most importantly, our business model transition is underway and exceeding expectations. By the second half of this year, we will fully be in a subscription-only mode. Customer and partner reaction to our new business model has been very positive, which gives me great confidence about our approach to the transition. Next, we continue to gauge [indiscernible] our costs. In Q4, we kept spend flat year-over-year. We recently did a sizable restructuring that balances the need for financial discipline and its ability to invest in critical initiatives that drive the long-term health of the company. In September, we've discussed annual operating expense growth of 5% to 6%. The restructuring, combined with other cost-cutting measures, has allowed us to put a significant cap on spending for the next 2 years. And we are committed to keeping spend growth roughly flat to slightly down through FY '17 and FY '18.
And finally, our cloud-based products are the undisputed leaders in their respective categories. While many people are focused on the business model shift, being in the leadership position in the cloud leads to a long-term sustainable competitive advantage. Building a great company over the long term requires balancing the interest of shareholders, employees and customers. Done well, these are not mutually exclusive. While it's easy to talk about, it's harder to do, and I'm very proud of the many awards we received that recognized our success in doing just that. A few in particular worth mentioning are we were selected for Fortune's World's 25 Best Multinational Workplaces, Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For, and we're in the top 5 of Fortune's Most Admired Software Companies. We also were given countless awards for innovation and product leadership. And bringing it all together, we are updating our long-term cash flow model. As we look to FY '20, assuming that the number of outstanding shares remains constant, we will be able to produce about $6 of free cash flow per share. In the following years, free cash flow continues to dramatically increase, and we see a path to free cash flow that exceeds $2.5 billion or more than $11 per share of free cash flow by FY '23. As you are aware, our cash flow generation this year and next will be impacted by the transition from perpetual to term-based licenses. The silver lining is that we now have an opportunity to switch to a new operating structure to support our business needs. This change will result in an increase in our U.S.-based cash while lowering our long-term tax rate. This will greatly help with the long-term structural imbalance of our ongoing revenues and cash flows as we move through the business model transition. We will give you more details during this year as our plans materialize.
As we turn to fiscal 2017, we couldn't be more excited about entering this next phase of our business. This year will be the most unique in the company's history as we complete the transition from perpetual licenses to cloud-based subscriptions at the end of Q2, but with an interesting and unique orderly pattern. None of the traditional seasonality patterns for sales metrics will be applicable nor will year-over-year growth rates of traditional financial metrics be helpful in understanding how we are performing through the transition.
Q1 will be our first quarter with only subscription offerings for individual products. We have a number of sales promotions in place to accelerate our customers' move to desktop subscription. As you think about Q1, the best results for us would be to be higher on subscriptions and lower on revenue. Now this may seem counterintuitive, but, in fact, would result from an accelerated transition to desktop subs. The end of Q2 will be the next major milestone of our business model transition as we start selling perpetual licenses for Suites. We expect the dynamics will most closely resemble what we saw in Q4 with the end-of-sale for individual products. Q3 will be our first quarter of subscription-only sales across the board and will likely experience sequential slowdown. And Q4 should begin to show more normal sales trends in our new subscription-only model. In our view, the better metrics for tracking our progress over the next few quarters will be subscription additions and ARR growth. The entire company has been realigned and is hyperfocused on subscription additions and growth in recurring revenue. We have put in place both the processes and incentives, such as new sales comp and bonus plans, to align with our goal of growing our subscription base by a 20% CAGR over the next 4 years, which will drive a 24% CAGR in ARR.
Many of you have asked about the impact of the macroeconomic environment on our business. We've said for the past several quarters that the global conditions have been uneven. Most of the emerging markets have been a mess, but most of the mature markets have been decent. As we evaluated our strong Q4 results, we didn't see any further degradation in the demand environment.
However, there is no denying there is clear divergence in sentiment with regards to global macroeconomic conditions. Coupled with the uniqueness of this year, our forecasting process has never been more challenging. As such, we believe it's prudent to take an appropriately conservative approach to our outlook for the year, while remaining confident in our ability to achieve our long-term target. For the year, we're projecting to add approximately 500,000 subscriptions, with new model subscriptions contributing the vast majority of the growth. As expected, this will be the year where the transition cost has the biggest revenue impact as we move more fully into the subscription model. 
On the earnings call last quarter, I talked about 1% to 2% spend growth through FY '17. Given that our typical annual spend increase starts at about 4% just from managing health care cost, et cetera, some cost actions were already factored into that guidance. As repeatedly about reducing our spend growth while staying the course for the investments required to make both the business model and platform transition. Examples of the investments in building out a low-cost, high-touch inside sales team, we're building out our cloud platform products. We are constantly impacted by cutting spending too much or not reducing it enough could have underway and ultimate success of the transition. We believe our current course of managing spend grew flat to modestly down for FY '17 strikes the right balance. And as I previously mentioned, we will maintain flat growth throughout FY '18 as well.
We aren't updating the entire framework we laid out at the Investor Day last September, but there are a couple of data points that should be helping you with longer-term modeling. As I said earlier, with the updates to the model overall, we see FCF per share of roughly $6 in FY '20, given our current view of top line growth and our spend trajectory. Our revenue projection for FY '17 is slightly lower than the framework we provided in September for a few reasons. Continued FX headwinds are pushing revenue down. We are assuming a higher mix of new model sub based on our recent performance. And as I mentioned earlier, we're taking a more conservative stance given all the moving parts this year.
Similar to our view in Q1, hitting the low end of our revenue range while exceeding our subscription guidance is a desirable outcome for the year. If we experienced greater-than-expected demand for the last perpetual licenses for Suites, it will likely drive revenue to the high end of guidance or beyond.
To wrap things up, we're really excited to be one step further along in the transition. Our long-term strategy will provide our customers with greater flexibility, more compelling products and a better user experience. In doing so, we're driving higher lifetime customer value, simplifying our go-to-market and significantly increasing the size of the available market. Simultaneously, we are reducing our cost structure to accelerate our transition and increase our profitability as well as evolving our operating and tax structure to better meet our future business needs. In short, we are creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business for Autodesk for the years to come. Finally, I'd like to thank all of our employees and our partners who worked so hard to make last year a success.

Most of the update to the guidance was not a change in the overall demand. So let's just put that out there, kind of assuming the same level of demand. We were pleased in Q4 to see greater demand, but no difference in demand from when we talked about the model. A lot of the upside is driven by greater cost control, so a lot has to do with some of the stuff we outlined for FY '17 and '18. And just as you roll out through the subsequent years, starting from a lower cost base has a tremendous advantage. And in a lot of ways, that's what we were responding to. Many of our investors have said, I understand the transition, I love where you're getting out on the other side. But can't you control costs a little bit better through this transition? I think in response to that, that's where we got to and that's where you see a lot of it. The other slight shift I'd say is we're more optimistic about the move to the new model. We've seen more positive signs of acceptance by both customers and partners. And remember, a little bit of our reluctance to move more quickly was making sure we had acceptance of both groups and the ability for them to successfully navigate the transition as well as us."

So despite the news that you may have read, China continues to perform well. But there are places, where our business in emerging markets has just totally tanked. So when you look at a number of these places, the Middle East, Russia, which are largely driven by oil, Brazil is bad. So you look there, when you compare geographically, our EMEA results look not as strong as the others. 2 factors there: one is EMEA had a fabulous fourth quarter last year; and the second part is really the MEA part. The E part of EMEA did great, but the MEA part just struggled and it really is due to oil and commodities and other stuff. So the geographic part is pretty simple. Don't see a big change, I think, relative to what we hear others talking about or reading in newspapers, if anyone still reads newspapers. China is better than you would expect from taking your readings. The only weak point in the developed world, no delta there, is Japan. Japan has been weak for a while, currency is an issue.

We've seen China actually be a bit of a bright spot for us in the emerging markets. And everything else, and in particular, Russia and Brazil, have really struggled year-on-year. The only other thing that stands out when you look through -- it was kind of strength across the board in Q4. And in particular, the number of large transactions that we did, the deal is greater than $1 million. It's heavily driven by our EBAs, our big enterprise business agreements. We had a very strong quarter there and, in fact, did more than a handful of 8-figure deals there. Now these are all ratable, so you don't see them all dropping in to the revenue stream in Q4, but a handful of 8-figure deals and the largest manufacturing deal we've ever done, we just got it done in Q4. So I'd say strength on the high end as well."

One of the tricks that we're kind of referencing in the forecasting is that in particular, I think we have a couple of quarters, where it's hard to know which way people will go, Q1 and Q2 in particular, but even extending into Q3. So we're doing our best job on triangulating from what we're hearing from our partners, what we're hearing from our salespeople, top-down models, extrapolation in trends. But to be honest, it's a little bit hard, and that's why we have a slightly broader range in terms of guidance and why we gave the slightly paradoxical guidance that I wouldn't mind seeing revenue down. I think I've now done something like 40 of these earnings calls at the end of the quarter, and I don't think I've ever alluded for revenue to be down, but this may be -- this is certainly a first. And so it's just different than it's ever been. And I can't highlight enough that the next 4 quarters are just going to be a little bit odd. And that's what we pointed to, and I think you are on the right point, which is look at volume. We think volume will be up. Look at ARR, there will be a number of metrics that will underlie what is really the foundation of the business doing well and for underlying demand. And then a little bit, what I think is the math that follows the whip and just as the math is ugly in the next 1.5 years, the math gets beautiful in the subsequent years. And so we'll take that as we can. But one other addition, let me just add, what our bias is, and I think strongly supported by many of our investors, is to do anything we can to transition our customers to the new model as fast as possible. So there are a number of things like this that we're doing, which again, we think could adversely affect some of our guidance on revenue but we think will also help on exceeding on subscriptions. So many of you have noticed things like promotions in Q1. I think you'll see promotions in Q1 around our new model businesses. I think you'll see the same thing in Q3. That would not be out of the question for us to do stuff like that. So a number of things, but our bias is we'd already moved up the end-of-sale date by 6 months and now we're using all the knobs and levers we have to continue to put pressure on the system to move to the new model as quickly as possible."

We've geared the entire machine from sales comp through the variable comp bonus plans that every employee has. You look at our promos, you look at the way we will point our channel partners next week at our sales kickoff event. We've geared everything for driving subs. Because the more we drive subs, and in particular, the more we drive the new model subs, ultimately, that's what builds the strength of the model and gets us to that vision of fiscal '20 that we've laid out. So ARPS to ARPS is more of a drive number. We're focused on driving subs and driving ARR. And when you divide those 2, you get ARPS. I think, if you wanted to think about it a little bit more mechanically, I'll give you 2 pointers. One is the fastest-growing piece of our desktop business, which is what's driving the new model subs as much as anything is the low end. it's the AutoCAD LT desktop subs. So that's naturally going to put downward pressure on ARPS. The second is the way we calculate ARR in a quarterly basis is we total up our recurring revenue for the quarter, multiply that by 4 and you get it annualized, and that's our ARR. And so the linearity in a given quarter will drive the ARR calculation. In other words, the more of those sales are coming late in the quarter, there's fewer revenue that actually accretes into the reported revenue for that quarter. And so you don't get to see the full effect of it until the following quarter. So there's a little bit of seasonality and linearity effect on ARR at any given quarter, but I think can also throw off your ARPS calculation."

But as Scott pointed out, our lower cost products like the LT will put pressure on it downward as well as many of the cloud subscriptions. So as we've talked about, many of those cloud subscriptions are from larger groups working together as opposed to individual design and engineering products. So things like BIM 360 and PLM 360 connects hundreds of thousands of users. And so the average cost per subscriber will be substantially lower than a designed product.

One is there's always been more of a seasonality to our large enterprise deals. Some of it is driven by the events of the year. And remember, even though one of the perks of this company is our calendar and fiscal numbering, it does give us a second close, so we not only have a customer ended the year, but our salespeople haven't ended the year, too. And so there's always been a stronger influence on Q4 because of that. The second thing is if you go back a handful of years, we had almost no enterprise licenses. That was a nonexistent part of our business, and I think we've done a number of things over the midterm to change that. One is we build out a sales force that did it. We changed the nature of some of our products to better accommodate it. We have licensing models that are more aligned with what they want to do. And I think our drive, really, to take a leadership position in the industry, whether that's what we're doing in Media and Entertainment or BIM and AECs or doing on the cloud and manufacturing has led companies to view Autodesk as a more strategic partner. Other than how many years id have to go back before I would find that a million-dollar deal in a quarter was a big deal. And now it's fairly routine. So we've invested heavily. As we detailed at Analyst Day this year and last year, we think there's a lot more there. We think the offerings coming enabled us to grow much more quickly. And what we love about it is it does have some trickle-down effect, in that all of these companies greatly affect their supply chain. So we're really excited about the enterprise business, and we're going to continue to keep investing in it. As a matter of fact, the biggest investment chain during the 2008, 2009 downturn when we recognized like our statistical run rate business was falling off and one of the places we could really invest was in the enterprise. And it was really out of ahead of that soul searching in the darkness that we really landed on this. And it's just been a continual success."

I think, again, that we set up the machine, and Amar had said that, I mean, in every part of the company to focus on driving subs. And so the easy place to track right now through this year will be to track how we grow both total subscriptions, but then more importantly, the new modeled subscriptions because that's what's going to grow the company longer-term. On cash flow, I said a couple of things. Cash flow for Q4 was artificially low. We did have -- we had very interesting linearity in the quarter, where the third month of the quarter, so January for us, saw more than half of our total sales get done. And since we build in that 30, we had a lot of -- in a normal linearity, a normal 30, 30, 40 or the normal that we have experienced in the past few years, we would have seen about $95 million more cash flow from ops fall into Q4. But given the linearity of the quarter, given those sales got done late, that's all sitting in receivables. By the way, our receivables is 100% current, so there's not -- there's no risk on that. But I'd tell you, in receivables, it will now be collected in Q1. So what it means is there's a headwind on the cash flow from ops we just reported for Q4 that will just ripple over into Q1. And if you remember what we said for cash flow, our free cash flow, back at Investor Day, we said we thought it would be breakeven to slightly negative for fiscal '17, and that now goes up by about $100 million year-on-year. So think of it being certainly positive, somewhere around that $50 million to $100 million range."

The second and probably more important thing that we're trying to accomplish with Collections is to give an incentive for the existing customers who are on maintenance for Suites, a more attractive thing to move over to. So as we said, we want to try to use the carrot as much is possible to convince our customers, our best customers, who are on maintenance subscription to move over.

It's -- I feel like I could stand on my head and talk about this and it still doesn't matter, but the really big thing we're doing is investing in the cloud and mobile, and we're trying to change the dynamics of the market. And we are continuing to invest in that, and so some of it is tied to cloud infrastructure and things like that. As you step down a level, you would see things like continued investment in our enterprise sales force, things that are working. But some of that starts to fall in the category of the regular rejiggering you do within a business. Clearly, we have less people selling in Russia than we used to and more people on major accounts. So hopefully, Stan, those gives you kind of the areas."

So I think that will be -- that will put some upward pressure on maintenance subs in the first half of the year, but then in the second half of the year, there's no new maintenance subs. And while we have a high renewal rate on maintenance, it's not 100%. So maintenance turns around and becomes, for the full year, it becomes a headwind for us on selling subscriber adds. The remainder is looking at what we think -- what we've seen this year, what we think will happen next year in terms of unit volumes and knowing that for the second half of the year, those unit volumes will all be, in some form or fashion, a subscription account. And so it's putting those 2 together and really building it bottoms-up, with the assumption on renewal rates that leads us to that midpoint."

Our revenue outlook in the out-years is still exactly what we outlined. Back to the beginning of your question, I would say, relative to September, our expenses are much lower, considerably lower, just to put -- from 5% to 6% that we said was kind of the feeling. Now we're talking about flat for the next 2 years and then moderating from there. So it's substantial. When you run the model, it has a dramatic effect, particularly having down to flat in the first few years of this transition. The revenue, we're tweaking slightly, but the revenue is not about unit demand, as we said, it's really whether people buy the new model or the old model. And all through this year, we will still have some variability, and so an inability to predict exactly what happens. The good news is as we move to the end of the year, there's only one thing that people can buy new from us. And so while -- in many ways, this is painful to go through the transition. We do hit a point, probably in the middle of next year, where 80% or 90% of the revenue in a quarter comes off the balance sheet. So if I go back to when I first started, where you started every quarter in 0, you're now going to be in a place where you start every quarter with 80% or 90% of the tank full. And that -- and so we use the word business model transition and maybe start to think that's wild, but absolutely, that's really what it means. And so our ability to predict that gets very good at that point, and your ability to model it gets very good at that point as you watch us at the ARR."

Like we said, we thought about 10% of the volume was people who were taking advantage of the last moment opportunity to buy. I think we'll see that again in Q2, maybe slightly stronger with the Suites, but I'm not convinced of that yet. But many people are finding desktop subscription as the only attractive alternative. And maybe when we started talking about this a couple of years ago, we were the tall pole in the tent or something about this. We are no longer the tall pole in the tent. The entire software industry is moving to these kinds of licensing models, and customers are just getting much more comfortable. And they understand what the benefit to them is of buying this way.

I mean, I think it's partially what I just answered is that we start -- so for example, we start building a model in which almost all of the revenue comes off the balance sheet. So just starting with that idea that quarters used to start at 0 and will now start at 80 or 90 or 95 is different. You will also be able to look at things like the churn and see the renewal rates and extrapolate from there. So to the extent that -- and we generally haven't gone out that far, but people really didn't understand the dynamic of this. And so we were just trying to put it in perspective. I mean, to the extent that you want to discount FY '23, feel free to. It's way in the future. I think the FY '20 is there. The problem we had and really the reason why we gave details around FY '23 is because FY '20 or FY '21 is still so much in the steep part of the curve. And so if we -- when we were doing that and only talking about FY '20, people were saying, is that the terminal? Is it the terminal cash flow? Is it the terminal EPS? Is it the terminal operating margin? And it wasn't. And just to the extent now that traditional financial metrics are going to go down predictably as a result of how we account for this, it's just as certain that they come up on the other side. So I'm totally fine with people wanting to discount FY '23. We just wanted to make sure that people understood that that's what our model looks like. And I think if you back off it and look, we've impressed. There are some people who think we should be able to get a lot more. There are some people who get to less. But you can then look at it in a pretty reasonable way about -- thinking about the number of subscribers. Because remember, if anything, we have been attacked for our ARPS. So there's not a lot of assumption about ARPS going up, so it really is all about subscribers and then ARR really translates directly to revenues. So put whatever discounts you want on it, Brent."

Can that 300,000 go up due to adding pirated users? It probably should go up -- you should be adding those old license users as subscriptions, but then those become renewals later in time. And so how can we think about the unit sales and the seat sales as we move along the transition?"

We've been pretty modest in our assumption. But you're right, you have the old subscribers. And remember, the definitional issue just really gets to this thing of a user could be in a different company but they have been a user before, and let's just ignore that for a second. But the old subscribers would be there. Piracy, we think, this will put a significant dent in casual piracy. And as we said the new offerings are the places where we're getting new customers. So come at this a different way. We talk about it sometimes as TAM expansion. We talk about it as new users. I referenced 100 million people in manufacturing and construction who didn't have a need for many of the tools we previously sold. We do now, whether that's BIM 360 or PLM 360. Those are new users. Those new users may be inside of existing customers or they may be in new accounts. But we didn't give you an indication. Again, many of these products are notably high. In almost all cases, the majority of the customers that are doing it are not traditional customers. The other thing that I think is really important, and I know you guys do not want to bake too much into your model, but we're running a business not a spreadsheet. And in our world, the investments we've made in going to cloud-based engineering tools has led us to have a leadership position in that. We deeply believe that the future of all software is in the cloud and in mobile and it opens up big markets. I've always believed, for people who invest in Autodesk, this is one of the fundamental tenets you should believe in. There are less difficult ways to get there, but we think the business model transition starts the curve we just talked about with Brent. But if that is going to continue into the out-years, that's based on the fact that we expand into new markets, get new users and win the platform of the future."

I kind of hesitate to do it because it's all been going so swimmingly. But I'm really just trying to avoid work for a day with Scott and I over the next couple of days and having the same conversations several dozen different times. Because I've had it in private, even as I go down to the coffee store, I get asked by all the investors in our building. And that's just a question of what's going on with our activist investors. And so I just want to take that head on and happy to talk about it privately with others, but it seems like a mistake not to address it to some degree. So let me just give you my viewpoint on this. The first thing is that I think a number of the 13D filers as well as some of the activist investors have raised legitimate concerns. And one part that kind of troubles me about it is that there are other long-term investors, really constructive investors, who have raised the same issues in a much better way. And so while we are absolutely talking to the activist investors, I think too much credit is being given to them and not enough credit is being given to our long-term investors who have asked for change in a constructive way. They've understood kind of the subtleties and complexities of running the business and they truly have taken the time to understand what the challenges and the opportunities we face. And so I feel like they're getting the short end of the stick when they've really pulled the laboring war in supporting the company over the long period. Many of my problems with sort of some of the more activist investors is that their focus is extremely short-term and somewhat simplistic. They just ignore some of the complexities of running a business. And let's just get a lighter note for a second and then I'll return to being more serious, but let me just tell you what my concern is, is that if you're going to sit on the outside and have lots of good ideas, how to do this or that thing better or why things should move more quickly, as a matter of fact, if you turn on sports radio or political talk radio, on sports radio, you can hear thousands of people who know about the coach or general manager or the owner should have done differently. And I was worried about that thing. I watched the game last night, I had a million ideas of what the coach should do, but I didn't actually have to do the job. And so in a nutshell, my concern is people who like essentially want to turn Autodesk into a Men's Wearhouse. If you look, I don't think any of the people who got involved in Men's Wearhouse intentionally meant to do damage to the company. I don't think they meant to screw it up, but I think they had some simplistic views. And what troubles me is seeing those same views expressed about our business. Actually, I got one little funny story here. I looked up Men's Wearhouse the other day, I was trying -- and they changed the name of the company and the symbol. And what I thought was interesting is changing the name makes it actually hard to track the price and how poorly it's performed. But the symbol is a little bit of a telltale sign because if you just look at it and squint, it's spelled T-U-R-D. It's actually T-L-R-D, but it's what it looks and there's probably more like it. So let me just try to end this on a more serious note. We are talking to the activists, we would like to shift the conversation to the active investors to a more constructive dialogue. There is certainly a possibility that together, we can do that. And most importantly, I just want to say thank you to our long-term shareholders who have understood what the challenges are. They're really the fantastic opportunities the company has. Thanks."

Let's start by wrapping up Q4. Then I want to take a few minutes to talk about long-term value creation for our shareholders, and then we'll end with guidance.
As you saw in the press release, we had a terrific fourth quarter, and our results demonstrated our business model transition is working. The end of the fourth quarter marked a key milestone in Autodesk's transition to our software-as-a-service business as we hit the end-of-sale date for perpetual licenses for individual products. While the end-of-sale went well, what makes our Q4 results particularly good is that they were not driven by a dramatic surge in last opportunity buy-in of perpetual licenses. In fact, our analysis suggests that only a small portion, around 10% of our Q4 unit volume, is related to end-of-sale activity. More importantly, strong subscription growth, both new model and maintenance subscriptions, and a record number of large transactions drove these results.
Our total unit volume for the fourth quarter was flat compared to the fourth quarter last year, which was a major accomplishment. Recall that in Q4 last year, we had a significant uptick in demand related to the end of our upgrade program. Said another way, we were able to cover last year's Q4 uptick in unit volume with our new model subscription offering. When we look at total unit volume for the year, we were pleased to see volume of approximately 650,000 licenses. The total of subscription additions for the quarter was better than expected at 190,000. As we've seen all year, the additions were led by new model subscriptions with strong growth in all 3 types: desktop, enterprise and cloud subscriptions.
Desktop subscription remains our fastest-growing new model subscription offering and grew nearly 300% year-over-year. More specifically, desktop subscription is thriving with our channel partners. In just the past 4 quarters, the channel volume of desktop subscription has increased by more than 400%. In Q4, approximately 65% of our desktop subscription volume came through our channel partner, which is up from less than 50% in Q4 last year.
What's still also notable is that we achieved our highest quarter for new model subs for the year and highest ever in terms of organic new model sub adds in the same quarter that we hit the end-of-sale of perpetual licenses for individual products, a remarkable achievement. For the year, we added 50% more new model subs than maintenance subs, even as maintenance attach and renewal rates moved to record highs. The growth in new model subscriptions fueled 74% constant currency growth in new model ARR. Total recurring revenue grew to 53% of revenue compared to 47% in the fourth quarter last year.
We're also pleased to see that unit volume through our e-store produced strong growth, and we believe that our online business will continue to increase meaningfully. When you add in the business we do directly with enterprise customers, our overall direct business grew to 21% of our revenue volume compared to just 17% and 16% for the past 2 years. We set a record for the number of large deals in the quarter, overall, a 19% increase in total deal [indiscernible]. The majority of these large deals were flexible enterprise licenses or EBAs, which are helping drive subscription growth. Specifically, existing enterprise customers that moved from one of our older license agreements to the newer Token Flex EBAs have resulted in subscriber growth 3x higher than before. That's pretty meaningful. Just as a reminder, for those of you keeping score at home, the new Token Flex EBAs that we signed up this quarter, over 20,000, won't start to show up in accounts until next quarter.
Large enterprise deals signal that we are becoming a more strategic and essential partner to our largest customers. Our long-term vision and position as the thought leader in the industry is an essential part of their commitment to us. To summarize, Q4 provides a nice proof point that the business model transition is working for our customers, our partners and us. I couldn't be happier with the results.
Now that we've covered the past quarter, let me turn to long-term value creation. Given the short-term impact that the model transition is having on our traditional financial metrics, the recent turmoil in the stock market, growing fears about a global macroeconomic slowdown and the noise created by investors focused on the short term, I think it's worth stepping back and taking a few minutes to outline how we are creating long-term value for our shareholders. 
First, we are dramatically increasing the lifetime value of our customers with our new business model. While this creates short-term downward pressure on our traditional financial metrics, we have repeatedly called out how it creates significant financial returns over the next 3 to 5 years.
Second, we are simplifying our entire go-to-market strategy to align with the concept of being an all-subscription company. This involves a significant increase in our direct customer sales and marketing efforts, both at the enterprise level and through e-commerce. Not only will this change the cost structure, but it will increase -- it will greatly increase how effectively we serve our customers.
And third and most importantly, we are exploiting the cloud to deliver more compelling products to our current customers and dramatically expand the size of our market opportunities. Our early investment in cloud-based design and engineering tools have given us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead in both the construction and manufacturing software market. Mainstream mobile and cloud technologies have opened up the market with more than 100 million potential subscribers.
Thirdly, we have made substantial investments to achieve our leadership position. And let me be as clear as possible, the technology platform for the future, for all design and engineering software -- no, really, all software is the cloud. And the company that wins will have substantial and sustainable long-term advantages.
To summarize, our framework to building long-term shareholder value is to increase the lifetime value of every customer, change our cost structure, the means by which we reach customers and, finally, build the best cloud-based products and services in the industry.
So while generalities are important, let me specifically highlight recent activity in terms of these long-term objectives. Most importantly, our business model transition is underway and exceeding expectations. By the second half of this year, we will fully be in a subscription-only mode. Customer and partner reaction to our new business model has been very positive, which gives me great confidence about our approach to the transition. 
Next, we continue to gauge and control our costs. In Q4, we kept spend flat year-over-year. We recently did a sizable restructuring that balances the need for financial discipline and its ability to invest in critical initiatives that drive the long-term health of the company. In September, we discussed annual operating expense growth of 5% to 6%. The restructuring, combined with other cost-cutting measures, has allowed us to put a significant cap on spending for the next few years. And we are committed to keeping spend growth roughly flat to slightly down through FY '17 and FY '18.
And finally, our cloud-based products are the undisputed leaders in their respective categories. While many people are focused on the business model shift, we need a leadership position in the cloud that leads to a long-term sustainable competitive advantage. 
Building a great company over the long term requires balancing the interests of shareholders, employees and customers. Done well, these are not mutually exclusive. While it's easy to talk about, it's harder to do, and I'm very proud of the many awards we received that recognize our success in doing just that. A few in particular worth mentioning are: we were selected for Fortune's World's 25 Best Multinational Workplaces; Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For; and we're in the top 5 of Fortune's Most Admired Software Companies. We also were given countless awards for innovation and product leadership. 
Now bringing it all together, we are updating our long-term cash flow model. As we look to FY '20, assuming that the number of outstanding shares remains constant, we will be able to produce about $6 of free cash flow per share. In the following years, free cash flow continues to dramatically increase, and we see a path to free cash flow that exceeds $2.5 billion or more than $11 per share of free cash flow by FY '23. As you are aware, our cash flow generation this year and next will be impacted by the transition from perpetual to term-based licenses. The silver lining is that we now have an opportunity to switch to a new operating structure to support our business needs. This change will result in an increase in our U.S.-based cash while lowering our long-term tax rate. This will greatly help with the long-term structural imbalance of ongoing revenues and cash flows as we move through the business model transition. We will give you more details during this year as our plans materialize.
As we turn to fiscal 2017, we couldn't be more excited about entering this next phase of our business. This year will be the most unique in the company's history as we complete the transition from perpetual licenses to cloud-based subscriptions at the end of Q2. It will be an interesting and unique quarterly pattern. None of the traditional seasonality patterns for sales metrics will be applicable, nor will year-over-year growth rates of traditional financial metrics be helpful in understanding how we are performing through the transition.
Q1 will be our first quarter with only subscription offerings for individual products. We have a number of sales promotions in place to accelerate our customers' move to desktop subscriptions. As you think about Q1, the best result for us would be to be higher on subscriptions and lower on revenue. Now this may seem counterintuitive, but, in fact, would result from an accelerated transition to desktop subs. The end of Q2 will be the next major milestone of our business model transition as we stop selling perpetual licenses for Suites. We expect the dynamics will most closely resemble what we saw in Q4 with the end-of-sale for individual products. Q3 will be our first quarter of subscription-only sales across the board and we'll likely experience sequential slowdown. And Q4 should begin to show more normal sales trends in our new subscription-only model. In our view, the better metrics for tracking our progress over the next few quarters will be subscription additions and ARR growth. The entire company has been realigned and is hyper focused on subscription additions and growth in recurring revenue. We have put in place both the processes and incentives, such as new sales comp and bonus plans, to align with our goal of growing our subscription base by a 20% CAGR over the next 4 years, which will drive a 24% CAGR in ARR.
Many of you have asked about the impact of the macroeconomic environment on our business. We've said for the past several quarters that the global conditions have been uneven. Most of the emerging markets have been a mess, but most of the mature markets have been decent. As we evaluated our strong Q4 results, we didn't see any further degradation in the demand environment.
However, there is no denying there is clear divergence in sentiment with regards to global macroeconomic conditions. Coupled with the uniqueness of this year, our forecasting process has never been more challenging. As such, we believe it's prudent to take an appropriately conservative approach to our outlook for the year, while remaining confident in our ability to achieve our long-term target. For the year, we're projecting to add approximately 500,000 subscriptions, with new model subscriptions contributing the vast majority of the growth. As expected, this will be the year where the transition causes the biggest revenue impact as we move more fully into the subscription model. 
On the earnings call last quarter, I talked about 1% to 2% spend growth through FY '17. Given that our typical annual spend increase starts at about 4% just from rising health care costs, et cetera, some cost actions were already factored into that guidance. I've spoken repeatedly about reducing our spend growth while staying the course for the investments required to make both the business model and platform transitions. Examples of the investments in building out a low-cost, high-touch inside sales team, we're building out our cloud platform products. We are conscious of the impact that cutting spending too much or not reducing it enough could have on the rates and ultimate success of the transition. We believe our current course of managing spend growth flat to modestly down for FY '17 strikes the right balance. And as I previously mentioned, we will maintain flat growth throughout FY '18 as well.
We aren't updating the entire framework we laid out at the Investor Day last September, but there are a couple of data points that should be helping you with longer-term modeling. As I said earlier, with the updates to the model overall, we see FCF per share of roughly $6 in FY '20, given our current view of top line growth and our spend trajectory. Our revenue projection for FY '17 is slightly lower than the framework we provided in September for a few reasons. Continued FX headwinds are pushing revenue down. We are assuming a higher mix of new model subs based on our recent performance. And as I mentioned earlier, we're taking a more conservative stance given all the moving parts this year.
Similar to our view on Q1, hitting the low end of our revenue range while exceeding our subscription guidance is a desirable outcome for the year. If we experience greater-than-expected demand for the last perpetual licenses for Suites, it will likely drive revenue to the high end of guidance or beyond.
To wrap things up, we're really excited to be one step further along in the transition. Our long-term strategy will provide our customers with greater flexibility, more compelling products and a better user experience. In doing so, we're driving higher lifetime customer value, simplifying our go-to-market and significantly increasing the size of the available market. Simultaneously, we are reducing our cost structure to accelerate our transition and increase our profitability as well as evolving our operating and tax structure to better meet our future business needs. In short, we are creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business for Autodesk for the years to come.

Most of the update to the guidance was not a change in the overall demand. So let's just put that out there, kind of assuming the same level of demand. We were pleased in Q4 to see greater demand, but no difference in demand from when we talked about the model. A lot of the upside is driven by greater cost control, so a lot has to do with some of the stuff we outlined for FY '17 and '18. And it's just as you roll that through the subsequent years, starting from a lower cost base has a tremendous advantage. And in a lot of ways, that's what we were responding to. Many of our investors have said, I understand the transition, I love to where you're getting on the other side. But can't you control costs a little bit better through this transition? I think in response to that, that's where we got to and that's where you see a lot of it. The other slight shift I'd say is we're more optimistic about the move to the new model. We've seen more positive signs of acceptance by both customers and partners. And remember, a little bit of our reluctance to move more quickly was making sure we had acceptance of both groups and the ability for them to successfully navigate the transition as well as us."

So despite the news that you may have read, China continues to perform well. But there are places, where our business in emerging markets has just totally tanked. So when you look at a number of these places, the Middle East, Russia, which are largely driven by oil -- Brazil is bad. So you look there, when you compare geographically, our EMEA results look not as strong as the others. Two factors there: one is EMEA had a fabulous fourth quarter last year; and the second part is really the MEA part. The E part of EMEA did great, but the MEA part just struggled and it really is due to oil and commodities and other stuff. So the geographic part is pretty simple. Don't see a big change, I think, relative to what we hear others talking about or reading in newspapers, if anyone still reads newspapers. China is better than you would expect from taking your readings. The only weak point in the developed world, no delta there, is Japan. Japan has been weak for a while, currency is an issue. But generally, we saw kind of flat demand. Across the markets -- both construction and manufacturing and on Media and Entertainment were all good, and there wasn't a lot of difference across that I would point to. We'll call out any trends that we're seeing that we're projecting into the future."

The only other thing that stands out when you look through -- it was kind of strength across the board in Q4. And in particular, the number of large transactions that we did, the deal is greater than $1 million. It's heavily driven by our EBAs, our big enterprise business agreements. We had a very strong quarter there and, in fact, did more than a handful of 8-figure deals there. Now these are all ratable, so you don't see them all dropping in to the revenue stream in Q4, but a handful of 8-figure deals and the largest manufacturing deal we've ever done, we just got it done in Q4. So I'd say strength on the high end as well."

One of the tricks that we're kind of referencing in the forecasting is that in particular, I think we have a couple of quarters, where it's hard to know which way people will go, Q1 and Q2 in particular, but even extending into Q3. So we're doing our best job on triangulating from what we're hearing from our partners, what we're hearing from our salespeople, top-down models, extrapolation in trends. But to be honest, it's a little bit hard, and that's why we have a slightly broader range in terms of guidance and why we gave the slightly paradoxical guidance that I wouldn't mind seeing revenue down. I think I've now done something like 40 of these earnings calls at the end of the quarter, and I don't think I've ever rooted for revenue to be down, but this may be -- this is certainly a first. And so it's just different than it's ever been. And I can't highlight enough that the next 4 quarters are just going to be a little bit odd. And that's why we've pointed to, and I think you are on the right point, which is look at volume. We think volume will be up. Look at ARR, there will be a number of metrics that will underlie what is really the foundation of the business doing well and for underlying demand. And then a little bit, which I think is the math that follows the will [ph] and just as the math is ugly in the next 1.5 years, the math gets beautiful in the subsequent years. And so we'll take that as we can. But one other addition, let me just add, what our bias is, and I think strongly supported by many of our investors, is to do anything we can to transition our customers to the new model as fast as possible. So there are a number of things like this that we're doing, which again, we think could adversely affect some of our guidance on revenue but we think will also help on exceeding on subscriptions. So many of you have noticed things like promotions in Q1. I think you'll see promotions in Q1 around our new model businesses. I think you'll see the same thing in Q3. It would not be out of the question for us to do stuff like that. So a number of things, but our bias is we'd already moved up the end-of-sale date by 6 months and now we're using all the knobs and levers we have to continue to put pressure on the system to move to the new model as quickly as possible."

We've geared the entire machine from sales comp through the variable comp bonus plans that every employee has. You look at our promos, you look at the way we will point our channel partners next week at our sales kickoff event. We've geared everything toward driving subs. Because the more we drive subs, and in particular, the more we drive the new model subs, ultimately, that's what builds the strength of the model and gets us to that vision of fiscal '20 that we've laid out. So ARPS to ARPS is more of a drive number. We're focused on driving subs and driving ARR. And when you divide those 2, you get ARPS. I think, if you wanted to think about it a little bit more mechanically, I would give you 2 pointers. One is the fastest-growing piece of our desktop business, which is what's driving the new model subs as much as anything is the low end. It's the AutoCAD LT desktop subs. So that's naturally going to put downward pressure on ARPS. The second is the way we calculate ARR on a quarterly basis is we total up our recurring revenue for the quarter, multiply that by 4 and you get it annualized, and that's our ARR. And so the linearity in a given quarter will drive the ARR calculation. In other words, the more of those sales that come in late in the quarter, there's fewer revenue that actually accretes into the reported revenue for that quarter. And so you don't get to see the full effect of it until the following quarter. So there's a little bit of seasonality and linearity effect on ARR at any given quarter, but I think can also throw off your ARPS calculation."

But as Scott pointed out, our lower cost products like the LT will put pressure on it downward as well as many of the cloud subscriptions. So as we've talked about, many of those cloud subscriptions are from larger groups working together as opposed to the individual design and engineering products. So things like BIM 360 and PLM 360 connects hundreds of thousands of users. And so the average cost per subscriber will be substantially lower than a designed product.

One is there's always been more of a seasonality to our large enterprise deals. Some of it is driven by their end of year. And remember, even though one of the perks of this company is our calendar and fiscal numbering, it does give us a second close, so we not only have a customer end of the year, but our salespeople have an end to the year, too. And so there's always been a stronger influence on Q4 because of that. The second thing is if you go back a handful of years, we had almost no enterprise licenses. That was a nonexistent part of our business, and I think we've done a number of things over the midterm to change that. One is, we built out a sales force that did it. We changed the nature of some of our products to better accommodate it. We have licensing models that are more aligned with what they want to do. And I think our drive, really, to take a leadership position in the industry, whether that's what we're doing in Media and Entertainment or with BIM and AEC or doing on the cloud in manufacturing, has led companies to view Autodesk as a more strategic partner. I don't know how many years I'd have to go back before I would find that a million-dollar deal in a quarter was a big deal. And now it's fairly routine. So we've invested heavily. As we detailed at Analyst Day this year and last year, we think there's a lot more there. We think the offerings coming enabled us to grow much more quickly. And what we love about it is it does have some trickle-down effect, in that all of these companies greatly affect their supply chain. So we're really excited about the enterprise business, and we're going to continue to keep investing in it. As a matter of fact, the biggest investment came during the 2008, 2009 downturn when we recognized like our statistical run rate business was falling off and one of the places we could really invest was in the enterprise. And it was really out of, kind of, that soul searching in the darkness that we really landed on this. And it's just been a continual success."

And so the easy place to track right now through this year will be to track how we grow both total subscriptions, but then more importantly, the new model subscriptions because that's what's going to grow the company longer-term. On cash flow, I said a couple of things. Cash flow for Q4 was artificially low. We did have -- we had very interesting linearity in the quarter, where the third month of the quarter, so January for us, saw more than half of our total sales get done. And since we bill net-30, we had a lot of -- in a normal linearity, a normal 30, 30, 40 or the normal that we have experienced in the past few years, we would have seen about $95 million more cash flow from ops fall into Q4. But given the linearity of the quarter, given those sales got done late, that's all sitting in receivables. By the way, our receivables is 100% current, so there's not -- there's no risk on that. But it's sitting in receivables and it will now be collected in Q1. So what it means is there's a headwind on the cash flow from ops we just reported for Q4 that will just ripple over into Q1. And if you remember what we said for cash flow, our free cash flow, back at Investor Day, we said we thought it would be breakeven to slightly negative for fiscal '17, and that now goes up by about $100 million year-on-year.

I don't think our -- any of our financial guidance is just predicated on what we're going to do with Collections, but we can think about it a lot. We would really like to simplify the offering for a whole number of operational reasons. It's incredibly important that we do that. The second and probably more important thing that we're trying to accomplish with Collections is to give an incentive for the existing customers who are on maintenance for Suites, a more attractive thing to move over to. So as we said, we want to try to use the carrot as much is possible to convince our customers, our best customers, who are on maintenance subscriptions to move over. And that's what we're really looking to do. At the same time, it is a great way to simplify our product portfolio. So we're going to use it for both those things. I think it will be important and we'll kind of get a better read on it as we go through the year, but a lot of the financial modeling that we've been talking about so far this afternoon is really predicated on overall volume. And we're not assuming any kind of outsized performance from Collections."

I don't think we've hit 20% yet, so we're somewhere in that 10% to 20%. I don't have a more precise number at this point, but I mean, there's still a lot of room to grow. And what's particularly good about this business, the growth in the business is just not the number of accounts, it's the growth within the accounts that's been so substantial. So it's not like we signed an EBA, and in the end [ph], remember, there's a consumption-based aspect to this as well. And we kind of detailed why we think it's a win-win. And so the existing EBAs continue to grow, and we have more than 80% of our large customers are still not on these flexible licenses. The last part, just to tie both your questions together, Jay, is essentially Collections is a form of flexible licensing for smaller customers that can be sold through the channel. So what we really want to do is use the patterns, just see the model that's worked so well for the enterprise and bring it to small and medium businesses and allow our partners to sell more flexible consumption-based licenses as well."

As you step down a level, you would see things like continued investment in our enterprise sales force, things that are working.

So I think that will be -- that will put some upward pressure on maintenance subs in the first half of the year, but then in the second half of the year, there's no new maintenance subs. And while we have a high renewal rate on maintenance, it's not 100%. So maintenance turns around and becomes, for the full year, it becomes a headwind for us on selling subscriber adds. The remainder is looking at what we think -- what we've seen this year, what we think will happen next year in terms of unit volumes and knowing that for the second half of the year, those unit volumes will all be, in some form or fashion, a subscription account.

Our revenue outlook in the out-years is still exactly what we outlined. Back to the beginning of your question, I would say, relative to September, our expenses are much lower, considerably lower, just to put -- from 5% to 6% that we said was kind of the feeling. Now we're talking about flat for the next 2 years and then moderating from there. So it's substantial. I mean, you run the model, it has a dramatic effect, particularly having down to flat in the first few years of this transition. The revenue, we're tweaking slightly, but the revenue is not about unit demand, as we said, it's really whether people buy the new model or the old model. And all through this year, we will still have some variability, and so an inability to predict exactly what happens. The good news is, we move to the end of the year, there's only one thing that people can buy new from us. And so while -- in many ways, this is painful to go through the transition. We do hit a point, probably in the middle of next year, where 80% or 90% of the revenue in a quarter comes off the balance sheet. So if I go back to when I first started, where you started every quarter in 0, you're now going to be in a place where you start every quarter with 80% or 90% of the tank full. And that -- and so we use the word business model transition and maybe [indiscernible], but absolutely, that's really what it means. And so our ability to predict that gets very good at that point, and your ability to model it gets very good at that point as you watch us add the ARR."

I think we'll see that again in Q2, maybe slightly stronger with the Suites, but I'm not convinced of that yet. But many people are finding desktop subscription as the only attractive alternative. And maybe when we started talking about this a couple of years ago, we were the tall pole in the tent or something about this. We are no longer the tall pole in the tent.

It has such a huge impact on free cash flow when you take these 90-day snapshots. If we just talked about the linearity of Q4, which was a strong quarter from any dimension, but because of the linearity, we saw a lot of the sales that came in, in Q4, come into that third month and depressed our recorded cash -- free cash flows for Q4 by about $95 million, which now have shifted from Q4 and into Q1. So I think that with linearity being such a large variable there, it's really hard to say if this quarter definitively is going to be the bottom. But think of it as happening in fiscal '17 from a free cash flow standpoint, and then from an accumulated cash standpoint, think of that as fiscal '18."

I mean, I think it's partially what I just answered is that we start -- so for example, we start building a model in which almost all of the revenue comes off the balance sheet. So just starting with that idea that quarters used to start at 0 and will now start at 80 or 90 or 95 is different. You will also be able to look at things like the churn and see the renewal rates and extrapolate from there. So to the extent that -- and we generally haven't gone out that far, but people really didn't understand the dynamic of this. And so we were just trying to put it in perspective. I mean, to the extent that you want to discount FY '23, feel free to. It's way in the future. I think the FY '20 is there. The problem we had and really the reason why we gave details around FY '23 is because FY '20 or FY '21 is still so much in the steep part of the curve. And so if we -- when we were doing that and only talking about FY '20, people were saying, is that the terminal? Is it the terminal cash flow? Is it the terminal EPS? Is it the terminal operating margin? And it wasn't. And just to the extent now that traditional financial metrics are going to go down predictably as a result of how we account for this, it's just as certain that they come up on the other side. So I'm totally fine with people wanting to discount FY '23. We just wanted to make sure that people understood that, that's what our model looks like. And I think if you back off it and look, we've impressed. There are some people who think we should be able to get a lot more. There are some people who get to less. But you can then look at it in a pretty reasonable way about -- thinking about the number of subscribers. Because remember, if anything, we have been attacked for our ARPS. So there's not a lot of assumption about the ARPS going up, so it really is all about subscribers and then ARR really translates directly to revenues. So put whatever discounts you want on it, Brent."

Can that 300k go up due to adding pirated users? It probably should go up -- you should be adding those old license users as subscriptions, but then those become renewals later in time.

We've been pretty modest in our assumption. But you're right, you have the old subscribers. And remember, the definitional issue just really gets to this thing of a user could be in a different company but they have been a user before, and let's just ignore that for a second. But the old subscribers would be there. Piracy, we think, this will put a significant dent in casual piracy. And as we said the new offerings are the places where we're getting new customers. So come at this a different way. We talk about it sometimes as TAM expansion. We talk about it as new users. I referenced 100 million people in manufacturing and construction who didn't have a need for many of the tools we previously sold, but they do now, whether that's BIM 360 or PLM 360. Those are new users. Those new users may be inside of existing customers or they may be in new accounts. But we didn't give you an indication. Many of these products are relatively high. In almost all cases, the majority of the customers that are doing it are not traditional customers. The other thing that I think is really important, and I know you guys do not want to bake too much into your model, but we're running a business not a spreadsheet. And in our world, the investments we've made in going to cloud-based engineering tools has led us to have a leadership position in that. We deeply believe that the future of all software is in the cloud and in mobile and it opens up big markets. I've always believed, for people who invest in Autodesk, this is one of the fundamental tenets you should believe in. There are less difficult ways to get there, but we think the business model transition starts the curve we just talked about with Brent. But if that is going to continue into the out-years, that's based on the fact that we expand into new markets, get new users and win the platform of the future."

I kind of hesitate to do it because it's all been going so swimmingly. But I'm really just trying to avoid work for dinging Scott and I over the next couple of days in having the same conversations several dozen different times. Because I've had it in private, even as I go down to the coffee store, I get asked by all the investors in our building. And that's just a question of what's going on with our activist investors. And so I just want to take that head on and happy to talk about it privately with others, but it seems like a mistake not to address it to some degree. So let me just give you my viewpoint on this. The first thing is that I think a number of the 13D filers as well as some of the activist investors have raised legitimate concerns. And one part that kind of troubles me about it is that there are other long-term investors, really constructive investors, who have raised the same issues in a much better way. And so while we are absolutely talking to the activist investors, I think too much credit is being given to them and not enough credit is being given to our long-term investors who have asked for change in a constructive way. They've understood kind of the subtleties and complexities of running the business and they truly have taken the time to understand what the challenges and the opportunities we face. And so I feel like they're getting the short end of the stick when they've really pulled the laboring war [ph] in supporting the company over the long period. Many of my problems with sort of some of the more activist investors is that their focus is extremely short-term and somewhat simplistic. They just ignore some of the complexities of running a business. And let's just get a lighter note for a second and then I'll return to being more serious, but let me just tell you what my concern is, because it's easy to sit on the outside and have lots of good ideas, how to do this or that thing better or why things should move more quickly. As a matter of fact, if you turn on sports radio or political talk radio, on sports radio, you can hear thousands of people who know what the coach or general manager or the owner should have done differently. And I'm worried about that [indiscernible]. I watched the game last night, I had a million ideas of what the coach should do, but I didn't actually have to do the job. And so in a nutshell, my concern is people who like essentially want to turn Autodesk into Men's Wearhouse. If you look, I don't think any of the people who got involved in Men's Wearhouse intentionally meant to do damage to the company. I don't think they meant to screw it up, but I think they had some simplistic views. And what troubles me is seeing those same views expressed about our business. Actually, I got one little funny story here. I looked up Men's Wearhouse the other day, I was trying -- and they changed the name of the company and the symbol. And what I thought was interesting is changing the name makes it actually hard to track the price and how poorly it's performed. But the symbol is a little bit of a telltale sign because if you just look at it and squint, it's spelled T-U-R-D. It's actually T-L-R-D, but it's what it looks and there's probably more like it. So let me just try to end this on a more serious note. We are talking to the activists, we would like to shift the conversation to the active investors to a more constructive dialogue. There is certainly a possibility that together, we can do that. And most importantly, I just want to say thank you to our long-term shareholders who have understood what the challenges are. They're really the fantastic opportunities the company has. Thanks."

Let's start by wrapping up Q4. Then I want to take a few minutes to talk about long-term value creation for our shareholders, and then we'll end with guidance.
As you saw in the press release, we had a terrific fourth quarter, and our results demonstrated our business model transition is working. The end of the fourth quarter marked a key milestone in Autodesk's transition to our software-as-a-service business as we hit the end-of-sale date for perpetual licenses for individual products. While the end-of-sale went well, what makes our Q4 results particularly good is that they were not driven by a dramatic surge in last opportunity buy-in of perpetual licenses. In fact, our analysis suggests that only a small portion, around 10% of our Q4 unit volume, is related to end-of-sale activity. More importantly, strong subscription growth, both new model and maintenance subscriptions, and a record number of large transactions drove these results.
Our total unit volume for the fourth quarter was flat compared to the fourth quarter last year, which was a major accomplishment. Recall that in Q4 last year, we had a significant uptick in demand related to the end of our upgrade program. Said another way, we were able to cover last year's Q4 uptick in unit volume with our new model subscription offering. When we look at total unit volume for the year, we were pleased to see volume of approximately 650,000 licenses. The total of subscription additions for the quarter was better than expected at 190,000. As we've seen all year, the additions were led by new model subscriptions with strong growth in all 3 types: desktop, enterprise and cloud subscriptions.
Desktop subscription remains our fastest-growing new model subscription offering and grew nearly 300% year-over-year. More specifically, desktop subscription is thriving with our channel partners. In just the past 4 quarters, the channel volume of desktop subscription has increased by more than 400%. In Q4, approximately 65% of our desktop subscription volume came through our channel partner, which is up from less than 50% in Q4 last year.
What's still also notable is that we achieved our highest quarter for new model subs for the year and highest ever in terms of organic new model sub adds in the same quarter that we hit the end-of-sale of perpetual licenses for individual products, a remarkable achievement. For the year, we added 50% more new model subs than maintenance subs, even as maintenance attach and renewal rates moved to record highs. The growth in new model subscriptions fueled 74% constant currency growth in new model ARR. Total recurring revenue grew to 53% of revenue compared to 47% in the fourth quarter last year.
We're also pleased to see that unit volume through our e-store produced strong growth, and we believe that our online business will continue to increase meaningfully. When you add in the business we do directly with enterprise customers, our overall direct business grew to 21% of our revenue volume compared to just 17% and 16% for the past 2 years. We set a record for the number of large deals in the quarter, overall, a 19% increase in total deal [indiscernible]. The majority of these large deals were flexible enterprise licenses or EBAs, which are helping drive subscription growth. Specifically, existing enterprise customers that moved from one of our older license agreements to the newer Token Flex EBAs have resulted in subscriber growth 3x higher than before. That's pretty meaningful. Just as a reminder, for those of you keeping score at home, the new Token Flex EBAs that we signed up this quarter, over 20,000, won't start to show up in accounts until next quarter.
Large enterprise deals signal that we are becoming a more strategic and essential partner to our largest customers. Our long-term vision and position as the thought leader in the industry is an essential part of their commitment to us. To summarize, Q4 provides a nice proof point that the business model transition is working for our customers, our partners and us. I couldn't be happier with the results.
Now that we've covered the past quarter, let me turn to long-term value creation. Given the short-term impact that the model transition is having on our traditional financial metrics, the recent turmoil in the stock market, growing fears about a global macroeconomic slowdown and the noise created by investors focused on the short term, I think it's worth stepping back and taking a few minutes to outline how we are creating long-term value for our shareholders. 
First, we are dramatically increasing the lifetime value of our customers with our new business model. While this creates short-term downward pressure on our traditional financial metrics, we have repeatedly called out how it creates significant financial returns over the next 3 to 5 years.
Second, we are simplifying our entire go-to-market strategy to align with the concept of being an all-subscription company. This involves a significant increase in our direct customer sales and marketing efforts, both at the enterprise level and through e-commerce. Not only will this change the cost structure, but it will increase -- it will greatly increase how effectively we serve our customers.
And third and most importantly, we are exploiting the cloud to deliver more compelling products to our current customers and dramatically expand the size of our market opportunities. Our early investment in cloud-based design and engineering tools have given us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead in both the construction and manufacturing software market. Mainstream mobile and cloud technologies have opened up the market with more than 100 million potential subscribers.
Thirdly, we have made substantial investments to achieve our leadership position. And let me be as clear as possible, the technology platform for the future, for all design and engineering software -- no, really, all software is the cloud. And the company that wins will have substantial and sustainable long-term advantages.
To summarize, our framework to building long-term shareholder value is to increase the lifetime value of every customer, change our cost structure, the means by which we reach customers and, finally, build the best cloud-based products and services in the industry.
So while generalities are important, let me specifically highlight recent activity in terms of these long-term objectives. Most importantly, our business model transition is underway and exceeding expectations. By the second half of this year, we will fully be in a subscription-only mode. Customer and partner reaction to our new business model has been very positive, which gives me great confidence about our approach to the transition. 
Next, we continue to gauge and control our costs. In Q4, we kept spend flat year-over-year. We recently did a sizable restructuring that balances the need for financial discipline and its ability to invest in critical initiatives that drive the long-term health of the company. In September, we discussed annual operating expense growth of 5% to 6%. The restructuring, combined with other cost-cutting measures, has allowed us to put a significant cap on spending for the next few years. And we are committed to keeping spend growth roughly flat to slightly down through FY '17 and FY '18.
And finally, our cloud-based products are the undisputed leaders in their respective categories. While many people are focused on the business model shift, we need a leadership position in the cloud that leads to a long-term sustainable competitive advantage. 
Building a great company over the long term requires balancing the interests of shareholders, employees and customers. Done well, these are not mutually exclusive. While it's easy to talk about, it's harder to do, and I'm very proud of the many awards we received that recognize our success in doing just that. A few in particular worth mentioning are: we were selected for Fortune's World's 25 Best Multinational Workplaces; Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For; and we're in the top 5 of Fortune's Most Admired Software Companies. We also were given countless awards for innovation and product leadership. 
Now bringing it all together, we are updating our long-term cash flow model. As we look to FY '20, assuming that the number of outstanding shares remains constant, we will be able to produce about $6 of free cash flow per share. In the following years, free cash flow continues to dramatically increase, and we see a path to free cash flow that exceeds $2.5 billion or more than $11 per share of free cash flow by FY '23. As you are aware, our cash flow generation this year and next will be impacted by the transition from perpetual to term-based licenses. The silver lining is that we now have an opportunity to switch to a new operating structure to support our business needs. This change will result in an increase in our U.S.-based cash while lowering our long-term tax rate. This will greatly help with the long-term structural imbalance of ongoing revenues and cash flows as we move through the business model transition. We will give you more details during this year as our plans materialize.
As we turn to fiscal 2017, we couldn't be more excited about entering this next phase of our business. This year will be the most unique in the company's history as we complete the transition from perpetual licenses to cloud-based subscriptions at the end of Q2. It will be an interesting and unique quarterly pattern. None of the traditional seasonality patterns for sales metrics will be applicable, nor will year-over-year growth rates of traditional financial metrics be helpful in understanding how we are performing through the transition.
Q1 will be our first quarter with only subscription offerings for individual products. We have a number of sales promotions in place to accelerate our customers' move to desktop subscriptions. As you think about Q1, the best result for us would be to be higher on subscriptions and lower on revenue. Now this may seem counterintuitive, but, in fact, would result from an accelerated transition to desktop subs. The end of Q2 will be the next major milestone of our business model transition as we stop selling perpetual licenses for Suites. We expect the dynamics will most closely resemble what we saw in Q4 with the end-of-sale for individual products. Q3 will be our first quarter of subscription-only sales across the board and we'll likely experience sequential slowdown. And Q4 should begin to show more normal sales trends in our new subscription-only model. In our view, the better metrics for tracking our progress over the next few quarters will be subscription additions and ARR growth. The entire company has been realigned and is hyper focused on subscription additions and growth in recurring revenue. We have put in place both the processes and incentives, such as new sales comp and bonus plans, to align with our goal of growing our subscription base by a 20% CAGR over the next 4 years, which will drive a 24% CAGR in ARR.
Many of you have asked about the impact of the macroeconomic environment on our business. We've said for the past several quarters that the global conditions have been uneven. Most of the emerging markets have been a mess, but most of the mature markets have been decent. As we evaluated our strong Q4 results, we didn't see any further degradation in the demand environment.
However, there is no denying there is clear divergence in sentiment with regards to global macroeconomic conditions. Coupled with the uniqueness of this year, our forecasting process has never been more challenging. As such, we believe it's prudent to take an appropriately conservative approach to our outlook for the year, while remaining confident in our ability to achieve our long-term target. For the year, we're projecting to add approximately 500,000 subscriptions, with new model subscriptions contributing the vast majority of the growth. As expected, this will be the year where the transition causes the biggest revenue impact as we move more fully into the subscription model. 
On the earnings call last quarter, I talked about 1% to 2% spend growth through FY '17. Given that our typical annual spend increase starts at about 4% just from rising health care costs, et cetera, some cost actions were already factored into that guidance. I've spoken repeatedly about reducing our spend growth while staying the course for the investments required to make both the business model and platform transitions. Examples of the investments in building out a low-cost, high-touch inside sales team, we're building out our cloud platform products. We are conscious of the impact that cutting spending too much or not reducing it enough could have on the rates and ultimate success of the transition. We believe our current course of managing spend growth flat to modestly down for FY '17 strikes the right balance. And as I previously mentioned, we will maintain flat growth throughout FY '18 as well.
We aren't updating the entire framework we laid out at the Investor Day last September, but there are a couple of data points that should be helping you with longer-term modeling. As I said earlier, with the updates to the model overall, we see FCF per share of roughly $6 in FY '20, given our current view of top line growth and our spend trajectory. Our revenue projection for FY '17 is slightly lower than the framework we provided in September for a few reasons. Continued FX headwinds are pushing revenue down. We are assuming a higher mix of new model subs based on our recent performance. And as I mentioned earlier, we're taking a more conservative stance given all the moving parts this year.
Similar to our view on Q1, hitting the low end of our revenue range while exceeding our subscription guidance is a desirable outcome for the year. If we experience greater-than-expected demand for the last perpetual licenses for Suites, it will likely drive revenue to the high end of guidance or beyond.
To wrap things up, we're really excited to be one step further along in the transition. Our long-term strategy will provide our customers with greater flexibility, more compelling products and a better user experience. In doing so, we're driving higher lifetime customer value, simplifying our go-to-market and significantly increasing the size of the available market. Simultaneously, we are reducing our cost structure to accelerate our transition and increase our profitability as well as evolving our operating and tax structure to better meet our future business needs. In short, we are creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business for Autodesk for the years to come. Finally, I'd like to thank all of our employees and our partners who worked so hard to make last year a success.

Most of the update to the guidance was not a change in the overall demand. So let's just put that out there, kind of assuming the same level of demand. We were pleased in Q4 to see greater demand, but no difference in demand from when we talked about the model. A lot of the upside is driven by greater cost control, so a lot has to do with some of the stuff we outlined for FY '17 and '18. And it's just as you roll that through the subsequent years, starting from a lower cost base has a tremendous advantage. And in a lot of ways, that's what we were responding to. Many of our investors have said, I understand the transition, I love to where you're getting on the other side. But can't you control costs a little bit better through this transition? I think in response to that, that's where we got to and that's where you see a lot of it. The other slight shift I'd say is we're more optimistic about the move to the new model. We've seen more positive signs of acceptance by both customers and partners. And remember, a little bit of our reluctance to move more quickly was making sure we had acceptance of both groups and the ability for them to successfully navigate the transition as well as us."

And it's probably a good 4 to 5 points higher than that, given what we've just talked about in spend."

So despite the news that you may have read, China continues to perform well. But there are places, where our business in emerging markets has just totally tanked. So when you look at a number of these places, the Middle East, Russia, which are largely driven by oil -- Brazil is bad. So you look there, when you compare geographically, our EMEA results look not as strong as the others. Two factors there: one is EMEA had a fabulous fourth quarter last year; and the second part is really the MEA part. The E part of EMEA did great, but the MEA part just struggled and it really is due to oil and commodities and other stuff. So the geographic part is pretty simple. Don't see a big change, I think, relative to what we hear others talking about or reading in newspapers, if anyone still reads newspapers. China is better than you would expect from taking your readings. The only weak point in the developed world, no delta there, is Japan. Japan has been weak for a while, currency is an issue. But generally, we saw kind of flat demand. Across the markets -- both construction and manufacturing and on Media and Entertainment were all good, and there wasn't a lot of difference across that I would point to.

And in particular, the number of large transactions that we did, the deal is greater than $1 million. It's heavily driven by our EBAs, our big enterprise business agreements. We had a very strong quarter there and, in fact, did more than a handful of 8-figure deals there. Now these are all ratable, so you don't see them all dropping in to the revenue stream in Q4, but a handful of 8-figure deals and the largest manufacturing deal we've ever done, we just got it done in Q4. So I'd say strength on the high end as well."

One of the tricks that we're kind of referencing in the forecasting is that in particular, I think we have a couple of quarters, where it's hard to know which way people will go, Q1 and Q2 in particular, but even extending into Q3. So we're doing our best job on triangulating from what we're hearing from our partners, what we're hearing from our salespeople, top-down models, extrapolation in trends. But to be honest, it's a little bit hard, and that's why we have a slightly broader range in terms of guidance and why we gave the slightly paradoxical guidance that I wouldn't mind seeing revenue down. I think I've now done something like 40 of these earnings calls at the end of the quarter, and I don't think I've ever rooted for revenue to be down, but this may be -- this is certainly a first. And so it's just different than it's ever been. And I can't highlight enough that the next 4 quarters are just going to be a little bit odd. And that's why we've pointed to, and I think you are on the right point, which is look at volume. We think volume will be up. Look at ARR, there will be a number of metrics that will underlie what is really the foundation of the business doing well and for underlying demand. And then a little bit, which I think is the math that follows the will [ph] and just as the math is ugly in the next 1.5 years, the math gets beautiful in the subsequent years. And so we'll take that as we can. But one other addition, let me just add, what our bias is, and I think strongly supported by many of our investors, is to do anything we can to transition our customers to the new model as fast as possible. So there are a number of things like this that we're doing, which again, we think could adversely affect some of our guidance on revenue but we think will also help on exceeding on subscriptions. So many of you have noticed things like promotions in Q1. I think you'll see promotions in Q1 around our new model businesses. I think you'll see the same thing in Q3. It would not be out of the question for us to do stuff like that. So a number of things, but our bias is we'd already moved up the end-of-sale date by 6 months and now we're using all the knobs and levers we have to continue to put pressure on the system to move to the new model as quickly as possible."

We've geared the entire machine from sales comp through the variable comp bonus plans that every employee has. You look at our promos, you look at the way we will point our channel partners next week at our sales kickoff event. We've geared everything toward driving subs. Because the more we drive subs, and in particular, the more we drive the new model subs, ultimately, that's what builds the strength of the model and gets us to that vision of fiscal '20 that we've laid out. So ARPS to ARPS is more of a drive number. We're focused on driving subs and driving ARR. And when you divide those 2, you get ARPS. I think, if you wanted to think about it a little bit more mechanically, I would give you 2 pointers. One is the fastest-growing piece of our desktop business, which is what's driving the new model subs as much as anything is the low end. It's the AutoCAD LT desktop subs. So that's naturally going to put downward pressure on ARPS. The second is the way we calculate ARR on a quarterly basis is we total up our recurring revenue for the quarter, multiply that by 4 and you get it annualized, and that's our ARR. And so the linearity in a given quarter will drive the ARR calculation. In other words, the more of those sales that come in late in the quarter, there's fewer revenue that actually accretes into the reported revenue for that quarter. And so you don't get to see the full effect of it until the following quarter. So there's a little bit of seasonality and linearity effect on ARR at any given quarter, but I think can also throw off your ARPS calculation."

One is there's always been more of a seasonality to our large enterprise deals. Some of it is driven by their end of year. And remember, even though one of the perks of this company is our calendar and fiscal numbering, it does give us a second close, so we not only have a customer end of the year, but our salespeople have an end to the year, too. And so there's always been a stronger influence on Q4 because of that. The second thing is if you go back a handful of years, we had almost no enterprise licenses. That was a nonexistent part of our business, and I think we've done a number of things over the midterm to change that. One is, we built out a sales force that did it. We changed the nature of some of our products to better accommodate it. We have licensing models that are more aligned with what they want to do. And I think our drive, really, to take a leadership position in the industry, whether that's what we're doing in Media and Entertainment or with BIM and AEC or doing on the cloud in manufacturing, has led companies to view Autodesk as a more strategic partner. I don't know how many years I'd have to go back before I would find that a million-dollar deal in a quarter was a big deal. And now it's fairly routine. So we've invested heavily. As we detailed at Analyst Day this year and last year, we think there's a lot more there. We think the offerings coming enabled us to grow much more quickly. And what we love about it is it does have some trickle-down effect, in that all of these companies greatly affect their supply chain. So we're really excited about the enterprise business, and we're going to continue to keep investing in it. As a matter of fact, the biggest investment came during the 2008, 2009 downturn when we recognized like our statistical run rate business was falling off and one of the places we could really invest was in the enterprise. And it was really out of, kind of, that soul searching in the darkness that we really landed on this. And it's just been a continual success."

There's a lot of maintenance sitting in deferred revenue, right? So it's not going to come off quickly out of the reported revenues, but it will trickle down. It will become, in the second half of the year, both maintenance ARR and maintenance subscriptions growth will be a headwind to our total ARR and total subscriptions growth."

First, Heather, we're not providing ARR guidance for the year certainly in that level of granularity. I think, again, that we've set up the machine, and [indiscernible] say that, I mean, every part of the company, the focus on driving subs. And so the easy place to track right now through this year will be to track how we grow both total subscriptions, but then more importantly, the new model subscriptions because that's what's going to grow the company longer-term. On cash flow, I said a couple of things. Cash flow for Q4 was artificially low. We did have -- we had very interesting linearity in the quarter, where the third month of the quarter, so January for us, saw more than half of our total sales get done. And since we bill net-30, we had a lot of -- in a normal linearity, a normal 30, 30, 40 or the normal that we have experienced in the past few years, we would have seen about $95 million more cash flow from ops fall into Q4. But given the linearity of the quarter, given those sales got done late, that's all sitting in receivables. By the way, our receivables is 100% current, so there's not -- there's no risk on that. But it's sitting in receivables and it will now be collected in Q1. So what it means is there's a headwind on the cash flow from ops we just reported for Q4 that will just ripple over into Q1. And if you remember what we said for cash flow, our free cash flow, back at Investor Day, we said we thought it would be breakeven to slightly negative for fiscal '17, and that now goes up by about $100 million year-on-year. So think of it being certainly positive, somewhere around that $50 million to $100 million range."

I don't think our -- any of our financial guidance is just predicated on what we're going to do with Collections, but we can think about it a lot. We would really like to simplify the offering for a whole number of operational reasons. It's incredibly important that we do that. The second and probably more important thing that we're trying to accomplish with Collections is to give an incentive for the existing customers who are on maintenance for Suites, a more attractive thing to move over to. So as we said, we want to try to use the carrot as much is possible to convince our customers, our best customers, who are on maintenance subscriptions to move over. And that's what we're really looking to do. At the same time, it is a great way to simplify our product portfolio. So we're going to use it for both those things. I think it will be important and we'll kind of get a better read on it as we go through the year, but a lot of the financial modeling that we've been talking about so far this afternoon is really predicated on overall volume.

I mean, there's certainly other companies in there, a number of Media and Entertainment companies. I mean, so it's there, but it is focused on large manufacturing and large construction companies. I don't think we've hit 20% yet, so we're somewhere in that 10% to 20%. I don't have a more precise number at this point, but I mean, there's still a lot of room to grow. And what's particularly good about this business, the growth in the business is just not the number of accounts, it's the growth within the accounts that's been so substantial. So it's not like we signed an EBA, and in the end [ph], remember, there's a consumption-based aspect to this as well. And we kind of detailed why we think it's a win-win. And so the existing EBAs continue to grow, and we have more than 80% of our large customers are still not on these flexible licenses. The last part, just to tie both your questions together, Jay, is essentially Collections is a form of flexible licensing for smaller customers that can be sold through the channel. So what we really want to do is use the patterns, just see the model that's worked so well for the enterprise and bring it to small and medium businesses and allow our partners to sell more flexible consumption-based licenses as well."

So remember, these flexible license offerings we talk about and are so proud about, we actually need to build the infrastructure to support that. Consumption-based models need it, so we're still investing in doing that. And then the third thing that we're doing is -- and I know it's gotten a lot less focus. It's -- I feel like I could stand on my head and talk about this and it still doesn't matter, but the really big thing we're doing is investing in the cloud and mobile, and we're trying to change the dynamics of the market. And we are continuing to invest in that, and so some of it is tied to cloud infrastructure and things like that. As you step down a level, you would see things like continued investment in our enterprise sales force, things that are working. But some of that starts to fall in the category of the regular rejiggering you do within a business. Clearly, we have less people selling in Russia than we used to and more people on major accounts.

So I think that will be -- that will put some upward pressure on maintenance subs in the first half of the year, but then in the second half of the year, there's no new maintenance subs. And while we have a high renewal rate on maintenance, it's not 100%. So maintenance turns around and becomes, for the full year, it becomes a headwind for us on selling subscriber adds. The remainder is looking at what we think -- what we've seen this year, what we think will happen next year in terms of unit volumes and knowing that for the second half of the year, those unit volumes will all be, in some form or fashion, a subscription account.

Our revenue outlook in the out-years is still exactly what we outlined. Back to the beginning of your question, I would say, relative to September, our expenses are much lower, considerably lower, just to put -- from 5% to 6% that we said was kind of the feeling. Now we're talking about flat for the next 2 years and then moderating from there. So it's substantial. I mean, you run the model, it has a dramatic effect, particularly having down to flat in the first few years of this transition. The revenue, we're tweaking slightly, but the revenue is not about unit demand, as we said, it's really whether people buy the new model or the old model. And all through this year, we will still have some variability, and so an inability to predict exactly what happens. The good news is, we move to the end of the year, there's only one thing that people can buy new from us. And so while -- in many ways, this is painful to go through the transition. We do hit a point, probably in the middle of next year, where 80% or 90% of the revenue in a quarter comes off the balance sheet. So if I go back to when I first started, where you started every quarter in 0, you're now going to be in a place where you start every quarter with 80% or 90% of the tank full.

Carl touched on this earlier. It's a somewhat paradoxical year. So if you -- to the extent that customers continue to move more quickly to the new models, that's going to put downward pressure on the current year's recorded revenues. However, when you look out in time, especially when you get out into fiscal '19 and fiscal '20, we talked about this, the overwhelming majority of our revenues are going to be driven by new model subs. So while -- a faster move to a new model will result in a lower end on reported revenues for this year. It actually is good news for building up that base and getting to the numbers we laid out in the out-years."

But we won't really know, and we won't get a much better feel in Q3 as this becomes the only way to buy. But from all the anecdotal info, talking to our partners, what people are tending to do is buy desktop subscriptions. Like we said, we thought about 10% of the volume was people who were taking advantage of the last moment opportunity to buy. I think we'll see that again in Q2, maybe slightly stronger with the Suites, but I'm not convinced of that yet. But many people are finding desktop subscription as the only attractive alternative. And maybe when we started talking about this a couple of years ago, we were the tall pole in the tent or something about this. We are no longer the tall pole in the tent. The entire software industry is moving to these kinds of licensing models, and customers are just getting much more comfortable. And they understand what the benefit to them is of buying this way. So I think there will be some noise for a while, but by the second half of the year, we're well into the single model, and by next year, it's kind of all done."

If we just talked about the linearity of Q4, which was a strong quarter from any dimension, but because of the linearity, we saw a lot of the sales that came in, in Q4, come into that third month and depressed our recorded cash -- free cash flows for Q4 by about $95 million, which now have shifted from Q4 and into Q1. So I think that with linearity being such a large variable there, it's really hard to say if this quarter definitively is going to be the bottom.

I mean, I think it's partially what I just answered is that we start -- so for example, we start building a model in which almost all of the revenue comes off the balance sheet. So just starting with that idea that quarters used to start at 0 and will now start at 80 or 90 or 95 is different. You will also be able to look at things like the churn and see the renewal rates and extrapolate from there. So to the extent that -- and we generally haven't gone out that far, but people really didn't understand the dynamic of this. And so we were just trying to put it in perspective. I mean, to the extent that you want to discount FY '23, feel free to. It's way in the future. I think the FY '20 is there. The problem we had and really the reason why we gave details around FY '23 is because FY '20 or FY '21 is still so much in the steep part of the curve. And so if we -- when we were doing that and only talking about FY '20, people were saying, is that the terminal? Is it the terminal cash flow? Is it the terminal EPS? Is it the terminal operating margin? And it wasn't. And just to the extent now that traditional financial metrics are going to go down predictably as a result of how we account for this, it's just as certain that they come up on the other side. So I'm totally fine with people wanting to discount FY '23. We just wanted to make sure that people understood that, that's what our model looks like. And I think if you back off it and look, we've impressed. There are some people who think we should be able to get a lot more. There are some people who get to less. But you can then look at it in a pretty reasonable way about -- thinking about the number of subscribers. Because remember, if anything, we have been attacked for our ARPS. So there's not a lot of assumption about the ARPS going up, so it really is all about subscribers and then ARR really translates directly to revenues. So put whatever discounts you want on it, Brent."

Can that 300k go up due to adding pirated users? It probably should go up -- you should be adding those old license users as subscriptions, but then those become renewals later in time.

We've been pretty modest in our assumption. But you're right, you have the old subscribers. And remember, the definitional issue just really gets to this thing of a user could be in a different company but they have been a user before, and let's just ignore that for a second. But the old subscribers would be there. Piracy, we think, this will put a significant dent in casual piracy. And as we said the new offerings are the places where we're getting new customers. So come at this a different way. We talk about it sometimes as TAM expansion. We talk about it as new users. I referenced 100 million people in manufacturing and construction who didn't have a need for many of the tools we previously sold, but they do now, whether that's BIM 360 or PLM 360. Those are new users. Those new users may be inside of existing customers or they may be in new accounts. But we didn't give you an indication. Many of these products are relatively high. In almost all cases, the majority of the customers that are doing it are not traditional customers. The other thing that I think is really important, and I know you guys do not want to bake too much into your model, but we're running a business not a spreadsheet. And in our world, the investments we've made in going to cloud-based engineering tools has led us to have a leadership position in that. We deeply believe that the future of all software is in the cloud and in mobile and it opens up big markets. I've always believed, for people who invest in Autodesk, this is one of the fundamental tenets you should believe in. There are less difficult ways to get there, but we think the business model transition starts the curve we just talked about with Brent. But if that is going to continue into the out-years, that's based on the fact that we expand into new markets, get new users and win the platform of the future."

I kind of hesitate to do it because it's all been going so swimmingly. But I'm really just trying to avoid work for dinging Scott and I over the next couple of days in having the same conversations several dozen different times. Because I've had it in private, even as I go down to the coffee store, I get asked by all the investors in our building. And that's just a question of what's going on with our activist investors. And so I just want to take that head on and happy to talk about it privately with others, but it seems like a mistake not to address it to some degree. So let me just give you my viewpoint on this. The first thing is that I think a number of the 13D filers as well as some of the activist investors have raised legitimate concerns. And one part that kind of troubles me about it is that there are other long-term investors, really constructive investors, who have raised the same issues in a much better way. And so while we are absolutely talking to the activist investors, I think too much credit is being given to them and not enough credit is being given to our long-term investors who have asked for change in a constructive way. They've understood kind of the subtleties and complexities of running the business and they truly have taken the time to understand what the challenges and the opportunities we face. And so I feel like they're getting the short end of the stick when they've really pulled the laboring war [ph] in supporting the company over the long period. Many of my problems with sort of some of the more activist investors is that their focus is extremely short-term and somewhat simplistic. They just ignore some of the complexities of running a business. And let's just get a lighter note for a second and then I'll return to being more serious, but let me just tell you what my concern is, because it's easy to sit on the outside and have lots of good ideas, how to do this or that thing better or why things should move more quickly. As a matter of fact, if you turn on sports radio or political talk radio, on sports radio, you can hear thousands of people who know what the coach or general manager or the owner should have done differently. And I'm worried about that [indiscernible]. I watched the game last night, I had a million ideas of what the coach should do, but I didn't actually have to do the job. And so in a nutshell, my concern is people who like essentially want to turn Autodesk into Men's Wearhouse. If you look, I don't think any of the people who got involved in Men's Wearhouse intentionally meant to do damage to the company. I don't think they meant to screw it up, but I think they had some simplistic views. And what troubles me is seeing those same views expressed about our business. Actually, I got one little funny story here. I looked up Men's Wearhouse the other day, I was trying -- and they changed the name of the company and the symbol. And what I thought was interesting is changing the name makes it actually hard to track the price and how poorly it's performed. But the symbol is a little bit of a telltale sign because if you just look at it and squint, it's spelled T-U-R-D. It's actually T-L-R-D, but it's what it looks and there's probably more like it. So let me just try to end this on a more serious note. We are talking to the activists, we would like to shift the conversation to the active investors to a more constructive dialogue. There is certainly a possibility that together, we can do that. And most importantly, I just want to say thank you to our long-term shareholders who have understood what the challenges are. They're really the fantastic opportunities the company has. Thanks."

We had a terrific start to FY '17, with more proof points that the transition from perpetual licenses to subscription and cloud offerings is going well. We're moving steadily ahead on our 2 big initiatives: First, we are increasing the lifet",2065,"Thanks, Dave. We had a terrific start to FY '17, with more proof points that the transition from perpetual licenses to subscription and cloud offerings is going well. We're moving steadily ahead on our 2 big initiatives: First, we are increasing the lifetime customer value. Secondly, we're driving increased adoption of our cloud-based solutions to better serve existing customers as well as expand into I'll share more details on our Q1 results and then talk more about our view around long-term shareholder value creation before getting into our outlook for the rest of the year.
As I mentioned last quarter, the primary focus for us through the transition is driving subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue or ARR. In total, we added 132,000 net new subscriptions in the quarter. New model subscription additions more than doubled to 140,000. And while we expected maintenance subscriptions to decline, in conjunction with the end of sale of perpetual licenses on individual products at the end of Q4, total maintenance subscriptions declined by only 8,000 as our renewal [indiscernible] maintenance continues to increase. 
Q1 was the first quarter where customers no longer had the option to buy a perpetual license for individual products such as AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT. As a result, additions from product subscription, formerly known as desktop subscription, jumped dramatically by 125% sequentially and by nearly 350% year-over-year. 
Helping drive product subscription growth in Q1 was a promotion targeted at converted [indiscernible] our legacy non-subscriber base to new product subscriptions. This promotion captured legacy non-subscribers who are customers that purchased the perpetual license sometime in the past and wanted to trade in their old perpetual license for a product subscription at a discount. It turned out to be one of the most successful promotions we've ever run and contributed over 25,000 net new model subscriptions to the quarter. 
As we analyzed the data, the really interesting part was that over 50% of those taking advantage of the promotion were using versions from 7 years back or older. We've talked about the opportunity to convey the [indiscernible] of the estimated 2.8 million non-subscribers, which captures a 5-year lookback. We knew there was a meaningful number of active users beyond that 5-year lookback and this was a great validation of that point.
New model subscriptions also got a strong contribution from our enterprise flexible license or EBA customers. I mentioned on last quarter's call that in Q4, we signed up a record number of enterprise customers for these token-based or consumption style EBAs. And that because of the way we count those subscriptions, we've seen the benefit to net new subscriptions in Q1 as we did in the first quarter of last year. These EBAs contributed more than 25,000 subscription additions in Q1 this year. 
EBAs with our large enterprise customers have been a very successful component of our transition, leading to both increased subscriptions and account value while creating increased flexibility for our customers. 
We also had a record quarter for cloud subscription additions in Q1, which increased nearly 50% sequentially. BIM 360 and PLM 360 continued to lead the way but we're also having success with our other cloud products such as Shotgun, A360 and Fusion 360. 
Our cloud-based products continue to bring in new customers to Autodesk. Our newest cloud product is our IoT platform, Fusion Kinect, formerly known as SeeControl, a service that helps manufacturers and system integrators connect, analyze, control and manage remotely, which is gaining traction. change the Cad, CAM and PLM markets with cloud-based products, we're doing the same with Internet of Things, enabling our customers to easily incorporate IoT capabilities into their projects. 
In Q1, we landed a 6-figure IoT deal with an industrial manufacturing company and [indiscernible] the competing head-to-head against other well-known competitors. This is an exceptional win because the customer is considered a pioneer in IT and as making connected products as part of their core business strategy for several years. 
It's important to note that our channel partners are fully engaged with our subscription model. 63% of new model subscription additions came through our channel partners compared to just 27% in Q1 last year. We're also excited about the number of subscriptions coming through our eStore, which have more than doubled from Q1 last year. Our total direct sales increased to 25% in the first quarter. That's up from just 15% 2 years ago, and it's still in the early days for our eStore.
The [indiscernible] new model subscriptions fueled a 76% year-on-year constant currency increase in new model ARR. Total recurring revenue jumped to 70% of our total liquidity revenues compared to 53% last quarter. Total ARR growth was 12% at constant currency year-on-year. Remember, when the value of the total ARR growth relative to our long-term target that this number would build over the next 3 quarters as new model becomes an increasingly large component of total ARR, so we are very confident with the growth we experienced here in Q1.
Another metric that we've talked [indiscernible] about has been unit volume. When comparing our unit volume to the first quarter last year, it was in line with our expectations. On the expense side, we are diligently controlling our spending. As a result of the restructuring action we took early in the quarter, our total spend decreased more than 2 percentage points year-on-year. We are continuing to make structural changes that allow us to spend less yet focus on our key initiatives. We are carefully balancing the need for financial discipline with a need to invest to drive long-term health of the company. 
Overall, we are very pleased with the Q1 results, which are a great start to the year and [indiscernible] confident that the transition is working for our customers, our partners and Autodesk. 
[indiscernible] to the end of Q2 when we start perpetual licenses for Suites and become fully immersed in the subscription model. Another exciting factor about Q3 is that we begin selling [indiscernible] as our next generation of Suites called Collections. 
We [indiscernible] customers until next week, but I will give you a little preview. Collections will be the most convenient way for customers to access a wide selection of both our desktop software and our cloud services. We're significantly reducing complexity by offering just 3 collections: 1 for 1 for manufacturing and 1 for . The value for our customers is tremendous and well exceeds our Premium Suite. We're offering single user and multi-user access and choices of different rates that fit their needs. 
Suites have been a tremendous success since we launched them over 5 years ago, and Collections will take it to the next level by giving greater flexibility to our customers and increasing the lifetime value for us. 
[indiscernible] touched on last quarter and that's about what we're doing to create long-term value for our shareholders. [indiscernible] because I see that where we're ultimately aiming to accomplish, which is position Autodesk to lead the next-generation design [indiscernible] somewhat in the noise of quarterly financial results. 
Our transition is really happening on 2 vectors. The first is the business model pricing transition that is happening now, where our customers are needing to churn-based subscriptions. Over the next 3 years, we expect this process to move to a highly predictable model and significant increase in the value our customers get from our products. 
It's important this model change we are simplifying our entire go-to-market strategy to align with the concept of being an all-subscription company, the result [indiscernible] meaningful increases in the business we do directly with our customers at the enterprise and e-commerce levels. In of these changes ultimately reduce our cost structure and increase how effectively we serve our customers. 
The second vector of our transition is how we are building platforms to exploit the cloud and dramatically expand the size of our market opportunities. [indiscernible] we've made in this area started over 3 years ago allowed us to get a sizable lead on our current competitors as well as funded startups. We've seen the platform shift moving before. Incumbents would slowly become less relevant while the world changes around that. We're to secure the future of Autodesk and our new cloud-based products are already the undisputed leaders in their respective categories. 
It's not just about making [indiscernible] design tools. It's about market expansion. Mobile and cloud technologies are opening up significant opportunities in areas of construction and manufacturing that are completely new to Autodesk. Again, our framework for creating long-term shareholder value is to increase the lifetime value of every customer, change our cost structure and [indiscernible] each customers and best cloud and mobile-based products and services in the industry as the underlying platform shifts to the cloud. While many people are focused on the business model shift, leadership position in the cloud leads to a long-term sustainable competitive advantage.
Now turning to our Q2 and full year outlook. I mentioned on last quarter's call while the current fiscal year is the most unique in the company's history as we complete the transition from perpetual licenses to subscriptions at the end of Q2. None of the traditional seasonality patterns or sales metrics will be applicable, nor will year-over-year [indiscernible] traditional metrics be helpful in understanding how we are performing through the transition. Similar to our Q1 [ph] hitting the low end of the revenue range while exceeding our subscription guidance is a desirable outcome for the year. 
Our view of the macroeconomic environment impact on our business hasn't changed since last quarter or the past several quarters for that matter. The conditions have been most of the emerging markets have been difficult, but most of the mature markets have been relatively good. As we evaluated our strong Q1 results, we didn't see any meaningful change in the demand environment. 
For the end of sale of suites here in Q2, we expect will resemble what we saw in Q4 with the end of sale for individual products. In other words, we're expecting some surge activity but not a lot. Remember that our unit volume and revenue contribution from Suites is much lower than our individual products, and we've already seen a significant shift in Suites customers to the new model. 
While this is good news in terms of moving them to a higher value offering now and not having to convince them later, it down our expectations for a surge in value at the end of this quarter. Also while the targeting legacy customers successful in Q1, we will not be running that promo here in Q2.
Q3 may be our first quarter of subscription-only sales across the board and will likely experience sequential slowdown. That's when you can expect to see promotions aimed at legacy customers again. If you're not modeling a sequential decline for Q3 already, you should be. And if consistent with our expectations for the full year, which are unchanged. And Q4 should begin to show more normal sales trends in our near subscription-only model. 
We made a slight adjustment to our FY '17 outlook for EPS based on our revised tax assumption for the year. Otherwise, we remain comfortable with our full year outlook for FY '17 and our long-term goals of growing our subscription base by a 20% CAGR over the next 4 years, which will drive a 24% CAGR in ARR. 
We remain committed to keeping spend grade roughly flat to slightly down this year and flat in FY '18. And coupled with our top line projections, we see a path to free cash flow of roughly $6 per share in FY '20 and $11 per share in FY '23. 
To wrap things up, our business model transition is in full swing now and exceeding expectations. We're very excited to be another major step further along in the transition, and by the second half of this year, we will fully be in a subscription-only model. 
Customers [indiscernible] model subscriptions and the cloud. At the same time, we're driving higher lifetime value, simplifying our offerings and our go-to-market activities and significantly increasing our market opportunity as we meet the next wave of design and engineering software to the cloud. We have a clear vision and plan for creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business in the years to come.

And I know it's got a lot of attention, so let me just back up a little bit and give you a more holistic view of meeting people to subscription and then try to place of the 2.8 million into context. So as we were looking at building out the new model that would be subscription-only, we basically said that there were 3 pools of people that we could draw from: one were the non-subscribers. The second were the non-payers or the pirates. And the third, I'll just call the nonusers, basically people who are not using software or using competitive software. And share shift would be [indiscernible]. 3 different distinct pools with different dynamics. One of the questions came up frequently was, ""Okay, what is the size of the people who bought products that aren't on subscription?"" And what we said is our new model, or [indiscernible] model, we were looking to add about 800,000 subscribers to the total. From this collection of sources. People wanted to know the size of the -- wanted to know the size of each of these relative segments. To think about it. On the non-subscribers, one data point we give you there's only just 1 was that in the last 5 years and [indiscernible] relatively constant, which is why we chose it is a convenient data point. There were 2.8 million people who had bought that had an attached subscription. We put a caveat around that. It's some people may no longer be users and no longer be actively using it. They may have come back in by buying a new license. They may have joined a different firm. They could have passed away for all we know. But we wanted to give a size to it. There were clearly people beyond that 5 years who are still using software as evidenced by that. So it's just an indication and if you look, it's interesting and somewhat obvious in at least retrospect. But if you look at the legacy results, more people that were back 6 and 7 years that in years, 1, 2 and 3. The news around 7 years and [indiscernible] distribution. So that should give you an indication of what goes on in that case. So it is bigger. And what we had said is we thought we could convert 30%. So taking into account how many people were no longer active or the new model would not appeal to them, we thought we could convert 30% of the base. And that's what we're indicating our assumption in the model. The second one is and I think people want to look at this and miss out on the dynamics as we move to a more connected experience for our customers is that right now, somewhere around half or slightly more than half of the usage of our products in the world is by people who do not pay for it. Once again, you got to pay a discount on how many people will actually pay for when they are forced to. But at least, these many people don't take software they use it as the ones who do. And then the third one, which I did not rule out is an important contribution to the subscription additions are the people who are using competitive products. I think what you've done to lead the way in cloud-based engineering software is going to be very attractive and will be a source of [indiscernible] customers for many of the legacy providers who has frankly kind of moving the software to the cloud. So sorry for the very long-winded answer to your question, but I thought it would -- [indiscernible]  And i just wanted to try to put it in the broader context."

And could you talk about what you think the relevance is of the schedule of various products is to sustaining the flywheel of the subscription model? And one almost obviously missing brand in your portfolio is, let's call it, Revit 360. You've got all kinds of other 360s, but you don't have a Revit 360. Is that something that would make sense for you?"

So generally, the [indiscernible] updates is inversely proportional to the maturity of the product just broadly speaking, if you were to look and say a very mature product like AutoCAD needs frequent updates, products like any of the 360, like Fusion",251,"Yes. So generally, the [indiscernible] updates is inversely proportional to the maturity of the product just broadly speaking, if you were to look and say a very mature product like AutoCAD needs frequent updates, products like any of the 360, like Fusion 360 gets updated relatively frequently. If you follow Fusion there's weekly and biweekly small updates and certainly every month, there's an update with significant functionality. We have continued that. In some ways, it's not the overall quantity of stuff delivered. One of the thing that changes in this [indiscernible] is really the frequency. And I think it changes is also the digestibility. I did [indiscernible] a year versus having dozens of small snacks. And a little bit what this allows us to do with our newer products is have not only us deploy the software more effectively, but our customers more easily discover what's in it and put it to use as quickly as possible. So kind of continue on that kind of cadence of the newer cloud-based products would be frequently updated. The other ones will be a little bit slower but both the traditional products and the new cloud services, we need to be thought of differently as connected experiences, which now allow us to do things in the ongoing use and in the update that just not possible before. As a matter of fact, even when you look at some of the data were just reporting on question, a bunch of that comes from frequent connectivity."

So the linearity in the quarter is one effect but mix is a bigger effect. Actually, you see the same thing and maintenance going the reverse direction. As there are fewer AutoCAD LT and AutoCAD maintenance subs, probably already done the math you see the ARPS is going up slightly on the maintenance side but coming down on you model strictly a matter of mix.

And in total, there's probably a couple hundred million dollars already being sold in the area of collaboration and coordination software. I think that market is going to grow tremendously. And that's what's available to us. There's really critical that we get out the BIM 360 docs like you said. We had incredible success with our enterprise, Architecture, Engineering and Construction customers, but they were missing out on smaller parts of the market, and that's really gets the scale. But I mean, these are opportunities that certainly in the hundreds of thousands of potential users, and in some cases, possibly in millions. But if you want to just look more specifically, for example, many of the people on the construction side will use BIM 360 were not a user of our designer engineering products. If you look at PLM 360, it drives the use of our manufacturing products throughout the whole enterprise as opposed to just people that are design and engineering. So it's a very different use profile. It's also why you said just some of the other comments, when you look at some of these cost subscriptions, when you include these will be lower priced products. And that's what kind of dampens the growth. So just trying to tie them together but things are really no uses of that haven't been available, whereas before I talked about there's 3 pools of users and use of the desktop for the new cloud-based design products."

I think you're thinking about it in the right way, but let me put a little bit of a different distraction on it. The places where the year-on-year growth is less impacted by the model transition are the places where they were earlier to adopt the new model. So the compare point a year ago already had a reasonable mix or a growing mix of new model subs built into it. That was not the case in APAC, right? APAC has been the slowest was to adopt the new models so the compare point for our APAC revenues for the quarter compares back to a quarter that very had little new model mix inside theer. So it's more impacted in terms of the year-on-year growth rates. Yes, one of the encouraging signs we saw this quarter was the proportion in APAC of new model subscriptions for the Suites. So there are portions of Asia that are moving. It's not uniform, but we were very surprised and pleasantly to see such a large percentage and exceeded the other geos in terms of new model subscription. So we're seeing some traction there. Also a lot of it just so you understand it and maybe you can reconcile it, some of you are doing things like channel checks. One of the biggest factors affecting the uptake is actually the sentiment of the reseller. Resellers have a huge impact in what they present to our customers. Our best resellers are all on board with the new model some of the wins that are staying behind our influencing it. And some sometimes of that carries over into geographic distinctions. Actually big enough to be called out."

On the stand-alone products remember we size it at the end of Q4, there was only about a 10% increase in volume that came through. Suites, to begin with, are a much lower volume product stand-alone products are. We're also seeing and have seen a really steady increase in the uptake of customers already buying the new model on Suites. So not waiting for it to hit end of sale. There's been a lot of interest in suite customers buying the new model. So you add those 2 together, we're expecting a small amount of buy-ahead activity in Q2 on Suites but not a huge amount.

We had a terrific start to FY '17, with more proof points that the transition from perpetual licenses to subscription and cloud offerings is going well.

We had a terrific start to FY '17, with more proof points that the transition from perpetual licenses to subscription and cloud offerings is going well. We're moving steadily ahead on our 2 big initiatives: first, we are increasing the lifetime customer value; secondly, we're driving increased adoption of our cloud-based solutions to better serve existing customers as well as expand into new segments. I'll share more details on our Q1 results and then talk more about our view around long-term shareholder value creation before getting into our outlook for the rest of the year.
As I mentioned last quarter, the primary focus for us through the transition is driving subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue or ARR. In total, we added 132,000 net new subscriptions in the quarter. New model subscription additions more than doubled to 140,000. And while we expected maintenance subscriptions to decline in conjunction with the end of sale of perpetual licenses on individual products at the end of Q4, total maintenance subscriptions declined by only 8,000 as our renewal rate on maintenance continues to increase.
Q1 was the first quarter where customers no longer had the option to buy a perpetual license for individual products such as AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT. As a result, additions from product subscription, formerly known as desktop subscription, jumped dramatically by 125% sequentially and by nearly 350% year-over-year.
Helping drive product subscription growth in Q1 was a promotion targeted at converting our legacy non-subscriber base to new product subscriptions. This promotion captured legacy non-subscribers who are customers that purchased the perpetual license sometime in the past and wanted to trade in their old perpetual license for a product subscription at a discount. It turned out to be one of the most successful promotions we've ever run and contributed over 25,000 net new model subscriptions to the quarter.
As we analyzed the data, the really interesting part was that over 50% of those taking advantage of the promotion were using versions from 7 years back or older. We've talked about the opportunity to convert a portion of the estimated 2.8 million non-subscribers, which captures a 5-year look back. We knew there was a meaningful number of active users beyond that 5-year look back, and this was a great validation of that point.
New model subscriptions also got a strong contribution from our enterprise flexible license or EBA customers. I mentioned on last quarter's call that in Q4, we signed up a record number of enterprise customers for these token-based or consumption-style EBAs and that because of the way we count those subscriptions, we've seen the benefit to net new subscriptions in Q1 as we did in the first quarter of last year. These EBAs contributed more than 25,000 subscription additions in Q1 this year. EBAs with our large enterprise customers have been a very successful component of our transition, leading to both increased subscriptions and account value while creating increased flexibility for our customers.
We also had a record quarter for cloud subscription additions in Q1, which increased nearly 50% sequentially. BIM 360 and PLM 360 continue to lead the way, but we're also having success with our other cloud products such as Shotgun, A360 and Fusion 360.
Our cloud-based products continue to bring in new customers to Autodesk. Our newest cloud product is our IoT platform, Fusion Kinect, formerly known as SeeControl, a service that helps manufacturers and system integrators connect, analyze, control and manage things remotely, which is gaining traction. Just as we changed the CAD, CAM and PLM markets with cloud-based products, we're doing the same within Internet of Things, enabling our customers to easily incorporate IoT capabilities into their projects. 
In Q1, we landed a 6-figure IoT deal with an industrial manufacturing company, and this is us [ph] competing head-to-head against other well-known competitors. This is an exceptional win because the customer is considered a pioneer in IT and has been making connected products as part of their core business strategy for several years.
It's important to note that our channel partners are fully engaged with our subscription model. 63% of new model subscription additions came through our channel partners compared to just 27% in Q1 last year. We're also excited about the number of subscriptions coming through our eStore, which have more than doubled from Q1 last year. Our total direct sales increased to 25% in the first quarter. That's up from just 15% 2 years ago, and it's still in the early days for our eStore.
The growth of new model subscriptions fueled a 76% year-on-year constant currency increase in new model ARR. Total recurring revenue jumped to 70% of our total reported revenues compared to 53% last quarter. Total ARR growth was 12% at constant currency year-on-year. Remember when evaluating total ARR growth relative to our long-term targets that this number would build over the next 3 quarters as new model becomes an increasingly large component of total ARR. So we're very comfortable with the growth we experienced here in Q1.
Another metric that we've talked about in recent quarters about has been unit volume. When comparing our unit volume to the first quarter last year, it was in line with our expectations. On the expense side, we are diligently controlling our spending. As a result of the restructuring action we took early in the quarter, our total spend decreased more than 2 percentage points year-on-year. We are continuing to make structural changes that allow us to spend less yet focus on our key initiatives. We are carefully balancing the need for financial discipline with the need to invest to drive the long-term health of the company.
Overall, we are very pleased with the Q1 results, which are a great start to the year and reinforce our confidence that the transition is working for our customers, our partners and Autodesk.
Usually, we compare it to the end of Q2 when we start selling perpetual licenses for Suites and become fully immersed in the subscription model. Another exciting factor about Q3 is that we'll begin selling what will be thought out as our next generation of Suites called Collections. We won't officially launch it with our customers until next week, but I will give you a little preview. Collections will be the most convenient way for customers to access a wide selection of both our desktop software and our cloud services. We're significantly reducing complexity by offering just 3 Collections: one for AEC, one for manufacturing and one for engineering [ph]. The value for our customers is tremendous and well exceeds a premium suite. We're offering single-user and multi-user access and choices of different term rates that fit their needs. 
Suites have been a tremendous success since we launched them over 5 years ago, and Collections will take it to the next level by giving greater flexibility to our customers and increasing the lifetime value for us.
That's a good segue to what I touched on last quarter, and that's about what we're doing to create long-term value for our shareholders. I'm reiterating [ph] this because I feel that what we're ultimately aiming to accomplish, which is position Autodesk to lead the next-generation design, is being somewhat lost in the noise of quarterly financial results.
Our transition is really happening on 2 vectors. The first is the business model and pricing transition that is happening now where our customers are moving to term-based subscriptions. Over the next 3 years, we expect this process to move to a highly predictable model and a significant increase in the value our customers get from our products. In support of this model change, we are simplifying our entire go-to-market strategy to align with the concept of being an all-subscription company. The result will be meaningful increases in the business we do directly with our customers at the enterprise and e-commerce levels. In turn, these changes ultimately reduce our cost structure and increase how effectively we serve our customers.
The second vector of our transition is how we are building platforms to exploit the cloud and dramatically expand the size of our market opportunities. The investments we've made in this area, which started over 3 years ago, have allowed us to get a sizable lead on our current competitors as well as the many well-funded startups. We've seen the platform shift movie before. Incumbents will slowly become less relevant while the world changes around them. We're investing to secure the future of Autodesk, and our new cloud-based products are already the undisputed leaders in their respective categories.
It's not just about making browser-based design tools. It's about market expansion. Mobile and cloud technologies are opening up significant opportunities in areas of construction and manufacturing that are completely new to Autodesk. Again, our framework for building long-term shareholder value is to increase the lifetime value of every customer, change our cost structure and the means by which we reach customers and finally, to build the best cloud and mobile-based products and services in the industry as the underlying platform shifts to the cloud. While many people are focused on the business model shift, winning the leadership position in the cloud leads to a long-term sustainable competitive advantage.
Now turning to our Q2 and full year outlook. I mentioned on last quarter's call that the current fiscal year is the most unique in the company's history as we complete the transition from perpetual licenses to subscriptions at the end of Q2. None of the traditional seasonality patterns for sales metrics will be applicable, nor will year-over-year growth rates of traditional metrics be helpful in understanding how we are performing through the transition. Similar to our view on Q1, hitting the low end of the revenue range while exceeding our subscription guidance is a desirable outcome for the year.
Our view of the macroeconomic environment impact on our business hasn't changed since last quarter or for the past several quarters for that matter. The global conditions have been uneven. Most of the emerging markets have been difficult, but most of the mature markets have been relatively good. As we evaluated our strong Q1 results, we didn't see any meaningful change in the demand environment.
For the end of sale of Suites here in Q2, we expect the dynamics will resemble what we saw in Q4 with the end of sale for individual products. In other words, we're expecting some surge activity but not a lot. Remember that our unit volume and revenue contribution from Suites is much lower than our individual products, and we've already seen a significant shift in Suites customers to the new model. While this is good news in terms of moving them to a higher-value offering now and not having to convert them later, it trims down our expectation for a surge in value at the end of this quarter. Also while the promo targeting legacy customers was successful in Q1, we will not be running that promo here in Q2.
Q3 may be our first quarter of subscription-only sales across the board and will likely experience sequential slowdown. That's when you can expect to see promotions aimed at our legacy customers again. If you're not modeling a sequential decline for Q3 already, you should be. And it's consistent with our expectations for the full year, which are unchanged. And Q4 should begin to show more normal sales trends in our new subscription-only model.
We made a slight adjustment to our FY '17 outlook for EPS based on our revised tax rate assumption for the year. Otherwise, we remain comfortable with our full year outlook for FY '17 and our long-term goals of growing our subscription base by a 20% CAGR over the next 4 years, which will drive a 24% CAGR in ARR. We remain committed to keeping spend growth roughly flat to slightly down this year and flat in FY '18. And coupled with our top line projections, we see a path to free cash flow of roughly $6 per share in FY '20 and $11 per share in FY '23.
To wrap things up, our business model transition is in full swing now and exceeding expectations. We're very excited to do another major step further along in the transition, and by the second half of this year, we will fully be in a subscription-only model. Customers and partners are embracing the new model, both subscriptions and the cloud. At the same time, we're driving higher lifetime value, simplifying our offerings and our go-to-market activities and significantly increasing our market opportunity as we move the next wave of design and engineering software to the cloud. We have a clear vision and plan for creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business in the years to come.

So as we were lo",688,"Yes, so let me -- that's a great question. And I know it's got a lot of attention, so let me just back up a little bit and give you a more holistic view of moving people to subscriptions and then try to place the 2.8 million into context. So as we were looking at building out the new model that would be subscription-only, we basically said that there were 3 pools of people that we could draw from: one were the non-subscribers, the second were the non-payers or the pirates, and the third are -- I'll just call them nonusers, basically people who are not using software or using competitive software. And share shift would be the mover [ph]. So we have 3 different distinct pools with different dynamics. One of the questions came up frequently was, ""Okay, what is the size of the people who bought products that aren't on subscription?"" And what we said is our new model -- when we built out our model, we were looking to add about 800,000 subscribers to the total from this collection of sources. People wanted to know the size of the -- wanted to know the size of each of these relative segments. Here's a way to think about it. On the non-subscribers, one data point we gave you, and there's only just one, was that in the last 5 years and remained relatively constant, which is why we chose it is a convenient data point, there were 2.8 million people who had bought that had -- but had an attached subscription. We put a caveat around that, that said some of those people may no longer be users and may no longer be actively using it. They may have come back in by buying a new license. They may have joined a different firm. They could have passed away for all we know. But we wanted to give a size to it. There were clearly people beyond that 5 years who are still using software as evidenced by that. So it is just an indication, and if you look, it's interesting and somewhat obvious in at least retrospect. But if you look at the legacy promo results, there were more people that bought that were back 6 and 7 years that were -- than in the years, 1, 2 and 3. And the mean is around 7 years and it's a bell-shaped distribution. So that should give you an indication of what goes on in that base. So it is bigger. And what we had said is we thought we could convert 30%. So taking into account how many people were no longer active or the new model would not appeal to them, we thought we could convert 30 base -- 30% of the base. And that's what we were indicating was our assumption in the model. The second one is, and I think people overlook this and miss out on the dynamics as we move to a more connected experience for our customers, is that right now, somewhere around half or slightly more than half of the usage of our products in the world is by people who do not pay for it. Once again, you got to put a discount on how many people will actually pay for when they are forced to. But at least as many people don't pay for the software they use as the ones who do. And then the third one, which I did not rule out as an important contribution to the subscription additions, are the people who are using competitive products. I think much of what we've done to lead the way in cloud-based engineering software is going to be very attractive and will be a source of moving customers for many of the legacy providers who has frankly kind of dropped the ball on moving the software to the cloud. So sorry for the very long-winded answer to your question, but I thought it would -- I knew this [ph] would come up and I just wanted to try to put it in the broader context."

So on that point, could you talk about how you were thinking about the timing of delivery of new technology over time? In other words, for example, Inventor is being updated seemingly on a quarterly basis. So back in December in AU, we heard that AutoCAD may go to a more than 12-month cycle for major releases. And could you talk about what you think the relevance is of the schedule of various products is to sustaining the flywheel of the subscriptions model? And one almost obviously missing brand in your portfolio is, let's call it, Revit 360. You've got all kinds of other 360s, but you don't have a Revit 360. Is that something that would make sense for you?"

So generally, the frequency of updates is inversely proportional to the maturity of the product, just broadly speaking, that if you were to look and say a very mature product like AutoCAD needs at least frequent updates, products like any of the 360,",267,"Yes. So generally, the frequency of updates is inversely proportional to the maturity of the product, just broadly speaking, that if you were to look and say a very mature product like AutoCAD needs at least frequent updates, products like any of the 360, like Fusion 360 gets updated relatively frequently. If you follow like Fusion, there's weekly and biweekly small updates. And certainly every month, there's an update with significant functionality. We've continued that. In some ways, it's not the overall quantity of stuff delivered. One of the changes in this new model is really the frequency. But I think with changes is also the digestibility. If I did a one big roll a year versus having dozens of small snacks. And a little bit what this allows us to do with our newer products is have not only us deploy the software more effectively but our customers more easily discover what's in it and put it to use as quickly as possible. So when we kind of continue on that kind of cadence of the newer cloud-based products would be frequently updated, the other ones will be a little bit slower. But both the traditional products and the new cloud services will need to be thought of differently as connected experiences, which now allow us to do things in the ongoing use and in the update that were just not possible before. As a matter of fact, even when you look at some of the data I was just reporting on in the answer to Saket's question, a bunch of that comes from frequent connectivity."

I realize that the way we do it is accurate in terms of accounting standard, the way we do it today, but confusing from a modeling standpoint.

That's not ready yet, but that's something that is implied. And I think it will be a very investor-friendly move when we can make that. On the first question on capacity, we see the -- so we built the entitlement engine. We are -- as you think about it, it's a multi-phase process, right? You have to build the capability on the back end. Then each product has to build in the capability to recognize the new back end and use that as a way of turning it on so that they can get access to it. And then as those products ramp up, the capacity on the back end gets tested. So we haven't had any problems at this point as we ramp up the new model subscriptions fairly rapidly.

As you know, with the end of sale of perpetual licenses at the end of Q4, a lot of the new model subs that we added this quarter, of course, are the low-end models, right? So it's LT and AutoCAD. And so as those come online -- and maybe the way we measure ARR is we sum the recurring revenue for the entire quarter, multiply that by 4, and that's what becomes the ARR. So the linearity in the quarter is one effect, but mix is a bigger effect. Actually, you see the same thing in maintenance going on a reverse direction. As there are fewer AutoCAD LT and AutoCAD maintenance subs, you probably have already done the math. You see the ARPS is going up slightly on the maintenance side but coming down on new model. Strictly a matter of mix. That will reverse, of course, when we get to the second half and into next year and we return to a mix that has an equivalent representation of Suites as what we've seen historically."

I mean, I gave you the general outlook, which I would broadly characterize as unchanged. Probably the headline is it is unchanged and continues to be soft in a handful of mostly developing markets and pretty robust across the more mature markets. We paid special attention this time. And you guys have noted, and as I've been reading your reports, I would say 3 of our competitors, mostly in the manufacturing space but also 1 or 2 in the construction space, seemed to have a little rougher time of it this time. And what we're really trying to do is just parse how much was self-induced versus macroeconomically driven. I think at the end, I think most of the kind of shortfalls or stubbed toes seem to be mostly self-inflicted. And so we're pretty comfortable. I just talked to our sales leaders the other day. Yesterday, I met with some of our channel partners who represent a huge percentage of our [indiscernible] to the channel. And they feel -- they're feeling relatively bullish. So there's nothing in our guidance, the forecast, that would suggest any big change one way or another. Also across industry segments, relatively healthy across the board. If I wanted to put like a little gold star next to anything, I would say AEC seems to be just a little bit stronger on a worldwide basis. Once again, maybe better than the ADI index is that informal [indiscernible] count. There are just cities in the world where it's hard to reach a [indiscernible] right now. There's just so many in use. And so that to me would be a little bit of a bias towards the upside is just strength in AEC, but otherwise, stable, healthy, relatively unchanged."

That will be a nice move. The Collections going forward will have a fair number of cloud services, including the consumption-based models built into them. So that will be a way for customers to become more familiar, more comfortable and hopefully more desirous of more cloud functionality. The only thing we're doing with a lot of the cloud stuff is we're really reaching new segments. It's this cloud mobile combination, for example, that's allowing us to do -- and if you look at the products, BIM 360 and PLM 360, I mean, reaching large parts of the enterprise or large parts of the industry that were not otherwise accessible to us.

I would say Q2 through the end of the year, you will increasingly see cloud services that are available to all of our subscribers. They'll be packaged differently. Many of them will be done on a consumption basis. So for example, you will be able to either buy consumption plans or pay-as-you-go models in order to tap in the power of the cloud. So for example, visualization, analysis, being able to run many of these computing kinds of jobs on the cloud side is going to be a part of the rest of the year. And we'll continue to roll it out. We've already seen really good pickup in this. People are usually appreciating this being -- and sometimes people forget how computing intensive our apps are. And so instead of setting up a job and going for a cup of coffee, people are now able to set up a job on our cloud and then continue working. And so this has been a big productivity boost. Customers are really liking it. We're already doing a fair amount of visualization and are really starting to see a pickup in analysis and simulation, and I think that will continue. The other place where we've seen a fair amount of cloud-based stuff that's really important is the second access.

And that's what's available to us. It is really critical that we get out the BIM 360 Docs, like I said. We have had incredible success with our enterprise, architecture, engineering and construction customers. But they were missing out on smaller parts of the market, and that's where it really gets the scale. But I mean, these are opportunities that are certainly in the hundreds of thousands of potential users, and in some cases, possibly in the millions. But if you want to just look more specifically, for example, many of the people on the construction side who will use BIM 360 were not a user of our design our engineering products. If you look at PLM 360, it drives the use of our manufacturing products throughout the whole enterprise as opposed to just the people that are involved in design and engineering. So it's a very different use profile. It's also why we said just how you factor some of the other comments, when you look at some of these cloud subscriptions, when you include these, these will be lower-priced products. And that's what kind of dampens the ARPS growth.

So the compare point a year ago already had a reasonable mix or a growing mix of new model subs built into it. That was not the case in APAC, right? APAC has been the slowest to adopt the new models, so the compare point for our APAC revenues for the quarter compares back to the quarter that had very little new model mix inside there. So it's more impacted in terms of the year-on-year growth rates."

So there are portions of Asia that are moving. It's not uniform. But we were very surprised and pleasantly so to see such a large percentage and exceeded the other geos in terms of new model subscription. So we're seeing some traction there. Also a lot of it -- just so you understand it and maybe you can reconcile it, some of you are doing things like channel checks, one of the biggest factors affecting the uptake is actually the sentiment of the reseller. Resellers have a huge impact in what they present to our customers. Our best resellers are all on board with the new model. Some of the wins that are staying behind are influencing it, and sometimes of that carries over into geographic distinctions. They're actually big enough to be called out."

And what we're seeing in our guidance is in sync with what our expectations were. So it's not a question of a change in seasonality pattern versus what had been expected previously. If you just look at coming to the end of sale of Suites during Q2, we talked about earlier, we're expecting really a bit of a muted buy ahead versus what we saw on individual products. On the stand-alone products, remember we size it at the end of Q4. There was only about a 10% increase in volume that came through. Suites, to begin with, are a much lower-volume product than stand-alone products are. We're also seeing and have seen a really steady increase in the uptake of customers already buying the new model on Suites. So not waiting for it to hit end of sale. There's been a lot of interest in Suites customers buying the new model. So if you add those 2 together, we're expecting a small amount of buy-ahead activity in Q2 on Suites but not a huge amount. If it's bigger than we think, we'll be toward the high end of the range. And if it's less than we think, which would be a good thing because those are customers who don't have to convert off of perpetual in the future, [indiscernible] we think that we'll be at the low end of the range."

It's different, and this is really just our best estimate of what's going to go on. The more important news for us is that whatever happens, we're done with it at the end of this quarter. And so whether we're at the low end of the range, we're happy, or it's at the high end of the range, it doesn't matter because we move on to a world that we've been waiting for, I'm talking about it for a while, in which we're just really selling only one -- we're only selling the new model.

We had a terrific start to FY '17, with more proof points that the transition from perpetual licenses to subscription and cloud offerings is going well.

We had a terrific start to FY '17, with more proof points that the transition from perpetual licenses to subscription and cloud offerings is going well. We're moving steadily ahead on our 2 big initiatives: first, we are increasing the lifetime customer value; secondly, we're driving increased adoption of our cloud-based solutions to better serve existing customers as well as expand into new segments. I'll share more details on our Q1 results and then talk more about our view around long-term shareholder value creation before getting into our outlook for the rest of the year.
As I mentioned last quarter, the primary focus for us through the transition is driving subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue or ARR. In total, we added 132,000 net new subscriptions in the quarter. New model subscription additions more than doubled to 140,000. And while we expected maintenance subscriptions to decline in conjunction with the end of sale of perpetual licenses on individual products at the end of Q4, total maintenance subscriptions declined by only 8,000 as our renewal rate for maintenance continues to increase.
Q1 was the first quarter where customers no longer had the option to buy a perpetual license for individual products such as AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT. As a result, additions from product subscription, formerly known as desktop subscription, jumped dramatically by 125% sequentially and by nearly 350% year-over-year.
Helping drive product subscription growth in Q1 was a promotion targeted at converting our legacy non-subscriber base to new product subscriptions. This promotion captured legacy non-subscribers who are customers that purchased a perpetual license sometime in the past and wanted to trade in their old perpetual license for a product subscription at a discount. It turned out to be one of the most successful promotions we've ever run and contributed over 25,000 net new model subscriptions to the quarter.
As we analyzed the data, the really interesting part was that over 50% of those taking advantage of the promotion were using versions from 7 years back or older. We've talked about the opportunity to convert a portion of the estimated 2.8 million non-subscribers, which captures a 5-year look back. We knew there was a meaningful number of active users beyond that 5-year look back, and this was a great validation of that point.
New model subscriptions also got a strong contribution from our enterprise flexible license or EBA customers. I mentioned on last quarter's call that in Q4, we signed up a record number of enterprise customers for these token-based or consumption-style EBAs and that because of the way we count those subscriptions, we'd see the benefit to net new subscriptions in Q1 as we did in the first quarter of last year. These EBAs contributed more than 25,000 subscription additions in Q1 this year. EBAs with our large enterprise customers have been a very successful component of our transition, leading to both increased subscriptions and account value while creating increased flexibility for our customers.
We also had a record quarter for cloud subscription additions in Q1, which increased nearly 50% sequentially. BIM 360 and PLM 360 continue to lead the way, but we're also having success with our other cloud products such as Shotgun, A360 and Fusion 360.
Our cloud-based products continue to bring in new customers to Autodesk. Our newest cloud product is our IoT platform, Fusion Kinect, formerly known as SeeControl, a service that helps manufacturers and system integrators connect, analyze, control and manage things remotely, which is gaining traction. Just as we changed the CAD, CAM and PLM markets with cloud-based products, we're doing the same within the Internet of Things, enabling our customers to easily incorporate IoT capabilities into their projects. 
In Q1, we landed a 6-figure IoT deal with an industrial manufacturing company, and did so by competing head-to-head against other well-known competitors. This is an exceptional win because the customer is considered a pioneer in IoT [ph] and has been making connected products as part of their core business strategy for several years.
It's important to note that our channel partners are fully engaged with our subscription model. 63% of new model subscription additions came through our channel partners compared to just 27% in Q1 last year. We're also excited about the number of subscriptions coming through our eStore, which have more than doubled from Q1 last year. Our total direct sales increased to 25% in the first quarter. That's up from just 15% 2 years ago, and it's still in the early days for our eStore.
The growth of new model subscriptions fueled a 76% year-on-year constant currency increase in new model ARR. Total recurring revenue jumped to 70% of our total reported revenues compared to 53% last quarter. Total ARR growth was 12% at constant currency year-on-year. Remember when evaluating total ARR growth relative to our long-term targets that this number will build over the next 3 quarters as new model becomes an increasingly large component of total ARR. So we're very comfortable with the growth we experienced here in Q1.
Another metric that we've talked about in recent quarters about has been unit volume. When comparing our unit volume to the first quarter last year, it was in line with our expectations. On the expense side, we are diligently controlling our spending. As a result of the restructuring action we took early in the quarter, our total spend decreased more than 2 percentage points year-on-year. We are continuing to make structural changes that allow us to spend less yet focus on our key initiatives. We are carefully balancing the need for financial discipline with the need to invest to drive the long-term health of the company.
Overall, we are very pleased with the Q1 results, which are a great start to the year and reinforce our confidence that the transition is working for our customers, our partners and Autodesk.
We are eagerly looking forward to the end of Q2 when we stop selling perpetual licenses for Suites and become fully immersed in the subscription model. Another exciting factor about Q3 is that we'll begin selling what can be thought of as our next generation of Suites, called Collections. We won't officially launch it with our customers until next week, but I'll give you a little preview. Collections will be the most convenient way for customers to access a wide selection of both our desktop software and our cloud services. We're significantly reducing complexity by offering just 3 Collections: one for AEC, one for manufacturing and one for M&E [ph]. The value for our customers is tremendous and well exceeds the premium suite. We're offering single-user and multi-user access and choices of different term lengths to fit their needs. 
Suites have been a tremendous success since we launched them over 5 years ago, and Collections will take it to the next level by giving greater flexibility to our customers and increasing the lifetime value for us.
That's a good segue into what I touched on last quarter, and that's about what we do to create long-term value for our shareholders. I'm revisiting this because I feel that what we're ultimately aiming to accomplish, which is positioning Autodesk to lead the next-generation design, is being somewhat lost in the noise of quarterly financial results.
Our transition is really happening on 2 vectors. The first is the business model and pricing transition that is happening now where our customers are moving to term-based subscriptions. Over the next 3 years, we expect this process to move to a highly predictable model and a significant increase in the value our customers get from our products. In support of this model change, we are simplifying our entire go-to-market strategy to align with the concept of being an all-subscription company. The result will be meaningful increases in the business we do directly with our customers at the enterprise and e-commerce levels. In turn, these changes ultimately reduce our cost structure and increase how effectively we serve our customers.
The second vector of our transition is how we are building platforms to exploit the cloud and dramatically expand the size of our market opportunities. The investments we've made in this area, which started over 3 years ago, have allowed us to get a sizable lead on our current competitors as well as the many well-funded startups. We've seen the platform shift movie before. Incumbents will slowly become less relevant while the world changes around them. We're investing to secure the future of Autodesk, and our new cloud-based products are already the undisputed leaders in their respective categories.
It's not just about making browser-based design tools. It's about market expansion. Mobile and cloud technologies are opening up significant opportunities in areas of construction and manufacturing that are completely new to Autodesk. Again, our framework for building long-term shareholder value is to increase the lifetime value of every customer, change our cost structure and the means by which we reach customers and finally, to build the best cloud and mobile-based products and services in the industry as the underlying platform shifts to the cloud. While many people are focused on the business model shift, winning the leadership position in the cloud leads to a long-term sustainable competitive advantage.
Now turning to our Q2 and full year outlook. I mentioned on last quarter's call that the current fiscal year is the most unique in the company's history as we complete the transition from perpetual licenses to subscriptions at the end of Q2. None of the traditional seasonality patterns for sales metrics will be applicable, nor will year-over-year growth rates of traditional financial metrics be helpful in understanding how we are performing through the transition. Similar to our view on Q1, hitting the low end of our revenue range while exceeding our subscription guidance is a desirable outcome for the year.
Our view of the macroeconomic environment's impact on our business hasn't changed since last quarter or for the past several quarters for that matter. The global conditions have been uneven. Most of the emerging markets have been difficult, but most of the mature markets have been relatively good. As we evaluated our strong Q1 results, we didn't see any meaningful change in the demand environment.
For the end of sale of Suites here in Q2, we expect the dynamics will resemble what we saw in Q4 with the end of sale for individual products. In other words, we're expecting some surge activity but not a lot. Remember that our unit volume and revenue contribution from Suites is much lower than our individual products, and we've already seen a significant shift in Suites customers to the new model. While this is good news in terms of moving them to a higher-value offering now and not having to convert them later, it tamps down our expectations for a surge in buying at the end of this quarter. Also while the promo targeting legacy customers was successful in Q1, we will not be running that promo here in Q2.
Q3 will be our first quarter of subscription-only sales across the board and we'll likely experience sequential slowdown. That's when you can expect to see promotions aimed at our legacy customers again. If you're not modeling a sequential decline for Q3 already, you should be. And it's consistent with our expectations for the full year, which are unchanged. And Q4 should begin to show more normal sales trends in our new subscription-only model.
We made a slight adjustment to our FY '17 outlook for EPS based on our revised tax rate assumption for the year. Otherwise, we remain comfortable with our full year outlook for FY '17 and our long-term goals of growing our subscription base by a 20% CAGR over the next 4 years, which will drive a 24% CAGR in ARR. We remain committed to keeping spend growth roughly flat to slightly down this year and flat in FY '18. When coupled with our top line projections, we see a path to free cash flow of roughly $6 per share in FY '20 and $11 per share in FY '23.
To wrap things up, our business model transition is in full swing now and exceeding expectations. We're very excited to be another major step further along in the transition, and by the second half of this year, we will fully be in a subscription-only model. Customers and partners are embracing the new model, both subscriptions and the cloud. At the same time, we're driving higher lifetime value, simplifying our offerings and our go-to-market activities and significantly increasing our market opportunity as we lead the next wave of design and engineering software to the cloud. We have a clear vision and plan for creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business in the years to come.

So as we were lo",693,"Yes, so let me -- that's a great question. And I know it's got a lot of attention, so let me just back up a little bit and give you a more holistic view of moving people to subscriptions and then try to place the 2.8 million into context. So as we were looking at building out the new model that would be subscription-only, we basically said that there were 3 pools of people that we could draw from: one were the non-subscribers, the second were the non-payers or the pirates, and the third are -- I'll just call them nonusers, basically people who are either not using software or are using competitive software. Share shift we would move them over. So there are 3 different distinct pools with different dynamics. One of the questions came up frequently was, ""Okay, what is the size of the people who had bought products that aren't on subscription?"" And what we've said is our new model -- when we built out our model, we were looking to add about 800,000 subscribers to the total from this collection of sources. People wanted to know the size of the -- wanted to know the size of each of these relative segments. Here's a way to think about it. On the non-subscribers, one data point we gave you, and it was only just one, was that in the last 5 years and it had remained relatively constant, which is why we chose it is a convenient data point, there were 2.8 million people who had bought that had -- that had an attached subscription. We put a caveat around that, that said some of those people may no longer be users and may no longer be actively using it. They may have come back in by buying a new license. They may have joined a different firm. They could have passed away for all we know. But we wanted to give a size to it. There are clearly people beyond that 5 years who are still using software as evidenced by that. So it is just an indication, and if you look, it's interesting and somewhat obvious in at least retrospect. But if you look at the legacy promo results, there are more people that bought that were back 6 and 7 years that were -- than in the years, 1, 2 and 3. And the mean was around 7 years and it's a bell-shaped distribution. So that should give you an indication of what goes on in that base. So it is bigger. And what we had said is we thought we could convert 30%. So taking into account how many people were no longer active or the new model would not appeal to them, we thought we could convert 30 base -- 30% of the base. And that's what we were indicating was our assumption in the model. The second one is, and I think people overlook this and miss out on the dynamics as we move to a more connected experience for our customers, is that right now, somewhere around half or slightly more than half of the usage of our products in the world is by people who do not pay for it. Once again, you've got to put a discount on how many people will actually pay for it when they are forced to. But at least as many people don't pay for the software they use as the ones who do. And then the third one, which I did not rule out as an important contribution to the subscription additions, are the people who are using competitive products. I think much of what we've done to lead the way in cloud-based engineering software is going to be very attractive and will be a source of moving customers from mainly the legacy providers who have, frankly, kind of dropped the ball on moving their software to the cloud. So sorry for the very long-winded answer to your question, but I thought it would -- I knew that [indiscernible] would come up and I just wanted to try to put it in a broader context."

I thought it was very useful that you highlighted the technology and product vector of the strategy and not just the model change. So on that point, could you talk about how you're thinking about the timing of delivery of new technology over time? In other words, for example, Inventor is being updated, seemingly, on a quarterly basis. Though back in December in AU, we heard that AutoCAD may go to a more than 12-month cycle for major releases. And could you talk about what you think the relevance is of the schedule of various products is to sustaining the flywheel of the subscriptions model? And one almost obviously missing brand in your portfolio is, let's call it, Revit 360. You've got all kinds of other 360s, but you don't have a Revit 360. Is that something that would make sense for you?"

So generally, the frequency of updates is inversely proportional to the maturity of the product, just broadly speaking, that if you were to look and say a very mature product like AutoCAD needs the least frequent updates, products like any of the 360",272,"Yes. So generally, the frequency of updates is inversely proportional to the maturity of the product, just broadly speaking, that if you were to look and say a very mature product like AutoCAD needs the least frequent updates, products like any of the 360 -- like Fusion 360 gets updated relatively frequently. If you follow like Fusion, there's weekly and biweekly small updates. And certainly every month, there's an update with significant functionality. We'll continue that. In some ways, it's not the overall quantity of stuff delivered. One of the things that changes in this new model is really the frequency. And what I think it changes is also the digestibility. If I get it in one big meal a year versus having dozens of small snacks. And a little bit what this allows us to do with our newer products is have not only us deploy the software more effectively but our customers more easily discover what's in it and put it to use as quickly as possible. So when we kind of continue on that kind of cadence of the newer cloud-based products will be frequently updated, the other ones will be a little bit slower. But both the traditional products and the new cloud services will need to be thought of differently as connected experiences, which now allow us to do things in the ongoing use and in the update that were just not possible before. As a matter of fact, even when we look at some of the data I was just reporting on in the answer to Saket's question, a bunch of that comes from frequent connectivity."

I realize that the way we do it is accurate in terms of accounting standard, the way we do it today, but confusing from a modeling standpoint.

That's not ready yet, but that's something that is implied [ph]. And I think it will be a very investor-friendly move when we can make that. To your first question on capacity, we see the -- so we built the entitlement engine. We are -- as you think about it, it's a multi-phase process, right? We have to build the capability on the back end. Then each product has to build in the capability to recognize the new back end and use that as a way of turning it on so that they can get access to it. And then as those products ramp up, the capacity on the back end gets tested. So we haven't had any problems at this point as we've ramped up the new model subscriptions fairly rapidly.

Probably the headline is that it's unchanged and it continues to be soft in a handful, mostly of developing markets and pretty robust across the more mature markets. We paid special attention this time. And as you guys have noted, and as I've been [ph] reading your reports, I would say a few of our competitors, mostly in the manufacturing space but also 1 or 2 in the construction space, seemed to have a little rougher time of it this time. And what we're really trying to do is just parse how much was self-induced versus macroeconomically driven. I think at the end, I think most of the kind of shortfalls or stubbed toes seem to be mostly self-inflicted. And so we're pretty comfortable. I just talked to our sales leaders the other day. Yesterday, I met with some of our channel partners who represent a huge percentage of our [indiscernible] to the channel. And they feel -- they're feeling relatively bullish. So there's nothing in our guidance or the forecast that would suggest any big change one way or another. Also across industry segments, relatively healthy across the board. If I wanted to put like a little gold star next to anything, I would say AEC seems to be just a little bit stronger on a worldwide basis. Once again, maybe better than the ADI index is that informal [indiscernible] count. There are just cities in the world where it's hard to reach a [indiscernible] right now. There's just so many in use. And so that to me would be a little bit of a bias towards the upside is just strength in AEC, but otherwise, stable, healthy, relatively unchanged."

That would be a nice move. The Collections going forward will have a fair number of cloud services, including the consumption-based models built into them. So that will be a way for customers to become more familiar, more comfortable and hopefully more desirous of more cloud functionality. The only thing we're doing with a lot of the cloud stuff is we're really reaching new segments. It's this cloud mobile combination, for example, that's allowing us to do -- and if you look at the products, BIM 360 and PLM 360, I mean, reaching large parts of the enterprise or large parts of an industry that were not otherwise accessible to us.

Many of them will be done on a consumption basis. So for example, you will be able to either buy consumption plans or pay-as-you-go models in order to tap into the power of the cloud. So for example, visualization, analysis, being able to run many of these compute intensive jobs on the cloud side is going to be a part of the rest of the year. And we'll continue to roll it out. We've already seen really good pickup in this. People are hugely appreciating this thing of -- and sometimes people forget how compute intensive our apps are. And so instead of setting off a job and going for a cup of coffee, people are now able to set off a job on our cloud and then continue working. And so this has been a big productivity boost. Customers are really liking it. We're already doing a fair amount of visualization and are really starting to see a pickup in analysis and simulation, and I think that will continue. The other place where we've seen a fair amount of cloud-based stuff that's really important is the second axis of what's important about the cloud, which is all around collaboration and coordination.

And what we're seeing in our guidance is in sync with what our expectations were. So it's not a question of a change in seasonality pattern versus what had been expected previously. If you just look at coming to the end of sale of Suites during Q2, we talked about earlier, we're expecting really a bit of a muted buy ahead versus what we saw on individual products. On the stand-alone products, remember we sized it at the end of Q4. There was only about a 10% increase in volume that came through. Suites, to begin with, are a much lower-volume product than stand-alone products are. We're also seeing and have seen a really steady increase in the uptake of customers already buying the new model on Suites. So not waiting for it to hit end of sale. There's been a lot of interest in Suites customers buying the new model. So if you add those 2 together, we're expecting a small amount of buy-ahead activity in Q2 on Suites but not a huge amount. If it's bigger than we think, we'll be toward the high end of the range.

It's different, and this is really just our best estimate of what's going to go on. The more important news for us is that whatever happens, we're done with it at the end of this quarter. And so whether we're at the low end of the range and we're happy, or it's at the high end of the range, it doesn't matter because we move on to a world that we've been waiting for and talking about for a while, in which we're just really selling only one -- we're only selling the new model.

We had a terrific quarter, and we reached a very important milestone with the end of selling perpetual licenses. Our Q2 results mark another solid quarter of execution and progress on our 2 big initiatives: Increasing lifetime customer value",2330,"Thanks, Dave. We had a terrific quarter, and we reached a very important milestone with the end of selling perpetual licenses. Our Q2 results mark another solid quarter of execution and progress on our 2 big initiatives: Increasing lifetime customer value; and secondly, driving increased adoption of our cloud-based solutions. I'll share more details on our Q2 results and then update you on what we've been doing around creating long-term shareholder value before getting into the current quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. 
Starting with subscription numbers, we added 109,000 net use subscriptions in the quarter. We're really happy with the growth that new model subscription additions, which more than doubled year-over-year to 125,000. It was a strong quarter for product subscriptions, which drove the vast majority of the new model sub additions and is the clearest sign of the progress on the transition with our customers and partners. Keep in mind that we didn't have any big promotions going on like we did in Q1. 
Product subscriptions had strong sequential growth and dramatic year-over-year growth of over 3x. Product subscriptions come to us from a number of sources. We're really pleased to see that one of the primary sources continues to be net new customers, which accounted for approximately 1/3 of product subscription additions in Q2. It's impossible to get perfect clarity on these new customers, but it's likely that a portion of these people were previously pirating software and now have a much more affordable option with our subscriptions. Still others have been using alternative design tool and can now get access to better software. 
Looking at the other new model subscription types. Our token-based EBAs experienced good year-over-year growth, but added fewer than we did in our seasonally high Q1. And once again, we had a record quarter for cloud subscription additions. BIM 360 and Fusion 360 are leading the way, and we continue to have success with our other cloud products such as Shotgun and Fusion life cycle, formerly known as PLM 360. We continue to build on our leadership in the cloud and our cloud services play an increasingly important role in our transition. 
Maintenance is our other primary subscription bucket. The renewal rate for maintenance subscriptions increase significantly year-over-year and remain near historic highs. Keep in mind as we go forward, we'll start to experience larger decreases in maintenance subscriptions since we are no longer selling perpetual licenses. We will also be incentivizing customers on maintenance to switch to a product subscription. As we've outlined in the past, by the end of next fiscal year, we expect to have more customers in our new model subscriptions than maintenance subscriptions. We are adamant about supporting our maintenance customers, and at some point in the future, these programs will converge into a single subscription offering. 
As we've indicated before, growth in subscriptions will drive growth in ARR. The strong growth in new model subscriptions in Q2 fueled an 86% year-on-year constant currency increase in new model ARR. Total ARR was -- growth was 14% in constant currency year-over-year. Total recurring revenue was 67% of our total reported revenues. That's a big jump compared to 55% in Q2 last year and a slight decrease from last quarter due to the surge in perpetual Suites sales. With just a few exceptions, we're now in a subscription-only model, so you can expect another jump in the percentage of recurring revenue, starting in Q3. 
Our Q2 revenue results were well ahead of expectations, and were influenced primarily by a larger-than-expected surge in last opportunity buying of perpetual licenses for Suites. Recall that in Q4, we added 10% increase in unit volume related to the end of sale of perpetual licenses for individual products. Our analysis of Q2 suggest that just under 20% of our unit volume was related to end-of-sale activities for Suites. This was bigger than expected and it like to give you some insights on what we saw. It was only over the last 2 weeks of the quarter that we started to experience a surge in demand for Suites perpetual licenses, almost entirely driven by the channel. What was really interesting is that at the same time we experienced the uptick in perpetual license sales, we also saw the acceleration of product subscriptions sales. The unique aspect of this activity relative to what we experienced in Q4 is that roughly half of the volume for Suites came from customers cross grading from an individual product. This is neutral to the subscription count since the customer has to be on maintenance in order to cross grade, but it's absolutely positive for in-period revenue and, ultimately, ARR, since the will be paying more annually for their maintenance plan. Overall, the increase in volume related to the end of perpetual Suites was greater than we anticipated, but we are very pleased with how product subscriptions performed in the quarter and the overall net result as positive for Autodesk. 
Our total unit volume in the second quarter increase compared to Q2 last year and was in line with our expectations even when normalizing for the increased activity related to the end of sale for Suites. It's not surprising that the end of sale for Suites drove a sequential uptick in license revenue. What might be surprising if that we're not seeing faster growth in our as-reported subscription revenue line. 
There are 2 things that are inhibiting that growth. The first is FX, which is causing about a 4-point headwind. The second is the accounting treatment of product subscriptions and EBA revenue. While our new model subscriptions are deferred and recognized ratably over their contract length, a sizable portion of both our product subscription and our EBAs are recognized as license revenue. In fact, roughly 80% of product subscription and roughly 55% of EBAs get recorded as license revenue. Cloud is the only new model subscription type that gets 100% recorded as obstruction revenue. If all the new model subscriptions were recognized 100% as subscription revenue, that line would show 10% year-over-year growth as reported and 14% growth adjusted for currency. We are currently working towards providing a clearer breakout of our reporting so that our total as subscription revenue can be seen directly in our reporting disclosures. 
Now let me get into a few more details of our Q2 results. By now, it should be very clear that our channel partners are fully engaged with our subscription model. 68% of new model subscription additions came through our channel partners compared to just 47% in Q2 last year and 63% last quarter. The volume of subscriptions coming through our eStore also continued to gain momentum and nearly doubled from Q2 last year. Total direct revenue was 25% in the second quarter despite most of the search from the end of sale of Suites coming through the channel. That's up from 2% in Q2 last year. 
On the expense side. Our total spend decreased by almost 4% as we continue to diligently control our spending. We are continuing to make structural changes that allow us to spend less yet focus on our key initiatives. While we are being very disciplined about our spending, we are doing it without compromising the long-term health of the company. We also increased our stock buyback in Q2 to $170 million, in light of the dip in the stock caused by a temporary panic around the Brexit vote. 
Overall, we were very pleased with the Q2 results. All of the trends we sawed reinforce our confidence that the transition is working for our customers, our partners and Autodesk. That's a good segue way into what I've touched on in the last couple of earnings calls about what we're doing to create long-term value for our shareholders. We continue to get many questions in this area so I'm happy to talk about it. If you've been around the tech industry as long as I have, you've no doubt seen the carnage of once great technology companies that ultimately failed to innovate and keep their competitive advantage. Autodesk has been the leader in the world of design and engineering software for over 30 years and what we're doing with this transition is positioning Autodesk to lead the next generation of this kind of software. Our transition happens on 2 fronts. We are currently in the midst of a business model and pricing transition, where our customers are moving to term-based subscriptions. This will lead to a highly predictable model over time and a significant increase in the value our customers get from our products. The best indicator for this is the rapid growth we're experiencing in new model subscriptions and new model ARR. In support of this model change, we are simplifying our entire go-to-market strategy and reducing our cost structure while we increase our ability to more effectively serve our customers. 
The second front of our transition is how we are building platforms to exploit the cloud and dramatically expand the size of our market opportunities. We're well ahead of our traditional competitors on this front, and we're investing to secure the future of Autodesk. These mobile and cloud technologies are opening up significant opportunities in the areas of construction and Manufacturing that are completely new to Autodesk. These new platforms are for once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the competitive landscape. Our cloud-based products continue to gain momentum and are already the undisputed leaders in their respective categories. 
So this is how I'd summarize how we're building long-term shareholder value with 3 simple bullets: one, we are increasing the lifetime value of every customer; two, we're changing our cost structure by focusing our product portfolio and go-to-market strategies; and three, we're building the best cloud and mobile-based products and services in the industry, which significantly expands our total available market as the underlying technology platform shifts to the cloud. 
Now let's take a look at what's going on here in the current quarter, Q3. Our newly introduced Collections are a great example of increasing lifetime customer value. On August 1, we launched Collections, which is our next generation of Suites with the addition of our cloud services. Suites was tremendously successful for Autodesk, but with Collections, we're significantly reducing complexity by offering just 3 Collections, one for AEC, one for Manufacturing and one for M&E, making them easier to sell and consume. We're offering single-user and multiuser access and choices of different term lengths to fit their needs. The value of our customers is tremendous and well exceeds the premium suite. We priced Collections so that the average customer value to Autodesk will increase as well. We're only 25 days into selling Collections, but we're very happy with the start. 
Despite the strong performance of Suites at the end of Q2, in the first few weeks, we received the same volume levels for Collections that we experienced for Suites in the same period a year ago. From a tactical standpoint, some of you have been asking about pricing and promotions. We are currently running another promotion aimed at our legacy customers. It's similar to the very successful promotion that we ran in Q1, but the discount are smaller. You can expect us to continue to work to convert these legacy customers with the various promotions and incentives as we go forward. Like I've said before, running a business in different than running a spreadsheet. One area that we constantly evaluate is how we use pricing to drive subscriptions and ARR growth. Having said that, we wouldn't make significant decisions around packaging for pricing without first testing in certain markets. This is especially true when it comes to our flagship products like AutoCAD and guilty. 
In early September, pricing changes will go into effect that will rationalize the pricing of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. We believe these moves will drive customers to the right products for their needs and higher billings and ARR for Autodesk. 
Now turning to our outlook for Q3 and the full year. Our review of the macroeconomic environment's impact on our business hasn't changed over the past several quarters. The global conditions have remained uneven with most of the mature markets performing relatively well, while most of the emerging markets have been challenged. As we evaluated our strong Q2 results, we didn't see any meaningful change in the demand environment. And as I indicated earlier, we don't see any immediate fallout from the Brexit vote. As always, it's impossible to say what the long-term impact might be, but we don't see any near-term risk. Our strong Q2 results likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year, but we're comfortable with bringing up the bottom end of our previous ranges for both revenue and EPS for FY '17. We're also lowering our spend projection for FY '17 based on the better-than-expected progress we've made on this front. We remain confident in our long-term goals of growing our subscription base by 20% CAGR through FY '20, which will drive a 24% CAGR in ARR. We also remain committed to keeping spend growth flat in FY '18. The lower spend projection also enhances our projected path to free cash flow off roughly $6 per share in FY '20 and $11 per share in FY '23. 
So to wrap things up, we're very pleased with the consistent execution over the past few quarters. We're really excited to be another major step further along in the transition and now fully in the subscription-only model. We have a clear vision and plan for creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business in the years to come. We are focused on driving higher lifetime value, simplifying our offerings and our go-to-market activities and significantly increasing our market opportunities as we lead the next wave of design and engineering software to the cloud.

Could you give some specifics as to how you're thinking about what the changes might be? And is this part of what you referred to in the past as SRP realization as a concept for you to help improve pricing and margin? Secondly, with respect to the decay of classic maintenance over time, how are you thinking about the rate of that decline? When we look at one of your competitors, I think, you see which is moving mostly but not entirely to subscription, the state of rate of decline for their maintenance is low to mid-single digits. So would you anticipate going fully to [indiscernible] subscription that your decay of maintenance might be so much faster than that?"

So let me start with the pricing and then Scott and I can kind of tag team one about the maintenance decline. So starting to the pricing. What we wanted to do was, as I said, kind of rationalize the 3 different price points of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. Whenever possible, we would like customers to get the right product. More often than not, that is on AutoCAD verticals, particularly tailored to what the discipline they're in. And on the other side, for the more casual users, LT is clearly the more appropriate product. And what we were trying to do is move the price points apart, get the appropriate separations. And what we saw and a kind of referred to in the remarks, in our testing is that we can with the right pricing, move more healthy customers to AutoCAD and AutoCAD customers to the verticals. And so this is a part of the overall pricing, I wouldn't say it's particularly what I would refer to as ARPU realization. It's just increasing total pricing, but it's part of pricing optimization strategy. And let me take the first pass. A couple of things will contribute to the maintenance decline, as you said, classic maintenance. One is going to be the of from people who just choose not to renew for all of the usual reasons. The second one would be the conversion of the maintenance customers on to the subscription side. And on the first  one, we talked a little bit about it in that we said that we expected the subscription base to be larger by the end of next year. We gave you some hints or at least we gave you [indiscernible] trouble you can work on tonight, Jay. And then on the second one, we also talked a little bit about programmatic ways of doing that over time, highly will continue to encourage customers to move from classic maintenance to the new subscriptions. Scott, do you want to add something?"

The decay rate. We feel very, within that pool of maintenance subscribers by the way between low-end LT customers that have a slightly lower renewal rate versus Suites maintenance customers, which have a much higher renewal rate. So as that pull moves over, the maintenance pull will go continually down from this point, basically 1 minus per turn rate. And at that point, what you'll see is the mix will shift inside that pool. So if you think of maintenance revenue as a key time SKU, think of the prize, the average price inside there beginning to shift more toward Suites customers out through time. But the overall decline will be driven by the lower LT customers. I think the other way to peg this, Jay, as you sit down into your modeling, is what we said, I think we should do these things back at Investor Day, that our expectation is by the end of next year, the number of maintenance subscribers and the maintenance ARR will be below the new model subscribers and to model ARR by the end of next year."

And by the way, we predicted that, I think, pretty accurately versus what the results were. The piece that also happens, of course, when we saw our last perpetual license, you also saw your last crossgrade. And we saw a lot of the same behavior that we saw at the end -- if you remember when we stop selling upgrades in our fiscal '15, so more than a year ago, we saw a big spike in demand for people who were already using our product, but decided they wanted to upgrade to a more full function product. They're willing to pay more for it. We saw some of that same upgrade-like behavior happened within our crossgrade. And I think, that's the piece that surprised us a bit and it's a positive for ARR. It's a neutral for subscribers because you had to be on maintenance to be eligible for the cross grade, but it's a positive for ARR and is a positive for total revenue going forward. So that's of the way I would think about the surge we saw at the end of this quarter."

Let me just divide the markets and talk about the dynamics slightly differently. In the ASC market, which is more product based, it comes up for a building or roadway or a bridge. There is more willingness -- there's slightly more willingness to shift with new projects as new teams come together. I think, the place where you hear even greater reluctance is in Manufacturing. And there, we did -- we've done a number of things that we've rolled out across our product portfolio that allow customers to work in new software and access the data that they created over the last couple of decades. So they can work with the native data, they don't -- obviously, as always, we can translate it and convert it, But even more importantly, we now let customers leave their data in a data format and work on it whether they're doing modeling or visualization or simulations. So that is over the last 2 years, a pretty big breakthroughs in giving people a much smoother ramp to go from one of the legacy products to a new one. And at a certain point, one of the other things that has to happen in motivating people to move to something is the new stuff has to be that much better. If you think about it, particularly Manufacturing, many of the products that people are using are more than 20 years old. And we would like to think in the industry that we can do better than having 20-year-old products be state of the art. So part of it is making the new products and the new product experiences much more compelling. The other is to reassure people about being able to migrate their data or to use all their data and access it for as long as they need to."

So heavier in Q4 than in Q3 would be normal demand patterns. We also see Q4 typically heavy on EBA sales, although as you see in the last couple of years, there's a lot of them in Q4, the EBAs will pick up those subs in Q1. So think of this as being driven -- the Q3 versus Q4 driven by normal seasonality pattern first.

So we think Collections are a nice way to both simplify and get people that easy ramp the deal cloud services. So what they're familiar with plus the new stuff. Let me jump to the other side of it is our EBAs -- and as you mentioned, the technology behind the T-Flex is really in the less than the top 1% of our accounts. So it has a lot of room to grow before these 2 things run into each other. And what I would add is I would expect to see more flexibility in our product offerings going forward. Collections it's really just a first step in the door of what we're going to do in terms of making sure the customers have more flexibility. And that's regardless of how would it will be sold. At the same time, we've documented and we've talked about how we really want to see our EBAs go out to a broader audience and how that will grow over time. So we think there's a lot of room between the 2 right now, and there's actually an opportunity to introduce other offerings that have that level of activity from T-Flex. For example, it can easily be sold by our channel partners."

119902,378528815,1039276,"Autodesk, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Autodesk, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave. We had a terrific quarter, and we reached a very important milestone with the end of selling perpetual licenses. Our Q2 results mark another solid quarter of execution and progress on our 2 big initiatives: increasing lifetime customer value",2327,"Thanks, Dave. We had a terrific quarter, and we reached a very important milestone with the end of selling perpetual licenses. Our Q2 results mark another solid quarter of execution and progress on our 2 big initiatives: increasing lifetime customer value; and secondly, driving increased adoption of our cloud-based solutions. I'll share more details on our Q2 results and then update you on what we've been doing around creating long-term shareholder value before getting into the current quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. 
Starting with subscription numbers, we added 109,000 net new subscriptions in the quarter. We're really happy with the growth of new model subscription additions, which more than doubled year-over-year to 125,000. It was a strong quarter for product subscriptions, which drove the vast majority of the new model sub additions and is a clear sign of the progress on the transition with our customers and partners. Keep in mind that we didn't have any big promotions going on like we did in Q1. 
Product subscriptions had strong sequential growth and dramatic year-over-year growth of over 3x. Product subscriptions come to us from a number of sources. We're really pleased to see that one of the primary sources continues to be net new customers, which accounted for approximately 1/3 of product subscription additions in Q2. It's impossible to get perfect clarity on these new customers, but it's likely that a portion of these people were previously pirating software and now have a much more affordable option with our subscription. Still others have been using alternative design tool and can now get access to better software. 
Looking at the other new model subscription types, our token-based EBAs experienced good year-over-year growth, but added fewer than we did in our seasonally high Q1. And once again, we had a record quarter for cloud subscription additions. BIM 360 and Fusion 360 are leading the way, and we continue to have success with our other cloud products such as Shotgun and Fusion life cycle, formerly known as PLM 360. We continue to build on our leadership in the cloud and our cloud services play an increasingly important role in our transition. 
Maintenance is our other primary subscription bucket. The renewal rate for maintenance subscriptions increased significantly year-over-year and remain near historic highs. Keep in mind that as we go forward, we'll start to experience larger decreases in maintenance subscriptions since we are no longer selling perpetual licenses. We'll also be incentivizing customers on maintenance to switch to a product subscription. As we've outlined in the past, by the end of next fiscal year, we expect to have more customers on our new model subscriptions than maintenance subscriptions. We are adamant about supporting our maintenance customers, and at some point in the future, these programs will converge into a single subscription offering. 
As we've indicated before, growth in subscriptions will drive growth in ARR. The strong growth in new model subscriptions in Q2 fueled an 86% year-on-year constant currency increase in new model ARR. Total ARR was -- growth was 14% in constant currency year-over-year. Total recurring revenue was 67% of our total reported revenues. That's a big jump compared to 55% in Q2 last year and a slight decrease from last quarter due to the surge in perpetual suite sales. With just a few exceptions, we're now in a subscription-only model, so you can expect another jump in the percentage of recurring revenue starting in Q3. 
Our Q2 revenue results were well ahead of expectations and were influenced primarily by a larger-than-expected surge in last opportunity buying of perpetual licenses for Suites. Recall that in Q4, we added 10% increase in unit volume related to the end of sale of perpetual licenses for individual products. Our analysis of Q2 suggest that just under 20% of our unit volume was related to end-of-sale activity for Suites. This was bigger than expected, and I'd like to give you some insights on what we saw. It was only over the last 2 weeks of the quarter that we started to experience a surge in demand for Suites perpetual licenses, almost entirely driven by the channel. What was really interesting is that at the same time we experienced the uptick in perpetual license sales, we also saw the acceleration of product subscription sales. The unique aspect of this activity relative to what we experienced in Q4 is that roughly half of the volume for Suites came from customers crossgrading from an individual product. This is neutral to the subscription count since the customer has to be on maintenance in order to cross grade, but it's absolutely positive for in-period revenue and ultimately ARR, since the customer will be paying more annually for their maintenance plan. Overall, the increase in volume related to the end of perpetual Suites was greater than we anticipated, but we are very pleased with how product subscriptions performed in the quarter and the overall net result is positive for Autodesk. 
Our total unit volume in the second quarter increased compared to Q2 last year and was in line with our expectations even when normalizing for the increased activity related to the end of sale for Suites. It's not surprising that the end of sale for Suites drove a sequential uptick in license revenue. What might be surprising is that we're not seeing faster growth in our as-reported subscription revenue line. 
There are 2 things that are inhibiting that growth. The first is FX, which is causing about a 4-point headwind. The second is the accounting treatment of product subscription and EBA revenue. While our new model subscriptions are deferred and recognized ratably over their contract length, a sizable portion of both our product subscription and our EBAs are recognized as license revenue. In fact, roughly 80% of product subscription and roughly 55% of EBAs get recorded as license revenue. Cloud is the only new model subscription type that gets 100% recorded as subscription revenue. If all the new model subscriptions were recognized 100% as subscription revenue, that line would show 10% year-over-year growth as reported and 14% growth adjusted for currency. We are currently working towards providing a clearer breakout of our reporting so that our total subscription revenue can be seen directly in our reporting disclosures. 
Now let me get into a few more details of our Q2 results. By now it should be very clear that our channel partners are fully engaged with our subscription model. 68% of new model subscription additions came through our channel partners compared to just 47% in Q2 last year and 63% last quarter. The volume of subscriptions coming through our eStore also continues to gain momentum and nearly doubled from Q2 last year. Total direct revenue was 25% in the second quarter despite most of the surge from the end of sale of Suites coming through the channel. That's up from 20% in Q2 last year. 
On the expense side, our total spend decreased by almost 4% as we continue to diligently control our spending. We are continuing to make structural changes that allow us to spend less yet focus on our key initiatives. While we are being very disciplined about our spending, we are doing it without compromising the long-term health of the company. We also increased our stock buyback in Q2 to $170 million in light of the dip in the stock caused by the temporary panic around the Brexit vote. 
Overall, we were very pleased with the Q2 results. All of the trends we saw reinforced our confidence that the transition is working for our customers, our partners and Autodesk. That's a good segue into what I've touched on in the last couple of earnings calls about what we're doing to create long-term value for our shareholders. We continue to get many questions in this area, so I'm happy to talk about it. If you've been around the tech industry as long as I have, you've no doubt seen the carnage of once great technology companies that ultimately failed to innovate and keep their competitive advantage. Autodesk has been the leader in the world of design and engineering software for over 30 years and what we're doing with this transition is positioning Autodesk to lead the next generation of this kind of software. Our transition happens on 2 fronts. We're currently in the midst of a business model and pricing transition, where our customers are moving to term-based subscriptions. This will lead to a highly predictable model over time and a significant increase in the value our customers get from our products. The best indicator for this is the rapid growth we're experiencing in new model subscriptions and new model ARR. In support of this model change, we are simplifying our entire go-to-market strategy and reducing our cost structure while we increase our ability to more effectively serve our customers. 
The second front of our transition is how we are building platforms to exploit the cloud and dramatically expand the size of our market opportunities. We're well ahead of our traditional competitors on this front, and we're investing to secure the future of Autodesk. These mobile and cloud technologies are opening up significant opportunities in the areas of construction and manufacturing that are completely new to Autodesk. These new platforms are for a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the competitive landscape. Our cloud-based products continue to gain momentum and are already the undisputed leaders in their respective categories. 
So this is how I'd summarize how we're building long-term shareholder value in 3 simple bullets: one, we're increasing the lifetime value of every customer; two, we're changing our cost structure by focusing our product portfolio and go-to-market strategies; and three, we're building the best cloud and mobile-based products and services in the industry, which significantly expands our total available market as the underlying technology platform shifts to the cloud. 
Now let's take a look at what's going on here in the current quarter, Q3. Our newly introduced Collections are a great example of increasing lifetime customer value. On August 1, we launched Collections, which is our next generation of Suites with the addition of our cloud services. Suites was tremendously successful for Autodesk, but with Collections, we're significantly reducing complexity by offering just 3 Collections, one for AEC, one for Manufacturing and one for M&E, making them easier to sell and consume. We're offering single-user and multi-user access and choices of different term lengths to fit their needs. The value of our customers is tremendous and well exceeds the premium suite. We've priced Collections so that the average customer value to Autodesk will increase as well. We're only 25 days into selling Collections, but we're very happy with the start. 
Despite the strong performance of Suites at the end of Q2, in their first few weeks we're seeing the same volume level for Collections that we experienced for Suites in the same period a year ago. From a tactical standpoint, some of you have been asking about pricing and promotions. We are currently running another promotion aimed at our legacy customers. It's similar to the very successful promotion that we ran in Q1, but the discount is smaller. You can expect us to continue to work to convert these legacy customers with various promotions and incentives as we go forward. Like I've said before, running a business is different than running a spreadsheet. One area that we constantly evaluate is how we use pricing to drive subscriptions and ARR growth. Having said that, we wouldn't make significant decisions around packaging or pricing without first testing in certain markets. This is especially true when it comes to our flagship products like AutoCAD and LT. 
In early September, pricing changes will go into effect that will rationalize the pricing of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. We believe these moves will drive customers to the right product for their needs at higher billings and ARR for Autodesk. 
Now turning to our outlook for Q3 and the full year. Our view of the macroeconomic environment's impact on our business hasn't changed over the past several quarters. The global conditions have remained uneven with most of the mature markets performing relatively well, while most of the emerging markets have been challenged. As we evaluated our strong Q2 results, we didn't see any meaningful change in the demand environment. And as I indicated earlier, we don't see any immediate fallout from the Brexit vote. As always, it's impossible to say what the long-term impact might be, but we don't see any near-term risk. Our strong Q2 results likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year, but we're comfortable with bringing up the bottom end of our previous ranges for both revenue and EPS for FY '17. We're also lowering our spend projection for FY '17 based on the better-than-expected progress we've made on this front. We remain confident in our long-term goals of growing our subscription base by a 20% CAGR through FY '20, which will drive a 24% CAGR in ARR. We also remain committed to keeping spend growth flat in FY '18. The lower spend projection also enhances our projected path to free cash flow of roughly $6 per share in FY '20 and $11 per share in FY '23. 
So to wrap things up, we're very pleased with the consistent execution over the past few quarters. We're really excited to be another major step further along in the transition and now fully in the subscription-only model. We have a clear vision and plan for creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business in the years to come.

Could you give some specifics as to how you're thinking about what the changes might be? And is this part of what you referred to in the past as SRP realization as a concept for you to help improve pricing and margin? Secondly, with respect to the decay of classic maintenance over time, how are you thinking about the rate of that decline? When we look at one of your competitors BBC, which is moving mostly but not entirely to subscription, the state of rate of decline for their maintenance is low to mid-single digit. So would you anticipate going fully to subscription that your decay of maintenance might be so much faster than that?"

So let me start with the pricing and then Scott and I can kind of tag team the one about the maintenance decline. So starting with the pricing, what we wanted to do was, as I said, kind of rationalize the 3 different price points of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. Whenever possible, we would like customers to get the right product. More often than not, that is on AutoCAD vertical, particularly tailored to what they -- the discipline they're in. And on the other side, for the more casual users, LT is clearly the more appropriate product. And what we were trying to do is move the price points apart, get the appropriate separation. And what we saw, I kind of referred to in the remarks, in our testing is that we can, with the right pricing, move more LT customers to AutoCAD and AutoCAD customers to the vertical. And so this is a part of the overall pricing. I wouldn't say it's particularly what I would refer to the SRP realization. It's just increasing total pricing, but it's part of a pricing optimization strategy. And let me take the first pass. Couple of things will contribute to the maintenance decline, as you said, classic maintenance. One is going to be the fall off from people who just choose not to renew for all of the usual reasons. The second one will be the conversion of the maintenance customers on to the subscription side. And on the first one, we talked a little bit about it and that we said that we expected the subscription base to be larger by the end of next year, and we gave you some hints or at least we gave you an algebra problem you can work on tonight, Jay. And then on the second one, we also talked a little bit about programmatic ways of doing that and over time how we will continue to encourage customers to move from classic maintenance to the new subscriptions. Scott, you want to add something?"

It's the decay rate. We [indiscernible] vary within that pool of maintenance subscribers by the way between low-end LT customers that have a slightly lower renewal rate versus Suites maintenance customers, which have a much higher renewal rate. So as that pool moves over, the maintenance pool will go continually down from this point, basically 1 minus our turn rate. And at that point, what you'll see is the mix will shift inside that pool. So if you think of maintenance revenue as a P-time SKU, think of the price, the average price inside there beginning to shift more toward Suites customers out through time, but the overall decline being driven by the low-end LT customers. I think the other way to peg this, Jay, as you sit down and do your modeling, is what we've said -- and I think we showed you these curves back at Investor Day, that our expectation is by the end of next year, the number of maintenance subscribers and the maintenance ARR will be below the new model subscribers and new model ARR by the end of next year."

There was -- the normal end of sale surge that -- like we saw in Q4, where it was the last chance for our customer who wanted to buy a Suite perpetual license and there are some buy ahead activity, some pull ahead of future demand for that set of customers. And by the way, we predicted that, I think, pretty accurately versus what the results were. The piece that also happened was, of course, when we saw your last perpetual license, you also saw your last crossgrade. And we saw a lot of the same behavior that we saw at the end of -- if you remember when we stop selling upgrades in our fiscal '15, so more than a year ago, we saw a big spike in demand for people who were already using our product, but decided they wanted to upgrade to a more full functioned product. They're willing to pay more for it. We saw some of that same upgrade-like behavior happen within our crossgrades. And I think that's the piece that surprised us a bit and it's a positive for ARR. It's a neutral for subscribers because you had to be on maintenance to be eligible for the crossgrade, but it's a positive for ARR and it's a positive for total revenue going forward.

Let me just divide the markets and talk about the dynamics slightly differently. In the AEC market, which is more project based, it comes up for a building or a roadway or a bridge. There is more willingness -- there is slightly more willingness to shift with new projects as new teams come together. I think the place where you hear even greater reluctance is in manufacturing. And there we did -- we've done a number of things that we've rolled out across our product portfolio that allow customers to work in new software and access the data that they created over the last couple of decades. So they can work with the native data. They don't -- obviously, as always, we can translate it and convert it. But even more importantly, we now let customers leave their data in the native data format and work on it whether they're doing modeling or visualization or simulation. So that's been, over the last 2 years, a pretty big breakthrough in giving people a much smoother ramp to go from one of the legacy products to a new one. And at a certain point, one of the other things that has to happen in motivating people to move to something is the new stuff has to be that much better. If you think about it, particularly manufacturing, many of the products that people are using are more than 20 years old. And we would like to think in the industry that we can do better than having 20-year-old products be state of the art. So part of it is making the new products and the new product experiences much more compelling. The other is to reassure people about being able to migrate their data or to use all their data and access it for as long as they need to."

We also see Q4 typically heavy on EBA sales, although as you see in the last couple of years, we sell a lot of them in Q4, the EBAs will pick up those subs in Q1. So think of this as being driven -- the Q3 versus Q4 driven by our normal seasonality pattern first.

If you remember back in Q1, new model sub adds were 140,000, but buried in there were 2 things that didn't recur in Q2. One was the promo. We didn't run that legacy-focused promo in Q2. We will do that again, as Carl said, in Q3. The second is we had a big catchup of the EBAs that rolled in, in Q1 and we're a little bit more than 25,000 of that 140,000 we had in Q1. If you net those 2 out, Q1, without those 2, is in the, call it, 90,000 range. That grew to 125,000 new model sub adds in Q2. So I don't -- there's certainly the pull ahead, I don't think, signals any weakness in where we're headed of the new model side. The only thing to bear in mind is a part of the pull ahead that we saw, a significant part, was driven by crossgrades. And to be eligible for a crossgrade, you had to already be a customer with a maintenance agreement attached. So all of those -- all of that pull ahead business was really neutral to subs. They already have a sub and they have a sub now. So it's not a big piece of that pull ahead. Really doesn't affect the subs growth."

The third piece is what you just said. Both the product subs and the EBAs, of course, when we sell it, goes immediately into deferred revenue and gets recognized ratably. But as it comes out of deferred, a portion of it -- because if you think of a term license, the customer is buying 2 things. They're buying access to the license and they're buying maintenance. So a portion of that deferred revenue accretes back into the license line and a portion of it accretes back into the maintenance line. I know it's confusing. I would love to say that I'm changing that today.

So we think Collections are a nice way to both simplify and get people the easy ramp to the new cloud services, so what they're familiar with plus the new stuff. Let me jump to the other side of it is our EBAs -- and as you mentioned, the technology behind it, the T-Flex, is really in the less than the top 1% of our accounts. So it has a lot of room to grow before these 2 things run into each other. And what I would add is I would expect to see more flexibility in our product offerings going forward. Collections is really just a first step in the door of what we're going to do in terms of making sure the customers have more flexibility. And that's regardless of how would it be sold. At the same time, we've documented and we've talked about how we really want to see our EBAs go out to a broader audience and how that will grow over time. So we think there's a lot of room between the 2 right now, and there's actually an opportunity to introduce other offerings that have that level of flexibility from T-Flex. But for example, it can easily be sold by our channel partners."

We had a terrific quarter, and we reached a very important milestone with the end of selling perpetual licenses. Our Q2 results mark another solid quarter of execution and progress on our 2 big initiatives: increasing lifetime customer value",2325,"Thanks, Dave. We had a terrific quarter, and we reached a very important milestone with the end of selling perpetual licenses. Our Q2 results mark another solid quarter of execution and progress on our 2 big initiatives: increasing lifetime customer value; and secondly, driving increased adoption of our cloud-based solutions. I'll share more details on our Q2 results and then update you on what we've been doing around creating long-term shareholder value before getting into the current quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. 
Starting with subscription numbers, we added 109,000 net new subscriptions in the quarter. We're really happy with the growth of new model subscription additions, which more than doubled year-over-year to 125,000. It was a strong quarter for product subscriptions, which drove the vast majority of the new model sub additions and is a clear sign of the progress on the transition with our customers and partners. Keep in mind that we didn't have any big promotions going on like we did in Q1. 
Product subscriptions had strong sequential growth and dramatic year-over-year growth of over 3x. Product subscriptions come to us from a number of sources. We're really pleased to see that one of the primary sources continues to be net new customers, which accounted for approximately 1/3 of product subscription additions in Q2. It's impossible to get perfect clarity on these new customers, but it's likely that a portion of these people were previously pirating software and now have a much more affordable option with our subscription. Still others have been using an alternative design tool and can now get access to better software. 
Looking at the other new model subscription types, our token-based EBAs experienced good year-over-year growth, but added fewer than we did in our seasonally high Q1. And once again, we had a record quarter for cloud subscription additions. BIM 360 and Fusion 360 are leading the way, and we continue to have success with our other cloud products such as Shotgun and Fusion Lifecycle, formerly known as PLM 360. We continue to build on our leadership in the cloud and our cloud services play an increasingly important role in our transition. 
Maintenance is our other primary subscription bucket. The renewal rate for maintenance subscriptions increased significantly year-over-year and remain near historic highs. Keep in mind that as we go forward, we'll start to experience larger decreases in maintenance subscriptions since we are no longer selling perpetual licenses. We'll also be incentivizing customers on maintenance to switch to a product subscription. As we've outlined in the past, by the end of next fiscal year, we expect to have more customers on our new model subscriptions than maintenance subscriptions. We are adamant about supporting our maintenance customers, and at some point in the future, these programs will converge into a single subscription offering. 
As we've indicated before, growth in subscriptions will drive growth in ARR. The strong growth in new model subscriptions in Q2 fueled an 86% year-on-year constant currency increase in new model ARR. Total ARR was -- growth was 14% in constant currency year-over-year. Total recurring revenue was 67% of our total reported revenues. That's a big jump compared to 55% in Q2 last year and a slight decrease from last quarter due to the surge in perpetual suite sales. With just a few exceptions, we're now in a subscription-only model, so you can expect another jump in the percentage of recurring revenue starting in Q3. 
Our Q2 revenue results were well ahead of expectations and were influenced primarily by a larger-than-expected surge in last-opportunity buying of perpetual licenses for Suites. Recall that in Q4, we had a 10% increase in unit volume related to the end of sale of perpetual licenses for individual products. Our analysis of Q2 suggests that just under 20% of our unit volume was related to end-of-sale activity for Suites. This was bigger than expected, and I'd like to give you some insights on what we saw. It was only over the last 2 weeks of the quarter that we started to experience a surge in demand for Suites perpetual licenses, almost entirely driven by the channel. What was really interesting is that at the same time we experienced the uptick in perpetual license sales, we also saw the acceleration of product subscription sales. The unique aspect of this activity relative to what we experienced in Q4 is that roughly half of the volume for Suites came from customers cross-grading from an individual product. This is neutral to the subscription count since the customer has to be on maintenance in order to cross-grade, but it's absolutely positive for in-period revenue and ultimately ARR, since the customer will be paying more annually for their maintenance plan. Overall, the increase in volume related to the end of perpetual Suites was greater than we anticipated, but we are very pleased with how product subscriptions performed in the quarter and the overall net result is positive for Autodesk. 
Our total unit volume in the second quarter increased compared to Q2 last year and was in line with our expectations even when normalizing for the increased activity related to the end of sale for Suites. It's not surprising that the end of sale for Suites drove a sequential uptick in license revenue. What might be surprising is that we're not seeing faster growth in our as-reported subscription revenue line. 
There are 2 things that are inhibiting that growth. The first is FX, which is causing about a 4-point headwind. The second is the accounting treatment of product subscription and EBA revenue. While our new model subscriptions are deferred and recognized ratably over their contract length, a sizable portion of both our product subscription and our EBAs are recognized as license revenue. In fact, roughly 80% of product subscription and roughly 55% of EBAs get recorded as license revenue. Cloud is the only new model subscription type that gets 100% recorded as subscription revenue. If all the new model subscriptions were recognized 100% as subscription revenue, that line would show 10% year-over-year growth as reported and 14% growth adjusted for currency. We are currently working towards providing a clearer breakout of our reporting so that our total subscription revenue can be seen directly in our reporting disclosures. 
Now let me get into a few more details of our Q2 results. By now it should be very clear that our channel partners are fully engaged with our subscription model. 68% of new model subscription additions came through our channel partners compared to just 47% in Q2 last year and 63% last quarter. The volume of subscriptions coming through our eStore also continues to gain momentum and nearly doubled from Q2 last year. Total direct revenue was 25% in the second quarter despite most of the surge from the end of sale of Suites coming through the channel. That's up from 20% in Q2 last year. 
On the expense side, our total spend decreased by almost 4% as we continue to diligently control our spending. We are continuing to make structural changes that allow us to spend less yet focus on our key initiatives. While we are being very disciplined about our spending, we are doing it without compromising the long-term health of the company. We also increased our stock buyback in Q2 to $170 million in light of the dip in the stock caused by the temporary panic around the Brexit vote. 
Overall, we were very pleased with the Q2 results. All of the trends we saw reinforced our confidence that the transition is working for our customers, our partners and Autodesk. That's a good segue into what I've touched on in the last couple of earnings calls about what we're doing to create long-term value for our shareholders. We continue to get many questions in this area, so I'm happy to talk about it. If you've been around the tech industry as long as I have, you've no doubt seen the carnage of once great technology companies that ultimately failed to innovate and keep their competitive advantage. Autodesk has been the leader in the world of design and engineering software for over 30 years and what we're doing with this transition is positioning Autodesk to lead the next generation of this kind of software. Our transition happens on 2 fronts. We're currently in the midst of a business model and pricing transition, where our customers are moving to term-based subscriptions. This will lead to a highly predictable model over time and a significant increase in the value our customers get from our products. The best indicator for this is the rapid growth we're experiencing in new model subscriptions and new model ARR. In support of this model change, we are simplifying our entire go-to-market strategy and reducing our cost structure while we increase our ability to more effectively serve our customers. 
The second front of our transition is how we are building platforms to exploit the cloud and dramatically expand the size of our market opportunities. We're well ahead of our traditional competitors on this front, and we're investing to secure the future of Autodesk. These mobile and cloud technologies are opening up significant opportunities in the areas of construction and manufacturing that are completely new to Autodesk. These new platforms offer a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the competitive landscape. Our cloud-based products continue to gain momentum and are already the undisputed leaders in their respective categories. 
So this is how I'd summarize how we're building long-term shareholder value in 3 simple bullets: one, we're increasing the lifetime value of every customer; two, we're changing our cost structure by focusing our product portfolio and go-to-market strategies; and three, we're building the best cloud and mobile-based products and services in the industry, which significantly expands our total available market as the underlying technology platform shifts to the cloud. 
Now let's take a look at what's going on here in the current quarter, Q3. Our newly introduced Collections are a great example of increasing lifetime customer value. On August 1, we launched Collections, which is our next generation of Suites with the addition of our cloud services. Suites was tremendously successful for Autodesk, but with Collections, we're significantly reducing complexity by offering just 3 Collections, one for AEC, one for Manufacturing and one for M&E, making them easier to sell and consume. We're offering single-user and multi-user access and choices of different term lengths to fit their needs. The value of our customers is tremendous and well exceeds the premium suite. We've priced Collections so that the average customer value to Autodesk will increase as well. We're only 25 days into selling Collections, but we're very happy with the start. 
Despite the strong performance of Suites at the end of Q2, in their first few weeks we're seeing the same volume level for Collections that we experienced for Suites in the same period a year ago. From a tactical standpoint, some of you have been asking about pricing and promotions. We are currently running another promotion aimed at our legacy customers. It's similar to the very successful promotion that we ran in Q1, but the discount is smaller. You can expect us to continue to work to convert these legacy customers with various promotions and incentives as we go forward. Like I've said before, running a business is different than running a spreadsheet. One area that we constantly evaluate is how we use pricing to drive subscriptions and ARR growth. Having said that, we wouldn't make significant decisions around packaging or pricing without first testing in certain markets. This is especially true when it comes to our flagship products like AutoCAD and LT. 
In early September, pricing changes will go into effect that will rationalize the pricing of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. We believe these moves will drive customers to the right product for their needs at higher billings and ARR for Autodesk. 
Now turning to our outlook for Q3 and the full year. Our view of the macroeconomic environment's impact on our business hasn't changed over the past several quarters. The global conditions have remained uneven, with most of the mature markets performing relatively well, while most of the emerging markets have been challenged. As we evaluated our strong Q2 results, we didn't see any meaningful change in the demand environment. And as I indicated earlier, we don't see any immediate fallout from the Brexit vote. As always, it's impossible to say what the long-term impact might be, but we don't see any near-term risk. Our strong Q2 results likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year, but we're comfortable with bringing up the bottom end of our previous ranges for both revenue and EPS for FY '17. We're also lowering our spend projection for FY '17 based on the better-than-expected progress we've made on this front. We remain confident in our long-term goals of growing our subscription base by a 20% CAGR through FY '20, which will drive a 24% CAGR in ARR. We also remain committed to keeping spend growth flat in FY '18. The lower spend projection also enhances our projected path to free cash flow of roughly $6 per share in FY '20 and $11 per share in FY '23. 
So to wrap things up, we're very pleased with the consistent execution over the past few quarters. We're really excited to be another major step further along in the transition and now fully in the subscription-only model. We have a clear vision and plan for creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business in the years to come. We are focused on driving higher lifetime value, simplifying our offerings and our go-to-market activities, and significantly increasing our market opportunity as we lead the next wave of design and engineering software to the cloud.

Could you give some specifics as to how you're thinking about what the changes might be? And is this part of what you referred to in the past as SRP realization as a concept for you to help improve pricing and margin? Secondly, with respect to the decay of classic maintenance over time, how are you thinking about the rate of that decline? When we look at one of your competitors, PTC, which is moving mostly but not entirely to subscription, the stated rate of decline for their maintenance is low to mid-single digit. So would you anticipate, going fully to subscription, that your decay of maintenance might be somewhat faster than that?"

So let me start with the pricing and then Scott and I can kind of tag team the one about the maintenance decline. So starting with the pricing, what we wanted to do was, as I said, kind of rationalize the 3 different price points of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. Whenever possible, we would like customers to get the right product. More often than not, that is on AutoCAD vertical, particularly tailored to what they -- the discipline they're in. And on the other side, for the more casual users, LT is clearly the more appropriate product. And what we were trying to do is move the price points apart, get the appropriate separation. And what we saw, and I kind of referred to in the remarks, in our testing is that we can, with the right pricing, move more LT customers to AutoCAD and AutoCAD customers to the vertical. And so this is a part of the overall pricing. I wouldn't say it's particularly what I would refer to as the SRP realization. It's just increasing total pricing, but it's part of a pricing optimization strategy. And let me take the first pass. Couple of things will contribute to the maintenance decline, as you said, classic maintenance. One is going to be the fall-off from people who just choose not to renew for all of the usual reasons. The second one will be the conversion of the maintenance customers on to the subscription side. And on the first one, we talked a little bit about it in that we said that we expected the subscription base to be larger by the end of next year, and we gave you some hints or at least we gave you an algebra problem you can work on tonight, Jay. And then on the second one, we also talked a little bit about programmatic ways of doing that and over time how we will continue to encourage customers to move from classic maintenance to the new subscriptions. Scott, you want to add something?"

It's the decay rate, which will vary within that pool of maintenance subscribers, by the way, between low-end LT customers that have a slightly lower renewal rate, versus Suites maintenance customers, which have a much higher renewal rate. So as that pool moves over, the maintenance pool will go continually down from this point, basically 1 minus our turn rate. And at that point, what you'll see is the mix will shift inside that pool. So if you think of maintenance revenue as a P times Q, think of the price, the average price inside there beginning to shift more toward Suites customers out through time, but the overall decline being driven by the low-end LT customers. I think the other way to peg this, Jay, as you sit down and do your modeling, is what we've said -- and I think we showed you these curves back at Investor Day, that our expectation is by the end of next year, the number of maintenance subscribers and the maintenance ARR will be below the new model subscribers and new model ARR by the end of next year."

There was the normal end-of-sale surge that -- like we saw in Q4, where it was the last chance for our customer who wanted to buy a Suite perpetual license, and there is some buy-ahead activity, some pull ahead of future demand for that set of customers. And by the way, we predicted that, I think, pretty accurately versus what the results were. The piece that also happened was, of course, when you sell your last perpetual license, you also sell your last cross-grade. And we saw a lot of the same behavior that we saw at the end of -- if you remember when we stop selling upgrades in our fiscal '15, so more than a year ago, we saw a big spike in demand for people who were already using our product, but decided they wanted to upgrade to a more full-functioned product. They're willing to pay more for it. We saw some of that same upgrade-like behavior happen within our cross-grades. And I think that's the piece that surprised us a bit and it's a positive for ARR. It's a neutral for subscribers because you had to be on maintenance to be eligible for the cross-grade, but it's a positive for ARR and it's a positive for total revenue going forward. So that's the way I would think about the surge we saw at the end of this quarter."

Let me just divide the markets and talk about the dynamics slightly differently. In the AEC market, which is more project based, it comes up for a building or a roadway or a bridge, there is more willingness -- there is slightly more willingness to shift with new projects as new teams come together. I think the place where you hear even greater reluctance is in manufacturing. And there we did -- we've done a number of things that we've rolled out across our product portfolio that allow customers to work in new software and access the data that they created over the last couple of decades. So they can work with the native data. They don't -- obviously, as always, we can translate it and convert it. But even more importantly, we now let customers leave their data in the native format and work on it whether they're doing modeling or visualization or simulation. So that's been, over the last 2 years, a pretty big breakthrough in giving people a much smoother ramp to go from one of the legacy products to a new one. And at a certain point, one of the other things that has to happen in motivating people to move to something is the new stuff has to be that much better. If you think about it, particularly manufacturing, many of the products that people are using are more than 20 years old. And we would like to think in the industry that we can do better than having 20-year-old products be state of the art. So part of it is making the new products and the new product experiences much more compelling. The other is to reassure people about being able to migrate their data or to use all their data and access it for as long as they need to."

New model types tend to have the same seasonality as a lot of our, previously, our perpetual license did. So heavier in Q4 than in Q3 would be normal demand pattern. We also see Q4 typically heavy on EBA sales, although as you see in the last couple of years, we sell a lot of them in Q4, the EBAs. We pick up those subs in Q1. So think of this as being driven -- the Q3 versus Q4 driven by our normal seasonality pattern first.

I would have expected the ARPS number, the pricing side of the equation on subscription, start to improve. But by my math, it's still down sequentially a little bit both on maintenance and new model subs. One -- it's a 2-part question. One, why does that continue to decline?

But I think overriding, longer term, you do need to expect for some period of time that to continue to come down. It will come down simply driven by mix. We've talked about ARPS being very mix sensitive. It will continue to be mix sensitive. And as we get further out and layer on more quarters of selling Suites and Collections and our higher-priced products, only in the new model way, you'll begin to see that ARPS rebound. But short term, we'll continue -- that pool will be more heavily dominated by the lower-priced LT and AutoCAD, things that have been out there only as product subs for the last 6 months.

If you remember back in Q1, new model sub adds were 140,000, but buried in there were 2 things that didn't recur in Q2. One was the promo. We didn't run that legacy-focused promo in Q2. We will do that again, as Carl said, in Q3. The second is we had a big catch-up of the EBAs that rolled in, in Q1 and were a little bit more than 25,000 of that 140,000 we had in Q1. If you net those 2 out, Q1, without those 2, is in the, call it, 90,000 range. That grew to 125,000 new model sub adds in Q2. So I don't -- there's certainly -- the pull-ahead, I don't think, signals any weakness in where we're headed of the new model side. The only thing to bear in mind is a part of the pull-ahead that we saw, a significant part, was driven by cross-grades. And to be eligible for a cross-grade, you had to already be a customer with a maintenance agreement attached. So all of those -- all of that pull-ahead business was really neutral to subs. They already had a sub and they have a sub now. So it's not -- a big piece of that pull-ahead really doesn't affect the subs growth."

The third piece is what you just said. Both the product subs and the EBAs, of course, when we sell it, goes immediately into deferred revenue and gets recognized ratably. But as it comes out of deferred, a portion of it -- because if you think of a term license, the customer is buying 2 things. They're buying access to the license and they're buying maintenance. So a portion of that deferred revenue accretes back into the license line and a portion of it accretes back into the maintenance line. I know it's confusing. I would love to say that I'm changing that today.

I just want to maybe understand probably a little bit your thinking behind Collections and your design philosophy for it. And just my background for this question was we were looking for an offering other than desktop subscription that might be a little bit more appropriate for the mid-market. Seeing some resistance in the mid-market to the subscriptions, more so than for AutoCAD and LTs being sold as DTS in the low end of the market. And yet Collections, it looks very much like the desktop subscription. It's a larger bundle at a slightly higher price point. Maybe the question, besides your kind of your intent behind it, is what -- where will the dividing line be in the market between your T-Flex and your EBAs versus Collections when it comes to consuming the Suites in terms of kind of company size? Is that how we should think about it? And what might that size be?"

We haven't seen the resistance. And as a matter of fact, much of -- many of the new products and desktop subscriptions for both Suites and Collections is being sold through our channel partners, which serves the broadly speaking mid-market. So we think Collections are a nice way to both simplify and get people the easy ramp to the new cloud services, so what they're familiar with plus the new stuff. Let me jump to the other side of it, is our EBAs, and as you mentioned, the technology behind it, the T-Flex, is really in less than the top 1% of our accounts. So it has a lot of room to grow before these 2 things run into each other. And what I would add is I would expect to see more flexibility in our product offerings going forward. Collections is really just the first step in the door of what we're going to do in terms of making sure the customers have more flexibility. And that's regardless of how would it be sold. At the same time, we've documented and we've talked about how we really want to see our EBAs go out to a broader audience and how that will grow over time. So we think there's a lot of room between the 2 right now, and there's actually an opportunity to introduce other offerings that have that level of flexibility from T-Flex, but for example, can easily be sold by our channel partners."

We had a terrific quarter, and we reached a very important milestone with the end of selling perpetual licenses. Our Q2 results mark another solid quarter of execution and progress on our 2 big initiatives: increasing lifetime customer value",2325,"Thanks, Dave. We had a terrific quarter, and we reached a very important milestone with the end of selling perpetual licenses. Our Q2 results mark another solid quarter of execution and progress on our 2 big initiatives: increasing lifetime customer value; and secondly, driving increased adoption of our cloud-based solutions. I'll share more details on our Q2 results and then update you on what we've been doing around creating long-term shareholder value before getting into the current quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. 
Starting with subscription numbers, we added 109,000 net new subscriptions in the quarter. We're really happy with the growth of new model subscription additions, which more than doubled year-over-year to 125,000. It was a strong quarter for product subscriptions, which drove the vast majority of the new model sub additions and is a clear sign of the progress on the transition with our customers and partners. Keep in mind that we didn't have any big promotions going on like we did in Q1. 
Product subscriptions had strong sequential growth and dramatic year-over-year growth of over 3x. Product subscriptions come to us from a number of sources. We're really pleased to see that one of the primary sources continues to be net new customers, which accounted for approximately 1/3 of product subscription additions in Q2. It's impossible to get perfect clarity on these new customers, but it's likely that a portion of these people were previously pirating software and now have a much more affordable option with our subscription. Still others have been using an alternative design tool and can now get access to better software. 
Looking at the other new model subscription types, our token-based EBAs experienced good year-over-year growth, but added fewer than we did in our seasonally high Q1. And once again, we had a record quarter for cloud subscription additions. BIM 360 and Fusion 360 are leading the way, and we continue to have success with our other cloud products such as Shotgun and Fusion Lifecycle, formerly known as PLM 360. We continue to build on our leadership in the cloud and our cloud services play an increasingly important role in our transition. 
Maintenance is our other primary subscription bucket. The renewal rate for maintenance subscriptions increased significantly year-over-year and remain near historic highs. Keep in mind that as we go forward, we'll start to experience larger decreases in maintenance subscriptions since we are no longer selling perpetual licenses. We'll also be incentivizing customers on maintenance to switch to a product subscription. As we've outlined in the past, by the end of next fiscal year, we expect to have more customers on our new model subscriptions than maintenance subscriptions. We are adamant about supporting our maintenance customers, and at some point in the future, these programs will converge into a single subscription offering. 
As we've indicated before, growth in subscriptions will drive growth in ARR. The strong growth in new model subscriptions in Q2 fueled an 86% year-on-year constant currency increase in new model ARR. Total ARR was -- growth was 14% in constant currency year-over-year. Total recurring revenue was 67% of our total reported revenues. That's a big jump compared to 55% in Q2 last year and a slight decrease from last quarter due to the surge in perpetual suite sales. With just a few exceptions, we're now in a subscription-only model, so you can expect another jump in the percentage of recurring revenue starting in Q3. 
Our Q2 revenue results were well ahead of expectations and were influenced primarily by a larger-than-expected surge in last-opportunity buying of perpetual licenses for Suites. Recall that in Q4, we had a 10% increase in unit volume related to the end of sale of perpetual licenses for individual products. Our analysis of Q2 suggests that just under 20% of our unit volume was related to end-of-sale activity for Suites. This was bigger than expected, and I'd like to give you some insights on what we saw. It was only over the last 2 weeks of the quarter that we started to experience a surge in demand for Suites perpetual licenses, almost entirely driven by the channel. What was really interesting is that at the same time we experienced the uptick in perpetual license sales, we also saw the acceleration of product subscription sales. The unique aspect of this activity relative to what we experienced in Q4 is that roughly half of the volume for Suites came from customers cross-grading from an individual product. This is neutral to the subscription count since the customer has to be on maintenance in order to cross-grade, but it's absolutely positive for in-period revenue and ultimately ARR, since the customer will be paying more annually for their maintenance plan. Overall, the increase in volume related to the end of perpetual Suites was greater than we anticipated, but we are very pleased with how product subscriptions performed in the quarter and the overall net result is positive for Autodesk. 
Our total unit volume in the second quarter increased compared to Q2 last year and was in line with our expectations even when normalizing for the increased activity related to the end of sale for Suites. It's not surprising that the end of sale for Suites drove a sequential uptick in license revenue. What might be surprising is that we're not seeing faster growth in our as-reported subscription revenue line. 
There are 2 things that are inhibiting that growth. The first is FX, which is causing about a 4-point headwind. The second is the accounting treatment of product subscription and EBA revenue. While our new model subscriptions are deferred and recognized ratably over their contract length, a sizable portion of both our product subscription and our EBAs are recognized as license revenue. In fact, roughly 80% of product subscription and roughly 55% of EBAs get recorded as license revenue. Cloud is the only new model subscription type that gets 100% recorded as subscription revenue. If all the new model subscriptions were recognized 100% as subscription revenue, that line would show 10% year-over-year growth as reported and 14% growth adjusted for currency. We are currently working towards providing a clearer breakout of our reporting so that our total subscription revenue can be seen directly in our reporting disclosures. 
Now let me get into a few more details of our Q2 results. By now it should be very clear that our channel partners are fully engaged with our subscription model. 68% of new model subscription additions came through our channel partners compared to just 47% in Q2 last year and 63% last quarter. The volume of subscriptions coming through our eStore also continues to gain momentum and nearly doubled from Q2 last year. Total direct revenue was 25% in the second quarter despite most of the surge from the end of sale of Suites coming through the channel. That's up from 20% in Q2 last year. 
On the expense side, our total spend decreased by almost 4% as we continue to diligently control our spending. We are continuing to make structural changes that allow us to spend less yet focus on our key initiatives. While we are being very disciplined about our spending, we are doing it without compromising the long-term health of the company. We also increased our stock buyback in Q2 to $170 million in light of the dip in the stock caused by the temporary panic around the Brexit vote. 
Overall, we were very pleased with the Q2 results. All of the trends we saw reinforced our confidence that the transition is working for our customers, our partners and Autodesk. That's a good segue into what I've touched on in the last couple of earnings calls about what we're doing to create long-term value for our shareholders. We continue to get many questions in this area, so I'm happy to talk about it. If you've been around the tech industry as long as I have, you've no doubt seen the carnage of once great technology companies that ultimately failed to innovate and keep their competitive advantage. Autodesk has been the leader in the world of design and engineering software for over 30 years and what we're doing with this transition is positioning Autodesk to lead the next generation of this kind of software. Our transition happens on 2 fronts. We're currently in the midst of a business model and pricing transition, where our customers are moving to term-based subscriptions. This will lead to a highly predictable model over time and a significant increase in the value our customers get from our products. The best indicator for this is the rapid growth we're experiencing in new model subscriptions and new model ARR. In support of this model change, we are simplifying our entire go-to-market strategy and reducing our cost structure while we increase our ability to more effectively serve our customers. 
The second front of our transition is how we are building platforms to exploit the cloud and dramatically expand the size of our market opportunities. We're well ahead of our traditional competitors on this front, and we're investing to secure the future of Autodesk. These mobile and cloud technologies are opening up significant opportunities in the areas of construction and manufacturing that are completely new to Autodesk. These new platforms offer a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the competitive landscape. Our cloud-based products continue to gain momentum and are already the undisputed leaders in their respective categories. 
So this is how I'd summarize how we're building long-term shareholder value in 3 simple bullets: one, we're increasing the lifetime value of every customer; two, we're changing our cost structure by focusing our product portfolio and go-to-market strategies; and three, we're building the best cloud and mobile-based products and services in the industry, which significantly expands our total available market as the underlying technology platform shifts to the cloud. 
Now let's take a look at what's going on here in the current quarter, Q3. Our newly introduced Collections are a great example of increasing lifetime customer value. On August 1, we launched Collections, which is our next generation of Suites with the addition of our cloud services. Suites was tremendously successful for Autodesk, but with Collections, we're significantly reducing complexity by offering just 3 Collections, one for AEC, one for Manufacturing and one for M&E, making them easier to sell and consume. We're offering single-user and multi-user access and choices of different term lengths to fit their needs. The value of our customers is tremendous and well exceeds the premium suite. We've priced Collections so that the average customer value to Autodesk will increase as well. We're only 25 days into selling Collections, but we're very happy with the start. 
Despite the strong performance of Suites at the end of Q2, in their first few weeks we're seeing the same volume level for Collections that we experienced for Suites in the same period a year ago. From a tactical standpoint, some of you have been asking about pricing and promotions. We are currently running another promotion aimed at our legacy customers. It's similar to the very successful promotion that we ran in Q1, but the discount is smaller. You can expect us to continue to work to convert these legacy customers with various promotions and incentives as we go forward. Like I've said before, running a business is different than running a spreadsheet. One area that we constantly evaluate is how we use pricing to drive subscriptions and ARR growth. Having said that, we wouldn't make significant decisions around packaging or pricing without first testing in certain markets. This is especially true when it comes to our flagship products like AutoCAD and LT. 
In early September, pricing changes will go into effect that will rationalize the pricing of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. We believe these moves will drive customers to the right product for their needs at higher billings and ARR for Autodesk. 
Now turning to our outlook for Q3 and the full year. Our view of the macroeconomic environment's impact on our business hasn't changed over the past several quarters. The global conditions have remained uneven, with most of the mature markets performing relatively well, while most of the emerging markets have been challenged. As we evaluated our strong Q2 results, we didn't see any meaningful change in the demand environment. And as I indicated earlier, we don't see any immediate fallout from the Brexit vote. As always, it's impossible to say what the long-term impact might be, but we don't see any near-term risk. Our strong Q2 results likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year, but we're comfortable with bringing up the bottom end of our previous ranges for both revenue and EPS for FY '17. We're also lowering our spend projection for FY '17 based on the better-than-expected progress we've made on this front. We remain confident in our long-term goals of growing our subscription base by a 20% CAGR through FY '20, which will drive a 24% CAGR in ARR. We also remain committed to keeping spend growth flat in FY '18. The lower spend projection also enhances our projected path to free cash flow of roughly $6 per share in FY '20 and $11 per share in FY '23. 
So to wrap things up, we're very pleased with the consistent execution over the past few quarters. We're really excited to be another major step further along in the transition and now fully in the subscription-only model. We have a clear vision and plan for creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business in the years to come. We are focused on driving higher lifetime value, simplifying our offerings and our go-to-market activities, and significantly increasing our market opportunity as we lead the next wave of design and engineering software to the cloud.

Could you give some specifics as to how you're thinking about what the changes might be? And is this part of what you referred to in the past as SRP realization as a concept for you to help improve pricing and margin? Secondly, with respect to the decay of classic maintenance over time, how are you thinking about the rate of that decline? When we look at one of your competitors, PTC, which is moving mostly but not entirely to subscription, the stated rate of decline for their maintenance is low to mid-single digit. So would you anticipate, going fully to subscription, that your decay of maintenance might be somewhat faster than that?"

So let me start with the pricing and then Scott and I can kind of tag team the one about the maintenance decline. So starting with the pricing, what we wanted to do was, as I said, kind of rationalize the 3 different price points of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. Whenever possible, we would like customers to get the right product. More often than not, that is on AutoCAD vertical, particularly tailored to what they -- the discipline they're in. And on the other side, for the more casual users, LT is clearly the more appropriate product. And what we were trying to do is move the price points apart, get the appropriate separation. And what we saw, and I kind of referred to in the remarks, in our testing is that we can, with the right pricing, move more LT customers to AutoCAD and AutoCAD customers to the vertical. And so this is a part of the overall pricing. I wouldn't say it's particularly what I would refer to as the SRP realization. It's just increasing total pricing, but it's part of a pricing optimization strategy. And let me take the first pass. Couple of things will contribute to the maintenance decline, as you said, classic maintenance. One is going to be the fall-off from people who just choose not to renew for all of the usual reasons. The second one will be the conversion of the maintenance customers on to the subscription side. And on the first one, we talked a little bit about it in that we said that we expected the subscription base to be larger by the end of next year, and we gave you some hints or at least we gave you an algebra problem you can work on tonight, Jay. And then on the second one, we also talked a little bit about programmatic ways of doing that and over time how we will continue to encourage customers to move from classic maintenance to the new subscriptions. Scott, you want to add something?"

It's the decay rate, which will vary within that pool of maintenance subscribers, by the way, between low-end LT customers that have a slightly lower renewal rate, versus Suites maintenance customers, which have a much higher renewal rate. So as that pool moves over, the maintenance pool will go continually down from this point, basically 1 minus our turn rate. And at that point, what you'll see is the mix will shift inside that pool. So if you think of maintenance revenue as a P times Q, think of the price, the average price inside there beginning to shift more toward Suites customers out through time, but the overall decline being driven by the low-end LT customers. I think the other way to peg this, Jay, as you sit down and do your modeling, is what we've said -- and I think we showed you these curves back at Investor Day, that our expectation is by the end of next year, the number of maintenance subscribers and the maintenance ARR will be below the new model subscribers and new model ARR by the end of next year."

There was the normal end-of-sale surge that -- like we saw in Q4, where it was the last chance for our customer who wanted to buy a Suite perpetual license, and there is some buy-ahead activity, some pull ahead of future demand for that set of customers. And by the way, we predicted that, I think, pretty accurately versus what the results were. The piece that also happened was, of course, when you sell your last perpetual license, you also sell your last cross-grade. And we saw a lot of the same behavior that we saw at the end of -- if you remember when we stop selling upgrades in our fiscal '15, so more than a year ago, we saw a big spike in demand for people who were already using our product, but decided they wanted to upgrade to a more full-functioned product. They're willing to pay more for it. We saw some of that same upgrade-like behavior happen within our cross-grades. And I think that's the piece that surprised us a bit and it's a positive for ARR. It's a neutral for subscribers because you had to be on maintenance to be eligible for the cross-grade, but it's a positive for ARR and it's a positive for total revenue going forward. So that's the way I would think about the surge we saw at the end of this quarter."

Let me just divide the markets and talk about the dynamics slightly differently. In the AEC market, which is more project based, it comes up for a building or a roadway or a bridge, there is more willingness -- there is slightly more willingness to shift with new projects as new teams come together. I think the place where you hear even greater reluctance is in manufacturing. And there we did -- we've done a number of things that we've rolled out across our product portfolio that allow customers to work in new software and access the data that they created over the last couple of decades. So they can work with the native data. They don't -- obviously, as always, we can translate it and convert it. But even more importantly, we now let customers leave their data in the native format and work on it whether they're doing modeling or visualization or simulation. So that's been, over the last 2 years, a pretty big breakthrough in giving people a much smoother ramp to go from one of the legacy products to a new one. And at a certain point, one of the other things that has to happen in motivating people to move to something is the new stuff has to be that much better. If you think about it, particularly manufacturing, many of the products that people are using are more than 20 years old. And we would like to think in the industry that we can do better than having 20-year-old products be state of the art. So part of it is making the new products and the new product experiences much more compelling. The other is to reassure people about being able to migrate their data or to use all their data and access it for as long as they need to."

We also see Q4 typically heavy on EBA sales, although as you see in the last couple of years, we sell a lot of them in Q4, the EBAs. We pick up those subs in Q1. So think of this as being driven -- the Q3 versus Q4 driven by our normal seasonality pattern first.

And I said when we back out the extra buying of perpetual Suites, it was the volume of activity that we would have expected for this quarter. It was -- it slightly exceeded our expectations.

If you remember back in Q1, new model sub adds were 140,000, but buried in there were 2 things that didn't recur in Q2. One was the promo. We didn't run that legacy-focused promo in Q2. We will do that again, as Carl said, in Q3. The second is we had a big catch-up of the EBAs that rolled in, in Q1 and were a little bit more than 25,000 of that 140,000 we had in Q1. If you net those 2 out, Q1, without those 2, is in the, call it, 90,000 range. That grew to 125,000 new model sub adds in Q2. So I don't -- there's certainly -- the pull-ahead, I don't think, signals any weakness in where we're headed of the new model side. The only thing to bear in mind is a part of the pull-ahead that we saw, a significant part, was driven by cross-grades. And to be eligible for a cross-grade, you had to already be a customer with a maintenance agreement attached. So all of those -- all of that pull-ahead business was really neutral to subs. They already had a sub and they have a sub now. So it's not -- a big piece of that pull-ahead really doesn't affect the subs growth."

The third piece is what you just said. Both the product subs and the EBAs, of course, when we sell it, goes immediately into deferred revenue and gets recognized ratably. But as it comes out of deferred, a portion of it -- because if you think of a term license, the customer is buying 2 things. They're buying access to the license and they're buying maintenance. So a portion of that deferred revenue accretes back into the license line and a portion of it accretes back into the maintenance line. I know it's confusing. I would love to say that I'm changing that today. We are working on changing that so that it's much clearer for you to be able to see how subscription revenue comes back into a line called subscription. Maintenance is in the maintenance line.

So we think Collections are a nice way to both simplify and get people the easy ramp to the new cloud services, so what they're familiar with plus the new stuff. Let me jump to the other side of it, is our EBAs, and as you mentioned, the technology behind it, the T-Flex, is really in less than the top 1% of our accounts. So it has a lot of room to grow before these 2 things run into each other. And what I would add is I would expect to see more flexibility in our product offerings going forward. Collections is really just the first step in the door of what we're going to do in terms of making sure the customers have more flexibility. And that's regardless of how would it be sold. At the same time, we've documented and we've talked about how we really want to see our EBAs go out to a broader audience and how that will grow over time. So we think there's a lot of room between the 2 right now, and there's actually an opportunity to introduce other offerings that have that level of flexibility from T-Flex, but for example, can easily be sold by our channel partners."

We're really pleased with our third quarter results. Q3 marked a significant milestone in our transition. It's the first quarter where we only sold subscriptions, and we're off to a great start. New model subscriptions grew by 168,000. New m",2400,"Thanks, Dave. We're really pleased with our third quarter results. Q3 marked a significant milestone in our transition. It's the first quarter where we only sold subscriptions, and we're off to a great start. New model subscriptions grew by 168,000. New model ARR grew 91% at constant currency, and recurring revenue jumped to 76% of total revenue.
More generally, we made progress on our 2 major initiatives: growing lifetime customer value by moving customers to the subscription model and increasing adoption of our cloud-based solutions. Given that this quarter was the most uncertain when we started the year, these are fantastic results. So let's look at the details.
For the quarter, we added 134,000 net subscriptions. New model subscription additions more than tripled year-over-year to 168,000, while the maintenance subscriptions declined as expected by 34,000 during the quarter. Product subscriptions drove the vast majority of the new model sub additions. The launch of industry collections, the next generation of Suites that include many of our cloud services, contributed to our strong growth this quarter. Collections are a great example of how we're simplifying our offerings while increasing lifetime customer value.
During the quarter, we ran another promotion aimed at converting our legacy non-subscriber base to new product subscriptions. Like the promotion in Q1, legacy nonsubscribers were offered product subscriptions at a discount when trading in their old perpetual licenses. The Q3 promotion added approximately 43,000 product subscriptions, significantly more than in Q1. In addition, the overall average selling price was twice as high as the Q1 promotion due to a lower discount and the fact that customers favored higher-priced products.  And lastly, more than 50% of the subscribers turned in licenses that were 7 years back or older. This reinforces our view that there are a meaningful number of active users whose licenses are more than 5 years old and are interested in moving to the latest software.
While the promo successfully migrated many legacy customers to our subscription model, product subscriptions continue to attract a significant number of users that are new to Autodesk. Once again, new customers represented about 1/3 of our new product subscriptions for the quarter. We believe some of these people were previously pirating the software and now have a much more affordable option with product subscriptions. This is consistent with the fact that emerging countries are some of the fastest growing areas for product subscriptions. In other cases, these new users have been using an alternative design tool and can now afford software from Autodesk.
Overall, product subscriptions grew by more than 30% quarter-over-quarter with new subscribers coming from the legacy base, from people previously pirating the software and from new customers switching from other systems. Particularly pleasing is that the strong performance immediately follows the end of sale of perpetual licenses for Suites.
We also had another record quarter for cloud subscription additions. They nearly doubled from the second quarter, which was also a record. BIM 360 and Fusion 360, once again, are leading the way, but we also have continued to have success with our other cloud products such as AutoCAD 360, Shotgun and Collaboration for Revit.
It is clear that we are building on our leadership in the cloud and that cloud services are growing in importance with our customers. We see the benefits of the cloud's inherent scale and connectivity. For example, during Q3, we signed a large BIM 360 contract with a global construction company. Last spring, they started a pilot program, less than [ph] 200 seats for new projects. Working with them on their implementation drove rapid adoption. Their results were so strong that they signed a 7-figure agreement, expanding their use of BIM 360 Glue, Field and Docs to additional projects, reaching over 2,000 subscriptions in just 1 region. Now they are planning to scale their BIM processes even further, eventually using BIM 360 for all projects in all regions.
Maintenance is our other significant subscription bucket. During the quarter, we included for the first time 13,000 maintenance customers from our acquisition of Solid Angle. As you already know, July 31 was the last time customers could add maintenance to a perpetual license, so the incentive to stay up-to-date with existing maintenance contracts is compelling. 
In Q3, the renewal rate for maintenance subscriptions were strong, ahead of last year. But with no new maintenance agreements being sold, total maintenance subscriptions declined. As we've said before, we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance subscriptions going forward. The rate of decline will vary based on the number of subscriptions that come up for renewal, the renewal rate and our ability to incentivize maintenance customers to switch over to product subscription. This migration is good for both Autodesk and our customers as it moves them to our newest and best products. While we are still working through the time line, at some point, we will further simplify our offerings, and the maintenance subscription and product subscription offerings will converge into a single program.
Now let me get into ARR. New model ARR growth surged to 91% on a constant currency basis and reflects the continued strong uptake of all of our new subscription offerings. Total ARR grew 15% at constant currency. ARR growth was negatively impacted this quarter by the allocation of our market development funds, which are accounted for as contra revenue and booked upfront in each quarter. Prior to Q3, these funds were allocated across all revenue streams. With the end of perpetual license sales, 100% of our market development funds are now allocated to recurring revenues in ARR. This impacted ARR growth by 3 percentage points or about $40 million.
FX rates also continued to be a headwind for ARR in the quarter. The combination of FX rates and contra revenues reduced total ARR by about $100 million or 7 percentage points in Q3, which is sizable. Despite those headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our FY '20 ARR CAGR of 24%.
I mentioned last quarter that some of our moves to drive subscriptions in ARR revolve around pricing. In early September, we made changes that rationalized the pricing of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. The aim was to drive customers to the right product for their needs and do so with higher billings and ARR.
I'm pleased to report that these actions are motivating the intended customer behavior. More LT users are buying [indiscernible] AutoCAD, and the volumes for AutoCAD and especially AutoCAD verticals increased significantly quarter-over-quarter. For the overall AutoCAD family of products, volume and ARR increased because of these price changes.
We focus on subscriptions and ARR as the key metrics to measure our progress in the business model transition. However, we have received many investment questions on trends in annualized revenue per subscription or ARPS, so I thought I'd spend a little extra time on it this quarter, and we'll spend more time on it at Investor Day next week.
Let's start by focusing on new seats added in Q3, excluding the promo seats, as they have the temporary effect of depressing ARPS until their renewal, which will be at the full price. Suites and collections in the U.S. saw a year-over-year increase in ARPS of 24%. In Germany, the increase was plus 79%, and in Japan, it was plus 26%. AutoCAD LT in the U.S. saw a year-over-year increase of plus 9%. In Germany, the increase was plus 55% and in Japan, 50%.
The AutoCAD family, which is the sum of the newer [ph] AutoCAD and the vertical AutoCAD in the U.S. saw a year-over-year increase of 8%. In Germany, the increase was 13% and in Japan, 78%. Because of strong year-over-year changes with new seat purchases, the quarter-over-quarter ARPS change for the sum of AutoCAD, AutoCAD verticals and AutoCAD LT in the U.S., Germany and Japan were 5%, 35% and 64%, respectively. This was simply the result of more people buying vertical AutoCAD than vanilla AutoCAD and more people buying AutoCAD instead of AutoCAD LT, exactly the result we were looking for from the pricing change and why we generated more volume in ARR from the AutoCAD family. These are very positive outcomes. In fact, except for a few emerging markets in Europe, we see essentially the same trend lines everywhere.
So why aren't these results reflected in the aggregate ARPS number we report? There are 2 primary reasons. First, the calculation is extremely sensitive to mix in the early stages. Small numbers exaggerate the effects of short-term shifts internally, geo mix, promotions, et cetera. Until it starts to normalize when the number of customers is large enough. Secondly, the math that we use to count ARR and subscriptions is very sensitive to timing within a quarter. On an as-reported basis, ARPS can significantly understate the value of a subscription. The net-net of all of this is that fundamental business drivers are very positive, but aggregate ARPS for the company is declining because of various mix impacts, calculations surround ARPS, FX and the contra revenue impacts of market development funds. 
In fact, pass-throughs [ph] such as mix drove about 50% of the declining ARPS trend. We expect these impacts to converge to a steady state, and that's when you'll see aggregate ARPS begin to increase again. We will provide more insight into the components of the new model subscriptions as they mature into a bigger base next year. I know many of you are keenly interested in this area, and we will spend a lot more time on this at next week's Investor Day.
Total direct revenue also increased as a proportion of total revenues to 29%, up from just 17% 2 years ago and 25% last quarter as we continue to grow the volume of business for both our large enterprise customers as well as our eStore.
On the expense side, we continue to prudently manage spend. Total non-GAAP spend decreased by 2% year-over-year. This marks the third consecutive quarter of decreases as we diligently control our spending. We had already committed to keeping our FY '18 spend flat with FY '17. We're now committing to keep our FY '19 spend flat as well. This will require some additional effort, but we believe it's the right thing to do at this stage of our transition and that we can do so without compromising the long-term health of the company.
We also remained aggressive with our stock buyback program in Q3, buying back 2 million shares at an average price of $68.74. We've now repurchased nearly 7 million shares this fiscal year and plan to remain active buyers through both programmatic and opportunistic means. This is another area we will discuss in greater depth at our Investor Day on December 6.
Overall, we are extremely pleased with our Q3 results. We have increased confidence that the transition is working for customers, partners and Autodesk and that we are on track for the FY '20 targets we set.
Turning to our outlook. As we've seen over the past several quarters, global conditions have held steady with most of the mature markets performing relatively well, while many of the emerging markets have been challenging. As we evaluate our strong Q3 results and look ahead to Q4, we don't see any meaningful change in the demand environment. Talk of increased infrastructure spending and tax reform in the U.S. would likely benefit Autodesk, but it's far too early to determine if the election results will have a material positive or negative impact on our business domestically or abroad.
Our view for the rest of fiscal '17 remains positive. Our revenue and EPS results were slightly better than we expected in Q3. Q4 typically experiences a sequential increase due to seasonality, and we expect to see that again this year. But keep in mind that Q3 revenue benefited from $38 million in backlog from the end of sale of perpetual Suites at the end of Q2.
Since we've ended the sale of most perpetual licenses, backlog is now 0, and it won't be a material contributor going forward in the subscription-only model. We feel great about the way subscriptions are trending, and now that Q3 is behind us, we are bringing up the bottom end of our previous range for subscription additions. And we're on track for the spend target that we lowered last quarter.
When we started down this transition path 3 years ago, the objective was the same as it is today: build long-term shareholder value and establish Autodesk as the leader of the next generation of design and engineering software. We are accomplishing these goals in 3 simple ways: One, we're increasing the lifetime value of every customer by moving them to subscription models; Two, we're changing our cost structure by focusing our product portfolio and go-to-market strategies; and three, we're building the best cloud and mobile-based products and services in the industry, which significantly expands our TAM as the underlying technology platform shifts to the cloud.
Next week at our Investor Day event, we'll provide further detail on significant items on our path to our transition goals, including $6 in free cash flow per share in FY '20 and $11 in FY '23. Some of the items we'll cover include an update on the transition overall, focus areas to achieve the 20% growth in subscriptions and 24% CAGR in ARR, the factors influencing ARPS, TAM expansion opportunities in construction and manufacturing and success with our cloud offerings, the evolution of our go-to-market strategies to align with the subscription business, recent operating changes that will increase our access to borrowing cash and dramatically increase our financial flexibility, and our thoughts on capital allocation.
To wrap things up, we couldn't be more excited to be finally in the subscription-only model. We've executed well over the past few quarters, and we're looking forward to finishing the year strong. Our vision and strategy are working. The business model transition is ahead of plan, and we're leading the industry in delivering cloud-based software for the next generation of design and engineering. With each quarter, we become more confident in our ability to increase shareholder value by creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business and achieving the goals we set out for FY '20 for subscriptions, ARR and cash flow.

So market development funds are common to every company that sells through a value-added reseller channel. So it's, in effect, demand generation dollars. It's money that we make available to our resellers for them to go often and drive demand, presale demand for the product. So it's not a new program. We've had market development funds for years. I think what's changed this quarter is the way those market development funds are allocated. They're not treated as an expense. They're treated as a contra revenue, meaning they're subtracted from our reported revenues. It runs $10 million to $11 million a quarter. And so historically, what's happened is that was allocated pro rata to the sales through the channel, which were heavily driven by license sales. This quarter, of course, there's no license sales, so all of the market development funds, the same amount we've always spent, in that being allocated for the first time to recurring revenues. And so the $10 million to $11 million per quarter, when you annualize that, of course, is between $40 million and $45 million for the year. So first time we've seen that effect on recurring revenue was this quarter and I would expect that to stay in that range going forward."

One was about certainty product mix. One is about geo mix. There's others like terminalling. And then there are very specific things, the difference between, for example, EBAs and maintenance. Those numbers are different as well as certainly the cloud revenues look different. So those things matter a lot. We have a fair amount of flexibility. We understand the price range that these things will come in. Right now, we're actually above the plan for where we expect it to be. And one of the things I try to do in the middle of the prepared remarks was give you a little bit of information about what selling on a like-for-like basis is. So that's where -- those were, and those ""of the middle all about how much more people are being this year or this quarter compared to the previous year or the previous quarter. And we thought it was important to really compare the like-for-like so that people could understand it. One of the things we also mentioned is going forward, we'll start breaking this out for you. Having an average of averages of averages is way too confusing as we've all seen. I think, the folks at Goldman did a nice job at breaking out the model in their most recent report, and I think they did a nice job of looking at the stuff we did. While it's not identically our model, it's close and certainly has the major effects in there and a good understanding of the kind of mix we anticipate seeing and the price ranges. So maybe that helps a little bit. We're going to spend a lot more time next week walking you through this, but hopefully, that's a start on the problem."

We have a fervent belief that engineering software is going to move to the cloud. All the time in engineering software will be in the cloud.

We've shown kind of the basic architecture with products like Fusion 360 and how they take advantage of the connectivity and the compute power of the cloud. So we started to demonstrate that and we started investing in this area 3 or 4 years ago. As I said before, while everybody is rightfully focused on the business model transition of our existing business and how we're using it to attract new customers, what I think people will most be surprised about is you look out the next couple of years is the size of the cloud business that we built and how it really extends our TAM. So we are going to spend a bunch of time next week kind of showing a little bit more. [indiscernible] got to see it. We'll try to put kind of an investor look on it so that people next week can understand what we're doing and what the importance is and why we're investing in the cloud and why this really is the next-generation architecture. I've talked in the past about being a place for collaboration, giving you access to virtually unlimited amounts of compute power, which is something our users demand. And so it's just a natural fit. It's unusual that engineering has been one of the slowest to move to the cloud. But we see lots of evidence of hitting the tipping point not just in the U.S. but other places in terms of customer's willingness to adopt it. And so next week, you'll hear a bunch more."

As you know, part of it is the calculation method we chose gives great certainty and repeatability. It's very auditable, but it is a method that can greatly understate the amount of revenue coming in. So one of the things we do and we'll walk you through this example, but what we actually do is we take the revenue that comes in for the quarter to recognize revenue, which is particularly back-end loaded, can be close to 0. And we divide it by the number of subscribers at the end of the quarter. So in the extreme, if somebody -- so for example, we -- I'll use one example that will illustrate 2 points. The promotions were very heavily back-end loaded. So you have a low-priced offering that's discounted coming in very close to the end. So what you might get out of that is 1 day out of 91 worth of revenue, I'll call it 4 days out of 365 or slightly less than 1% of the revenue that, that subscription is work, but we divide it by a whole subscriber. So it greatly understates the value. Even in -- as we go through this, it will normalize as Scott mentioned because the numbers come up, the numbers get larger and you'll get the same effect moving from quarter-to-quarter. In the beginning, it's very sensitive to mix, it's very sensitive to timing. So we're ahead of our plan from where we want to be. And while I understand that some people are paying lots of attention to ARPS, I think, the better thing to look at going forward, and we tried to stress of this ARR as Scott mentioned we'll start giving you guidance on ARR. And on the ARPS 1, we'll start breaking it out so you don't have to be guessing at the coefficients between what's in cloud, what's in EBA, what's in product subscriptions and even in the subset, something like the legacy promotion. We think we can help you understand that a little better. Again, I'll tell you again, one of the reasons we gave the numbers in the middle of the prepared remarks about like-for-like was to show you the increase in pricing that we were seeing. And I was -- there were some numbers that were quarter-over-quarter and some was year-over-year, and we'll detail that a little bit more next week at Investor Day so you can see the thing.

So on the cloud stuff, Richard, in terms of having mature, viable cloud products for both the AEC industry and manufacturing, we are the only ones that have it. You look out and see some small startups fairly have any traction. We probably have 3 orders of magnitude, maybe 4 orders of magnitude, more users in the cloud than they do. So I think for people who are deciding that the cloud has real benefits, I think, Autodesk is the natural choice. As we -- we've detailed a little bit in previous times where we said more than half and sometimes it was three quarters of the users of Fusion are coming from other mechanical CAD packages. So it's not just our users who are adding on cloud capabilities. It's really to attract new users. The second part of it is one of the things we did when we introduced our cloud products is we made sure they weren't only direct competitors with what we already did, but it was to extend the market. So if you look at BIM 360, BIM 360 wasn't a replacement for Revit. It was to extend having model-based design go all the way out to the job site and reach all the construction workers. Those are the kind of things we're trying to do is expand the reach of our products because of the more natural platform. And I think, you've seen the same thing in other parts of enterprise software with SaaS offerings, where people are extending into parts of the company that their legacy applications would have never gone to. And I think, it's identical in the design and engineering world."

In terms of absolute dollars, we think there are more dollars of sales going through the channel in fiscal '20 than there were in fiscal '16. But as -- in terms of a percent of pie, the percent of the total sales that get done, it'll be a smaller percent by the time we get out there.

We started with a lot of transactions going through the eStore. But we also went through when you have back-end loaded quarters, you greatly understate the value of that subscription. It's why during the thing I tried to break out how the prices were increasing for like-for-like products going forward. And I think, that's going to be an important one. What you're getting is you're trying to look at on average and guess the component pieces. And rather than having you guess, what we said we would do next year is break it out so that you can actually see. In the interim, what we did is we gave you some numbers were showing that the prices are actually increasing even if the calculation methodology in the mix is hitting it down. As we said, just some of the mix issues, we're responsible for 50% of the decline. So mix and timing play a big role here. And remember how I just described that calculation? That if you buy something at the end of the quarter, for example, on the last day, it greatly undervalues what that subscription is worth over the long term. In a quarter in which we had a fair amount of promotion and the promotion was back-end loaded, you're going to see that.

If you go back to new model subscription sales a year ago, it was a small number. They were largely in mature markets, a healthy mix of monthly and annual as well as many of them came through the eStore. The channel was filled largely focused on selling perpetual licenses at that point. What we've seen over the last several quarters is pretty significant uptake of new model subscription sales. And I'm talking about product subscriptions sales now. Pretty significant uptake of those in emerging markets which, I think, is healthy for the business. Certainly, I would expect some of those to be recaptured in those emerging markets. But as that happens, of course, those are lower price, and so that's a headwind on ours. We see a lot more long-term sales of products and a lot less monthly. Frankly, we had a lot of toe dippers that were coming in monthly. Previously, we now have a lot more annual and multiyear. Again, good for the business but that -- the monthly subscription price is about 50% higher than the annual subscription price. Monthly times 12 is about 50% more than annual. So that mix shift, again, good for the business. Not necessarily good for ARPS, it's a headwind. And then as the channel has gotten really engaged and is driving this, and so a higher proportion of the sales or product subs come through the channel than the year ago, where many of them were being sold off the eStore. Again, I think, that's a positive for the business. It gives us scale, but it cuts into ARPS. So 3 trims that are very positive for our business and positive for the long-term ARR growth, but all it cut against growing ARPS for the short term."

That -- I would go back though and highlight what Carl mentioned in his script. Renewal rate is actually stronger this year than it was last year. So yes, we are seeing a decline in the absolute numbers, but it's not driven by the decline in renewal rate. It's driven by the rate at which the maintenance was, for renewals, and then in some cases, we're incentivizing them and successfully moving them over to the new model."

And I think, you've seen the effectiveness. We've been able to detail the effectiveness of the legacy programs very specifically. Piracy is a little bit harder. Unlike legacy, where people claim to be a legacy customer, people don't claim to be former pirates. So it makes it a little bit more difficult to identify them former pirates. But we do have our ways. I expect to see more from that. And like we said, about 1/3 of the customers coming are new customers. In terms of the other things that we see is growth amongst our enterprise customers in terms of EBAs and size of those, and then the whole new category of cloud customers and consumption. So you've heard that cloud customers, and then you'll have consumption models, where people kind of pay as they go for various services. Many of them will be tied directly to cloud products, but many will be consumption based into things like the collections. So, for example, someone's doing simulation or rendering in a collection. We'll get some amount with it, and if they want to use extra, they'll pay as they go so that's where [indiscernible] see that.

So we try to understand that dynamic a low bit more and we'll talk all bit more about that. As a rough guess, one of the ways to think about and we've talked about this before. For every legitimate user out there, there's about one that's slightly more than 1 user who's not paying for the software. So my guess would be as we made some of these offerings more affordable from an upfront perspective, we are attracting a fair number of the pirates. So the piracy base is probably bigger than we originally anticipated kind of last year when we laid out these goals. The second thing is the legacy base is probably bigger than we laid out last year at this time. We saw it in terms of the distribution throughout the years. Again, the midpoint is, again, around 7 years. So we're seeing a fair number of people who are historical users. So on both those fronts, we are kind of pleased. The greenfield is a little harder to identify for certain. The other ones, we had a better chance at. But we'll give you a little bit more color on this as we go -- get the numbers.

New model subscriptions grew by 168,000. New m",2399,"Thanks, Dave. We're really pleased with our third quarter results. Q3 marked a significant milestone in our transition. It's the first quarter where we only sold subscriptions, and we're off to a great start. New model subscriptions grew by 168,000. New model ARR grew 91% at constant currency, and recurring revenue jumped to 76% of total revenue.
More generally, we made progress on our 2 major initiatives: growing lifetime customer value by moving customers to the subscription model and increasing adoption of our cloud-based solutions. Given that this quarter was the most uncertain when we started the year, these are fantastic results. So let's look at the details.
For the quarter, we added 134,000 net subscriptions. New model subscription additions more than tripled year-over-year to 168,000, while the maintenance subscriptions declined as expected by 34,000 during the quarter. Product subscriptions drove the vast majority of the new model sub additions. The launch of industry collections, the next generation of Suites that include many of our cloud services, contributed to our strong growth this quarter. Collections are a great example of how we're simplifying our offerings while increasing lifetime customer value.
During the quarter, we ran another promotion aimed at converting our legacy non-subscriber base to new product subscriptions. Like the promotion in Q1, legacy nonsubscribers were offered product subscriptions at a discount when trading in their old perpetual licenses. The Q3 promotion added approximately 43,000 product subscriptions, significantly more than in Q1. In addition, the overall average selling price was twice as high as the Q1 promotion due to a lower discount and the fact that customers favored higher-priced products.  And lastly, more than 50% of the subscribers turned in licenses that were 7 years back or older. This reinforces our view that there are a meaningful number of active users whose licenses are more than 5 years old and are interested in moving to the latest software.
While the promo successfully migrated many legacy customers to our subscription model, product subscriptions continue to attract a significant number of users that are new to Autodesk. Once again, new customers represented about 1/3 of our new product subscriptions for the quarter. We believe some of these people were previously pirating the software and now have a much more affordable option with product subscriptions. This is consistent with the fact that emerging countries are some of the fastest growing areas for product subscriptions. In other cases, these new users have been using an alternative design tool and can now afford software from Autodesk.
Overall, product subscriptions grew by more than 30% quarter-over-quarter with new subscribers coming from the legacy base, from people previously pirating the software and from new customers switching from other systems. Particularly pleasing is that the strong performance immediately follows the end of sale of perpetual licenses for Suites.
We also had another record quarter for cloud subscription additions. They nearly doubled from the second quarter, which was also a record. BIM 360 and Fusion 360, once again, are leading the way, but we also have continued to have success with our other cloud products such as AutoCAD 360, Shotgun and Collaboration for Revit.
It is clear that we are building on our leadership in the cloud and that cloud services are growing in importance with our customers. We see the benefits of the cloud's inherent scale and connectivity. For example, during Q3, we signed a large BIM 360 contract with a global construction company. Last spring, they started a pilot program, less than 200 seats for new projects. Working with them on their implementation drove rapid adoption. Their results were so strong that they signed a 7-figure agreement, expanding their use of BIM 360 Glue, Field and Docs to additional projects, reaching over 2,000 subscriptions in just 1 region. Now they are planning to scale their BIM processes even further, eventually using BIM 360 for all projects in all regions.
Maintenance is our other significant subscription bucket. During the quarter, we included for the first time 13,000 maintenance customers from our acquisition of Solid Angle. As you already know, July 31 was the last time customers could add maintenance to a perpetual license, so the incentive to stay up-to-date with existing maintenance contracts is compelling.
In Q3, the renewal rate for maintenance subscriptions were strong, ahead of last year. But with no new maintenance agreements being sold, total maintenance subscriptions declined. As we've said before, we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance subscriptions going forward. The rate of decline will vary based on the number of subscriptions that come up for renewal, the renewal rate and our ability to incentivize maintenance customers to switch over to product subscription. This migration is good for both Autodesk and our customers as it moves them to our newest and best products. While we are still working through the time line, at some point, we will further simplify our offerings, and the maintenance subscription and product subscription offerings will converge into a single program.
Now let me get into ARR. New model ARR growth surged to 91% on a constant currency basis and reflects the continued strong uptake of all of our new subscription offerings. Total ARR grew 15% at constant currency. ARR growth was negatively impacted this quarter by the allocation of our market development funds, which are accounted for as contra revenue and booked upfront in each quarter. Prior to Q3, these funds were allocated across all revenue streams. With the end of perpetual license sales, 100% of our market development funds are now allocated to recurring revenues in ARR. This impacted ARR growth by 3 percentage points or about $40 million.
FX rates also continued to be a headwind for ARR in the quarter. The combination of FX rates and contra revenues reduced total ARR by about $100 million or 7 percentage points in Q3, which is sizable. Despite those headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our FY '20 ARR CAGR of 24%.
I mentioned last quarter that some of our moves to drive subscriptions in ARR revolve around pricing. In early September, we made changes that rationalized the pricing of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. The aim was to drive customers to the right product for their needs and do so with higher billings and ARR.
I'm pleased to report that these actions are motivating the intended customer behavior. More LT users are buying up to [ph] AutoCAD, and the volumes for AutoCAD and especially AutoCAD verticals increased significantly quarter-over-quarter. For the overall AutoCAD family of products, volume and ARR increased because of these price changes.
We focus on subscriptions and ARR as the key metrics to measure our progress in the business model transition. However, we have received many investment questions on trends in annualized revenue per subscription or ARPS, so I thought I'd spend a little extra time on it this quarter, and we'll spend more time on it at Investor Day next week.
Let's start by focusing on new seats added in Q3, excluding the promo seats, as they have the temporary effect of depressing ARPS until their renewal, which will be at the full price. Suites and collections in the U.S. saw a year-over-year increase in ARPS of 24%. In Germany, the increase was plus 79%, and in Japan, it was plus 26%. AutoCAD LT in the U.S. saw a year-over-year increase of plus 9%. In Germany, the increase was plus 55% and in Japan, 50%.
The AutoCAD family, which is the sum of the newer AutoCAD and the vertical AutoCAD in the U.S. saw a year-over-year increase of 8%. In Germany, the increase was 13% and in Japan, 78%. Because of strong year-over-year changes with new seat purchases, the quarter-over-quarter ARPS change for the sum of AutoCAD, AutoCAD verticals and AutoCAD LT in the U.S., Germany and Japan were 5%, 35% and 64%, respectively. This was simply the result of more people buying vertical AutoCAD than vanilla AutoCAD and more people buying AutoCAD instead of AutoCAD LT, exactly the result we were looking for from the pricing change and why we generated more volume in ARR from the AutoCAD family. These are very positive outcomes. In fact, except for a few emerging markets in Europe, we see essentially the same trend lines everywhere.
So why aren't these results reflected in the aggregate ARPS number we report? There are 2 primary reasons. First, the calculation is extremely sensitive to mix in the early stages. Small numbers exaggerate the effects of short-term shifts internally, geo mix, promotions, et cetera, until it starts to normalize when the number of customers is large enough. Secondly, the math that we use to count ARR and subscriptions is very sensitive to timing within a quarter. On an as-reported basis, ARPS can significantly understate the value of a subscription. The net-net of all of this is that fundamental business drivers are very positive, but aggregate ARPS for the company is declining because of various mix impacts, calculations surround ARPS, FX and the contra revenue impacts of market development funds. 
In fact, pass-throughs such as mix drove about 50% of the declining ARPS trend. We expect these impacts to converge to a steady state, and that's when you'll see aggregate ARPS begin to increase again. We will provide more insight into the components of the new model subscriptions as they mature into a bigger base next year. I know many of you are keenly interested in this area, and we will spend a lot more time on this at next week's Investor Day.
Total direct revenue also increased as a proportion of total revenues to 29%, up from just 17% 2 years ago and 25% last quarter as we continue to grow the volume of business for both our large enterprise customers as well as our eStore.
On the expense side, we continue to prudently manage spend. Total non-GAAP spend decreased by 2% year-over-year. This marks the third consecutive quarter of decreases as we diligently control our spending. We had already committed to keeping our FY '18 spend flat with FY '17. We're now committing to keep our FY '19 spend flat as well. This will require some additional effort, but we believe it's the right thing to do at this stage of our transition and that we can do so without compromising the long-term health of the company.
We also remained aggressive with our stock buyback program in Q3, buying back 2 million shares at an average price of $68.74. We've now repurchased nearly 7 million shares this fiscal year and plan to remain active buyers through both programmatic and opportunistic means. This is another area we will discuss in greater depth at our Investor Day on December 6.
Overall, we are extremely pleased with our Q3 results. We have increased confidence that the transition is working for customers, partners and Autodesk and that we are on track for the FY '20 targets we set.
Turning to our outlook. As we've seen over the past several quarters, global conditions have held steady with most of the mature markets performing relatively well, while many of the emerging markets have been challenging. As we evaluate our strong Q3 results and look ahead to Q4, we don't see any meaningful change in the demand environment. Talk of increased infrastructure spending and tax reform in the U.S. would likely benefit Autodesk, but it's far too early to determine if the election results will have a material positive or negative impact on our business domestically or abroad.
Our view for the rest of fiscal '17 remains positive. Our revenue and EPS results were slightly better than we expected in Q3. Q4 typically experiences a sequential increase due to seasonality, and we expect to see that again this year. But keep in mind that Q3 revenue benefited from $38 million in backlog from the end of sale of perpetual Suites at the end of Q2.
Since we've ended the sale of most perpetual licenses, backlog is now 0, and it won't be a material contributor going forward in the subscription-only model. We feel great about the way subscriptions are trending, and now that Q3 is behind us, we are bringing up the bottom end of our previous range for subscription additions. And we're on track for the spend target that we lowered last quarter.
When we started down this transition path 3 years ago, the objective was the same as it is today: build long-term shareholder value and establish Autodesk as the leader of the next generation of design and engineering software. We are accomplishing these goals in 3 simple ways: One, we're increasing the lifetime value of every customer by moving them to subscription models; Two, we're changing our cost structure by focusing our product portfolio and go-to-market strategies; and three, we're building the best cloud and mobile-based products and services in the industry, which significantly expands our TAM as the underlying technology platform shifts to the cloud.
Next week at our Investor Day event, we'll provide further detail on significant items on our path to our transition goals, including $6 in free cash flow per share in FY '20 and $11 in FY '23. Some of the items we'll cover include an update on the transition overall, focus areas to achieve the 20% growth in subscriptions and 24% CAGR in ARR, the factors influencing ARPS, TAM expansion opportunities in construction and manufacturing and success with our cloud offerings, the evolution of our go-to-market strategies to align with the subscription business, recent operating changes that will increase our access to borrowing cash and dramatically increase our financial flexibility, and our thoughts on capital allocation.
To wrap things up, we couldn't be more excited to be finally in the subscription-only model. We've executed well over the past few quarters, and we're looking forward to finishing the year strong. Our vision and strategy are working. The business model transition is ahead of plan, and we're leading the industry in delivering cloud-based software for the next generation of design and engineering. With each quarter, we become more confident in our ability to increase shareholder value by creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business and achieving the goals we set out for FY '20 for subscriptions, ARR and cash flow.

So market development funds are common to every company that sells through a value-added reseller channel. So it's, in effect, demand generation dollars. It's money that we make available to our resellers for them to go often and drive demand, presale demand for the product. So it's not a new program. We've had market development funds for years. I think what's changed this quarter is the way those market development funds are allocated. They're not treated as an expense. They're treated as a contra revenue, meaning they're subtracted from our reported revenues. It runs $10 million to $11 million a quarter. And so historically, what's happened is that was allocated pro rata to the sales through the channel, which were heavily driven by license sales. This quarter, of course, there's no license sales, so all of the market development funds, the same amount we've always spent, in that being allocated for the first time to recurring revenues. And so the $10 million to $11 million per quarter, when you annualize that, of course, is between $40 million and $45 million for the year. So first time we've seen that effect on recurring revenue was this quarter, and I would expect that to stay in that range going forward."

One was about, certainly, product mix. One is about geo mix. There's others like term length. And then there are very specific things, the difference between, for example, EBAs and maintenance. Those numbers look different as well as certainly the cloud revenues look different. So those things matter a lot. We have a fair amount of flexibility. We understand the price range that these things will come in. Right now we're actually above the plan for where we expect it to be. And one of the things I tried to do in the middle of the prepared remarks was give you a little bit of information about what selling on a like-for-like basis is. So that's where -- those were those quotes in the middle all about how much more people are paying this year or this quarter compared to the previous year or the previous quarter. And we thought it was important to really compare the like-for-like so that people could understand it. One of the things we also mentioned is, going forward, we'll start breaking this out for you. Having an average of averages of averages is way too confusing as we've all seen. I think the folks at Goldman did a nice job at breaking out the model in their most recent report, and I think they did a nice job of looking at the stuff we did. While it's not identically our model, it's close and certainly has the major effects in there and a good understanding of the kind of mix we anticipate seeing and the price ranges. So maybe that helps a little bit. We're going to spend a lot more time next week walking you through this, but hopefully, that's a start on the problem."

And you just need to look at the ARPS for maintenance, and you see it's far more steady because it's a much bigger base of maintenance subs. So as the base grows, mix will become slightly less important. I think, longer term, the more important metric than ARPS is ARR, and so one of things we look to do is provide you better insight into where we think ARR is headed so that the ARPS calculation becomes less slightly sensitive.

We have a fervent belief that engineering software is going to move to the cloud. All design and engineering software will be in the cloud. We started to demonstrate that with a number of products we've talked about, some like BIM 360. We've shown kind of the basic architecture with products like Fusion 360 and how they take advantage of the connectivity and the compute power of the cloud. So we started to demonstrate that, and we started investing in this area 3 or 4 years ago. As I've said before, while everybody is rightfully focused on the business model transition of our existing business and how we're using it to attract new customers, what I think people will most be surprised about, as you look out the next couple of years, is the size of the cloud business that we built and how it really extends our TAM. So we're going to spend a bunch of time next week kind of showing a little bit more. You were at AU and got to see it. We'll try to put kind of an investor look on it so that people next week can understand what we're doing and what the importance is and why we're investing in the cloud and why this really is the next-generation architecture. And I've talked in the past about being a place for collaboration as we've always said [ph] giving you access to virtually unlimited amounts of compute power, which is something our users demand. And so it's just a natural fit. It's unusual that engineering has been one of the slowest to move to the cloud, but we see lots of evidence of hitting the tipping point not just in the U.S. but other places in terms of customer's willingness to adopt it.

It's very auditable, but it is a method that can greatly understate the amount of revenue coming in. So one of the things we do -- and we'll walk you through this example. But what we actually do is we take the revenue that comes in for the quarter to recognize revenue, which, if it's particularly back-end loaded, can be close to 0, and we divide it by the number of subscribers at the end of the quarter. So in the extreme, if somebody -- so for example, we -- I'll use one example that will illustrate 2 points. The promotions were very heavily back-end loaded. So you have a low-priced offering that's discounted coming in very close to the end. So what you might get out of that is 1 day out of 91 worth of revenue or, call it, 4 days out of 365 or slightly less than 1% of the revenue that, that subscription is worth, but we divide it by a whole subscriber. So it greatly understates the value. Even in -- as we go through this, it will normalize, as Scott mentioned, because the numbers come up -- the numbers get larger, and you'll get the same effect moving from quarter-to-quarter. In the beginning, it's very sensitive to mix. It's very sensitive to timing. So we're ahead of our plan from where we want to be. And while I understand that some people are paying lots of attention to ARPS, I think the better thing to look at going forward, and we've tried to stress, is ARR. As Scott mentioned, we'll start giving you guidance on ARR. And on the ARPS one, we'll start breaking it out, so you don't have to be guessing at the coefficients between what's in cloud, what's in EBA, what's in product subscriptions and even in the subset that's something like the legacy promotion. We think we can help you understand that a little better. Again, I'll -- I'll tell you again, one of the reasons we gave the numbers in the middle of the prepared remarks about like for like was to show you the increase in pricing that we were seeing. And that was both -- there were some numbers that were quarter-over-quarter, and some were year-over-year. And we'll detail that a little bit more next week at Investor Day, so you can see the thing.

So on the cloud stuff, Richard, in terms of having mature, viable cloud products for both the AEC industry and manufacturing, we're really the only ones that have it. You can look out and see some small startups but barely have any traction. We probably have 3 orders of magnitude, maybe 4 orders of magnitude more users in the cloud than they do. So I think for people who are deciding that the cloud has real benefits, I think Autodesk is the natural choice. As we -- we've detailed a little bit at previous times where we said more than half and sometimes it was 3/4 of the users of Fusion are coming from other mechanical CAD packages. So it's not just our users who are adding on cloud capabilities. It's really to attract new users. The second part of it is one of the things we did when we introduced our cloud products is we made sure they weren't only direct competitors with what we already did, but it was to extend the market. So if you look at BIM 360, BIM 360 wasn't a replacement for Revit. It was to extend having model-based design go all the way out to the job site and reach all the construction workers. Those are the kind of things we're trying to do, is expand the reach of our products because of the more natural platform. And I think you've seen the same thing in other parts of enterprise software with SaaS offerings, where people are extending into parts of the company that their legacy applications would have never gone to. And I think it's identical in the design and engineering world."

In terms of absolute dollars, we think there are more dollars of sales going through the channel in fiscal '20 than there were in fiscal '16. But as -- in terms of a percent of pie, the percent of the total sales that get done, it'll be a smaller percent by the time we get out there.

We started with a lot of EBA. We started with a lot of transactions going through the eStore, but we also went through -- when you have back-end loaded quarters, you greatly understate the value of that subscription. It's why during the thing I tried to break out how the prices were increasing for like-for-like products going forward. And I think that's going to be an important one. What you're getting is you're trying to look at on average and guess the component pieces. And rather than have you guess, what we said we would do next year is break it out so that you can actually see. In the interim, what we did is we gave you some numbers for showing that the prices are actually increasing even if the calculation methodology in the mix is hitting it down. As we said, just some of the mix issues, we're responsible for 50% of the decline. So mix and timing play a big role here. And remember how I just described that calculation, that if you buy something at the end of the quarter, for example, on the last day, it greatly undervalues what that subscription is worth over the long term. In a quarter in which we had a fair amount of promotion and the promotion was back-end loaded, you're going to see that. But I'll reemphasize again. The prices of like for like for people buying the same thing that they bought last quarter or a year ago, those prices are going up significantly, and I highlighted how they were going up significantly across the world."

If you go back to new model subscription sales a year ago, it was a small number. They were largely in mature markets, a healthy mix of monthly and annual as well as many of them came through the eStore. The channel was still largely focused on selling perpetual licenses at that point. What we've seen over the last several quarters is pretty significant uptake of new model subscription sales, and I'm talking about product subscriptions sales now, pretty significant uptake of those in emerging markets which, I think, is healthy for the business. It's certainly -- I would expect some of those to be recapture of pirates in those emerging markets. But as that happens, of course, those are lower priced, and so that's a headwind on ARPS. We see a lot more long-term sales of product and a lot less monthly. Frankly, we had a lot of toe dippers that were coming in monthly. Previously, we now have a lot more annual and multiyear. Again, good for the business but that -- the monthly subscription price is about 50% higher than the annual subscription price. Monthly times 12 is about 50% more than annual. So as that mix shifts, again, good for the business, not necessarily good for ARPS. It's a headwind. And then as the channel has gotten really engaged and is driving this and so a higher proportion of the sales of product subs come through the channel than a year ago, where many of them were being sold off the eStore. Again, I think, that's a positive for the business. It gives us scale, but it cuts into ARPS. So 3 trends that are very positive for our business and positive for the long-term ARR growth, but all that cut against growing ARPS in the short term."

So yes, we're seeing a decline in the absolute numbers, but it's not driven by a decline in renewal rate. It's driven by the rate at which the maintenance agreements come up for renewal, and then in some cases, we're incentivizing them and successfully moving them over to new model."

And I think you've seen the effectiveness. We've been able to detail the effectiveness of the legacy programs very specifically. Piracy is a little bit harder. Unlike legacy, where people claim to be a legacy customer, people don't claim to be former pirates. So it makes it a little bit more difficult to identify them as former pirates, but we do have our ways. I expect to see more from that. And like we said, about 1/3 of the customers coming are new customers. In terms of the other -- the other thing that we see is growth amongst our enterprise customers in terms of EBAs and size of those and then the whole new category of cloud customers and consumption. So you'll have all that cloud customers, and then you'll have consumption models, where people kind of pay as they go for various services. Many of them will be tied directly to cloud products, but many will be consumption based into things like the collections. So for example, if someone's doing simulation or rendering in a collection, they'll get some amount with it. And if they want to use extra, they'll pay as they go. So that's where we're expecting to see that. And next week, you'll see a bunch more about it. But right now our cloud business is growing incredibly quickly.

So we're trying to understand that dynamic a little bit more, and we'll talk a little bit more about that. As a rough guess, one of the ways to think about, and we've talked about this before, for every legitimate user out there, there's about one that's slightly more than one user who's not paying for the software. So my guess would be, as we made some of these offerings more affordable from an upfront perspective, we're attracting a fair number of the pirates. So the piracy base is probably bigger than we originally anticipated kind of last year when we laid out these goals. The second thing is the legacy base is probably bigger than we laid out last year at this time. We saw it in terms of the distribution throughout the years. Again, the midpoint is, again, around 7 years. So we're seeing a fair number of people who are historical users. So on both those fronts, we're kind of pleased. The greenfield is a little harder to identify for certain. The other ones, we have a better chance at. But we'll give you a little bit more color on this as we go -- we get the numbers.

And next week, Amar will go through a bunch of it, a bunch of what we're doing there and how it's reaching people who are actually on the construction site building stuff. When you look at the other things like manufacturing, Fusion 360 as well as all of our advanced manufacturing products are really very specifically about the next part of the process. I've kind of joked that we've helped people make beautiful digital prototypes, things that stay on that side of the glass, but our customers get paid for making real things. And so what we started doing a number of years ago is starting helping them in that process of taking it on one side of the screen to the other side of the screen. And we have lots of stuff going on in composite materials, a lot we have going on with machining, communicating on the factory floor as well as the construction site. Those are all expansions of the market, and we'll spend a fair amount of time. We've generally spent most of our time -- and probably appropriate so as people have been very interested in the new business model transition. But like I said, this is a growing and very important part of the business, and as people look to the next couple of years, they'll become increasingly important. So we'll give you some more detail, Brent."

New model subscriptions grew by 168,000. New m",2397,"Thanks, Dave. We're really pleased with our third quarter results. Q3 marked a significant milestone in our transition. It's the first quarter where we only sold subscriptions, and we're off to a great start. New model subscriptions grew by 168,000. New model ARR grew 91% at constant currency, and recurring revenue jumped to 76% of total revenue.
More generally, we made progress on our 2 major initiatives: growing lifetime customer value by moving customers to the subscription model and increasing adoption of our cloud-based solutions. Given that this quarter was the most uncertain when we started the year, these are fantastic results. So let's look at the details.
For the quarter, we added 134,000 net subscriptions. New model subscription additions more than tripled year-over-year to 168,000, while maintenance subscriptions declined, as expected, by 34,000 during the quarter. Product subscriptions drove the vast majority of the new model sub additions. The launch of industry collections, the next generation of Suites that include many of our cloud services, contributed to our strong growth this quarter. Collections are a great example of how we're simplifying our offerings while increasing lifetime customer value.
During the quarter, we ran another promotion aimed at converting our legacy non-subscriber base to new product subscriptions. Like the promotion in Q1, legacy nonsubscribers were offered product subscriptions at a discount when trading in their old perpetual licenses. The Q3 promotion added approximately 43,000 product subscriptions, significantly more than in Q1. In addition, the overall average selling price was twice as high as the Q1 promotion due to a lower discount and the fact that customers favored higher-priced products. And lastly, more than 50% of the subscribers turned in licenses that were 7 years back or older. This reinforces our view that there are a meaningful number of active users whose licenses are more than 5 years old and are interested in moving to the latest software.
While the promo successfully migrated many legacy customers to our subscription model, product subscriptions continue to attract a significant number of users that are new to Autodesk. Once again, new customers represented about 1/3 of our new product subscriptions for the quarter. We believe some of these people were previously pirating the software and now have a much more affordable option with product subscriptions. This is consistent with the fact that emerging countries are some of the fastest-growing areas for product subscriptions. In other cases, these new users have been using an alternative design tool and can now afford software from Autodesk.
Overall, product subscriptions grew by more than 30% quarter-over-quarter with new subscribers coming from the legacy base, from people previously pirating the software and from new customers switching from other systems. Particularly pleasing is that the strong performance immediately follows the end of sale of perpetual licenses for Suites.
We also had another record quarter for cloud subscription additions. They nearly doubled from the second quarter, which was also a record. BIM 360 and Fusion 360, once again, are leading the way, but we also have continued to have success with our other cloud products such as AutoCAD 360, Shotgun and Collaboration for Revit.
It is clear that we are building on our leadership in the cloud and that cloud services are growing in importance with our customers. We see the benefits of the cloud's inherent scale and connectivity. For example, during Q3, we signed a large BIM 360 contract with a global construction company. Last spring, they started a pilot program, less than 200 seats for new projects. Working with them on their implementation drove rapid adoption. Their results were so strong that they signed a 7-figure agreement, expanding their use of BIM 360 Glue, Field and Docs to additional projects, reaching over 2,000 subscriptions in just 1 region. Now they are planning to scale their BIM processes even further, eventually using BIM 360 for all projects in all regions.
Maintenance is our other significant subscription bucket. During the quarter, we included for the first time 13,000 maintenance customers from our acquisition of Solid Angle. As you already know, July 31 was the last time customers could add maintenance to a perpetual license, so the incentive to stay up-to-date with existing maintenance contracts is compelling.
In Q3, the renewal rate for maintenance subscriptions was strong, ahead of last year. But with no new maintenance agreements being sold, total maintenance subscriptions declined. As we've said before, we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance subscriptions going forward. The rate of decline will vary based on the number of subscriptions that come up for renewal, the renewal rate and our ability to incentivize maintenance customers to switch over to product subscription. This migration is good for both Autodesk and our customers as it moves them to our newest and best products. While we are still working through the time line, at some point, we will further simplify our offerings, and the maintenance subscription and product subscription offerings will converge into a single program.
Now let me get into ARR. New model ARR growth surged to 91% on a constant-currency basis and reflects the continued strong uptake of all of our new subscription offerings. Total ARR grew 15% at constant currency. ARR growth was negatively impacted this quarter by the allocation of our market development funds, which are accounted for as contra revenue and booked upfront in each quarter. Prior to Q3, these funds were allocated across all revenue streams. With the end of perpetual license sales, 100% of our market development funds are now allocated to recurring revenues in ARR. This impacted ARR growth by 3 percentage points or about $40 million.
FX rates also continued to be a headwind for ARR in the quarter. The combination of FX rates and contra revenues reduced total ARR by about $100 million or 7 percentage points in Q3, which is sizable. Despite those headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our FY '20 ARR CAGR of 24%.
I mentioned last quarter that some of our moves to drive subscriptions in ARR revolve around pricing. In early September, we made changes that rationalized the pricing of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. The aim was to drive customers to the right product for their needs and do so with higher billings and ARR.
I'm pleased to report that these actions are motivating the intended customer behavior. More LT users are buying up to [ph] AutoCAD, and the volumes for AutoCAD and especially AutoCAD verticals increased significantly quarter-over-quarter. For the overall AutoCAD family of products, volume and ARR increased because of these price changes.
We focus on subscriptions and ARR as the key metrics to measure our progress in the business model transition. However, we have received many investment questions on trends in annualized revenue per subscription or ARPS, so I thought I'd spend a little extra time on it this quarter, and we'll spend more time on it at Investor Day next week.
Let's start by focusing on new seats added in Q3, excluding the promo seats, as they have the temporary effect of depressing ARPS until their renewal, which will be at the full price. Suites and collections in the U.S. saw a year-over-year increase in ARPS of 24%. In Germany, the increase was plus 79%, and in Japan, it was plus 26%. AutoCAD LT in the U.S. saw a year-over-year increase of plus 9%. In Germany, the increase was plus 55% and in Japan, 50%.
The AutoCAD family, which is the sum of the newer AutoCAD and the vertical AutoCAD in the U.S. saw a year-over-year increase of 8%. In Germany, the increase was 13% and in Japan, 78%. Because of strong year-over-year changes for new seat purchases, the quarter-over-quarter ARPS change for the sum of AutoCAD, AutoCAD verticals and AutoCAD LT in the U.S., Germany and Japan were 5%, 35% and 64%, respectively. This was simply the result of more people buying vertical AutoCAD than vanilla AutoCAD and more people buying AutoCAD instead of AutoCAD LT, exactly the result we were looking for from the pricing change and why we generated more volume in ARR from the AutoCAD family. These are very positive outcomes. In fact, except for a few emerging markets in Europe, we see essentially the same trend lines everywhere.
So why aren't these results reflected in the aggregate ARPS number we report? There are 2 primary reasons. First, the calculation is extremely sensitive to mix in the early stages. Small numbers exaggerate the effects of short-term shifts internally, geo mix, promotions, et cetera, until it starts to normalize when the number of customers is large enough. Secondly, the math that we use to count ARR and subscriptions is very sensitive to timing within the quarter. On an as-reported basis, ARPS can significantly understate the value of a subscription. The net-net of all of this is that fundamental business drivers are very positive, but aggregate ARPS for the company is declining because of various mix impacts, calculations surround ARPS, FX and the contra revenue impact of market development funds. 
In fact, pass-throughs such as mix drove about 50% of the declining ARPS trend. We expect these impacts to converge to a steady state, and that's when you'll see aggregate ARPS begin to increase again. We will provide more insight into the components of the new model subscriptions as they mature into a bigger base next year. I know many of you are keenly interested in this area, and we will spend a lot more time on this at next week's Investor Day.
Total direct revenue also increased as a proportion of total revenues to 29%, up from just 17% 2 years ago and 25% last quarter as we continue to grow the volume of business with both our large enterprise customers as well as our eStore.
On the expense side, we continue to prudently manage spend. Total non-GAAP spend decreased by 2% year-over-year. This marks the third consecutive quarter of decreases as we diligently control our spending. We had already committed to keeping our FY '18 spend flat with FY '17. We're now committing to keep our FY '19 spend flat as well. This will require some additional effort, but we believe it's the right thing to do at this stage of our transition and that we can do so without compromising the long-term health of the company.
We also remained aggressive with our stock buyback program in Q3, buying back 2 million shares at an average price of $68.74. We've now repurchased nearly 7 million shares this fiscal year and plan to remain active buyers through both programmatic and opportunistic means. This is another area we will discuss in greater depth at our Investor Day on December 6.
Overall, we were extremely pleased with our Q3 results. We have increased confidence that the transition is working for customers, partners and Autodesk and that we are on track for the FY '20 targets we set.
Turning to our outlook. As we've seen over the past several quarters, global conditions have held steady with most of the mature markets performing relatively well, while many of the emerging markets have been challenging. As we evaluate our strong Q3 results and look ahead to Q4, we don't see any meaningful change in the demand environment. Talk of increased infrastructure spending and tax reform in the U.S. would likely benefit Autodesk, but it's far too early to determine if the election results will have a material positive or a negative impact on our business domestically or abroad.
Our view for the rest of fiscal '17 remains positive. Our revenue and EPS results were slightly better than we expected in Q3. Q4 typically experiences a sequential increase due to seasonality, and we expect to see that again this year. But keep in mind that Q3 revenue benefited from $38 million in backlog from the end of sale of perpetual Suites at the end of Q2.
Since we've ended the sale of most perpetual licenses, backlog is now 0, and it won't be a material contributor going forward in the subscription-only model. We feel great about the way subscriptions are trending, and now that Q3 is behind us, we are bringing up the bottom end of our previous range for subscription additions. And we're on track for the spend target that we lowered last quarter.
When we started down this transition path 3 years ago, the objective was the same as it is today: build long-term shareholder value and establish Autodesk as the leader of the next generation of design and engineering software. We are accomplishing these goals in 3 simple ways: One, we're increasing the lifetime value of every customer by moving them to subscription models; two, we're changing our cost structure by focusing our product portfolio and go-to-market strategies; and three, we're building the best cloud and mobile-based products and services in the industry, which significantly expands our TAM as the underlying technology platform shifts to the cloud.
Next week at our Investor Day event, we'll provide further detail on significant items on our path to our transition goals, including $6 in free cash flow per share in FY '20 and $11 in FY '23. Some of the items we'll cover include: an update on the transition overall; focus areas to achieve the 20% growth in subscriptions and 24% CAGR in ARR; the factors influencing ARPS; TAM expansion opportunities in construction and manufacturing and success with our cloud offerings; the evolution of our go-to-market strategies to align with the subscription business; recent operating changes that will increase our access to borrowing cash and dramatically increase our financial flexibility; and our thoughts on capital allocation.
To wrap things up, we couldn't be more excited to be finally in the subscription-only model. We've executed well over the past few quarters, and we're looking forward to finishing the year strong. Our vision and strategy are working. The business model transition is ahead of plan, and we're leading the industry in delivering cloud-based software for the next generation of design and engineering. With each quarter, we become more confident in our ability to increase shareholder value by creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business and achieving the goals we set out for FY '20 for subscriptions, ARR and cash flow.

So market development funds are common to every company that sells through a value-added reseller channel. So it's, in effect, demand generation dollars. It's money that we make available to our resellers for them to go off and drive demand, presale demand for the product. So it's not a new program. We've had market development funds for years. I think what's changed this quarter is the way those market development funds are allocated. They're not treated as an expense. They're treated as a contra revenue, meaning they're subtracted from our reported revenues. It runs $10 million to $11 million a quarter. And so historically, what's happened is that was allocated pro rata to the sales through the channel, which were heavily driven by license sales. This quarter, of course, there's no license sales, so all of the market development funds, the same amount we've always spent, end up being allocated for the first time to recurring revenues. And so the $10 million to $11 million per quarter, when you annualize that, of course, is between $40 million and $45 million for the year. So first time we've seen that effect on recurring revenue was this quarter, and I would expect it to stay in that range going forward."

One was about, certainly, product mix. One is about geo mix. There's others like term length. And then there are very specific things, the difference between, for example, EBAs and maintenance. Those numbers look different as well as certainly the cloud revenues look different. So those things matter a lot. We have a fair amount of flexibility. We understand the price range that these things will come in. Right now, we're actually above the plan for where we expected to be. And one of the things I tried to do in the middle of the prepared remarks was give you a little bit of information about what selling on a like-for-like basis is. So that's where -- those were those quotes in the middle all about how much more people are paying this year or this quarter compared to the previous year or the previous quarter. And we thought it was important to really compare the like-for-like so that people could understand it. One of the things we also mentioned is going forward, we'll start breaking this out for you. Having an average of averages of averages is way too confusing as we've all seen. I think the folks at Goldman did a nice job at breaking out the model in their most recent report, and I think they did a nice job of looking at the stuff we did. While it's not identically our model, it's close and certainly has the major effects in there and a good understanding of the kind of mix we anticipate seeing and the price ranges. So maybe that helps a little bit. We're going to spend a lot more time next week walking you through this, but hopefully, that's a start on the problem."

So as the base grows, mix will become slightly less important. I think, longer term, the more important metric than ARPS is ARR, and so one of things we'll look to do is provide you better insight into where we think ARR is headed so that the ARPS calculation becomes less slightly sensitive.

We have a fervent belief that engineering software is going to move to the cloud. All design and engineering software will be in the cloud. We've started to demonstrate that with a number of products we've talked about, some like BIM 360. We've shown kind of the basic architecture with products like Fusion 360 and how they take advantage of the connectivity and the compute power of the cloud. So we started to demonstrate that, and we started investing in this area 3 or 4 years ago. As I've said before, while everybody is rightfully focused on the business model transition of our existing business and how we're using it to attract new customers, what I think people will most be surprised about, as you look out the next couple of years, is the size of the cloud business that we built and how it really extends our TAM. So we're going to spend a bunch of time next week kind of showing a little bit more. You were at AU and got to see it. We'll try to put kind of an investor look on it so that people next week can understand what we're doing and what the importance is and why we're investing in the cloud and why this really is the next-generation architecture. And I've talked in the past about being a place for collaboration as always it giving you access to virtually unlimited amounts of compute power, which is something our users demand. And so it's just a natural fit. It's unusual that engineering has been one of the slowest to move to the cloud, but we see lots of evidence of hitting the tipping point not just in the U.S. but other places in terms of customer's willingness to adopt it. And so next week, you'll hear a bunch more."

It's very auditable, but it is a method that can greatly understate the amount of revenue coming in. So one of the things we do -- and we'll walk you through this example. But what we actually do is we take the revenue that comes in for the quarter, the recognized revenue, which, if it's particularly back-end loaded, can be close to 0, and we divide it by the number of subscribers at the end of the quarter. So in the extreme, if somebody -- so for example, we -- I'll use one example that'll illustrate 2 points. The promotions were very heavily back-end loaded. So you have a low-priced offering that's discounted coming in very close to the end. So what you might get out of that is 1 day out of 91 worth of revenue or, call it, 4 days out of 365 or slightly less than 1% of the revenue that, that subscription is worth, but we divide it by a whole subscriber. So it greatly understates the value. Even in -- as we go through this, it will normalize, as Scott mentioned, because the numbers come up -- the numbers get larger, and you'll get the same effect moving from quarter-to-quarter. In the beginning, it's very sensitive to mix. It's very sensitive to timing. So we're ahead of our plan from where we want to be. And while I understand that some people are paying lots of attention to ARPS, I think the better thing to look at going forward, and we've tried to stress it, is ARR. As Scott mentioned, we'll start giving you guidance on ARR. And on the ARPS one, we'll start breaking it out, so you don't have to be guessing at the coefficients between what's in cloud, what's in EBA, what's in product subscriptions and even in the subset that's something like the legacy promotion. We think we can help you understand that a little better. Again, I'll -- I'll tell you again, one of the reasons we gave the numbers in the middle of the prepared remarks about like for like was to show you the increase in pricing that we were seeing. And that was both -- there were some numbers that were quarter-over-quarter, and some were year-over-year. And we'll detail that a little bit more next week at Investor Day, so you can see the thing.

So on the cloud stuff, Richard, in terms of having mature, viable cloud products for both the AEC industry and manufacturing, we're really the only ones that have it. You can look out and see some small startups but barely have any traction. We probably have 3 orders of magnitude, maybe 4 orders of magnitude more users in the cloud than they do. So I think for people who are deciding that the cloud has real benefits, I think Autodesk is the natural choice. As we -- we've detailed a little bit at previous times where we said more than half and sometimes it was 3/4 of the users of Fusion are coming from other mechanical CAD packages. So it's not just our users who are adding on cloud capabilities. It's really to attract new users. The second part of it is one of the things we did when we introduced our cloud products is we made sure they weren't only direct competitors with what we already did, but it was to extend the market. So if you look at BIM 360, BIM 360 wasn't a replacement for Revit. It was to extend having model-based design go all the way out to the job site and reach all the construction workers. Those are the kind of things we're trying to do, is expand the reach of our products because of the more natural platform. And I think you've seen the same thing in other parts of enterprise software with SaaS offerings, where people are extending into parts of the company that their legacy applications would have never gone to. And I think it's identical in the design and engineering world."

In terms of absolute dollars, we think there are more dollars of sales going through the channel in fiscal '20 than there were in fiscal '16. But as -- in terms of a percent of pie, the percent of the total sales that get done, it'll be a smaller percent by the time we get out there.

We started with a lot of EBA. We started with a lot of transactions going through the eStore, but we also went through -- when you have back-end loaded quarters, you greatly understate the value of that subscription. It's why during the thing I tried to break out how the prices were increasing for like-for-like products going forward. And I think that's going to be an important one. What you're getting is you're trying to look at an average and guess the component pieces. And rather than have you guess, what we said we would do next year is break it out so that you can actually see. In the interim, what we did is we gave you some numbers for showing that the prices are actually increasing even if the calculation methodology in the mix is hitting it down. As we said, just some of the mix issues were responsible for 50% of the decline. So mix and timing play a big role here.

In a quarter in which we had a fair amount of promotion and the promotion was back-end loaded, you're going to see that. But I'll reemphasize again. The prices of like for like for people buying the same thing that they bought last quarter or a year ago, those prices are going up significantly, and I highlighted how they were going up significantly across the world."

If you go back to new model subscription sales a year ago, it was a small number. They were largely in mature markets, a healthy mix of monthly and annual as well as many of them came through the eStore. The channel was still largely focused on selling perpetual licenses at that point. What we've seen over the last several quarters is a pretty significant uptake of new model subscription sales, and I'm talking about product subscriptions sales now, pretty significant uptake of those in emerging markets which, I think, is healthy for the business and certainly, I would expect some of those to be a recapture of pirates in those emerging markets. But as that happens, of course, those are lower priced, and so that's a headwind on ARPS. We see a lot more long-term sales of product and a lot less monthly. Frankly, we had a lot of toe dippers that were coming in monthly previously. We now have a lot more annual and multiyear. Again, good for the business but that -- the monthly subscription price is about 50% higher than the annual subscription price. The monthly times 12 is about 50% more than annual. So as that mix shifts, again, good for the business, not necessarily good for ARPS. It's a headwind. And then as the channel has gotten really engaged and is driving this and so a higher proportion of the sales of product subs come through the channel than a year ago, where many of them were being sold off the eStore. Again, I think, that's a positive for the business. It gives us scale, but it cuts into ARPS. So 3 trends that are very positive for our business and positive for the long-term ARR growth, but all that cut against growing ARPS in the short term."

So yes, we're seeing a decline in the absolute numbers, but it's not driven by a decline in renewal rate. It's driven by the rate at which the maintenance agreements come up for renewal, and then in some cases, we're incentivizing them and successfully moving them over to new model."

So in the kind of existing business, what we're really looking for is the 3 places we saw at this time. One was legacy, one is piracy and one is new customers. And I think you've seen the effectiveness. We've been able to detail the effectiveness of the legacy programs very specifically. Piracy is a little bit harder. Unlike legacy, where people claim to be a legacy customer, people don't claim to be former pirates. So it makes it a little bit more difficult to identify them as former pirates, but we do have our ways. I expect to see more from that. And like we said, about 1/3 of the customers coming are new customers. In terms of the other -- the other things that we see is growth amongst our enterprise customers in terms of EBAs and size of those and then the whole new category of cloud customers and consumption. So you'll both have cloud customers, and then you'll have consumption models, where people kind of pay as they go for various services. Many of them will be tied directly to cloud products, but many will be consumption baked into things like the collections. So for example, if someone's doing simulation or rendering in a collection, they'll get some amount with it. And if they want to use extra, they'll pay as they go. So that's where we're expecting to see that. And next week, you'll see a bunch more about it. But right now, our cloud business is growing incredibly quickly. We're really pleased with the growth we're seeing in the cloud business. And we'll talk more about which customers we're getting with the cloud business and why that expands the margin."

I'd probably put it probably in that category. I'd have to guess. But like I said, Brent, right now, we're doing a bunch of manual work to figure out of the new customers how many were really -- we've never seen before versus those who pirated the software. So we're trying to understand that dynamic a little bit more, and we'll talk a little bit more about that. As a rough guess, one of the ways to think about it, we've talked about this before, for every legitimate user out there, there's about 1, slightly more than 1 user who's not paying for the software. So my guess would be, as we made some of these offerings more affordable from an upfront perspective, we're attracting a fair number of the pirates. So the piracy base is probably bigger than we originally anticipated kind of last year when we laid out these goals. The second thing is the legacy base is probably bigger than we laid out last year at this time. We saw it in terms of the distribution throughout the years. Again, the midpoint is, again, around 7 years. So we're seeing a fair number of people who are historical users. So on both those fronts, we're kind of pleased. The greenfield is a little harder to identify for certain. The other ones, we have a better chance at. But we'll give you a little bit more color on this as we go -- we get the numbers.

New model subscriptions grew by 168,000. New m",2397,"Thanks, Dave. We're really pleased with our third quarter results. Q3 marked a significant milestone in our transition. It's the first quarter where we only sold subscriptions, and we're off to a great start. New model subscriptions grew by 168,000. New model ARR grew 91% at constant currency, and recurring revenue jumped to 76% of total revenue.
More generally, we made progress on our 2 major initiatives: growing lifetime customer value by moving customers to the subscription model and increasing adoption of our cloud-based solutions. Given that this quarter was the most uncertain when we started the year, these are fantastic results. So let's look at the details.
For the quarter, we added 134,000 net subscriptions. New model subscription additions more than tripled year-over-year to 168,000, while maintenance subscriptions declined, as expected, by 34,000 during the quarter. Product subscriptions drove the vast majority of the new model sub additions. The launch of industry collections, the next generation of Suites that include many of our cloud services, contributed to our strong growth this quarter. Collections are a great example of how we're simplifying our offerings while increasing lifetime customer value.
During the quarter, we ran another promotion aimed at converting our legacy non-subscriber base to new product subscriptions. Like the promotion in Q1, legacy nonsubscribers were offered product subscriptions at a discount when trading in their old perpetual licenses. The Q3 promotion added approximately 43,000 product subscriptions, significantly more than in Q1. In addition, the overall average selling price was twice as high as the Q1 promotion due to a lower discount and the fact that customers favored higher-priced products. And lastly, more than 50% of the subscribers turned in licenses that were 7 years back or older. This reinforces our view that there are a meaningful number of active users whose licenses are more than 5 years old and are interested in moving to the latest software.
While the promo successfully migrated many legacy customers to our subscription model, product subscriptions continue to attract a significant number of users that are new to Autodesk. Once again, new customers represented about 1/3 of our new product subscriptions for the quarter. We believe some of these people were previously pirating the software and now have a much more affordable option with product subscriptions. This is consistent with the fact that emerging countries are some of the fastest-growing areas for product subscriptions. In other cases, these new users have been using an alternative design tool and can now afford software from Autodesk.
Overall, product subscriptions grew by more than 30% quarter-over-quarter with new subscribers coming from the legacy base, from people previously pirating the software and from new customers switching from other systems. Particularly pleasing is that the strong performance immediately follows the end of sale of perpetual licenses for Suites.
We also had another record quarter for cloud subscription additions. They nearly doubled from the second quarter, which was also a record. BIM 360 and Fusion 360, once again, are leading the way, but we also have continued to have success with our other cloud products such as AutoCAD 360, Shotgun and Collaboration for Revit.
It is clear that we are building on our leadership in the cloud and that cloud services are growing in importance with our customers. We see the benefits of the cloud's inherent scale and connectivity. For example, during Q3, we signed a large BIM 360 contract with a global construction company. Last spring, they started a pilot program, less than 200 seats for new projects. Working with them on their implementation drove rapid adoption. Their results were so strong that they signed a 7-figure agreement, expanding their use of BIM 360 Glue, Field and Docs to additional projects, reaching over 2,000 subscriptions in just 1 region. Now they are planning to scale their BIM processes even further, eventually using BIM 360 for all projects in all regions.
Maintenance is our other significant subscription bucket. During the quarter, we included for the first time 13,000 maintenance customers from our acquisition of Solid Angle. As you already know, July 31 was the last time customers could add maintenance to a perpetual license, so the incentive to stay up-to-date with existing maintenance contracts is compelling.
In Q3, the renewal rate for maintenance subscriptions was strong, ahead of last year. But with no new maintenance agreements being sold, total maintenance subscriptions declined. As we've said before, we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance subscriptions going forward. The rate of decline will vary based on the number of subscriptions that come up for renewal, the renewal rate and our ability to incentivize maintenance customers to switch over to product subscription. This migration is good for both Autodesk and our customers as it moves them to our newest and best products. While we are still working through the time line, at some point, we will further simplify our offerings, and the maintenance subscription and product subscription offerings will converge into a single program.
Now let me get into ARR. New model ARR growth surged to 91% on a constant-currency basis and reflects the continued strong uptake of all of our new subscription offerings. Total ARR grew 15% at constant currency. ARR growth was negatively impacted this quarter by the allocation of our market development funds, which are accounted for as contra revenue and booked upfront in each quarter. Prior to Q3, these funds were allocated across all revenue streams. With the end of perpetual license sales, 100% of our market development funds are now allocated to recurring revenues in ARR. This impacted ARR growth by 3 percentage points or about $40 million.
FX rates also continued to be a headwind for ARR in the quarter. The combination of FX rates and contra revenues reduced total ARR by about $100 million or 7 percentage points in Q3, which is sizable. Despite those headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our FY '20 ARR CAGR of 24%.
I mentioned last quarter that some of our moves to drive subscriptions in ARR revolve around pricing. In early September, we made changes that rationalized the pricing of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. The aim was to drive customers to the right product for their needs and do so with higher billings and ARR.
I'm pleased to report that these actions are motivating the intended customer behavior. More LT users are buying up to [ph] AutoCAD, and the volumes for AutoCAD and especially AutoCAD verticals increased significantly quarter-over-quarter. For the overall AutoCAD family of products, volume and ARR increased because of these price changes.
We focus on subscriptions and ARR as the key metrics to measure our progress in the business model transition. However, we have received many investment questions on trends in annualized revenue per subscription or ARPS, so I thought I'd spend a little extra time on it this quarter, and we'll spend more time on it at Investor Day next week.
Let's start by focusing on new seats added in Q3, excluding the promo seats, as they have the temporary effect of depressing ARPS until their renewal, which will be at the full price. Suites and collections in the U.S. saw a year-over-year increase in ARPS of 24%. In Germany, the increase was plus 79%, and in Japan, it was plus 26%. AutoCAD LT in the U.S. saw a year-over-year increase of plus 9%. In Germany, the increase was plus 55% and in Japan, 50%.
The AutoCAD family, which is the sum of the newer AutoCAD and the vertical AutoCAD in the U.S. saw a year-over-year increase of 8%. In Germany, the increase was 13% and in Japan, 78%. Because of strong year-over-year changes for new seat purchases, the quarter-over-quarter ARPS change for the sum of AutoCAD, AutoCAD verticals and AutoCAD LT in the U.S., Germany and Japan were 5%, 35% and 64%, respectively. This was simply the result of more people buying vertical AutoCAD than vanilla AutoCAD and more people buying AutoCAD instead of AutoCAD LT, exactly the result we were looking for from the pricing change and why we generated more volume in ARR from the AutoCAD family. These are very positive outcomes. In fact, except for a few emerging markets in Europe, we see essentially the same trend lines everywhere.
So why aren't these results reflected in the aggregate ARPS number we report? There are 2 primary reasons. First, the calculation is extremely sensitive to mix in the early stages. Small numbers exaggerate the effects of short-term shifts internally, geo mix, promotions, et cetera, until it starts to normalize when the number of customers is large enough. Secondly, the math that we use to count ARR and subscriptions is very sensitive to timing within the quarter. On an as-reported basis, ARPS can significantly understate the value of a subscription. The net-net of all of this is that fundamental business drivers are very positive, but aggregate ARPS for the company is declining because of various mix impacts, calculations surround ARPS, FX and the contra revenue impact of market development funds. 
In fact, pass-throughs such as mix drove about 50% of the declining ARPS trend. We expect these impacts to converge to a steady state, and that's when you'll see aggregate ARPS begin to increase again. We will provide more insight into the components of the new model subscriptions as they mature into a bigger base next year. I know many of you are keenly interested in this area, and we will spend a lot more time on this at next week's Investor Day.
Total direct revenue also increased as a proportion of total revenues to 29%, up from just 17% 2 years ago and 25% last quarter as we continue to grow the volume of business with both our large enterprise customers as well as our eStore.
On the expense side, we continue to prudently manage spend. Total non-GAAP spend decreased by 2% year-over-year. This marks the third consecutive quarter of decreases as we diligently control our spending. We had already committed to keeping our FY '18 spend flat with FY '17. We're now committing to keep our FY '19 spend flat as well. This will require some additional effort, but we believe it's the right thing to do at this stage of our transition and that we can do so without compromising the long-term health of the company.
We also remained aggressive with our stock buyback program in Q3, buying back 2 million shares at an average price of $68.74. We've now repurchased nearly 7 million shares this fiscal year and plan to remain active buyers through both programmatic and opportunistic means. This is another area we will discuss in greater depth at our Investor Day on December 6.
Overall, we were extremely pleased with our Q3 results. We have increased confidence that the transition is working for customers, partners and Autodesk and that we are on track for the FY '20 targets we set.
Turning to our outlook. As we've seen over the past several quarters, global conditions have held steady with most of the mature markets performing relatively well, while many of the emerging markets have been challenging. As we evaluate our strong Q3 results and look ahead to Q4, we don't see any meaningful change in the demand environment. Talk of increased infrastructure spending and tax reform in the U.S. would likely benefit Autodesk, but it's far too early to determine if the election results will have a material positive or a negative impact on our business domestically or abroad.
Our view for the rest of fiscal '17 remains positive. Our revenue and EPS results were slightly better than we expected in Q3. Q4 typically experiences a sequential increase due to seasonality, and we expect to see that again this year. But keep in mind that Q3 revenue benefited from $38 million in backlog from the end of sale of perpetual Suites at the end of Q2.
Since we've ended the sale of most perpetual licenses, backlog is now 0, and it won't be a material contributor going forward in the subscription-only model. We feel great about the way subscriptions are trending, and now that Q3 is behind us, we are bringing up the bottom end of our previous range for subscription additions. And we're on track for the spend target that we lowered last quarter.
When we started down this transition path 3 years ago, the objective was the same as it is today: build long-term shareholder value and establish Autodesk as the leader of the next generation of design and engineering software. We are accomplishing these goals in 3 simple ways: One, we're increasing the lifetime value of every customer by moving them to subscription models; two, we're changing our cost structure by focusing our product portfolio and go-to-market strategies; and three, we're building the best cloud and mobile-based products and services in the industry, which significantly expands our TAM as the underlying technology platform shifts to the cloud.
Next week at our Investor Day event, we'll provide further detail on significant items on our path to our transition goals, including $6 in free cash flow per share in FY '20 and $11 in FY '23. Some of the items we'll cover include: an update on the transition overall; focus areas to achieve the 20% growth in subscriptions and 24% CAGR in ARR; the factors influencing ARPS; TAM expansion opportunities in construction and manufacturing and success with our cloud offerings; the evolution of our go-to-market strategies to align with the subscription business; recent operating changes that will increase our access to borrowing cash and dramatically increase our financial flexibility; and our thoughts on capital allocation.
To wrap things up, we couldn't be more excited to be finally in the subscription-only model. We've executed well over the past few quarters, and we're looking forward to finishing the year strong. Our vision and strategy are working. The business model transition is ahead of plan, and we're leading the industry in delivering cloud-based software for the next generation of design and engineering. With each quarter, we become more confident in our ability to increase shareholder value by creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business and achieving the goals we set out for FY '20 for subscriptions, ARR and cash flow.

So market development funds are common to every company that sells through a value-added reseller channel. So it's, in effect, demand generation dollars. It's money that we make available to our resellers for them to go off and drive demand, presale demand for the product. So it's not a new program. We've had market development funds for years. I think what's changed this quarter is the way those market development funds are allocated. They're not treated as an expense. They're treated as a contra revenue, meaning they're subtracted from our reported revenues. It runs $10 million to $11 million a quarter. And so historically, what's happened is that was allocated pro rata to the sales through the channel, which were heavily driven by license sales. This quarter, of course, there's no license sales, so all of the market development funds, the same amount we've always spent, end up being allocated for the first time to recurring revenues. And so the $10 million to $11 million per quarter, when you annualize that, of course, is between $40 million and $45 million for the year. So first time we've seen that effect on recurring revenue was this quarter, and I would expect it to stay in that range going forward."

One was about, certainly, product mix. One is about geo mix. There's others like term length. And then there are very specific things, the difference between, for example, EBAs and maintenance. Those numbers look different as well as certainly the cloud revenues look different. So those things matter a lot. We have a fair amount of flexibility. We understand the price range that these things will come in. Right now, we're actually above the plan for where we expected to be. And one of the things I tried to do in the middle of the prepared remarks was give you a little bit of information about what selling on a like-for-like basis is. So that's where -- those were those quotes in the middle all about how much more people are paying this year or this quarter compared to the previous year or the previous quarter. And we thought it was important to really compare the like-for-like so that people could understand it. One of the things we also mentioned is going forward, we'll start breaking this out for you. Having an average of averages of averages is way too confusing as we've all seen. I think the folks at Goldman did a nice job at breaking out the model in their most recent report, and I think they did a nice job of looking at the stuff we did. While it's not identically our model, it's close and certainly has the major effects in there and a good understanding of the kind of mix we anticipate seeing and the price ranges. So maybe that helps a little bit. We're going to spend a lot more time next week walking you through this, but hopefully, that's a start on the problem."

And you just need to look at the ARPS for maintenance, and you see it's far more steady because it's a much bigger base of maintenance subs. So as the base grows, mix will become slightly less important. I think, longer term, the more important metric than ARPS is ARR, and so one of things we'll look to do is provide you better insight into where we think ARR is headed so that the ARPS calculation becomes less slightly sensitive.

We've shown kind of the basic architecture with products like Fusion 360 and how they take advantage of the connectivity and the compute power of the cloud. So we started to demonstrate that, and we started investing in this area 3 or 4 years ago. As I've said before, while everybody is rightfully focused on the business model transition of our existing business and how we're using it to attract new customers, what I think people will most be surprised about, as you look out the next couple of years, is the size of the cloud business that we built and how it really extends our TAM. So we're going to spend a bunch of time next week kind of showing a little bit more. You were at AU and got to see it. We'll try to put kind of an investor look on it so that people next week can understand what we're doing and what the importance is and why we're investing in the cloud and why this really is the next-generation architecture. And I've talked in the past about being a place for collaboration as always it giving you access to virtually unlimited amounts of compute power, which is something our users demand. And so it's just a natural fit. It's unusual that engineering has been one of the slowest to move to the cloud, but we see lots of evidence of hitting the tipping point not just in the U.S. but other places in terms of customer's willingness to adopt it.

It's very auditable, but it is a method that can greatly understate the amount of revenue coming in. So one of the things we do -- and we'll walk you through this example. But what we actually do is we take the revenue that comes in for the quarter, the recognized revenue, which, if it's particularly back-end loaded, can be close to 0, and we divide it by the number of subscribers at the end of the quarter. So in the extreme, if somebody -- so for example, we -- I'll use one example that'll illustrate 2 points. The promotions were very heavily back-end loaded. So you have a low-priced offering that's discounted coming in very close to the end. So what you might get out of that is 1 day out of 91 worth of revenue or, call it, 4 days out of 365 or slightly less than 1% of the revenue that, that subscription is worth, but we divide it by a whole subscriber. So it greatly understates the value. Even in -- as we go through this, it will normalize, as Scott mentioned, because the numbers come up -- the numbers get larger, and you'll get the same effect moving from quarter-to-quarter. In the beginning, it's very sensitive to mix. It's very sensitive to timing. So we're ahead of our plan from where we want to be. And while I understand that some people are paying lots of attention to ARPS, I think the better thing to look at going forward, and we've tried to stress it, is ARR. As Scott mentioned, we'll start giving you guidance on ARR. And on the ARPS one, we'll start breaking it out, so you don't have to be guessing at the coefficients between what's in cloud, what's in EBA, what's in product subscriptions and even in the subset that's something like the legacy promotion. We think we can help you understand that a little better. Again, I'll -- I'll tell you again, one of the reasons we gave the numbers in the middle of the prepared remarks about like for like was to show you the increase in pricing that we were seeing. And that was both -- there were some numbers that were quarter-over-quarter, and some were year-over-year. And we'll detail that a little bit more next week at Investor Day, so you can see the thing.

So on the cloud stuff, Richard, in terms of having mature, viable cloud products for both the AEC industry and manufacturing, we're really the only ones that have it. You can look out and see some small startups but barely have any traction. We probably have 3 orders of magnitude, maybe 4 orders of magnitude more users in the cloud than they do. So I think for people who are deciding that the cloud has real benefits, I think Autodesk is the natural choice. As we -- we've detailed a little bit at previous times where we said more than half and sometimes it was 3/4 of the users of Fusion are coming from other mechanical CAD packages. So it's not just our users who are adding on cloud capabilities. It's really to attract new users. The second part of it is one of the things we did when we introduced our cloud products is we made sure they weren't only direct competitors with what we already did, but it was to extend the market. So if you look at BIM 360, BIM 360 wasn't a replacement for Revit. It was to extend having model-based design go all the way out to the job site and reach all the construction workers. Those are the kind of things we're trying to do, is expand the reach of our products because of the more natural platform. And I think you've seen the same thing in other parts of enterprise software with SaaS offerings, where people are extending into parts of the company that their legacy applications would have never gone to. And I think it's identical in the design and engineering world."

But I don't think our view has changed much from the perspective that we had a year ago, which was, as we get out to fiscal '20, we think the channel continues to be a significant part of our sales. In terms of absolute dollars, we think there are more dollars of sales going through the channel in fiscal '20 than there were in fiscal '16. But as -- in terms of a percent of pie, the percent of the total sales that get done, it'll be a smaller percent by the time we get out there. So I think we'll see a case where the channel has a place, where absolute dollars of revenue grow. By the way, probably fewer channel partners out there than we have today, so it's a more profitable business for the channel partners that remain.

We started with a lot of EBA. We started with a lot of transactions going through the eStore, but we also went through -- when you have back-end loaded quarters, you greatly understate the value of that subscription. It's why during the thing I tried to break out how the prices were increasing for like-for-like products going forward. And I think that's going to be an important one. What you're getting is you're trying to look at an average and guess the component pieces. And rather than have you guess, what we said we would do next year is break it out so that you can actually see. In the interim, what we did is we gave you some numbers for showing that the prices are actually increasing even if the calculation methodology in the mix is hitting it down. As we said, just some of the mix issues were responsible for 50% of the decline. So mix and timing play a big role here. And remember how I just described that calculation, that if you buy something at the end of the quarter, for example, on the last day, it greatly undervalues what that subscription is worth over the long term. In a quarter in which we had a fair amount of promotion and the promotion was back-end loaded, you're going to see that. But I'll reemphasize again. The prices of like for like for people buying the same thing that they bought last quarter or a year ago, those prices are going up significantly, and I highlighted how they were going up significantly across the world."

If you go back to new model subscription sales a year ago, it was a small number. They were largely in mature markets, a healthy mix of monthly and annual as well as many of them came through the eStore. The channel was still largely focused on selling perpetual licenses at that point. What we've seen over the last several quarters is a pretty significant uptake of new model subscription sales, and I'm talking about product subscriptions sales now, pretty significant uptake of those in emerging markets which, I think, is healthy for the business and certainly, I would expect some of those to be a recapture of pirates in those emerging markets. But as that happens, of course, those are lower priced, and so that's a headwind on ARPS. We see a lot more long-term sales of product and a lot less monthly. Frankly, we had a lot of toe dippers that were coming in monthly previously. We now have a lot more annual and multiyear. Again, good for the business but that -- the monthly subscription price is about 50% higher than the annual subscription price. The monthly times 12 is about 50% more than annual. So as that mix shifts, again, good for the business, not necessarily good for ARPS. It's a headwind. And then as the channel has gotten really engaged and is driving this and so a higher proportion of the sales of product subs come through the channel than a year ago, where many of them were being sold off the eStore. Again, I think, that's a positive for the business. It gives us scale, but it cuts into ARPS. So 3 trends that are very positive for our business and positive for the long-term ARR growth, but all that cut against growing ARPS in the short term."

That -- I would go back though and highlight what Carl mentioned in the script. Renewal rate is actually stronger this year than it was last year. So yes, we're seeing a decline in the absolute numbers, but it's not driven by a decline in renewal rate. It's driven by the rate at which the maintenance agreements come up for renewal, and then in some cases, we're incentivizing them and successfully moving them over to new model."

And I think you've seen the effectiveness. We've been able to detail the effectiveness of the legacy programs very specifically. Piracy is a little bit harder. Unlike legacy, where people claim to be a legacy customer, people don't claim to be former pirates. So it makes it a little bit more difficult to identify them as former pirates, but we do have our ways. I expect to see more from that. And like we said, about 1/3 of the customers coming are new customers. In terms of the other -- the other things that we see is growth amongst our enterprise customers in terms of EBAs and size of those and then the whole new category of cloud customers and consumption. So you'll both have cloud customers, and then you'll have consumption models, where people kind of pay as they go for various services. Many of them will be tied directly to cloud products, but many will be consumption baked into things like the collections. So for example, if someone's doing simulation or rendering in a collection, they'll get some amount with it. And if they want to use extra, they'll pay as they go. So that's where we're expecting to see that. And next week, you'll see a bunch more about it. But right now, our cloud business is growing incredibly quickly.

As a rough guess, one of the ways to think about it, we've talked about this before, for every legitimate user out there, there's about 1, slightly more than 1 user who's not paying for the software. So my guess would be, as we made some of these offerings more affordable from an upfront perspective, we're attracting a fair number of the pirates. So the piracy base is probably bigger than we originally anticipated kind of last year when we laid out these goals. The second thing is the legacy base is probably bigger than we laid out last year at this time. We saw it in terms of the distribution throughout the years. Again, the midpoint is, again, around 7 years. So we're seeing a fair number of people who are historical users. So on both those fronts, we're kind of pleased. The greenfield is a little harder to identify for certain. The other ones, we have a better chance at. But we'll give you a little bit more color on this as we go -- we get the numbers. Like I said, at a certain point, it won't actually matter, but we are looking at both piracy as well as maintenance customers who are moving over."

So for example, a lot of -- I mean, we're seeing it in a number of areas. In the AEC area, particularly with products like BIM 360, BIM 360, really, is communicating with all of our non-traditional customers involved in the process. If things like revenue in [ph] our structural analysis software for the architects and engineers, BIM 360 encompasses the entire workflow all the way from architect to general contractor and subcontractors. And next week, Amar will go through a bunch of it, a bunch of what we're doing there and how it's reaching people who are actually on the construction site building stuff. When you look at the other things like manufacturing, Fusion 360 as well as all of our advanced manufacturing products are really very specifically about the next part of the process. I've kind of joked that we've helped people make beautiful digital prototypes, things that stay on that side of the glass, but our customers get paid for making real things. And so what we started doing a number of years ago is starting helping them in that process of taking it from one side of the screen to the other side of the screen. And we have lots of stuff going on in composite materials, a lot we have going on with machining, communicating on the factory floor as well as the construction site. Those are all expansions of the market, and we'll spend a fair amount of time. We've generally spent most of our time -- and probably appropriately so as people have been very interested in the new business model transition. But like I said, this is a growing and very important part of the business, and as people look to the next couple of years, it'll become increasingly important. So we'll give you some more detail, Brent."
