I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter of 2016 results. A conference call slid",1027,"Thank you, Alicia. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter of 2016 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. 
I will start with the first quarter summary, as shown on Page 2 of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 16% to $4.7 billion with underlying sales down 9%. Our results reflected a continuation of the difficult economic conditions of that were experienced during most of fiscal 2015. We continue to find ourselves in the midst of a global industrial recession, and recent economic data suggests that capital spending by industrial businesses weakened during the course of the fourth calendar quarter. 
In the energy sector, lower, but equally as important, uncertain oil prices continue to impact both operational and capital spending by our end customers. 
Reported earnings per share in the first quarter decreased 29% to $0.53. Adjusted earnings per share, which exclude $24 million in separation costs, were better than our previous expectation of $0.50. The separation costs relate to our portfolio repositioning actions, specifically the planned spin-off of Network Power and the potential divestitures of the Motors and Drives and Power Generation businesses. 
Overall, the first quarter results were slightly better than our expectations, and the company remains well positioned for a challenging 2016. 
Turning to Slide 3. Gross profit margin in the quarter decreased 70 basis points to 40.1%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable mix. EBIT reflects the impacts of unfavorable currency transaction of $27 million and portfolio repositioning separation cost of $24 million. Additionally, the aggressive restructuring actions initiated in 2015 are beginning to have a positive impact on profitability. 
During the quarter, approximately 12 million shares were repurchased for $554 million. The company still plans for fiscal year share repurchase to reach approximately $1.2 billion. 
Turning to Slide 4. Underlying sales were down in all regions, except Europe, where our euro-based businesses are becoming more globally competitive. 
Turning to Slide 5. Business segment margin declined 170 basis points to 13.3%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable mix, partially offset by the savings from restructuring actions. 
Operating cash flow was down 15%, reflects the impact of lower earnings. 
Similar to many industrial manufacturers, capital spending was reduced due to lower global demand. Capital spending was down 30%. 
Turning to Slide 6. Process Management underlying sales declined 11% in the quarter. Energy sector spending remained at challenging levels as lower and increasingly uncertain oil prices further pressure spending, particularly in upstream market. Upstream projects underway will continue to completion, but new projects are facing potentially further delays. Downstream markets remain favorable in the U.S., Europe and Middle East, mainly in small- to medium-size projects in the chemical and power markets. We will continue to shift our resources to capitalize on more favorable business activity levels in downstream and life sciences markets. 
Turning to Slide 7. Industrial Automation first quarter underlying sales declined 15%, reflecting continued weakness from a global industrial recession and reduced levels of spending in upstream oil and gas customers. These conditions are expected to continue into the second quarter with improvement expected in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Network Power underlying sales declined 1% in the quarter as global demand for data center and telecommunications infrastructure spending was mixed. From a regional perspective, Asia had growth in Australia, India and Southeast Asia, while Latin America reflected favorable data center activity levels, particularly in Mexico. Segment margins increased 90 basis points to 8%, benefiting from restructuring actions. Recent order trends have reflected improving conditions in both data center and telecommunications investment. 
Turning to Slide 9. Climate Technologies underlying sales declined 10% as global air conditioning sales decreased, driven by higher U.S. residential demand in the prior year resulting from regulatory changes. Global refrigeration markets grew modestly as growth in the United States and Asia was up, partially offset by softness in Europe. Demand in the air conditioning and refrigeration markets remained favorable, supporting our outlook for modest levels of growth in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 10. Underlying sales in the commercial and residential solutions segment were down 2%. Favorable activity levels in U.S. construction markets resulted in growth in both the wet-dry vacuums and food waste disposal businesses. Segment margins improved 20 basis points to 21.7 from the favorable impact of the divestiture of the InterMetro business. The favorable trends in U.S. residential and commercial construction continue to support our outlook for modest levels of growth in the segment. 
Turning to Slide 11. As we have indicated, we expect difficult market conditions to persist throughout the fiscal year, but we do still see a bottom forming in both sales and earnings by the middle of 2016. We will continue to execute on our operational plans while diligently working to complete the important portfolio repositioning actions that were announced last June. 
Taking into account our first quarter results and recent order trends, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2016 guidance. Underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 2% to 5%, excluding negative currency translation and a deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.25, excluding estimated separation cost of approximately $250 million to $350 million, which are approximately $50 million lower than our previous expectations. For the second quarter, underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 4% to 6%, excluding negative currency translation and a deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.65 are expected, excluding estimated separation costs of approximately $75 million or approximately 11% -- $0.11 per share. 
Our long-standing commitment to return cash flow to our shareholders will be supported by an expected increase in 2016 operating cash flow to approximately $3 billion. 
And with that, I will now turn it over to Mr. David Farr."

Thank you very much to everyone joining us today. I appreciate that. We are looking for to seeing our investors and analysts in Austin next week, and we'll talk a little bit more about that in a second, but looking really forward to seeing everyone down there and sharing our plans and ideas to the group. 
I also want to thank everybody across Emerson relative to the execution in the first quarter. Clearly, this is only the first quarter, and we have a very detailed undertaking ahead of us relative to sequentially improving our sales, our profitability, our earnings and cash flow from [indiscernible] this year. And as I look at the plans we started back from restructuring back in February, and I look at the announcement of repositioning that we announced in June, we continue to make very good progress, but it is clearly all about executing around those plans that we put in place and making sure we get it done from a standpoint of driving costs, standpoint of repositioning this company and looking forward to how, as we go through a very challenging global economy, very challenging industrial recession that we see today and coming out of this a stronger company and one that can continue to add assets once we've repositioned to a new Emerson platform. 
Looking forward to giving you insight of how we see the 2016  [ph] unfolding from an economic standpoint. How we see the numbers happening from the cost of the repositioning, how we see the issues that we may see from a risk standpoint and what we're going to have to do about those if we see additional risks. Those are all things that we'll be talking about. I will defer those until we get together next week. Also looking forward to having Bob Sharp and also Steven Sonnenberg talk about the 2 key business segments -- business platforms that we'll be moving into: the commercial residential solutions and and then also the automation solutions. Those 2 individuals will give you insights into what we see, the strength of these platforms, what we can do with those platforms and where we're going to invest going forward. Clearly, we have a challenging oil and gas industrial marketplace right now, but it's nothing new. We've been there before. We know what to do -- deal with this issue. It's why we started the aggressive restructuring last year. As we talk amongst the business leaders, the OC, the board, if the market continues to get challenging, we will continue to do additional restructuring. We'll continue to make sure that the cost structure of this company stays competitive in that we can deliver the highest level of profitability that our shareholders expect from us. That is our -- that is what we're all about right now, executing around that and getting things forward. 
As I look at our current marketplace, the last 30 days have been what I would call the most unusual in my time at Emerson. I've never seen a marketplace go so volatile from the standpoint of the end markets, the stock markets, the interest rates, the -- I guess, the attitude. It's just a very amazing marketplace right now and one that clearly global CEOs like myself have to deal with and be prepared for whatever comes at us. But we are now basically in our fourth quarter of the recession. I'd see -- we'll talk about it next week, I see at least one more quarter, maybe another quarter. But sequentially, our game plan is to improve the business cycle, the business backup and start improving the profitability. And that's what we're all about here. 
So with that, I'll open the floor. I'm glad to have the first quarter behind us. I want again to thank the organization. They did a great job executing around the plans we put out there. We're making great progress. And clearly, it's only one quarter. We know that. And our game plan is sequentially improve the sales, the profitability, the earnings and the cash flow to our shareholders and establish the premium valuation that this company deserves. 
With that, I'll open the floor."

We are looking at situation, in my opinion, oil and gas marketplaces that will now recover until well past the middle of '17, maybe late '17. Fortunately, we have 75% of the business that doesn't serve oil and gas marketplace. So even though we'll talk about this next week, oil and gas being down, it's not going to 0. It will be a tougher marketplace, and we'll have to work harder at it. And clearly, there's a lot of uncertainty around this, but the game is, we're going to have to figure out how to get the sales, how to get the business and get our costs down. And it will clearly be a tougher year in '16 than we thought. That's the game. Pretty straightforward."

They can't go to 0, but I think it's going to get tougher. So my gut tells me that it is going to be more challenging in the near term, and our oil and gas -- I mean, our oil process work pace will be a drag on this, and the other businesses will start pulling back up. So that's where we're at this point in time. I think I've always -- we'll give you an update of what I think the process segment is going to do, but I would -- it's going to be -- there'll be more negative based on just some of the first question, I did say that when the price of oil got to down to that level will be an impact. And I think, right now, our underlying sales will be more negative in the process than we thought originally. And hence, we're going to have to go after more caution there.

There's not been a lot of big bids around what I would say the oil and gas or the bigger -- the other big projects. So the pricing has been rational. The other issue is right now, like our European competitors, were also major players in the process roll out of Europe. So we're not -- we get the best of that, too. So what I see going to happen is we're going to be seeing sales shift to our European operations because we've been working for this the last 12 months. The dollar really started appreciating last year, a little over a year ago. So we've been working together, a rebound cost structure which will continue to do. Our European organization right now is seeing the benefit of a lower cost structure. So they're winning, and I would say, you're going to see other regions the world do. So we're pushing around the world, just like our European competitors do and that's one of the -- that's one of the things we do have relatively having a broad manufacturing or basis in all these businesses.

It's tracking -- it's going to be a little more negative this year than last year, but well within what I thought we're going to see and well within material inflationary level.

A lot of people are trying to improve their profitability on down volume and dropping price kind it down volume to try and prove your profitability did not work. Economics 101. It does not work."

I am concerned as why I think we're talking about we need to get a reaction together think about if it takes longer to recover as we go into late '16, early '17 in the process side, because I personally think what will happen is, there will be a freeze a little bit right now around relative to our customers as they say, ""Okay, we're allocating capital. We're cutting capital again 10%, where the number is going to be, we'll see the next 30 to 60 days."" And that will create pressure I know on our base relative to smaller projects and MRO projects. So the initial reaction is, I think, we're going to see a slowdown. But hopefully, as we get into the year will start seeing that capital debt -- free back up again. You can't go to 0. Is not going to go to 0. But they're clearly going to reallocate, and they're doing that really fast right now from our customer base. So I'd -- my concern right now is, we're looking at downward pressure relative to our total sales underlying process. We need to take capacity off-line. So from my perspective, right now, we -- initial phase in the last 12 months is very much focused on people, restructuring overall -- overhead cost. And now, when I want to look out the chauffeur going to look out a longer recovery here in this particular part of the process world, we got to look at taking fixed assets off-line. And so now, that's Frank and Ed Purvis and the business leaders at their upcoming reviews would start -- I mean, a week or 2 from now, look at what extra capacity that we may need to take off permanently, if we're looking at a different environment and the capacity be and not be. So that -- -- I think that will lead to a higher level of restructuring later this year, early '17."

But I do know, given right now, given what the price of oil and gas is an potentially where to go, we fundamentally will have a capacity issue in that industry, which we didn't have, say, 12 months ago. And so we got to think about how we got to deal with that issue. And that, as you know, also takes time. And so -- but that's what it's on the table right now, and no one wants to deal with that because that's a really hard thing to deal with. But you got to deal with it. Period."

I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2016 results. A conference call slide",1024,"Thank you, Alicia. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. 
Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2016 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. 
I will start with the first quarter summary, as shown on Page 2 of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 16% to $4.7 billion with underlying sales down 9%. Our results reflected a continuation of the difficult economic conditions that were experienced during most of fiscal 2015. We continue to find ourselves in the midst of a global industrial recession, and recent economic data suggests that capital spending by industrial businesses weakened during the course of the fourth calendar quarter. 
In the energy sector, lower, but equally as important uncertain oil prices continue to impact both operational and capital spending by our end customers. 
Reported earnings per share in the first quarter decreased 29% to $0.53. Adjusted earnings per share, which exclude $24 million in separation costs, were better than our previous expectation of $0.50. These separation costs relate to our portfolio repositioning actions, specifically the planned spin-off of Network Power and the potential divestitures of the Motors and Drives and Power Generation businesses. 
Overall, the first quarter results were slightly better than our expectations and the company remains well positioned for a challenging 2016. 
Turning to Slide 3. Gross profit margin in the quarter decreased 70 basis points to 40.1%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable mix. EBIT reflects the impacts of unfavorable currency transactions of $27 million and portfolio repositioning separation costs of $24 million. Additionally, the aggressive restructuring actions initiated in 2015 are beginning to have a positive impact on profitability. 
During the quarter, approximately 12 million shares were repurchased for $554 million. The company still plans for fiscal year share repurchase to reach approximately $1.2 billion. 
Turning to Slide 4. Underlying sales were down in all regions, except Europe, where our euro-based businesses are becoming more globally competitive. 
Turning to Slide 5. Business segment margin declined 170 basis points to 13.3%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable mix, partially offset by the savings from restructuring actions. 
Operating cash flow was down 15%, reflects the impact of lower earnings. 
Similar to many industrial manufacturers, capital spending was reduced due to lower global demand. Capital spending was down 30%. 
Turning to Slide 6. Process Management underlying sales declined 11% in the quarter. Energy sector spending remained at challenging levels as lower and increasingly uncertain oil prices further pressured spending, particularly in upstream market. Upstream projects underway will continue to completion, but new projects are facing potentially further delays. Downstream markets remain favorable in the U.S., Europe and Middle East, mainly in small- to medium-sized projects in the chemical and power markets. We will continue to shift our resources to capitalize on more favorable business activity levels in downstream and life sciences markets. 
Turning to Slide 7. Industrial Automation first quarter underlying sales declined 15%, reflecting continued weakness from a global industrial recession and reduced levels of spending in upstream oil and gas customers. These conditions are expected to continue into the second quarter with improvements expected in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Network Power underlying sales declined 1% in the quarter as global demand for data center and telecommunications infrastructure spending was mixed. From a regional perspective, Asia had growth in Australia, India and Southeast Asia while Latin America reflected favorable data center activity levels, particularly in Mexico. Segment margins increased 90 basis points to 8%, benefiting from restructuring actions. Recent order trends have reflected improving conditions in both data center and telecommunications investment. 
Turning to Slide 9. Climate Technologies underlying sales declined 10% as global air conditioning sales decreased, driven by higher U.S. residential demand in the prior year resulting from regulatory changes. Global refrigeration markets grew modestly as growth in the United States and Asia was partially offset by softness in Europe. Demand in the air conditioning and refrigeration markets remains favorable, supporting our outlook for modest levels of growth in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 10. Underlying sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment were down 2%. Favorable activity levels in U.S. construction markets resulted in growth in both the wet-dry vacuums and food waste disposers businesses. Segment margins improved 20 basis points to 21.7% from the favorable impact of the divestiture of the InterMetro business. The favorable trends in U.S. residential and commercial construction continue to support our outlook for modest levels of growth in this segment. 
Turning to Slide 11. As we have indicated, we expect difficult market conditions to persist throughout the fiscal year, but we do still see a bottom forming in both sales and earnings by the middle of 2016. We will continue to execute on our operational plans while diligently working to complete the important portfolio repositioning actions that were announced last June. 
Taking into account our first quarter results and recent order trends, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2016 guidance. Underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 2% to 5% excluding negative currency translation and a deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.25 excluding estimated separation costs of approximately $250 million to $350 million, which are approximately $50 million lower than our previous expectations. 
For the second quarter, underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 4% to 6% excluding negative currency translation and a deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.65 are expected excluding estimated separation costs of approximately $75 million or approximately 11% -- $0.11 per share. 
Our long-standing commitment to return cash flow to our shareholders will be supported by an expected increase in 2016 operating cash flow to approximately $3 billion. 
And with that, I will now turn it over to Mr. David Farr."

We are looking forward to seeing our investors and analysts in Austin next week and we'll talk a little bit more about that in a second, but looking really forward to seeing everyone down there and sharing our plans and ideas to the group. 
I also want to thank everybody across Emerson relative to the execution in the first quarter. Clearly, this is only the first quarter and we have a very detailed undertaking ahead of us relative to sequentially improving our sales, our profitability, our earnings and cash flow from any part of this year. And as I look at the plans we started back from restructuring back in February and I look at the announcement of repositioning that we announced in June, we continue to make very good progress, but it is clearly all about executing around those plans that we put in place and making sure we get it done from the standpoint of driving costs, standpoint of repositioning this company and looking forward to how, as we go through a very challenging global economy, very challenging industrial recession that we see today and coming out of this a stronger company and one that can continue to add assets once we repositioned to a new Emerson platform. 
Looking forward to giving you insight of how we see the 2016  unfolding from an economic standpoint, how we see the numbers happening from the cost of the repositioning, how we see the issues that we may see from a risk standpoint and what we're going to have to do about those if we see additional risks. Those are all things that we'll be talking about. I will defer those until we get together next week. 
Also looking forward to having Bob Sharp and also Steve Sonnenberg talk about the 2 key business segments -- business platforms that we'll be -- that we're moving into: the Commercial & Residential Solutions and then also the Automation solutions. Those 2 individuals will give you insights to what we see, the strength of these platforms, what we can do with those platforms and where we're going to invest going forward. 
Clearly, we have a challenging oil and gas industrial marketplace right now, but it's nothing new. We've been there before. We know what to do to deal with this issue. It's why we started the aggressive restructuring last year. 
As we talk amongst the business leaders, the OC, the board, if the market continues to get challenging, we will continue to do additional restructuring. We'll continue to make sure that the cost structure of this company stays competitive and that we can deliver the highest level of profitability that our shareholders expect from us. That is our -- that is what we're all about right now: executing around that and getting things forward. 
As I look at our current marketplace, the last 30 days have been what I would call the most unusual in my time at Emerson. I've never seen a marketplace go so volatile from the standpoint of the end markets, the stock markets, the interest rates, the -- I guess, the attitude. It's just a very amazing marketplace right now and one that clearly global CEOs like myself have to deal with and be prepared for whatever comes at us. 
But we are now basically in our fourth quarter of the recession. I see, as we'll talk about it next week, I see at least one more quarter, maybe another quarter. But sequentially, our game plan is to improve the business cycle, the business backup and start improving the profitability and that's what we're all about here. 
So with that, I'll open the floor. I'm glad to have the first quarter behind us. I want again to thank the organization. They did a great job executing around the plans we put out there. We're making great progress. And clearly, it's only one quarter. We know that. And our game plan is sequentially improve sales, the profitability, the earnings and the cash flow to our shareholders and establish the premium valuation that this company deserves. 
With that, I open the floor."

We are looking at a situation, in my opinion, the oil and gas marketplaces that will now recover until well past the middle of '17, maybe late '17. Fortunately, we have 75% of the business that doesn't serve the oil and gas marketplace. So even though we'll talk about this next week, oil and gas spinning down, it's not going to 0. It will be a tougher marketplace and we'll have to work harder at it. And clearly, there is a lot of uncertainty around this, but the game is we're going to have to figure out how to get the sales, how to get the business and get our costs down and it will clearly be a tougher year in '16 than we thought.

I think that we see -- from our perspective, what we're looking at is that what we'll talk to you next week we're trying to encompass what we think the downside will be relative to oil and gas in the Process businesses. But I would say, the December quarter for orders for Process were not that bad. We pretty well have that factored in, in what's going on. I would say that my concern is the psyche of a Chevron or a psyche of a Exxon Mobil, a psyche of these Shells and the BPs and things like that will -- are going to again freeze up some of that spending level. They can't go to 0, but I think it's going to make it tougher. So my gut tells me that it is going to be more challenging in the near term in our oil and gas -- I mean, our Process order pace will be a drag and the other businesses will start pulling back up. So that's where we are at this point in time. I think I've always -- we'll give you an update on what I think the Process segment's going to do, but it's going to be -- there'll be more negative based on -- because on the first question, I did say that when the price of oil has gotten to down to that level, there'll be an impact and I think, right now, our underlying sales will be more negative in the Process than we thought originally, and hence, we're going to have to go out with more caution there. So -- but the psyche's not good in that space right now. Fortunately, there's more investments going on in the other parts of the marketplace and it's a big part of the marketplace, but the oil and gas investment area is not very good right now and I think it's going to hurt us for the second half of this year."

Though they are working through the inventory that was built up in 20 -- first part of 2015, but my gut tells me that I would not be surprised if we don't finish at minus 7% or 8% in China when it's all said and done. So write that down so you can see me how a good forecaster I was with it."

We also mentioned price change that we have to give on short-term actions from the standpoint of day-to-day business. So it's very measurable because we see the average pricing within the structure of the business. But you're right, there's not been a lot of big bids around what I would say the oil and gas or the bigger -- the other big projects. So the pricing has been rational. The other issue is right now, like our European competitors, we're also a major player in the Process flowing out of Europe and so we're not -- we get the benefit of that, too. So what I see going to happen is we're going to be seeing sales shift to our European operations because we've been working for this the last 12 months. The dollar really started appreciating last year, a little over a year ago. So we've been working to get our rebound cost structure, which we'll continue to do. So our European organization right now is seeing the benefit of a lower cost structure. So they're winning and I would say you're going to see other regions in the world lose. So we're pushing around the world, just like our European competitors do, and that's one of the benefits we do have relatively to having a broad manufacturing bases in all these businesses. So I feel reasonably comfortable right now on the forecast we're going to give you for price. I mean, we track this extremely hard. I don't know how long you've been following us, but I'll be the first one to mention in the early 2002-2003 time, I can't remember exactly when that was, we got line of sight on how fast this thing moved, but now we've created a lot tougher tracking process and so I can tell what's going on across this company. And it's tracking -- it's going to be a little more negative this year than last year, but well within what I thought we were going to see and well within the net material inflation level so -- and people are acting rational. It's going to be an interesting year to see. A lot of people are trying to improve their profitability on down volume and dropping price in a down volume to try to improve your profitability does not work. Economics 101. It does not work."

I am concerned as to why I think we're talking about we need to get our action together and think about if it takes longer to recover as we go into late '16 or early '17 in the Process side because I personally think what will happen is there'll be a freeze a little bit right now to allow our customers as they say, okay, we're reallocating capital. We're cutting capital again 10% or where that number's going to be. We'll see here in the next 30 to 60 days. And that will create pressure on, I know, our base relative to smaller projects and the MRO projects. So the initial reaction is, I think, we're going to see a slowdown and then hopefully, as we get into the year, we'll start seeing that capital back -- free back up again. They can't go to 0. It's not going to go to 0. But they're clearly going to reallocate and they're doing that really fast right now from our customer base. So I -- my concern right now is we're looking at downward pressure relative to our total sales underlying process. We need to take capacity off-line. So from my perspective, right now, we -- initial phase is for the last 12 months is very much focused on people, on restructuring overall -- overhead costs. And now, what I want to look at -- if we're going to look at a longer recovery here in this particular part of the Process world, we've got to look at taking fixed assets off-line. And so now, that's Frank and Ed Purvis and the business leaders have their upcoming reviews, which start, I think, a week or 2 from now. Look at what extra capacity that we may need to take off permanently if we're looking at a different environment and where should that capacity be and not be. So that's -- I think that will lead to higher levels of restructuring later this year, early '17."

And I don't have that magic call, I just know -- I can tell you what we can do. And so I'd know right now that certain things are going the right way. I have a feel for what things are. But I do know, that given right now, given where the price of oil and gas is and potentially where to go, we fundamentally will have a capacity issue in that industry, which we didn't have, say, 12 months ago. And so we've got to think about how we get to deal with that issue and that, as you know, also takes time.

But most people are taking advantage of the environment right now to go out and improve their, I say, the efficiency. The facilities are spending on small capital projects, upgrades that will help them get more out of the facility, higher quality, higher yield.

I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2016 results. A conference call slide",1024,"Thank you, Alicia. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. 
Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2016 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. 
I will start with the first quarter summary, as shown on Page 2 of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 16% to $4.7 billion with underlying sales down 9%. Our results reflected a continuation of the difficult economic conditions that were experienced during most of fiscal 2015. We continue to find ourselves in the midst of a global industrial recession, and recent economic data suggests that capital spending by industrial businesses weakened during the course of the fourth calendar quarter. 
In the energy sector, lower, but equally as important uncertain oil prices continue to impact both operational and capital spending by our end customers. 
Reported earnings per share in the first quarter decreased 29% to $0.53. Adjusted earnings per share, which exclude $24 million in separation costs, were better than our previous expectation of $0.50. These separation costs relate to our portfolio repositioning actions, specifically the planned spin-off of Network Power and the potential divestitures of the Motors and Drives and Power Generation businesses. 
Overall, the first quarter results were slightly better than our expectations and the company remains well positioned for a challenging 2016. 
Turning to Slide 3. Gross profit margin in the quarter decreased 70 basis points to 40.1%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable mix. EBIT reflects the impacts of unfavorable currency transactions of $27 million and portfolio repositioning separation costs of $24 million. Additionally, the aggressive restructuring actions initiated in 2015 are beginning to have a positive impact on profitability. 
During the quarter, approximately 12 million shares were repurchased for $554 million. The company still plans for fiscal year share repurchase to reach approximately $1.2 billion. 
Turning to Slide 4. Underlying sales were down in all regions, except Europe, where our euro-based businesses are becoming more globally competitive. 
Turning to Slide 5. Business segment margin declined 170 basis points to 13.3%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable mix, partially offset by the savings from restructuring actions. 
Operating cash flow was down 15%, reflects the impact of lower earnings. 
Similar to many industrial manufacturers, capital spending was reduced due to lower global demand. Capital spending was down 30%. 
Turning to Slide 6. Process Management underlying sales declined 11% in the quarter. Energy sector spending remained at challenging levels as lower and increasingly uncertain oil prices further pressured spending, particularly in upstream market. Upstream projects underway will continue to completion, but new projects are facing potentially further delays. Downstream markets remain favorable in the U.S., Europe and Middle East, mainly in small- to medium-sized projects in the chemical and power markets. We will continue to shift our resources to capitalize on more favorable business activity levels in downstream and life sciences markets. 
Turning to Slide 7. Industrial Automation first quarter underlying sales declined 15%, reflecting continued weakness from a global industrial recession and reduced levels of spending in upstream oil and gas customers. These conditions are expected to continue into the second quarter with improvements expected in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Network Power underlying sales declined 1% in the quarter as global demand for data center and telecommunications infrastructure spending was mixed. From a regional perspective, Asia had growth in Australia, India and Southeast Asia while Latin America reflected favorable data center activity levels, particularly in Mexico. Segment margins increased 90 basis points to 8%, benefiting from restructuring actions. Recent order trends have reflected improving conditions in both data center and telecommunications investment. 
Turning to Slide 9. Climate Technologies underlying sales declined 10% as global air conditioning sales decreased, driven by higher U.S. residential demand in the prior year resulting from regulatory changes. Global refrigeration markets grew modestly as growth in the United States and Asia was partially offset by softness in Europe. Demand in the air conditioning and refrigeration markets remains favorable, supporting our outlook for modest levels of growth in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 10. Underlying sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment were down 2%. Favorable activity levels in U.S. construction markets resulted in growth in both the wet-dry vacuums and food waste disposers businesses. Segment margins improved 20 basis points to 21.7% from the favorable impact of the divestiture of the InterMetro business. The favorable trends in U.S. residential and commercial construction continue to support our outlook for modest levels of growth in this segment. 
Turning to Slide 11. As we have indicated, we expect difficult market conditions to persist throughout the fiscal year, but we do still see a bottom forming in both sales and earnings by the middle of 2016. We will continue to execute on our operational plans while diligently working to complete the important portfolio repositioning actions that were announced last June. 
Taking into account our first quarter results and recent order trends, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2016 guidance. Underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 2% to 5% excluding negative currency translation and a deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.25 excluding estimated separation costs of approximately $250 million to $350 million, which are approximately $50 million lower than our previous expectations. 
For the second quarter, underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 4% to 6% excluding negative currency translation and a deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.65 are expected excluding estimated separation costs of approximately $75 million or approximately 11% -- $0.11 per share. 
Our long-standing commitment to return cash flow to our shareholders will be supported by an expected increase in 2016 operating cash flow to approximately $3 billion. 
And with that, I will now turn it over to Mr. David Farr."

We are looking forward to seeing our investors and analysts in Austin next week and we'll talk a little bit more about that in a second, but looking really forward to seeing everyone down there and sharing our plans and ideas to the group. 
I also want to thank everybody across Emerson relative to the execution in the first quarter. Clearly, this is only the first quarter and we have a very detailed undertaking ahead of us relative to sequentially improving our sales, our profitability, our earnings and cash flow from the remaining part of this year. And as I look at the plans we started back from restructuring back in February and I look at the announcement of repositioning that we announced in June, we continue to make very good progress, but it is clearly all about executing around those plans that we put in place and making sure we get it done from the standpoint of driving costs, standpoint of repositioning this company and looking forward to how, as we go through a very challenging global economy, very challenging industrial recession that we see today and coming out of this a stronger company and one that can continue to add assets once we repositioned to a new Emerson platform. 
Looking forward to giving you insight of how we see the 2016 unfolding from an economic standpoint, how we see the numbers happening from the cost of the repositioning, how we see the issues that we may see from a risk standpoint and what we're going to have to do about those if we see additional risks. Those are all things that we'll be talking about. I will defer those until we get together next week. 
Also looking forward to having Bob Sharp and also Steve Sonnenberg talk about the 2 key business segments -- business platforms that we'll be -- that we're moving into: the Commercial & Residential Solutions and then also the Automation solutions. Those 2 individuals will give you insights to what we see, the strength of these platforms, what we can do with those platforms and where we're going to invest going forward. 
Clearly, we have a challenging oil and gas industrial marketplace right now, but it's nothing new. We've been there before. We know what to do to deal with this issue. It's why we started the aggressive restructuring last year. 
As we talk amongst the business leaders, the OC, the board, if the market continues to get challenging, we will continue to do additional restructuring. We'll continue to make sure that the cost structure of this company stays competitive and that we can deliver the highest level of profitability that our shareholders expect from us. That is our -- that is what we're all about right now: executing around that and getting things forward. 
As I look at our current marketplace, the last 30 days have been what I would call the most unusual in my time at Emerson. I've never seen a marketplace go so volatile from the standpoint of the end markets, the stock markets, the interest rates, the -- I guess, the attitude. It's just a very amazing marketplace right now and one that clearly global CEOs like myself have to deal with and be prepared for whatever comes at us. 
But we are now basically in our fourth quarter of the recession. I see, as we'll talk about it next week, I see at least one more quarter, maybe another quarter. But sequentially, our game plan is to improve the business, cycle the business back up and start improving the profitability and that's what we're all about here. 
So with that, I'll open the floor. I'm glad to have the first quarter behind us. I want again to thank the organization. They did a great job executing around the plans we put out there. We're making great progress. And clearly, it's only one quarter. We know that. And our game plan is sequentially improve sales, the profitability, the earnings and the cash flow to our shareholders and establish the premium valuation that this company deserves. 
With that, I open the floor."

We are looking at a situation, in my opinion, the oil and gas marketplaces that will not recover until well past the middle of '17, maybe late '17. Fortunately, we have 75% of the business that doesn't serve the oil and gas marketplace. So even though we'll talk about this next week, oil and gas spending down, it's not going to 0. It will be a tougher marketplace and we'll have to work harder at it. And clearly, there is a lot of uncertainty around this, but the game is we're going to have to figure out how to get the sales, how to get the business and get our costs down and it will clearly be a tougher year in '16 than we thought.

I think that we see -- from our perspective, what we're looking at is that what we'll talk to you next week we're trying to encompass what we think the downside will be relative to oil and gas in the Process businesses. But I would say, the December quarter for orders for Process were not that bad. We pretty well have that factored in, in what's going on. I would say that my concern is the psyche of a Chevron or a psyche of a Exxon Mobil, a psyche of these Shells and the BPs and things like that will -- are going to again freeze up some of that spending level. They can't go to 0, but I think it's going to make it tougher. So my gut tells me that it is going to be more challenging in the near term in our oil and gas -- I mean, our Process order pace will be a drag on this and the other businesses will start pulling back up. So that's where we are at this point in time. I think I've always -- we'll give you an update on what I think the Process segment's going to do, but it's going to be -- there'll be more negative based on -- because on the first question, I did say that when the price of oil has gotten to down to that level, there'll be an impact and I think, right now, our underlying sales will be more negative in the Process than we thought originally, and hence, we're going to have to go out with more costs there. So -- but the psyche's not good in that space right now. Fortunately, there's more investments going on in the other parts of the marketplace and it's a big part of the marketplace, but the oil and gas investment area is not very good right now and I think it's going to hurt us for the second half of this year."

And it's -- we're going to see what our customer base does right now. As you said, man, they don't move that fast, but I know the psyche is not good.

But you're right, there's not been a lot of big bids around what I would say the oil and gas or the bigger -- the other big projects. So the pricing has been rational. The other issue is right now, like our European competitors, we're also a major player in the Process rolled out of Europe and so we're not -- we get the benefit of that, too. So what I see going to happen is we're going to be seeing sales shift to our European operations because we've been working for this the last 12 months. The dollar really started appreciating last year, a little over a year ago. So we've been working to get our rebound cost structure, which we'll continue to do. So our European organization right now is seeing the benefit of a lower cost structure. So they're winning and I would say you're going to see other regions in the world lose. So we're pushing around the world, just like our European competitors do, and that's one of the benefits we do have relative to having a broad manufacturing bases in all these businesses. So I feel reasonably comfortable right now on the forecast we're going to give you for price. I mean, we track this extremely hard. I don't know how long you've been following us, but I'll be the first one to admit in the early 2002-2003 time, I can't remember exactly when that was, we got side swiped on how fast this thing moved, but now we've created a lot tougher tracking process and so I can tell what's going on across this company. And it's tracking -- it's going to be a little more negative this year than last year, but well within what I thought we were going to see and well within the net material inflation level so -- and people are acting rational. It's going to be an interesting year to see. A lot of people are trying to improve their profitability on down volume and dropping price in a down volume to try to improve your profitability does not work. Economics 101. It does not work."

I am concerned as to why I think we're talking about we need to get our action together and think about if it takes longer to recover as we go into late '16 or early '17 in the Process side because I personally think what will happen is there'll be a freeze a little bit right now to allow our customers as they say, okay, we're reallocating capital. We're cutting capital again 10% or where that number's going to be. We'll see here in the next 30 to 60 days. And that will create pressure on, I know, our base relative to smaller projects and the MRO projects. So the initial reaction is, I think, we're going to see a slowdown and then hopefully, as we get into the year, we'll start seeing that capital back -- free back up again. They can't go to 0. It's not going to go to 0. But they're clearly going to reallocate and they're doing that really fast right now from our customer base. So I -- my concern right now is we're looking at downward pressure relative to our total sales underlying process. We need to take capacity off-line. So from my perspective, right now, we -- initial phase is for the last 12 months is very much focused on people, on restructuring overall -- overhead costs. And now, what I want to look at -- if we're going to look at a longer recovery here in this particular part of the Process world, we've got to look at taking fixed assets off-line. And so now, I've asked Frank and Ed Purvis and the business leaders at their upcoming reviews, which start, I think, a week or 2 from now. Look at what extra capacity that we may need to take off permanently if we're looking at a different environment and where should that capacity be and not be. So that's -- I think that will lead to higher levels of restructuring later this year, early '17."

Obviously, if some major crisis is going to erupt in the Middle East and things blowing up and stuff like that. But right now, I feel reasonably good about that.

The facilities are spending on small capital projects, upgrades that will help them get more out of the facility, higher quality, higher yield.

Now we've been -- if you look at the fourth calendar quarter, the third calendar quarter, they were pretty tough quarters for companies like Emerson. And so the market is now digesting that news as they saw it come out in the earnings report and the comments people are making right now, and let's say, a little bit more negative about 2016. So I would say that we sort of -- we've been trying to get ahead of that. And at this point in time, I feel that we've got that sized. I don't see the knock-down effect or what we saw the volatility, both in the marketplace and then also the commodity place in January.

I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2016 results. A conference call slide",1024,"Thank you, Alicia. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. 
Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2016 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. 
I will start with the first quarter summary, as shown on Page 2 of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 16% to $4.7 billion with underlying sales down 9%. Our results reflected a continuation of the difficult economic conditions that were experienced during most of fiscal 2015. We continue to find ourselves in the midst of a global industrial recession, and recent economic data suggests that capital spending by industrial businesses weakened during the course of the fourth calendar quarter. 
In the energy sector, lower, but equally as important uncertain oil prices continue to impact both operational and capital spending by our end customers. 
Reported earnings per share in the first quarter decreased 29% to $0.53. Adjusted earnings per share, which exclude $24 million in separation costs, were better than our previous expectation of $0.50. These separation costs relate to our portfolio repositioning actions, specifically the planned spin-off of Network Power and the potential divestitures of the Motors and Drives and Power Generation businesses. 
Overall, the first quarter results were slightly better than our expectations and the company remains well positioned for a challenging 2016. 
Turning to Slide 3. Gross profit margin in the quarter decreased 70 basis points to 40.1%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable mix. EBIT reflects the impacts of unfavorable currency transactions of $27 million and portfolio repositioning separation costs of $24 million. Additionally, the aggressive restructuring actions initiated in 2015 are beginning to have a positive impact on profitability. 
During the quarter, approximately 12 million shares were repurchased for $554 million. The company still plans for fiscal year share repurchase to reach approximately $1.2 billion. 
Turning to Slide 4. Underlying sales were down in all regions, except Europe, where our euro-based businesses are becoming more globally competitive. 
Turning to Slide 5. Business segment margin declined 170 basis points to 13.3%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable mix, partially offset by the savings from restructuring actions. 
Operating cash flow was down 15%, reflects the impact of lower earnings. 
Similar to many industrial manufacturers, capital spending was reduced due to lower global demand. Capital spending was down 30%. 
Turning to Slide 6. Process Management underlying sales declined 11% in the quarter. Energy sector spending remained at challenging levels as lower and increasingly uncertain oil prices further pressured spending, particularly in upstream market. Upstream projects underway will continue to completion, but new projects are facing potentially further delays. Downstream markets remain favorable in the U.S., Europe and Middle East, mainly in small- to medium-sized projects in the chemical and power markets. We will continue to shift our resources to capitalize on more favorable business activity levels in downstream and life sciences markets. 
Turning to Slide 7. Industrial Automation first quarter underlying sales declined 15%, reflecting continued weakness from a global industrial recession and reduced levels of spending in upstream oil and gas customers. These conditions are expected to continue into the second quarter with improvements expected in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Network Power underlying sales declined 1% in the quarter as global demand for data center and telecommunications infrastructure spending was mixed. From a regional perspective, Asia had growth in Australia, India and Southeast Asia while Latin America reflected favorable data center activity levels, particularly in Mexico. Segment margins increased 90 basis points to 8%, benefiting from restructuring actions. Recent order trends have reflected improving conditions in both data center and telecommunications investment. 
Turning to Slide 9. Climate Technologies underlying sales declined 10% as global air conditioning sales decreased, driven by higher U.S. residential demand in the prior year resulting from regulatory changes. Global refrigeration markets grew modestly as growth in the United States and Asia was partially offset by softness in Europe. Demand in the air conditioning and refrigeration markets remains favorable, supporting our outlook for modest levels of growth in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 10. Underlying sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment were down 2%. Favorable activity levels in U.S. construction markets resulted in growth in both the wet-dry vacuums and food waste disposers businesses. Segment margins improved 20 basis points to 21.7% from the favorable impact of the divestiture of the InterMetro business. The favorable trends in U.S. residential and commercial construction continue to support our outlook for modest levels of growth in this segment. 
Turning to Slide 11. As we have indicated, we expect difficult market conditions to persist throughout the fiscal year, but we do still see a bottom forming in both sales and earnings by the middle of 2016. We will continue to execute on our operational plans while diligently working to complete the important portfolio repositioning actions that were announced last June. 
Taking into account our first quarter results and recent order trends, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2016 guidance. Underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 2% to 5% excluding negative currency translation and a deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.25 excluding estimated separation costs of approximately $250 million to $350 million, which are approximately $50 million lower than our previous expectations. 
For the second quarter, underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 4% to 6% excluding negative currency translation and a deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.65 are expected excluding estimated separation costs of approximately $75 million or approximately 11% -- $0.11 per share. 
Our long-standing commitment to return cash flow to our shareholders will be supported by an expected increase in 2016 operating cash flow to approximately $3 billion. 
And with that, I will now turn it over to Mr. David Farr."

We are looking forward to seeing our investors and analysts in Austin next week and we'll talk a little bit more about that in a second, but looking really forward to seeing everyone down there and sharing our plans and ideas to the group. 
I also want to thank everybody across Emerson relative to the execution in the first quarter. Clearly, this is only the first quarter and we have a very detailed undertaking ahead of us relative to sequentially improving our sales, our profitability, our earnings and cash flow from the remaining part of this year. And as I look at the plans we started back from restructuring back in February and I look at the announcement of repositioning that we announced in June, we continue to make very good progress, but it is clearly all about executing around those plans that we put in place and making sure we get it done from the standpoint of driving costs, standpoint of repositioning this company and looking forward to how, as we go through a very challenging global economy, very challenging industrial recession that we see today and coming out of this a stronger company and one that can continue to add assets once we repositioned to a new Emerson platform. 
Looking forward to giving you insight of how we see the 2016 unfolding from an economic standpoint, how we see the numbers happening from the cost of the repositioning, how we see the issues that we may see from a risk standpoint and what we're going to have to do about those if we see additional risks. Those are all things that we'll be talking about. I will defer those until we get together next week. 
Also looking forward to having Bob Sharp and also Steve Sonnenberg talk about the 2 key business segments -- business platforms that we'll be -- that we're moving into: the Commercial & Residential Solutions and then also the Automation solutions. Those 2 individuals will give you insights to what we see, the strength of these platforms, what we can do with those platforms and where we're going to invest going forward. 
Clearly, we have a challenging oil and gas industrial marketplace right now, but it's nothing new. We've been there before. We know what to do to deal with this issue. It's why we started the aggressive restructuring last year. 
As we talk amongst the business leaders, the OC, the board, if the market continues to get challenging, we will continue to do additional restructuring. We'll continue to make sure that the cost structure of this company stays competitive and that we can deliver the highest level of profitability that our shareholders expect from us. That is our -- that is what we're all about right now: executing around that and getting things forward. 
As I look at our current marketplace, the last 30 days have been what I would call the most unusual in my time at Emerson. I've never seen a marketplace go so volatile from the standpoint of the end markets, the stock markets, the interest rates, the -- I guess, the attitude. It's just a very amazing marketplace right now and one that clearly global CEOs like myself have to deal with and be prepared for whatever comes at us. 
But we are now basically in our fourth quarter of the recession. I see, as we'll talk about it next week, I see at least one more quarter, maybe another quarter. But sequentially, our game plan is to improve the business, cycle the business back up and start improving the profitability and that's what we're all about here. 
So with that, I'll open the floor. I'm glad to have the first quarter behind us. I want again to thank the organization. They did a great job executing around the plans we put out there. We're making great progress. And clearly, it's only one quarter. We know that. And our game plan is sequentially improve sales, the profitability, the earnings and the cash flow to our shareholders and establish the premium valuation that this company deserves. 
With that, I open the floor."

We are looking at a situation, in my opinion, the oil and gas marketplaces that will not recover until well past the middle of '17, maybe late '17. Fortunately, we have 75% of the business that doesn't serve the oil and gas marketplace. So even though we'll talk about this next week, oil and gas spending down, it's not going to 0. It will be a tougher marketplace and we'll have to work harder at it. And clearly, there is a lot of uncertainty around this, but the game is we're going to have to figure out how to get the sales, how to get the business and get our costs down and it will clearly be a tougher year in '16 than we thought.

I think that we see -- from our perspective, what we're looking at is that what we'll talk to you next week we're trying to encompass what we think the downside will be relative to oil and gas in the Process businesses. But I would say, the December quarter for orders for Process were not that bad. We pretty well have that factored in, in what's going on. I would say that my concern is the psyche of a Chevron or a psyche of a Exxon Mobil, a psyche of these Shells and the BPs and things like that will -- are going to again freeze up some of that spending level. They can't go to 0, but I think it's going to make it tougher. So my gut tells me that it is going to be more challenging in the near term and our oil and gas -- I mean, our whole process order pace will be a drag in this and the other businesses will start pulling back up. So that's where we are at this point in time. I think I've always -- we'll give you an update on what I think the Process segment's going to do, but it's going to be -- there'll be more negative based on -- because on the first question, I did say that when the price of oil has gotten to down to that level, there'll be an impact and I think, right now, our underlying sales will be more negative in the Process than we thought originally, and hence, that we're going to have to go out with more costs there. So -- but the psyche's not good in that space right now. Fortunately, there's more investments going on in the other parts of the marketplace and it's a big part of the marketplace, but the oil and gas investment area is not very good right now and I think it's going to hurt us for the second half of this year."

But you're right, there's not been a lot of big bids around what I would say the oil and gas or the bigger -- the other big projects. So the pricing has been rational. The other issue is right now, like our European competitors, we're also a major player in the Process rolled out of Europe and so we're not -- we get the benefit of that, too. So what I see going to happen is we're going to be seeing sales shift to our European operations because we've been working for this the last 12 months. The dollar really started appreciating last year, a little over a year ago. So we've been working to get a rebalanced cost structure, which we'll continue to do. So our European organization right now is seeing the benefit of a lower cost structure. So they're winning and I would say you're going to see other regions in the world lose. So we're pushing around the world, just like our European competitors do, and that's one of the benefits we do have relative to having a broad manufacturing bases in all these businesses. So I feel reasonably comfortable right now on the forecast we're going to give you for price. I mean, we track this extremely hard. I don't know how long you've been following us, but I'll be the first one to admit in the early 2002-2003 time, I can't remember exactly when that was, we got side swiped on how fast this thing moved, but now we've created a lot tougher tracking process and so I can tell what's going on across this company. And it's tracking -- it's going to be a little more negative this year than last year, but well within what I thought we were going to see and well within the net material inflation level so -- and people are acting rational. It's going to be an interesting year to see. A lot of people are trying to improve their profitability on down volume and dropping price in a down volume to try to improve your profitability does not work. Economics 101. It does not work."

I am concerned as to why I think we're talking about we need to get our action together and think about if it takes longer to recover as we go into late '16 or early '17 in the Process side because I personally think what will happen is there'll be a freeze a little bit right now to allow our customers as they say, okay, we're reallocating capital. We're cutting capital again 10%. And where that number's going to be, we'll see here in the next 30 to 60 days. And that will create pressure on, I know, our base relative to smaller projects and the MRO projects. So the initial reaction is, I think, we're going to see a slowdown and then hopefully, as we get into the year, we'll start seeing that capital back -- free back up again. They can't go to 0. It's not going to go to 0. But they're clearly going to reallocate and they're doing that really fast right now from our customer base. So I -- my concern right now is we're looking at downward pressure relative to our total sales underlying process. We need to take capacity off-line. So from my perspective, right now, we -- initial phase is for the last 12 months is very much focused on people, on restructuring overall -- overhead costs. And now, what I want to look at -- if we're going to look at a longer recovery here in this particular part of the Process world, we've got to look at taking fixed assets off-line. And so now, I've asked Frank and Ed Purvis and the business leaders at their upcoming reviews, which start, I think, a week or 2 from now, look at what extra capacity that we may need to take off permanently if we're looking at a different environment and where should that capacity be and not be. So that's -- I think that will lead to higher levels of restructuring later this year, early '17."

Because if you're stuck 75% into a project and you stop, then you've got a problem because the project won't be that good by the time you come back to it in 5 years or wherever. So most people you're seeing, those monies will get spent. Now every time they go through a process of having to cut capital within that industry, that will fine-tune that. But most people are taking advantage of the environment right now to go out and improve their, I say, the efficiency. The facilities are spending on small capital projects, upgrades that will help them get more out of the facility, higher quality, higher yield. So that's where they're spending right now to get more of each facility. I mean, I see them still spending money. It's just an interesting process. They're going through the process of being very selective where when they have -- things are going their way, they threw a lot of money and everything. So the money is still being spent. But it's definitely be a lot more selective and it's going to be much more on how can I improve the investments we made over the last 10 years to get me more money out of that given the fact that my oil prices are down or my inputs are down, what can I do, so that's -- they're being a lot more selective along those lines and so -- which is a good business for us, but clearly you don't have the big projects, which give you a lot of top line growth with a big bang. But there's money being spent out there."

I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Today's call will summarize Emerson's second quarter 2016 results. The conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on the Emerson's website at emerson.com. 
A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available in the website for the next 90 days. 
I will start the presentation with the second quarter summary as shown on Slide 2. Net sales in the quarter decreased 9% to $4.9 billion with underlying sales down 5%. As we anticipated, served markets were mixed as oil and gas and industrial markets remained under pressure, particularly in North America where conditions were tougher. On the positive side, market conditions were more favorable in HVAC and U.S. construction. Data center and telecommunication spending improved during the quarter as well. Reported earnings per share decreased 60% to $0.57. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.66, which excludes $56 million of total separation costs, were slightly above our expectations. Profitability in the quarter benefited from the significant restructuring actions we completed in 2015 and solid operating performance across our businesses. Improved working capital performance generated strong operating cash flow of $719 million in the quarter. Overall, the second quarter exceeded many of the company's expectations, and we remain on track for fiscal 2016. 
Turning to Slide 3. Gross profit margin was up 40 basis points due to cost reductions and containment actions, and lower SG&A expense benefited from restructuring actions. The year-over-year change in EBIT reflects the impact of separation cost of $31 million and a $932 million divestiture gain from the Power Transmission Solutions business in the prior year. Excluding the gain and the separation costs, EBIT margin increased 70 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 4. Underlying sales decreased in all regions except Europe. The results were similar to the first quarter, which are noted on the slides for your reference, as the global economies are still not showing much strength. 
Turning to Slide 5. Business segment margin improved 140 basis points to 14.6%, led by year-over-year margin improvement in the Network Power, Climate Technology and Commercial & Residential Solutions segments. Restructuring was a positive, and savings from the 2015 restructuring actions and lower expense in the current year were a benefit across the segments. Comparisons in corporate and other were driven by an increase of $46 million in stock compensation, resulting from share price appreciation, pretax separation cost of $31 million and a 2015 divestiture gain of $932 million. Working capital performance drove an operating cash flow improvement of 101% in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6. Process Management underlying sales decreased 9% in the quarter. Oil and gas customer spending remained a headwind across the regions but was more pronounced in certain markets like the Canadian oil sands and the U.S. Efficiency and productivity projects continued to gain traction with customers in the energy sector as interest and engagement continue to increase. Project opportunities in power in the U.S., Asia, Europe and Middle East/Africa continued to support growth, while chemical markets across various regions continue to be favorable as well. Segment margin decreased 20 basis points primarily from volume deleverage and mix but were partially offset by savings from restructuring actions, which will continue to benefit profitability in the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Slide 7. Industrial Automation second quarter sales declined 10%, reflecting continued weakness in industrial and upstream oil and gas spending. Power-generating alternator sales are at a 10-year low. Alternative energy wind projects were a bright spot for the drives business. Segment margin decreased 50 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and price, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions and materials cost containment. Slightly better market conditions and easing comparisons are expected to improve both underlying growth and profitability in the second half of fiscal 2016. 
Turning to Slide 8. Network Power underlying sales were down 1% in the quarter, but global demand for data center telecommunications infrastructure improved during the quarter.
Telecommunications power systems had particularly strong growth in North America. Segment margin improved 490 basis points to 8.1%, mainly benefiting from restructuring actions. New product programs and the segment's global repositioning strategy are starting to flow through to both sales and profitability. Improving order trends for both data center and telecommunications investment will drive positive third quarter sales growth and improved margins. 
Turning to Slide 9. Climate Technologies underlying sales increased 2%, driven by the U.S. residential and commercial air conditioning business, which was up 10%. Europe reflected strong growth across the region. The refrigeration business was up high single digits. Segment margin increased 170 basis points primarily due to significant savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Favorable air conditioning and refrigeration end markets should continue to support improvement in underlying growth through the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Slide 10. Underlying sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment increased 2%. Favorable conditions in U.S. construction markets, particularly residential, were supportive for growth. The divestiture of the commercial storage business reduced year-over-year sales by 16% but had a positive impact on segment margin, which improved 380 basis points to 23.2%. Favorable trends in U.S. residential construction are expected to continue, supporting the outlook for modest levels of underlying growth and margin improvement in the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Slide 11. While the global economic environment for Emerson businesses will continue to be challenging, demand has begun to stabilize or improve in certain markets. Comparisons in the second half of the year also become easier due to the significant decline in underlying sales during fiscal 2015. As we've indicated, order trends remain in line with expectations and therefore continue to support our assumptions that 2016 underlying sales will be down 2% to 5%, excluding negative currency translation of 1% and a 2% deduction from completed divestitures. Underlying sales in the third quarter are expected to be approximately flat to the prior year. We also reaffirm our guidance that adjusted earnings per share will be $3.05 to $3.25 excluding $250 million to $300 million of separation cost related to the company's portfolio repositioning. Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter are anticipated to be flat to the prior year or approximately $0.85, excluding $145 million of separation costs. 
And now I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr."

Thank you very much for joining us today. I appreciate your time. And as you could see, I've -- this was a very solid quarter, and I want to thank the entire global organization relative to execution around the significant rest",1482,"Thank you very much, Craig. Thank you very much for joining us today. I appreciate your time. And as you could see, I've -- this was a very solid quarter, and I want to thank the entire global organization relative to execution around the significant restructuring starting last year and continue to run through this year. And the results are starting to flow through, as they did for the last 3 quarters. 
Core profitability has now begun to improve, and we're exhibiting strong cash flow and very good performance. And again, I want to thank the global Emerson organization out there for doing some very difficult heavy-lifting in a very challenging marketplace. 
As we talked about it since November, I've been talking about fixed-rate orders. We're going to reach our goal by April. I'm not quite sure yet, but it's -- as we've looked at the order pace for the last several months, step by step by step, with October being the bottom, we've seen continued improvement. Last month's 3-month roll, we basically saw at around negative 4%. We do not know what the April ending numbers will be, which report -- we're talking about reporting around the May [indiscernible] products meeting. But right now, my gut tells me we've seen some weaker in North America oil and gas spending in the short cycle, included, we're seeing very weak spending round the backup power-generating marketplace, which, as we see, it's running at an 11-year low. But we might close. And we'll know when we get it all in. But it might be May. But we haven't get it up in April yet. I know -- I can tell you this one, we're going to be close enough that my 14-month old Zorro might be able to jump that rope and get there, but I do know there's been some weakening in the North America oil and gas spending route in the alternate route, for sure. 
The overall performance this quarter relative to the operations was very good in a very challenging marketplace. You think about the balance sheet, the cash flow, the earnings, setting up for us, what we believe is a very important milestone, again, in the third quarter, with hopefully underlying sales getting close to 0 and our earnings per share being flat with improved margins. Again, very important milestones as we quickly work through the process. And operations have done a lot of heavy-lifting here, and the restructuring is really starting to pay off. 
From my perspective right now, as I look at the global marketplace, I just came back from Europe. Europe -- our Western European business had continued to improve. I finally see good -- some good momentum there. No, the economy is not going to be robust there, but they clearly are making investments. They're making strategic investments. They have some experts. And so underlying, we see our European business being a benefit, a positive versus what it was a couple of months ago. I see the U.S., the U.S. economy, in particular the industrial segment, has continued to be challenging in certain segments. I would say even weaker within the U.S. marketplace. The rest of the world basically is trending along the lines we've been talking about for the last 2 or 3, 4 quarters, including what we talked about at our analyst meeting in February. So not a whole lot of change as I see it. The plus is coming from Europe. The minus is coming from the U.S. 
Network Power business orders continue to be improving and positive, and we expect Network Power to have positive growth in the third quarter, the top line, and positive growth in earnings. We expect the Commercial & Residential Solutions efforts is continuing to be positive, and we also expect our Climate Technology business to do reasonably well. But one market we're struggling right now is China residential. The rest of the world, they're progressing, do extremely well. And obviously, you could see some of the profitability coming through from these businesses as they've got the restructuring done in the second half of last year and the early part of this year. 
From a restructuring standpoint, we're going to be around this -- Frank, I think we're talking about $68 million [ph] -- $70 million, $80 million. We are looking at areas right now where we've seen weaknesses -- where we'll wrap up a little bit more restructuring, but we have this pretty well in focus as we look at this year. We're also starting to look at opportunities as we've now formed the 2 strategic businesses underneath 2 leaders of Mike Train and Bob Sharp. And we're looking at programs that will institute coming forward into '17 and '18, I would say, create a more best-cost, structural-global organization and manufacturing process and opportunities that we can then look at taking more cost out both for profitability but also to increase investments and for growth in some of the technologies and innovations area. So overall, I'm pleased with the opportunities there and look forward to continuing to figure out how we can generate higher levels of profitability in the 2 core businesses that will remain as we finish the repositioning. 
Relative to the repositioning, as we review with the board last night and again this morning, we're making progress. The Network Power program both is on the table at this point in time. We're looking at either a sale or spin, both our viable at this point in time. And the board, along with inputs from the management team, we're getting closer and closer to making that final position, and we will be making that decision. We have filed initial spin documents, which you have to do, and will continue to refine those documents based on inputs from the SEC. But from our standpoint right now, both options of what we're going to do to the business will create value for our shareholders and for value for us as a company going forward, still on the table and is still actively being worked. And it is not a problem. I know people like to speculate and people like to aggravate, but this is a process that's well underway and well and focused and well in line with what we expected. 
Relative to Leroy-Somer CT, Control Techniques, again we had a lot of viable global potential buyers of these assets, and that process is well underway. And even despite the tougher marketplace we see in that market we're selling, we still have a good, good opportunity there to sell these businesses for, what I would say, a [indiscernible] price and accept that and take that money and reinvest it back into Emerson and to the 2 core businesses that we're going to maintain. 
We'll also review today significant acquisition opportunities. the board. One thing good about the world today and the struggle relative to a lot of companies, there are unique acquisition opportunities out there both from a technology standpoint and the commercial and residential standpoint and also from the automation solution standpoint. So we are looking for opportunities to reinvest the proceeds, and the objective is to take that money and reinvest it back into the core businesses and eventually get back into $20-plus billion corporation, but a much more focused and selective and profitable business. As we talked about in February, when we come out of this transition, we'll be a more profitable business, we'll be more focused business and will be a more -- very much focused on doing significant acquisitions around these 2 businesses and once again regaining the size, as big as a corporate relative to what we need to do in a global basis. i like where we sit today. We're pivoting from significant restructuring to getting closer to growth in new orders, significant growth in improved profitability and pivoting towards this completion of the repositioning of the 2 core businesses we're trying to get out and positioning ourselves towards making additional acquisitions. And a great progress along those lines. No more specific details than I just gave you. So you can ask, and I would say, ""No -- don't comment."" But that's the flavor we are right now and good discussion with the board for lengthy term last night and again today relative to that. But again, as we wrap up here and open up for questions, again very, very good execution by the operating folks from Frank and his team and Ed Purvis and Ed Monser and then all the business leaders out there. I truly appreciate the -- really working as hard in trying to create a high level of profitability and high level of cash flow for us to have the opportunity to reinvest and grow this company again. 
So with that, I open the mic for questions."

It did give us a chance to really have a better package to go out and sell in a more focused approach with the organization and also, clearly, the comps got a little bit easier. But the most important thing here is the work that Scott Barbour and his team did over the last couple of years in getting their team focused around the different channels, the different products, the different solutions.

So in the first quarter, we're -- delta year around $80 million improved from restructuring. Second quarter, we're looking at around $100 million. The third quarter, it looks to us like it's going to probably back around $70 million because now we're starting to get -- get comparisons from last year. And then yes, in the fourth quarter what happens here we see a bounce back up again, priced over $100 million because the expense is going to be down. So delta there is going to help us a little bit. So that's how the numbers look right now, and we just had a very good quarter here. I expect [indiscernible] decent quarter in the third quarter, and that will get a big pot because will be less spending from versus last year, which we had a big pickup. So the savings are starting to flow through along those lines. Next year, now I would say based on just the businesses left, let's say that we -- we're executing the sale or the spin or whatever of the business, you look at process business and you look at the commercial residential business left, which is the day-to-day restructuring. Those numbers are going to drop significantly because of what's going on. And then what -- and so when I say significantly we're going to be under $50 million. [indiscernible] number yet, but going to be under $50 million. [ph] And then what can happen though is Bob Sharp and Jim are looking at opportunities across the Commercial & Residential Solutions business that we are going to start executing on as we get into '17. So they are all of a sudden, that we don't have a number yet, but to start taking that number up, where that 50 maybe -- might go up $25 million, $30 million, $40 million as we look at a 2-year program to rightsize and restructuring and reposition the commercial residential on a global basis to make it really best-cost location, best cost structure and allow us to take some of that profitability to the P&L and also to help us invest for growth. So there's some unique opportunities to put this business together, and that will happen as we get into '17. But next year, restructuring, Mike, that tells me that the core business will be down significantly. A long-winded answer for probably you didn't want to hear. But that's [indiscernible]"

So we've been shifting some of the resources down from the large down to medium to go after those smaller projects. From a growth in market share, yes, I still feel that we're good at a -- we'll come out of the cycle ahead. As we did last cycle, I think Emerson will come out ahead and will be a stronger player in the Process Management industrial marketplace around the space here when the cycle comes out from an overall participation. On the day-to-day stuff, that, say, more driven by the corporate world of CEOs being very cautious, worried about cash flow, the same thing. Doing if you look at them as if you look at the capital spend in the first half of the year. We're down significantly from last year. Nothing any different from any of the CEOs out there. I think that CEOs right now are being very, very cautious relative to spending. And particularly, given weakness imaging in the industrial space. So I think that market -- that is going to be pretty, pretty challenging for the next 6 months and CEOs feel, ""Okay, I can let go a little bit of money, more money and reinvest back into the company."" That's how I see it at this point in time."

We are very focused on our capital spend right now on productivity, quality improvement and trying to get the cost down. But a lot of people are still trying to evaluate where they want to take their businesses. So I think there's been an underinvestment. And hopefully, we'll see it come back up.

We're seeing that spending going on. When you look at the order pace in Europe, look at the order pace in Asia, that trend is turning the right way. So that's why we felt pretty good. The one surprise we had is this -- the last couple of months. We've seen the U.S. spending rate come back down again, which by the sense and that's what's created probably this delay by 1 month relative to April -- the April time -- I don't know yet, for sure. But just intuition tells me where we were at negative 4%, that should be close to negative 2%. So it's this -- what's going on right now on this thing -- this is climbing up a little bit slower and we're having people be a little more cautious in spending. But on the power side, people are happy to spend money for the new regulations coming to play. They've underinvested for a while. We have some plants they've got to take off line. And so that we're seeing people spend money on trying to move towards gap. So the spending is there for power, and seen that. We're doing extremely well in Europe. We're doing well in North America and doing well in Asia. We are a company that actually continue to invest and grow and put the technology and a lot of our competitors are walking away from what I call primary power. And so be it, I love it.

The other thing we're doing at this point in time is also is we are getting restructuring done  actually getting it done at a lower cost.

I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Today's call will summarize Emerson's second quarter 2016 results. The conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on the Emerson's website at emerson.com. 
A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. 
I will start the presentation with the second quarter summary as shown on Slide 2. Net sales in the quarter decreased 9% to $4.9 billion, with underlying sales down 5%. As we anticipated, served markets were mixed as oil and gas and industrial markets remained under pressure, particularly in North America where conditions were tougher. On the positive side, market conditions were more favorable in HVAC and U.S. construction. Data center and telecommunication spending improved during the quarter as well. Reported earnings per share decreased 60% to $0.57. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.66, which excludes $56 million of total separation costs, were slightly above our expectations. Profitability in the quarter benefited from the significant restructuring actions we completed in 2015 and solid operating performance across our businesses. Improved working capital performance generated strong operating cash flow of $719 million in the quarter. Overall, the second quarter exceeded many of the company's expectations, and we remain on track for fiscal 2016. 
Turning to Slide 3. Gross profit margin was up 40 basis points due to cost reductions and containment actions, and lower SG&A expense benefited from restructuring actions. The year-over-year change in EBIT reflects the impact of separation cost of $31 million and a $932 million divestiture gain from the Power Transmission Solutions business in the prior year. Excluding the gain and the separation costs, EBIT margin increased 70 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 4. Underlying sales decreased in all regions except Europe. The results were similar to the first quarter, which are noted on the slide for your reference, as the global economies are still not showing much strength. 
Turning to Slide 5. Business segment margin improved 140 basis points to 14.6%, led by year-over-year margin improvement in the Network Power, Climate Technology and Commercial & Residential Solutions segments. Restructuring was a positive, as savings from the 2015 restructuring actions and lower expense in the current year were a benefit across the segments. Comparisons in corporate and other were driven by an increase of $46 million in stock compensation, resulting from share price appreciation, pretax separation cost of $31 million and a 2015 divestiture gain of $932 million. Working capital performance drove an operating cash flow improvement of 101% in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6. Process Management underlying sales decreased 9% in the quarter. Oil and gas customer spending remained a headwind across the regions, but was more pronounced in certain markets like the Canadian oil sands and the U.S. Efficiency and productivity projects continued to gain traction with customers in the energy sector as interest and engagement continue to increase. Project opportunities in power in the U.S., Asia, Europe and Middle East/Africa continued to support growth, while chemical markets across various regions continue to be favorable as well. Segment margin decreased 20 basis points primarily from volume deleverage and mix, but were partially offset by savings from restructuring actions, which will continue to benefit profitability in the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Slide 7. Industrial Automation second quarter sales declined 10%, reflecting continued weakness in industrial and upstream oil and gas spending. Power generating alternator sales are at a 10-year low. Alternative energy wind projects were a bright spot for the drives business. Segment margin decreased 50 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and price, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions and materials cost containment. Slightly better market conditions and easing comparisons are expected to improve both underlying growth and profitability in the second half of fiscal 2016. 
Turning to Slide 8. Network Power underlying sales were down 1% in the quarter. The global demand for data center and telecommunications infrastructure improved during the quarter. Telecommunications power systems had particularly strong growth in North America. Segment margin improved 490 basis points to 8.1%, mainly benefiting from restructuring actions. New product programs and the segment's global repositioning strategy are starting to flow through to both sales and profitability. Improving order trends for both data center and telecommunications investment will drive positive third quarter sales growth and improved margins. 
Turning to Slide 9. Climate Technologies underlying sales increased 2%, driven by the U.S. residential and commercial air-conditioning business, which was up 10%. Europe reflected strong growth across the region. The refrigeration business was up high single digits. Segment margin increased 170 basis points primarily due to significant savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Favorable air-conditioning and refrigeration end markets should continue to support improvement in underlying growth through the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Slide 10. Underlying sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment increased 2%. Favorable conditions in U.S. construction markets, particularly residential, were supportive for growth. The divestiture of the commercial storage business reduced year-over-year sales by 16%, but had a positive impact on segment margin, which improved 380 basis points to 23.2%. Favorable trends in U.S. residential construction are expected to continue, supporting the outlook for modest levels of underlying growth and margin improvement in the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Slide 11. While the global economic environment for Emerson businesses will continue to be challenging, demand has begun to stabilize or improve in certain markets. Comparisons in the second half of the year also become easier due to the significant decline in underlying sales during fiscal 2015. As we've indicated, order trends remain in line with expectations and therefore continue to support our assumptions that 2016 underlying sales will be down 2% to 5%, excluding negative currency translation of 1% and a 2% deduction from completed divestitures. Underlying sales in the third quarter are expected to be approximately flat to the prior year. We also reaffirm our guidance that adjusted earnings per share will be $3.05 to $3.25, excluding $250 million to $300 million of separation costs related to the company's portfolio repositioning. Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter are anticipated to be flat to the prior year or approximately $0.85, excluding $145 million of separation costs. 
And now I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr."

Thank you very much for joining us today. I appreciate your time. And as you could see, [indiscernible] this was a very solid quarter, and I want to thank the entire global organization relative to execution around the significant restructuring starting last year and continue to run through this year. And the results are starting to flow through, as they did for the last 3 quarters. 
Core profitability has now begun to improve, and we're exhibiting strong cash flow and very good performance. And again, I want to thank the global Emerson organization out there for doing some very difficult heavy-lifting in a very challenging marketplace. 
As we talked about it -- since November, I've been talking about fixed-rate orders. We're going to reach our goal by April. I'm not quite sure yet, but it's -- as we've looked at the order pace for the last several months, step by step by step, with October being the bottom, we've seen continued improvement. Last month's 3-month roll, we basically saw at around negative 4%. We do not know what the April ending numbers will be, which we'll report -- we're talking about reporting around the May Electrical Products Group meeting. But right now, my gut tells me we'd seen some weaker North America oil and gas spending in the short cycle, and clearly we're seeing very weak spending around the backup power-generator marketplace, which, as we see, it's running at an 11-year low. But we might close, and we'll know when we get it all in. But it might be May, but we haven't given up in April yet. I know -- I can tell you this one, we're going to be close enough that my 14-month old Zorro might be able to jump that rope and get there. But I do know there's been some weakening in the North America oil and gas spending route in the alternate route, for sure. 
The overall performance this quarter relative to the operations was very good in a very challenging marketplace. You think about the balance sheet, the cash flow, the earnings, setting up for us, what we believe is a very important milestone, again, in the third quarter, with hopefully underlying sales getting close to 0 and our earnings per share being flat with improved margins. Again, very important milestones as we quickly work through the process. And operations have done a lot of heavy-lifting here, and the restructuring is really starting to pay off. 
From my perspective right now, as I look at the global marketplace, I just came back from Europe. Europe -- our Western European business had continued to improve. I finally see good -- some good momentum there. No, the economy is not going to be robust there, but they clearly are making investments. They're making strategic investments. They have some exports. And so underlying, we see our European business being a benefit and a positive versus what it was a couple of months ago. I see the U.S., the U.S. economy, in particular on the industrial segment, has continued to be challenging in certain segments. I would say even weaker within the U.S. marketplace. The rest of the world basically is trending along the lines that we've been talking about for the last 2 or 3, 4 quarters, including what we talked about at our analyst meeting in February. So not a whole lot of change as I see it. The plus is coming from Europe. The minus is coming from the U.S. 
Network Power business orders continue to be improving and positive, and we expect Network Power to have positive growth in the third quarter, the top line, and positive growth in earnings. We expect the Commercial & Residential Solutions efforts is continuing to be positive, and we also expect our Climate Technology business to do reasonably well. But one market we're struggling right now is China residential. The rest of the world, they're progressing, doing extremely well. And obviously, you could see some of the profitability coming through with some of these businesses as they've got the restructuring done in the second half of last year and early part of this year. 
From a restructuring standpoint, we're going to be around this -- Frank, I think we're talking about $60 million to $80 million -- $70 million, $80 million. We are looking at areas right now where we've seen weaknesses -- where we'll ramp up a little bit more restructuring, but we have this pretty well in focus as we look at this year. We're also starting to look at opportunities as we've now formed the 2 strategic businesses underneath 2 leaders of Mike Train and Bob Sharp. And we're looking at our programs that will institute coming forward into '17 and '18 to, I would say, create a more best-cost, structural, global organization and manufacturing process and opportunities that we can then look at taking more cost out both for profitability, but also to increase investments and for growth in some of the technologies and innovations area. So overall, I'm pleased with the opportunities there and look forward to continuing to figure out how we can generate higher levels of profitability in the 2 core businesses that will remain as we finish the repositioning. 
Relative to the repositioning, as we review with the board last night and again this morning, we're making progress. The Network Power program both is on the table at this point in time. We're looking at either a sale or a spin, both are viable at this point in time. And the board, along with inputs from the management team, we're getting closer and closer to making that final decision, and we will be making that final decision. We have filed initial spin documents, which you have to do, and will continue to refine those documents based on inputs from the SEC. And -- but from our standpoint right now, both options of what we're going to do to the business to create value for our shareholders and for value for us as the company going forward, are still on the table and are still actively being worked. And it is not a problem. I know people like to speculate and people like to aggravate, but this is a process that's well underway and well and focused and well in line with what we expected. 
Relative to Leroy-Somer CT, Control Techniques, again we have a lot of viable global potential buyers of these assets, and that process is well underway. And even despite the tougher marketplace we see in that market, we're selling -- we still have a good, good opportunity there to sell these businesses for, what I would say, a respectable price and exit that and take that money and reinvest it back into Emerson and to the 2 core businesses that we're going to maintain. 
We also reviewed today significant acquisition opportunities, the board. One thing good about the world today and the struggle relative to a lot of companies, there are unique acquisition opportunities out there both from a technology standpoint and the commercial and residential standpoint and also from the automation solution standpoint. So we are looking for opportunities to reinvest the proceeds, and the objective is to take that money and reinvest it back into the core businesses and eventually get back into the $20-plus billion corporation, but a much more focused and selective and profitable business. As we talked about in February, when we come out of this transition, we'll be a more profitable business, we'll be more focused business and will be a more -- very much focused on doing significant acquisitions around these 2 businesses and once again regaining the size, right, as big as a corporate relative to what we need to do on a global basis. 
So i like where we sit today. We're pivoting from significant restructuring to getting closer to growth in new orders, significant growth in improved profitability and pivoting towards this completion of the repositioning of the 2 core businesses we're trying to get out and positioning ourselves towards making additional acquisitions. And a great progress along those lines. No more specific details than I just gave you. So you can ask, and I will say, ""No comment."" But that's the flavor we are right now, and good discussion with the board for lengthy term last night and again today relative to that. But again, as we wrap up here and open up for questions, again very, very good execution by the operating folks from Frank and his team and Ed Purvis and Ed Monser and then all the business leaders out there. I truly appreciate the -- they're really working as hard in trying to create a high level of profitability and high level of cash flow for us to have the opportunity to reinvest and grow this company again. 
So with that, I open the mic for questions."

That's all I can think about. No, it's a fair aspect. There's a couple of things going on. As you know, when we went through the period of [indiscernible] restructuring and trying to change the organization, we went through a period of having to develop a, I would say, a more selective type of product portfolio for the market changes and opportunities. It did give us a chance to really have a better package to go out and sell in a more focused approach with the organization and also, clearly, the comps got a little bit easier. But the most important thing here is the work that Scott Barbour and his team did over the last couple of years in getting their team focused around the different channels, the different products, the different solutions. And now I think that focus and that cost structure we've put in place really are allowing these guys to compete and win. And it's a global thing. And so that is very good to see. So we have a long way to go with that business, but it's nice to have it helping and carrying a load right now. So that's where it is -- that's what's really going on."

A spin is one that you can have -- assuming we don't know what the FTC will do from an input standpoint. But our focus right now, if we go to this side, we go to route of spin, it will be towards the end of the fiscal year, if not, just right after the fiscal year. If we have to sell and have to go through a review process, it could be a couple of months longer. But right now, we still look at some time in the September-October -- end of September, October, November time frame for that based on other way we go, but that's the time frame we're looking at that there, Scott. On Leroy-Somer Control Techniques, again, it really depends. There's a sale process. If we have to go in international person, relative -- a potential strategic buyer there, it will take, I think, from a revenue standpoint, both from the various governments around the world, longer. Both the U.S., the European government, there's a substantial position for Leroy-Somer CT and friends. So I think that's going to definitely be most likely. By the time it's completed in the fourth calendar quarter, but most -- what you'll from us sometime most likely this quarter or -- end of this quarter, early next fourth quarter, you'll hear which way we're going. You'll hear from us, sale or spin."

The market started to open up, and we just want to make sure we have the capability.

Relative to North America and particularly U.S., it's primarily just the day-to-day type of spending that you see on the oil projects, not really big projects specific. It's all around the day-to-day type of what we call the MRO type. This normal type of spend, where capital budgets definitely have been curtailed by most oil and gas guys or companies within the North America, both in Canada and the United States. And so they're continuing to tighten those belts up, and we're seeing that business, not day-to-day business, given our strength in this marketplace, which had been hurting us more on the, what I'd call the shorter-cycle type of products and the big -- the project business is not -- we haven't seen anything there, it's just been more of a more day-to-day type of situation.

I think that, that we are looking at the unique investments to help grow that business more in '17 and '18. On the automation side of the business right now, we're still going to go through, I would say, continue to downsize and rationalize for some time here. One of the things -- as we form the 2 businesses, we're looking at ways that we can take out cost and then accrete -- create new investment dollars, some to go to margins, some to go internally. But that's going to be more in the '17-'18 time period. So I think you're looking at us already pivoting on part of the portfolio and the automation part of the portfolio we are still rationalizing, restructuring, protecting profitability and making sure that we do the right thing to protect the core value of the businesses. And so we're not walking away from the strategic investments there, but we're more in the -- let's make sure we have this opportunity to get the cost in line. And if we have any weak pieces of the tree and the wood or whatever it is, let's get a trend. And that's where we are at right now."

In the first half of this year, they're down around 12%, 13%. So what we're seeing is we're starting to see some pick back up in certain sectors, and comparisons will be a little bit easier. So if we go flat, it's still not really exciting, given the fact how hard it was down last year. So that's what we see at this point in time.

And then -- in the fourth quarter what happens here is we're seeing a bounce back up again, probably to over $100 million because the expense is going to be down. So delta there is going to help us a little bit. So that's how the numbers look right now, and we just had a very good quarter here. I would expect us to have another decent quarter in the third quarter, and there will be a big pot because of the less spending from versus last year, which we had a big pickup. So the savings are starting to flow through along those lines. Next year, now I would say based on just the core businesses left, let's say that we were executing the sale or the spin or whatever of the business, you look at the process business and you look at the commercial and residential business left, which is the day-to-day restructuring. Those numbers are going to drop significantly because of what's going on. And then what -- and so when I say significantly, we're going to be under $50 million. I mean, I haven't seen the number yet, but I got to believe it could be under $50 million. And then what's going to happen though is Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann are looking at opportunities across the Commercial & Residential Solutions business that we are going to start executing on as we get into '17. So they are all of a sudden, that we don't have a number yet, but we're going to start taking that number up, where that 50 may become -- might go up $25 million, $30 million, $40 million as we look at a 2-year program to rightsize and restructuring and reposition the commercial and residential on a global basis to make it really best-cost location, best-cost structure and allow us to take some of that profitability to the P&L and also to help us invest for growth. So there's some unique opportunities [indiscernible] to put this business together. So that will happen as we get into '17. But next year, restructuring, Mike though tells me the core basis will be down significantly. A long-winded answer for probably what didn't want to hear. But that's [indiscernible]."

From a growth to market share, yes, I still feel that we're good end up -- we'll come out of cycle ahead. As we did last cycle, I think Emerson will come out ahead and will be a stronger player in the Process Management, industrial marketplace around the space here when the cycle comes out from an overall participation. On the day-to-day stuff, that's staying more driven by the corporate world of CEOs being very cautious, worried about cash flow, being the same thing I'm doing. If you look at Emerson, if you look at our capital spend in the first half of the year, we're down significantly from last year. I don't think I'm any different from any other CEO out there.

So I think that market -- that part is going to be pretty, pretty challenging here for the next 6 months.

We are very focused on our capital spend right now on productivity, quality improvement and trying to get the cost down.

I'm a little bit disappointed to watch corporate America cutting too far in that area. But that's where they are right now. And I can't push and shove anymore to make them do it.

So it's this -- what's going on right now, this thing -- this is climbing up a little bit slower and we're having people be a little more cautious in spending and -- but on the power side, people are happy to spend money for the new regulations coming to play.

That's why I think -- that's where I think things are going. People are cutting back. The demand is still growing, but it takes a long time. When you make an investment and you have oil and gas pumping and you got that capital spend, you just don't turn it off. Typically, you let it run until you make some cash out of it. And even though you're not making as much as you thought, you're still trying to get that payback. So I think that's what we're going through right now. We're still squeezing it out. And I think there could be a bump in the road here down, and -- but fundamentally, I think the trend line is back up a little bit towards the $50 mark."

I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Today's call will summarize Emerson's second quarter 2016 results. The conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on the Emerson's website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. 
I will start the presentation with the second quarter summary as shown on Slide 2. Net sales in the quarter decreased 9% to $4.9 billion, with underlying sales down 5%. As we anticipated, served markets were mixed as oil and gas and industrial markets remained under pressure, particularly in North America where conditions were tougher. 
On the positive side, market conditions were more favorable in HVAC and U.S. construction. Data center and telecommunication spending improved during the quarter as well. 
Reported earnings per share decreased 60% to $0.57. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.66, which excludes $56 million of total separation costs, were slightly above our expectations. 
Profitability in the quarter benefited from the significant restructuring actions we completed in 2015 and solid operating performance across our businesses. Improved working capital performance generated strong operating cash flow of $719 million in the quarter. 
Overall, the second quarter exceeded many of the company's expectations, and we remain on track for fiscal 2016. 
Turning to Slide 3. Gross profit margin was up 40 basis points due to cost reductions and containment actions, and lower SG&A expense benefited from restructuring actions. The year-over-year change in EBIT reflects the impact of separation costs of $31 million and a $932 million divestiture gain from the Power Transmission Solutions business in the prior year. Excluding the gain and the separation costs, EBIT margin increased 70 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 4. Underlying sales decreased in all regions except Europe. The results were similar to the first quarter, which are noted on the slide for your reference, as the global economies are still not showing much strength. 
Turning to Slide 5. Business segment margin improved 140 basis points to 14.6%, led by year-over-year margin improvement in the Network Power, Climate Technology and Commercial & Residential Solutions segments. Restructuring was a positive, as savings from the 2015 restructuring actions and lower expense in the current year were a benefit across the segments. Comparisons in corporate and other were driven by an increase of $46 million in stock compensation, resulting from share price appreciation, pretax separation costs of $31 million and a 2015 divestiture gain of $932 million. Working capital performance drove an operating cash flow improvement of 101% in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6. Process Management underlying sales decreased 9% in the quarter. Oil and gas customer spending remained a headwind across the regions, but was more pronounced in certain markets like the Canadian oil sands and the U.S. Efficiency and productivity projects continued to gain traction with customers in the energy sector as interest and engagement continue to increase. Project opportunities in power in the U.S., Asia, Europe and Middle East/Africa continued to support growth, while chemical markets across various regions continue to be favorable as well. Segment margin decreased 20 basis points primarily from volume deleverage and mix, but were partially offset by savings from restructuring actions, which will continue to benefit profitability in the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Slide 7. Industrial Automation second quarter sales declined 10%, reflecting continued weakness in industrial and upstream oil and gas spending. Power generating alternator sales are at a 10-year low. Alternative energy wind projects were a bright spot for the drives business. Segment margin decreased 50 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and price, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions and materials cost containment. Slightly better market conditions and easing comparisons are expected to improve both underlying growth and profitability in the second half of fiscal 2016. 
Turning to Slide 8. Network Power underlying sales were down 1% in the quarter. The global demand for data center and telecommunications infrastructure improved during the quarter. Telecommunications power systems had particularly strong growth in North America. Segment margin improved 490 basis points to 8.1%, mainly benefiting from restructuring actions. New product programs and the segment's global repositioning strategy are starting to flow through to both sales and profitability. Improving order trends for both data center and telecommunications investment will drive positive third quarter sales growth and improved margins. 
Turning to Slide 9. Climate Technologies underlying sales increased 2%, driven by the U.S. residential and commercial air-conditioning business, which was up 10%. Europe reflected strong growth across the region. The refrigeration business was up high single digits. Segment margin increased 170 basis points primarily due to significant savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Favorable air-conditioning and refrigeration end markets should continue to support improvement in underlying growth through the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Slide 10. Underlying sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment increased 2%. Favorable conditions in U.S. construction markets, particularly residential, were supportive for growth. The divestiture of the commercial storage business reduced year-over-year sales by 16%, but had a positive impact on segment margin, which improved 380 basis points to 23.2%. Favorable trends in U.S. residential construction are expected to continue, supporting the outlook for modest levels of underlying growth and margin improvement in the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Slide 11. While the global economic environment for Emerson businesses will continue to be challenging, demand has begun to stabilize or improve in certain markets. Comparisons in the second half of the year also become easier due to the significant decline in underlying sales during fiscal 2015. As we've indicated, order trends remain in line with expectations and therefore continue to support our assumptions that 2016 underlying sales will be down 2% to 5%, excluding negative currency translation of 1% and a 2% deduction from completed divestitures. 
Underlying sales in the third quarter are expected to be approximately flat to the prior year. We also reaffirm our guidance that adjusted earnings per share will be $3.05 to $3.25, excluding $250 million to $300 million of separation costs related to the company's portfolio repositioning. Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter are anticipated to be flat to the prior year or approximately $0.85, excluding $145 million of separation costs. 
And now I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr."

Thank you very much for joining us today. I appreciate your time. And as you could see, fundamentally, this was a very solid quarter, and I want to thank the entire global organization relative to execution around the significant restructuring starting last year and continue to run through this year. And the results are starting to flow through, as they did for the last 3 quarters. 
Core profitability has now begun to improve, and we're exhibiting strong cash flow and very good performance. And again, I want to thank the global Emerson organization out there for doing some very difficult heavy lifting in a very challenging marketplace. 
As we talked about it, since November, I've been talking about fixed-rate orders. We're going to reach our goal by April. I'm not quite sure yet, but it's -- as we've looked at the order pace for the last several months, step by step by step, with October being the bottom, we've seen continued improvement. Last month's 3-month roll, we basically saw at around negative 4%. We do not know what the April ending numbers will be, which we report -- we're talking about reporting around the May Electrical Products Group meeting. But right now, my gut tells me we'd seen some weaker North America oil and gas spending in the short cycle, and clearly, we're seeing very weak spending around the backup power-generator marketplace, which, as we see, it's running at an 11-year low. But we might be close, and we'll know when we get it all in. But it might be May, but we haven't given up on April yet. And I know I can tell you this one, we're going to be close enough that my 14-month old Zorro might be able to jump that rope and get there. But I do know there's been some weakening in the North America oil and gas spending route in the alternate route, for sure. 
The overall performance this quarter relative to the operations was very good in a very challenging marketplace. And you think about the balance sheet, the cash flow, the earnings, setting up for us what we believe is a very important milestone, again, in the third quarter, with hopefully, underlying sales getting close to 0 and our earnings per share being flat with improved margins. Again, very important milestones as we quickly work through the process. And operations have done a lot of heavy lifting here, and the restructuring is really starting to pay off. 
From my perspective right now, as I look at the global marketplace, I just came back from Europe. Europe -- our Western European business had continued to improve. I finally see good -- some good momentum there. No, the economy is not going to be robust there, but they clearly are making investments. They're making strategic investments. They have some exports. And so underlying, we see our European business being a benefit and a positive versus what it was a couple of months ago. I see the U.S., the U.S. economy, in particular on the industrial segment, has continued to be challenging in certain segments. I would say even weaker within the U.S. marketplace. The rest of the world basically is trending along the lines that we've been talking about for the last 2 or 3, 4 quarters, including what we talked about at our analyst meeting in February. So not a whole lot of change as I see it. The plus is coming from Europe. The minus is coming from the U.S. 
Network Power business orders continue to be improving and positive, and we expect Network Power to have positive growth in the third quarter, the top line, and positive growth in earnings. We expect the Commercial & Residential Solutions efforts is continuing to be positive, and we also expect our Climate Technology business to do reasonably well. But one market they're struggling with right now is China residential. The rest of the world, they're progressing, doing extremely well. And obviously, you could see some of the profitability coming through in some of these businesses as they've got the restructuring done in the second half of last year and the early part of this year. 
From a restructuring standpoint, we're going to be around this -- Frank, I think we're talking about $60 million to $80 million -- $70 million, $80 million. We are looking at areas right now where we've seen weaknesses where we'll ramp up a little bit more restructuring, but we have this pretty well in focus as we look at this year. We're also starting to look at opportunities as we've now formed the 2 strategic businesses underneath 2 leaders of Mike Train and Bob Sharp. And we're looking at programs that will institute coming forward into '17 and '18 to, I would say, create a more best-cost, structural, global organization and manufacturing process and opportunities that we can then look at taking more cost out both for profitability, but also to increase investments and for growth in some of the technologies and innovations area. So overall, I'm pleased with the opportunities there and look forward to continuing to figure out how we can generate higher levels of profitability in the 2 core businesses that will remain as we finish the repositioning. 
Relative to the repositioning, as we reviewed with the board last night and again this morning, we're making progress. The Network Power program both is on the table at this point in time. We're looking at either a sale or a spin; both are viable at this point in time. And the board, along with inputs from the management team, are getting closer and closer to making that final decision, and we will be making that final decision. We have filed initial spin documents, which you have to do, and we'll continue to refine those documents based on inputs from the SEC. And -- but from our standpoint right now, both options of what we're going to do to the business to create value for our shareholders and for value for us as a company going forward, are still on the table and are still actively being worked. And it is not a problem. I know people like to speculate and people like to aggravate, but this is a process that's well underway and well and focused and well in line with what we expected. 
Relative to Leroy-Somer CT, Control Techniques, again we have a lot of viable global potential buyers of these assets, and that process is well underway. And even despite the tougher marketplace we see in that market we're selling, we still have a good, good opportunity there to sell these businesses for, what I would say, a respectable price and exit that and take that money and reinvest it back into Emerson, in the 2 core businesses that we're going to maintain. 
We also reviewed today significant acquisition opportunities with the board. One thing good about the world today and the struggle relative to a lot of companies, there are unique acquisition opportunities out there both from a technology standpoint, from the commercial and residential standpoint and also from the automation solution standpoint. So we are looking for opportunities to reinvest the proceeds, and the objective is to take that money and reinvest it back into the core businesses and eventually get back into the $20-plus billion corporation, but a much more focused and selective and profitable business. As we talked about in February, when we come out of this transition, we will be a more profitable business, we'll be more focused business and we'll be a more -- very much focused on doing significant acquisitions around these 2 businesses and once again regaining the size, right, as big as a corporate relative to what we need to do on a global basis. 
So i like where we sit today. We're pivoting from significant restructuring to getting closer to growth in new orders, significant growth in improved profitability and pivoting towards this completion of the repositioning of the 2 core businesses we're trying to get out and positioning ourself towards making additional acquisitions. And a great progress along those lines. 
No more specific details than I just gave you. So you can ask, and I will say, ""No comment."" But that's the flavor we are right now, and good discussion with the board for a lengthy term last night and again today relative to that. 
But again, as we wrap up here and open up for questions, again very, very good execution by the operating folks from Frank and his team and Ed Purvis and Ed Monser and then all the business leaders out there. I truly appreciate the -- they're really working us hard in trying to create a higher level of profitability and high level of cash flow for us to have the opportunity to reinvest and grow this company again. 
So with that, I open the mic for questions."

It did give us a chance to really have a better package to go out and sell in a more focused approach with the organization and also, clearly, the comps got a little bit easier. But the most important thing here is the work that Scott Barbour and his team did over the last couple of years in getting their team focused around the different channels, the different products, the different solutions. And now I think that that focus and that cost structure we've put in place really are allowing these guys to compete and win. And it's a global thing. And so that is very good to see. So we have a long way to go with that business, but it's nice to have it helping and carrying a load right now. So that's where it -- that's what's really going on."

A spin is one that you can have -- assuming what -- we don't know what the FTC will do from an input standpoint. But our focus right now, if we go to this side, we go to route of spin, it will be towards the end of the fiscal year, if not, just right after the fiscal year. If we have to sell it and have to go through a review process, it could be a couple of months longer. But right now, we still look at some time in the September-October -- end of September, October, November time frame for that based on the way we go, but that's the time frame we're looking at that there, Scott. On Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques, again, it really depends. There's a sale process. If we have to go with an international person, relative -- a potential strategic buyer there, it will take, I think, from a review standpoint, both from the various governments around the world, longer. Both the U.S. government and the European government, there's a substantial position for Leroy-Somer CT in France. So I think that's going to definitely be most likely by the time it's completed in the fourth calendar quarter. But most -- what -- you'll hear from us sometime most likely this quarter or end of this quarter, early next fourth quarter, you'll hear which way we're going. You'll hear from us, sale or spin."

Relative to North America and particularly U.S., it's primarily just the day-to-day type of spending that you see on the oil projects, not really big project-specific. It's all around the day-to-day type of what we call the MRO type of -- this normal type of spend, where capital budgets definitely have been curtailed by most oil and gas guys or companies within the North America, both in Canada and the United States. And so they're continuing to tighten those belts up, and we're seeing that business, in that day-to-day business, given our strength in this marketplace, which has been hurting us more on the -- what I'd call the shorter-cycle type of products and the big -- the project business is not -- we haven't seen anything there, it's just been more the more day-to-day type of situation.

And they're basically, at this point of time, seeing very weak end-market demand in our customers, and so our guys are continue to ratchet back down. We're getting to a point right now after -- to the pace it's getting low enough, but it's kind of ugly from the standpoint there's not much volume going on. But that's where we are at this point in time in a very -- I mean, depths of the cycle and it's just it took another notch down the last couple of months, and I think we're getting really close.

The third quarter, it looks to us like it's going to probably back around $70 million because now we're starting to get -- we start to get some comparisons from last year. And then -- yes, and then in the fourth quarter what happens here is we're seeing a bounce back up again, probably to over $100 million because the expense is going to be down. So the delta there is going to help us a little bit. So that's how the numbers look right now, and we just had a very good quarter here. I would expect us to have another decent quarter in the third quarter, and then we'll get a big pot because there'll be less spending from versus last year, which we had a big pickup. So the savings are starting to flow through along those lines. Next year, now I would say based on just the core businesses left, let's say that we were executing the sale or the spin or whatever of the businesses, you look at the Process business and you look at the Commercial & Residential business left, and just the day-to-day restructuring, those numbers are going to drop significantly because of what's going on. And then what -- and so when I say significantly, we're going to be under $50 million. I mean, I haven't seen the number yet, but I got to believe it's going to be under $50 million. And then what's going to happen though is Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann are looking at opportunities across the Commercial & Residential Solutions business that we are going to start executing on as we get into '17. So they are all of a sudden, that we don't have a number yet, but we're going to start taking that number up, where that $50 million may become -- might go up $25 million, $30 million, $40 million as we look at a 2-year program to rightsize and restructure and reposition the Commercial & Residential on a global basis to make it really best cost location, best cost structure and allow us to take some of that profitability to the P&L and also to help us invest for growth. So there're some unique opportunities now that we've put these businesses together. And that will happen as we get into '17. But next year, restructuring, Mike tells me in the core bases, we'll be down significantly. A long-winded answer for probably what you didn't want to hear. But that's it."

So we've been shifting some of the resources down from the large down to the medium, go after those smaller projects. From a growth to market share, yes, I still feel that we're going to end up -- we'll come out of this cycle ahead. As we did the last cycle, I think Emerson will come out ahead and we'll be a stronger player in the Process Management, industrial marketplace around this space here when the cycle comes out from overall participation. On the day-to-day stuff, that's staying more driven by the corporate world of CEOs being very cautious, worried about cash flow, being the same thing I'm doing. If you look at Emerson, if you look at our capital spend in the first half of the year, we're down significantly from last year. I don't think I'm any different from any other CEO out there. And I think that CEOs right now are being very, very cautious relative to spending. And particularly, given they keep seeing weakness emerging in the industrial space. So I think that market -- that part's going to be pretty, pretty challenging here for the next 6 months until CEOs feel, ""Okay, I can let go a little bit of money, more money and reinvest back into the company."" That's how I see it at this point in time."

We are very focused on our capital spend right now on productivity, quality improvement and trying to get the cost down. But a lot of people are still trying to evaluate where they want to take their businesses. So I think there's been an underinvestment. And hopefully, we'll see it come back up in the old productivity and improving your efficiency and operations in North America. I'm a little bit disappointed to watch corporate America cutting too far in that area. But that's where they are right now. And I can't push and shove any more to make them do it.

We're seeing that spending going on. If I look at the order pace in Europe, I look at the order pace in Asia, that trend is turning the right way. So that's why we felt pretty good. The one surprise we had is this -- is the last couple of months. We've seen the U.S. spending rate come back down again, which bothers us and that's what's created probably this delay by 1 month relative to April -- the April target, which may have -- I don't know yet for sure, but just intuition tells me where we were at negative 4%, that should have been closer to negative 2%. So it's this -- what's going on right now, this thing, this is climbing up a little bit slower and we're having people be a little more cautious in spending and -- but on the power side, people are having to spend money for the new regulations come into play. They've underinvested for a while. They have some plants they've got to take offline. And so we're seeing people spend money on trying to move towards gas.

And we -- you have to do it at a very measured pace. That's one of the issues right there. And so it's a plan that you try to get it done within 12 months; sometimes it takes 14 months. A European process for restructuring is one that you want to do very carefully to get it done without major disruption and major problems with your workforce. So a lot of it is around that European situation. North America's a little bit easier. And that's pretty straightforward. But we have some restructuring underway in Europe that we are well planned out. And we might miss a month or 2 here as we push around. So that's what's going on at this point in time. The other thing we're doing at this point in time is also is they are getting the restructuring done. And they're actually getting it done at a little lower cost. They're getting the profits. They're getting it done, which is nice to see. If you do it with a measured pace, you actually get it done at a better cost structure and get the work done and the cost is less. But still think we're going to be doing around this $60 million, $70 million this year. And again, as I said, we're looking at somewhat in the process industrial area right now. There's some more incremental things we need to do to be properly staged -- positioned as we go into, I would say, a challenging first half of '17 at this point in time."

When you make an investment and you have oil and gas pumping and you got that capital spent, you just don't turn it off. Typically, you let it run and try to make some cash out of it. And even though you're not making as much as you thought, you're still trying to get that payback. So I think that's what we're going through right now. We're still squeezing it out. And I think that there could be a bump in the road here down, and -- but fundamentally, I think the trend line is back up a little bit towards the $50 mark."

Today's call will summarize Emerson's third quarter 2016 results and also provide an update on Emerson's business transformation. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website at emerson.com. 
A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. 
I will start with the third quarter summary, as shown on Page 2 of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 7% versus the prior year to $5.1 billion with underlying sales down 5%. The third quarter results reflected the continuation of challenging demand conditions in our key served markets. Oil and gas spending, both capital investment and operational expenditures, remains at significantly depressed levels. Automation markets in North America have been extremely challenging as anticipated improvements in spending did not materialize as we had forecast. Data center and telecommunications infrastructure demand continue to be favorable while global air conditioning and refrigeration in U.S. construction markets were mixed. The trailing 3-month orders for June were down 6.7% on a GAAP basis with underlying trends down 4.4%, excluding approximately 2% per currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes $37 million of separation cost, decreased 5% to $0.80. 
Reported earnings per share were $0.74. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $718 million. 
Turning to Slide 3. Despite lower-than-expected sales, EBIT margin increased 20 basis points versus the prior year, driven by benefits from restructuring actions and solid operational execution with our businesses. No additional, shares were repurchased during the quarter and separation costs were significantly lower than expected. 
Turning to Slide 4. Underlying sales decreased in all regions except Europe. The results by region were similar to the second quarter as the global environment for business investment remains challenging. 
Turning to Slide 5. Total segment margin was up 50 basis points to 16% as 3 segments reported improved margins. Both the Climate Technology and Commercial & Residential Solutions segments reported up margins despite lower volumes. And improved cost structure resulted in operating cash flows of $718 million in the quarter. Capital spending continues to be reduced, in line with overall business conditions. 
Turning to Slide 6. Process Management underlying sales decreased 13% in the quarter. Energy spending, particularly in North America, continues to be reduced -- continue to be reduced as customers evaluate the stability of current oil and gas prices, while power and life sciences markets continue to provide growth. 
Restructuring programs will be further increased in response to weak demand conditions from global oil and gas customers and the expectation that weaker conditions will continue into 2017. 
Segment margin decreased 290 basis points primarily due to a sharp volume reduction and the resulting deleverage, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions.
Turning to Slide 7. Industrial Automation third quarter underlying sales declined 11%, reflecting continued [indiscernible] in industrial spending in upstream oil and gas capital investments while wind projects remained favorable for the drives business. Segment margin decreased 110 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage and price, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Mix demand forecasts among the businesses are expected to result in improved levels of sales and profitability in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 8. Network Power underling sales increased 10% in the quarter as strong order trends in both data center and telecommunications infrastructure markets translated into positive growth. Sales increased in all regions except Europe, which reflected a difficult comparison to the prior year from large project revenues. 
Segment margin improved 550 basis points to 9.1%, driven by volume leverage in savings from restructuring actions. Benefits from restructuring actions and new product program support the expectation for continued margin improvement in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. Climate Technologies underlying sales decreased 1% in the quarter as decreases in Asia and the Middle East more than offset increases in other regions. Underlying sales growth in North America and Europe reflected low single-digit growth in both the air conditioning and commercial refrigeration businesses. Segment margin increased 270 basis points to 22.4%, primarily due to savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment, partially offset by lower pricing. The near-term outlook for global demand in our served markets supports the expectation for modest sales growth in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 10. Underlying sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment decreased 1% as growth in food waste disposers was offset by declines in all other businesses, which were impacted by customer-driven inventory reduction. Segment margin improved 380 basis points to 24.4%, reflecting the impact of the divestiture, savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Modest levels of underlying growth are expected in the fourth quarter as we anticipate favorable conditions in U.S. construction to continue and channel inventory reduction should be complete.
Turning to Slide 11. Earlier today, we announced agreement to sell our Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses for a combined value $5.2 billion, which is in line with the guidance we provided at our February investor conference. These agreements represent a significant step forward in the overall portfolio repositioning strategy we announced last year in June. And with these agreements now in place, the strategic repositioning squarely focuses on acquisitions within our core platforms of automation solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions as Emerson management and the board determine how to best to redeploy the cash proceeds from these divestitures.
Turning to Slide 12. The third quarter results continue to reflect the low growth global environment facing our businesses today. And the outlook remains challenging as markets will continue to be impacted by reduced levels of investment spending, weaker global economics and political uncertainty. Considering these conditions, coupled with the fact that anticipated improvement in order trends did not materialize, the company now expects fiscal year underlying sales to be down 5% to 6%, excluding currency translation and an impact from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. Adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year are now expected to be $2.90 to $3, excluding $200 million to $250 million of separation costs and a fourth quarter loss of approximately $100 million related to the agreements to sell Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques. 
I will now turn the presentation over to Cathy to talk about our business transformation."

I'm positive you're all anxious to hear from Dave, so we'll try to use you're incredibly valuable time with great care and sensitivity.

I'm positive you're all anxious to hear from Dave, so we'll try to use you're incredibly valuable time with great care and sensitivity. It is clear to me that I'm merely the warm-up band, and you're eager to get to the main act. 
Today, we're going to briefly discuss how we plan our market expertise to better redefine our great company, to accelerate change, drive growth and imagine a different future. I believe you've already witness some tangible efforts of this this morning. 
Go to Page 2. Although today is about moving your view beyond our financial pie charts, this particular one holds all the excitement about our new possibilities. This demonstrates how we are adapting to a new reality, utilizing our already industry leadership position in adjacent markets and driving our single source end-to-end solutions. 
Go to Page 3. This is not revolutionary for an already well-managed and financially strong company. We're on our 126th-year-old journey of complexity reduction and perpetual integration of our businesses. We're driving efficiencies through a tighter brand, which should deliver more collaboration and more customer focus, resulting in more integrated solutions innovations between our businesses. We are therefore more capable of cross-leveraging our remaining portfolio and making it easier for all to navigate our business. 
Slide 4. So we need to accelerate past our previous transformations, evolving our business and our messaging from doing many things to concentrating our efforts on the critical challenges facing our customers specifically process, industrial, commercial and residential markets. For automation solutions, this means being the most trusted partner and problem solver for our customers during the current business crisis for them. This also becomes a showcase for our Internet of Things initiatives as we built on our legacy of long-term success of network intelligence in the field, our groundbreaking point in technology and our unmatched wireless heritage. For our commercial and residential business, we can focus on the [indiscernible] criticality of human comfort, connected homes, food quality, advancing energy efficiency at home and work as well as sustainability. 
Slide 5. As conglomerates have fallen out of favor, we quickly transitioned to a more highly focused enterprise. The best example of this has been through emerson.com debuting on October 1. But all of our communications, both internal and outside, will reflect and promote our new positioning. Talent acquisition migrates from fragmented business units to an Emerson career-centric approach. Our social media has historically been product brand-focused. And now we're trying to expose our deep industry expertise and to humanize our brand. Finally, advertising, which previously portrayed as a wide and deep, now can support 2 major businesses and their own deep special expertise. 
Slide 6. So a great example of this was our truly unexpected foundational sponsorship which is you probably know as the Davos meeting of the oil and gas industry. As we were developing our new Emerson automation solutions positioning, this seemed like a great opportunity to dramatically demonstrate our leadership position in the industry and launch our unique and desperately needed approach for the oil and gas businesses facing a crucial moment in their troubled marketplace. Top quartile solutions were a breakthrough approach for a vulnerable industry, and we try to optimize our moment in the sun. 
Slide 7. We poured exceptional effort and assets into the Houston-based event with full immersion media and social media training for all the Emerson executives. As we drove a full frontal media approach to Citi venue and with all the participants. The extraordinary results are the positive outcome of tightly choreographed messaging strategy as well as very well prepared executives. This is Emerson at its best applying full energy in singular focus. 
Slide 8. For Emerson's newly combined Commercial & Residential Solutions business, the opening of our new Helix Innovation Center in Dayton offered a similarly tightly-focused media and promotional event. It was designed to showcase the advantages mostly aligned with these businesses. Innovation Center clearly demonstrates our unique research capabilities around energy efficiency, connected homes and businesses in a real-time simulated environment. This miraculously includes a fully built-in IKEA-furnished house, a commercial kitchen which serves the entire Dayton campus of catering and convenience store. This all exists under a single roof and allows for monitoring and research under an exceptional array of climate environments and variable conditions. 
Slide 9. From a marketing viewpoint, the opening of the Helix allowed for wildly focused media event. We continued our highly publicized STEM support initiative with a survey on the issues of STEM education. For you financial guys, STEM is the acronym for science, technology, engineering and math. We again tapped Internet science superstar, Hank Green, and the backdrop of our innovation center on the University of Dayton campus. It was media magic. We showcased our engineering initiatives and allowed Hank to do a storytelling sorcery to millions of network viewers, social media networkers and even thousands of potential investors. This was astonishingly successful for a B2B initiative where media interest was stoked by the authentic connected story of STEM careers, sustainable research, a science geek in a real university setting. This is not just another product launch event. 
Slide 10. As we all know, digital access and transparency has changed all of our business lives forever. We also know that an extraordinary amount of research and private exploration goes on long before salesman is invited to the party. Your website is the window to your company's soul and undoubtedly has the ability to expose one's capability to better explain as well as execute one's business. Most multibillion-dollar companies cannot unify and face the challenge of reconstituting their digital presence. The unique inflection point of today's divestitures had swung open an opportunity to begin again. We've been working for 12 months on Phase 1 of our new web presence to launch single taxonomy, single product catalog, single technology approach, resulting in mobile always, all-glass responsive design. This will result in a cleaner, portable, searchable new emerson.com. It will take us 2 more years to complete the technology transition. Keep, kill, edit invent. We had over 700,000 pages in our previous environment, but we will be, at the very least, a more nimble, unified player. This is the one thing I believe our competitors did not expect from us and would fear the most, a better [indiscernible] integrated Emerson. 
Slide 11. So Dave has generously allowed me to give you a 3.5-minute quick tour of the emerson.com prototype. This is giving you all a sneak preview into our Phase 1 of the new site. I think you will find it as a new vision of a streamlined, tightly focused sales, exemplifying enduring strength and adaptability change as we rise to the new challenge. 
Here with me, as we thought it was technically safer to videotape the prototypes as it is a little jumpy, and we didn't want to take you out of the webcast, here is emerson.com. Please roll the video.

breadth of our industries and humanize our brands. 
As we move to About Us, we see we introduce our visitors to our transformation story. This describes how we plan to increase value to both our customers and shareholders with our tight focus on 2 major business segments. Our realignment is about accelerated cultural change inside, customer joy outside and value creation for all. As we wind our visitors down the page, they will encounter a new Social Responsibility Report, access to our educational I Love STEM page and an extensive -- a much more extensive Join our Team Careers section. I'm also very proud of our more extensive social channel at YouTube. We are ready to connect. 
Finally, we head to our investors' happy home. Our Investors page is meant to be a familiar but improved user experience for all of you.

Our world-famous signature brands are still prominent and easily searchable so every customer can still reach each SKU by bookmark, new easy search and relatable discovery. 
The Emerson Commercial & Residential Solutions business introduces us to the unified concept of optimized performance for connected buildings with energy control. All our products and services form the basis of many cohesive growth opportunities based on connected equipment, home and business monitoring, energy-efficient improvements and infrastructure support. World-class signature brands like Rigid, Sensi and InSinkErator form the basis for scalable solutions and are the bedrock of this B2B business in our only B2C Empire. 
As I introduced earlier, the Helix is a metaphor for commercial and residential businesses. Our 5 simulated environments are almost impossible to appreciate from a distance as the building offers us the ability to control the external environment, think winter in Alaska, summer in Dubai, in order to measure the energy efficiency of the home or business inside. Our innovation center is the realized laboratory, so Emerson's most impressive sustainable innovations like InSinkErator sprang to energy, food waste initiatives to Sensi, Wi-Fi thermostats and groundbreaking compressor health controls. 
So thanks -- thank you very much for your time and attention. And I will hand it back to Dave Farr."

I wanted to -- the shareholders to understand, the investors to understand where we're trying to take the company going forward. A lot of work will be undertaken here the next 60 days as we get ready to launch. It's very important for our employees and our customers to understand what we're trying to do with Emerson and reposition the company into these 2 core business units. 
Clearly, a little over a year ago, we announced our repositioning efforts. We announced that we were going to sell or spin Network Power and sell the Leroy-Somer CT business. Today, we're very excited to announce that we found 2 strong partners to buy these respected businesses. Platinum buying the Network Power business, and a great solution for this business and one that we are excited about for platinum, the management team. And long term, meaning potentially us, given that we will have some potential upside if they're successful with our 15% equity ownership down the road. Also, a strong Japanese company that we've known for a long time, I know the Chairman for years buying our Leroy-Somer CT business and managing that business going forward. Again, a great solution for these 2 businesses with a good outcome for Emerson with over $5 billion of investment value for Emerson and our shareholders and for allowing us to reposition the company. We will have one more transaction in 2017. If you remember, we talked about selling ClosetMaid. We said we'd do that in '17. In total, we do somewhere between $5 billion and $6 billion in proceeds. And so we're well within what we expected back in February. 
So we look forward to closing these 2 transactions before the end of the calendar year and moving forward as the new Emerson and trying to drive a stronger valuable proposition for customers and for our shareholders. 
Now the third quarter. Yes, it was a tough quarter, a very tough quarter. June was a very challenging industrial marketplace for us, especially around process. Given the recent announcements of the GDP numbers, it shouldn't surprise any of us. The numbers announced last week from business investment for the last 9 months were negative and declining. Restatements for the last couple of years made it worse. So we're facing a very tough environment. And we saw that very quickly in the month of June as our process transactional business really slowed down as our customers continued to protect cash flow and their investments to make sure they have the cash needed to run the businesses or pay dividends or whatever they're doing. But clearly, a very challenging environment, but an environment where our team across Emerson knows what to do. And we're acting on it very aggressively and making sure we keep our costs in line, making sure we do the right things internally to protect the key investments but also keep our costs in line to allow us to generate the profits, the cash and the returns we expect at this company. 
In total, profitability for the third quarter was pretty good. We generate operating margins flat with last year at 17.4%. In case you didn't figure that out, 17.4%. We're down underlying sales of over 4%. Cash flow was very strong in the quarter. We're strong in cash flow for the first 9 months. We will continue to generate the cash flow to run the company, to invest and pay money back to our shareholders and do what we need to do. But we have to face the reality of what we see today. It's a tough market. We did see a bounce back in July in our process orders, which is a good sign. But in reality, we are looking at the marketplace right now where people are being very cautious, they're being very careful where they're spending money on and they're very uncertain relative to what's going on around the world from a political standpoint relative to this a business environment standpoint and where things are heading. So we're staying very focused on trying to drive the necessary actions to protect the short-term profitability, at the same time, staying very focused on making the right relevant long-term investments to drive the necessary change that we'll see in this business, this industry, when we come out. We will come out. This industry will come out. But clearly, a challenging marketplace right now and one that we fully understand that we have to deal with. And we will deal with it. 
Now let's think on the positive side of this. We had many people out there doubted that Emerson could take the transaction and the repositioning and get the job done. But the team within corporate, the team within Network Power, the team within LSCT and external partners did a lot of work the last 12 months and came up with very strong proposition both for our shareholders and for the buyers of these actions and also remaining assets that are being bought. Very pleased with the work there. Not easy to do in a marketplace, by the way, which is quite challenging. So my hats off to the entire team around the world for making this happen. I also want to thank the team for landing a tough quarter, a quarter that was a lot tougher than we started out thinking about it. And in reality, it ended up being very challenging, but we got the job done and delivered pretty good levels of profitability and levels of cash flow. No, it was not what we expected, but still very good in the environment we're seeing. 
From the perspective of the board and the senior management team, we're very focused on the future of the company. We have been repositioning the company, and we continue to reposition the company. It is a very solid company when we get down to the 2 businesses that will remain at the end of the calendar year. And we're very much focused on making the necessary investments internally and through strategic acquisitions to build upon these 2 businesses to once again return to over $20 billion in sales, profitable sales and profitable returns. The opportunities are there, and we're working on those. Yes, it's a tough environment, but there's no problem within Emerson. We deal with a tough environment. That's what we do. It's our DNA. Clearly, would I like to have a better time? Yes. But that's not what we're faced today. We're facing reality. We're very much focused on driving a stronger company, a more profitable company, a faster-growing company and remain an industry leader in the 2 key business units, business segments that will have when we finish. A tough quarter. Fourth quarter is going to be tough, too. Wasn't that long ago I thought that maybe we'd actually have flat or up sales in the fourth quarter. That's not going to happen. So we're going to have to deal with that. And from our perspective, as we continue the restructuring and get ready for a challenging 2017, it will be more favorable coming through a very difficult last 18 months, but still a challenging environment for us, but we are well positioned and will continue to be well positioned to drive levels of profitability that will generate great cash flow and returns. And over time, we'll continue to return to a growth mode that we know we have inside Emerson. 
So yes, I look back at the third quarter, a tough one, but we've got a lot done. Within 12 months from the announcement of the concept of our repositioning and selling our Network Power business, LSCT, we did it. We got it announced. We're looking at how we reorganize on the company to drive longer-term value, very good. The game is still on. The hard work is still happening. And I want to thank the entire management team globally working so hard here the last 12 months in this quarter to deliver what we need to deliver to continue to move Emerson forward to remain relevant and an industry leader in the space as we serve today and will continue to serve going forward in 2017 and beyond. 
With that, I open the floor for questions or comments. Thank you."

So we expect -- we'll be closer to $90 million global restructuring at fourth quarter. Clearly, you have timings and when things get pushed and shoved. But we're going to a continue the restructuring there in the fourth quarter, Then also in the first half for process automation. It looks to us that looks to me right now the process automation from the profitability standpoint are going down into the operating level -- probably around the high 17, low 18 EBIT margins obviously lower of restructuring. And they'll bounce back in that 20 level, but will not bounce back in '17 based on what we see right now. I just don't see the growth coming in the process will drive that leverage back up. A mode right now of trying to protect and minimize the downfall and profitability. And so what we're looking at right now probably from profitability is somewhere between 200, 250 basis points, I would say, deterioration and profitability at the operating level line of the process business for 2016. And that will stabilize that as we get into that -- into '17."

But -- so the early days with understanding how to create that. One of things Bob is coming from the process world and understanding that. So I'm expecting him to create a more of a solutions type of environment around this and to deleverage the core assets, leading assets we have in that space. So -- but it's going to be smaller sensing solution software type of acquisition and companies you [indiscernible] probably never even heard of or thought of, to be honest."

First of all, thank you very much for recognizing the sale. Appreciate that. As I've been communicating for over a year on our -- the sort of our utilization of cash flow going forward, yes, the dividends is important -- important to us, to us, but to our shareholders we have our perspective we are right right now, with the shrinking of the company down to say around $15 billion [ph] and the cash flow is coming down along those lines, we will be [indiscernible] our dividend as to discuss the board that's for the next couple of years. The goal is obviously to grow the company both organically and through acquisitions to rebuild the cash flow based that we're losing from the divestitures. But right now, as you think about our company, you think about our free cash -- about our free cash flow next year and let's say we take the dividend up marginally a little bit like we did this year. Our dividend coverage, our cash flow -- free cash flow to dividend coverage is going to around the mid 60% level. And -- so our goal is to figure out how to keep that -- peak in that mid-60s, maybe higher 60s, and then move it back down in the range of 40% to 50%. As I've told the shareholders, however, let's say that we're not able to find significant strategic acquisition. We're in -- we're not able to get the growth necessary to get back up to the side of the earnings and cash flow base that we had just a couple of years ago. And then we will, as a board, we'll have to consider to cut the dividend. That is not where we sit right now. Right now, we have the capability and funding internally and doing the dividend and will dial back the share repurchase. And this year, we end up to around $600 million share repurchase. Next year, we'll probably be somewhere in the $100 million to $200 million range, just basically covering what -- and any stock that we're putting out there for employees and -- but will dial that back. The intention of the board, as we've discussed a lot over the last 12 months, the use of proceeds that we -- in our balance sheet, to go out and to continue to aggressively and make investments within the 2 core spaces maintaining or keeping the company.

And that's in -- and so that's what I see right now. Until I see our customer base willing to invest more for productivity, invest for next-generation capacity or whatever it takes, it's going to be a tough environment. So I don't see that. On the commercial residential. We do see underlying growth, and we do see a little bit of improvement in profitability. Next year, the focus of that business will be the integration of some of the various businesses. As we've talked about streamlining and creating a very strong global integrated business. And so that's what that focus is going to be. So next year, I would say that business will be -- we'll have a positive underlying growth.

I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Katherine Button Bell, Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. 
Today's call will summarize Emerson's third quarter 2016 results and also provide an update on Emerson's business transformation. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website at emerson.com. 
A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. 
I will start with the third quarter summary as shown on Page 2 of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 7% versus the prior year to $5.1 billion, with underlying sales down 5%. The third quarter results reflected the continuation and challenging demand conditions in our key served markets. Oil and gas spending, both capital investment and operational expenditures, remains at significantly depressed levels. Automation markets in North America have been extremely challenging, as anticipated improvements in spending did not materialize as we had it forecast. Data center and telecommunications infrastructure demand continued to be favorable while global air conditioning and refrigeration and U.S. construction markets were mixed. The trailing 3-month orders for June were down 6.7% on a GAAP basis with underlying trends down 4.4%, excluding approximately 2% per currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes $37 million of separation cost, decreased 5% to $0.80. 
Reported earnings per share were $0.74. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $718 million. 
Turning to Slide 3. Despite lower-than-expected sales, EBIT margin increased 20 basis points versus the prior year, driven by benefits from restructuring actions and solid operational execution with our businesses. No additional shares were repurchased during the quarter, and separation costs were significantly lower than expected. 
Turning to Slide 4. Underlying sales decreased in all regions except Europe. The results by region were similar to the second quarter as the global environment for business investment remains challenging. 
Turning to Slide 5. Total segment margin was up 50 basis points to 16% as 3 segments reported improved margins. Both the Climate Technology and Commercial & Residential Solutions segments reported up margins despite lower volumes. And improved cost structure resulted in operating cash flow of $718 million in the quarter. Capital spending continues to be reduced, in line with overall business conditions. 
Turning to Slide 6. Process Management underlying sales decreased 13% in the quarter. Energy spending, particularly in North America, continues to be reduced -- continued to be reduced as customers evaluate the stability of current oil and gas prices, while power and life sciences markets continue to provide growth. 
Restructuring programs will be further increased in response to weak demand conditions from global oil and gas customers and the expectation that weaker conditions will continue into 2017. 
Segment margin decreased 290 basis points primarily due to a sharp volume reduction and the resulting deleverage, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions.
Turning to Slide 7. Industrial Automation third quarter underlying sales declined 11%, reflecting continued weakness in industrial spending and upstream oil and gas capital investments, while wind projects remained favorable for the drives business. Segment margin decreased 110 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage and price, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Mix demand forecasts among the businesses are expected to result in improved levels of sales and profitability in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 8. Network Power underling sales increased 10% in the quarter as strong order trends in both data center and telecommunications infrastructure markets translated into positive growth. Sales increased in all regions except Europe, which reflected a difficult comparison to the prior year from large project revenues. 
Segment margin improved 550 basis points to 9.1%, driven by volume leverage in savings from restructuring actions. Benefits from restructuring actions and new product program support the expectation for continued margin improvement in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. Climate Technologies underlying sales decreased 1% in the quarter as decreases in Asia and the Middle East more than offset increases in other regions. Underlying sales growth in North America and Europe reflected low single-digit growth in both the air conditioning and commercial refrigeration businesses. Segment margin increased 270 basis points to 22.4% primarily due to savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment, partially offset by lower pricing. The near-term outlook for global demand in our served markets supports the expectation for modest sales growth in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 10. Underlying sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment decreased 1% as growth in food waste disposers was offset by declines in all other businesses, which were impacted by customer-driven inventory reduction. Segment margin improved 380 basis points to 24.4%, reflecting the impact of the divestiture, savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Modest levels of underlying growth are expected in the fourth quarter as we anticipate favorable conditions in U.S. construction to continue and channel inventory reduction should be complete.
Turning to Slide 11. Earlier today, we announced agreements to sell our Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses for a combined value of $5.2 billion, which is in line with the guidance we provided at our February investor conference. These agreements represent a significant step forward in the overall portfolio repositioning strategy we announced last year in June. And with these agreements now in place, the strategic repositioning squarely focuses on acquisitions within our core platforms of Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions as Emerson management and the board determine how best to redeploy the cash proceeds from these divestitures.
Turning to Slide 12. The third quarter results continue to reflect the low growth global environment facing our businesses today. And the outlook remains challenging as markets will continue to be impacted by reduced levels of investment spending, weaker global economics and political uncertainty. Considering these conditions, coupled with the fact that anticipated improvement in order trends did not materialize, the company now expects fiscal year underlying sales to be down 5% to 6%, excluding currency translation and an impact from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. Adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year are now expected to be $2.90 to $3, excluding $200 million to $250 million of separation costs and a fourth quarter loss of approximately $100 million related to the agreements to sell Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques. 
I will now turn the presentation over to Kathy to talk about our business transformation."

I'm positive you're all anxious to hear from Dave, so I will try to use your incredibly valuable time with great care and sensitivity. It is clear to me that I'm merely the warm-up band, and you're eager to get the main act. 
Today, we're going to briefly discuss how we are planning our market expertise to better redefine our great company, to accelerate change, drive growth and imagine a different future. I believe you've already witnessed some tangible efforts of this, this morning. 
Go to Page 2. Although today is about moving your view beyond our financial pie charts, this particular one holds all the excitement about our new possibilities. This demonstrates how we are adapting to a new reality, utilizing our already industry leadership positions in adjacent markets and driving our single source, end-to-end solution.
Go to Page 3. This is not revolutionary for an already well-managed and financially strong company. We're on our 126-year-old journey of complexity reduction and perpetual integration of our businesses. We're driving efficiencies through a tighter brand, which should deliver more collaboration and more customer focus, resulting in more integrated solutions innovation between our businesses. We are therefore more capable of cross-leveraging our remaining portfolio and making it easier for all to navigate our business. 
Slide 4. So we need to accelerate past our previous transformations, evolving our business and our messaging from doing many things to concentrating our efforts on the critical challenges facing our customers, specifically in the process, industrial, commercial and residential markets. For Automation Solutions, this means being the most trusted partner and problem-solver for our customers during the current business crisis for them. This also becomes a showcase for our Internet of Things initiatives as we build on our legacy of long-term success of network intelligence in the field, we are groundbreaking PlantWeb technology and are unmatched wireless heritage. For our Commercial & Residential business, we can focus on the criticality of human comfort, connected homes, food quality and advancing energy efficiency at home and work as well as sustainability. 
Slide 5. As conglomerates have fallen out of favor, we've quickly transitioned to a more highly focused enterprise. The best example of this has been the new emerson.com debuting on October 1. But all of our communications, both internal and outside, will reflect and promote our new positioning. Talent acquisition migrates from fragmented business units to an Emerson career-centric approach. Our social media has historically been product brand-focused, and now we're trying to expose our deep industry expertise and to humanize our brand. 
Finally, advertising, which previously portrayed us as wide and deep, now can support 2 major businesses and their own deep special expertise. 
Slide 6. So a great example of this was our truly unexpected foundational sponsorship of CERAWeek, which is you probably know as the Davos meeting of the oil and gas industry. As we were developing our new Emerson Automation Solutions positioning, this seemed like a great opportunity to dramatically demonstrate our leadership position in the industry and launch our unique and desperately needed approach for the oil and gas businesses facing a crucial moment in their troubled marketplace. Top quartile solutions were a breakthrough approach for a vulnerable industry, and we tried to optimize our moment in the sun. 
Slide 7. We poured exceptional effort in assets in the Houston-based event with full immersion media and social media training for all the Emerson executives, as we drove a full frontal media approach at the Citi venue and with all the participants. The extraordinary results were the positive outcome of tightly choreographed messaging strategy as well as very well prepared executives. This is Emerson at its best applying full energy in singular focus. 
Slide 8. For Emerson's newly combined Commercial & Residential Solutions business, the opening of our new Helix Innovation Center in Dayton offered a similarly tightly-focused media and promotional event. It was designed to showcase the advantages mostly aligned in these businesses. Innovation Center clearly demonstrates our unique research capabilities around energy efficiency, connected homes and businesses in a real-time simulated environment. This miraculously includes a fully built-in IKEA-furnished house, a commercial kitchen which serves the entire Dayton campus of catering and a convenience store. This all exists under a single roof and allows for monitoring and research under an exceptional array of climate environments and variable conditions. 
Slide 9. From a marketing viewpoint, like CERAWeek, the opening of the Helix allowed for a widely focused media event. We continued our highly publicized STEM support initiative with a survey on the issues of STEM education. For you financial guys, STEM is the acronym for science, technology, engineering and math. We again tapped Internet science superstar, Hank Green, in the backdrop of our innovation center on the University of Dayton campus. It was media magic. We showcased our engineering initiatives and allowed Hank to do a storytelling sorcery to millions of network viewers, social media networkers and even thousands of potential investors. This was astonishingly successful for a B2B initiative where media interest was stoked by the authentic connected story of STEM careers, sustainable research, a science geek and a real university setting. This is not just another product launch event. 
Slide 10. As we all know, digital access and transparency has changed all of our business lives forever. We also know that an extraordinary amount of research and private exploration goes on long before salesman is invited to the party. Your website is the window to your company's soul, and undoubtedly has the ability to expose one's capability to better explain as well as execute one's business. Most multibillion-dollar companies cannot unify and face the challenge of reconstituting their digital presence. The unique inflection point of today's divestitures have swung open an opportunity to begin again. We've been working for 12 months on Phase 1 of our new web presence to launch single taxonomy, single product catalog, single technology approach, resulting in mobile-always all-glass responsive design. This will result in a cleaner, portable, searchable new emerson.com. It will take us 2 more years to complete the technology transition, keep, kill, edit invent. We had over 700,000 pages in our previous environment, but we will be, at the very least, a more nimble, unified player. This is the one thing I believe our competitors would not expect from us and would fear the most, a better, more fully integrated Emerson.
Slide 11. So Dave has generously allowed me to give you a 3.5-minute quick tour of the emerson.com prototype. This is giving you all a sneak preview into our Phase 1 of the new site. I think you will find it as a new vision of our streamlined, tightly focused sales, exemplifying enduring strength and adaptability to change as we rise to the new challenge. 
Here with me, as we thought it was technically safer to videotape the prototypes as it is a little jumpy, and we didn't want to take you out of the webcast, here is emerson.com. Please roll the video.
[Presentation]
Here they go. Okay. The front page is dedicated to introducing our clean design, inviting customers to explore, career seekers to learn and investors to fall in love all over again. It is meant to be a showcase of our great stories and a window to our values. The new site is an exceptional initiative to burst our silence and unify our businesses. In usability resource, our customers said it was usable [indiscernible] and that the images highlight the breadth of our industries and humanize our brand.
As we move to About Us, you'll see we introduced our visitors to our transformation story. This describes how we plan to increase value to both our customers and shareholders with our tight focus on 2 major business segments. Our realignment is about accelerated cultural change inside, customer joy outside and value creation for all. As we wind our visitors down the page, they will encounter a new Social Responsibility Report, access to our educational, I Love STEM, page and extensive -- or much more extensive Join our Team Careers section. I'm also very proud of our more extensive social channels [indiscernible]. You'll see from YouTube -- Twitter to YouTube, we are ready to connect. 
Finally, we head to our investors' happy home. Our Investors page is meant to be a familiar, but improved user experience for all of you. Rollover resources, back year annual reports, profiles and SEC filings are at your mouse tip. Finally, an up-to-the-minute mergers and acquisition updates section will be available, but not currently available in our 30-day-old prototype. 
Emerson Automation Solutions is the doorway to our ever-bonding offering in the industry and process industries. We immediately discussed capital projects, operational effeciency and tour our Internet of things offering on a global scale of a level. We -- our site is founded on an industry-centric approach allowing us to better explain our end-to-end solutions with an industry view.
Our world-famous signature brands are still prominent and easily searchable so every customer can still reach each SKU by bookmark, new easy search and relatable discovery. 
The Emerson Commercial & Residential Solutions business introduces us to the unified concept of optimized performance for connected buildings with energy control. All our products and services form the basis for many cohesive growth opportunities based on connected equipment, home and business monitoring, energy-efficient improvement and infrastructure support. World-class signature brands like Rigid, Sensi and InSinkErator form the basis for scalable solutions and are the bedrock of this B2B business in our only B2C Empire. 
As I introduced earlier, the Helix is the metaphor for Commercial & Residential businesses. Our 5 simulated environments are almost impossible to appreciate from a distance as the building offers us the ability to control the external environment, think winter in Alaska, summer in Dubai, in order to measure the energy efficiency of the home or business inside. Our innovation center has been a terrific real-life laboratory, so the Emerson's most impressive sustainable innovations like InSinkErator [indiscernible] to energy, food waste initiatives to Sensi, Wi-Fi thermostats and groundbreaking compressor health controls. 
So thanks -- thank you very much for your time and attention. And I will hand it back to Dave Farr."

I wanted to -- the shareholders to understand, the investors to understand where we're trying to take the company going forward. A lot of work will be undertaken here the next 60 days as we get ready to launch. It's very important for our employees and our customers to understand what we're trying to do with Emerson and reposition the company into these 2 core business units. 
Clearly, a little over a year ago, we announced our repositioning efforts. We announced that we were going to sell or spin Network Power and sell the Leroy-Somer CT business. Today, we're very excited to announce that we found 2 strong partners to buy these respected businesses. Platinum buying the Network Power business, and a great solution for this business and one that we are excited about for Platinum, the management team, and long term, even potentially us, given that we will have some potential upside if they're successful with our 15% equity ownership down the road. Also, Nidec, a strong Japanese company that we've known for a long time, I know the Chairman for years, is buying our Leroy-Somer CT business and managing that business going forward. Again, a great solution for these 2 businesses with a good outcome for Emerson with over $5 billion of investment value for Emerson and our shareholders and for allowing us to reposition the company. We will have one more transaction in 2017. If you remember, we talked about selling ClosetMaid, and we said we'd do that in '17. In total, we do somewhere between $5 billion and $6 billion in proceeds. And so we're well within what we expected back in February. 
So we look forward to closing these 2 transactions before the end of the calendar year and moving forward as the new Emerson and trying to drive a stronger valuable proposition for our customers and for our shareholders. 
Now the third quarter. Yes, it was a tough quarter, a very tough quarter. June was a very challenging industrial marketplace for us, especially on process. Given the recent announcements of the GDP numbers, it shouldn't surprise any of us. The numbers announced last week from business investment for the last 9 months were negative and declining. Restatements for the last couple of years made it worse. So we're facing a very tough environment. And we saw that very quickly in the month of June as our process transactional business really slowed down as our customers continued to protect cash flow and their investments to make sure they have the cash needed to run the businesses or pay dividends or whatever they're doing. Clearly, a very challenging environment, but an environment where our team across Emerson knows what to do. And we're acting on it very aggressively and making sure we keep our costs in line, making sure we do the right things internally to protect the key investments, but also keep our costs in line to allow us to generate the profits, the cash and the returns we expect at this company. 
In total, profitability for the third quarter was pretty good. We generate operating margins flat with last year at 17.4%. In case you didn't figure that out, 17.4%. We're down underlying sales of over 4%. Cash flow was very strong in the quarter. We're strong in cash flow for the first 9 months. We will continue to generate the cash flow to run the company, to invest and pay money back to our shareholders and do what we need to do. But we have to face the reality of what we see today. It's a tough market. We did see a bounce back in July in our process orders, which is a good sign. But in reality, we are looking at a marketplace right now where people are being very cautious, they're being very careful what they're spending money on, and they're very uncertain relative to what's going on around the world from a political standpoint relative to there's a [indiscernible] business environment standpoint and where things are heading. So we're staying very focused on trying to drive the necessary actions to protect the short-term profitability. At the same time, staying very focused on making the right relevant long-term investments to drive the necessary change that we'll see in this business, this industry, when we come out. We will come out. This industry will come out. But clearly, a challenging marketplace right now and one that we fully understand that we have to deal with. And we will deal with it. 
Now let's think on the positive side of this. We had many people out there doubted that Emerson could take the transaction, the repositioning and get the job done. But the team within corporate, the team within Network Power, the team within LSCT and our external partners did a lot of work the last 12 months and came up with very strong proposition both for our shareholders and for the buyers of these actions and also remaining assets that are being bought. Very pleased with the work there. Not easy to do in a marketplace, by the way, which is quite challenging. So my hats off to the entire team around the world for making this happen. I also want to thank the team for landing a tough quarter, a quarter that was a lot tougher than we started out thinking about it. And in reality, it ended up being very challenging, but we got the job done and delivered pretty good levels of profitability and levels of cash flow. No, it was not what we expected, but still very good in the environment we're seeing. 
From the perspective of the board and the senior management team, we're very focused on the future of the company. We have been repositioning the company, and we continue to reposition the company. It is a very solid company when we get down to the 2 businesses that will remain at the end of the calendar year. And we're very much focused on making the necessary investments internally and through our strategic acquisitions to build upon these 2 businesses to once again return to over $20 billion in sales, profitable sales and profitable returns. The opportunities are there, and we're working on those. Yes, it's a tough environment, but there's no problem within Emerson. We deal with tough environments, that's what we do, it's our DNA. Clearly, would I like to have a better time? Yes. But that's not what we faced today. So we're facing reality. We're very much focused on driving a stronger company, a more profitable company, a faster-growing company and remain an industry leader in the 2 key business units -- business segments that will have when we finish. A tough quarter. Fourth quarter is going to be tough, too. Wasn't that long ago I thought that maybe we'd actually have flat or up sales in the fourth quarter, that's not going to happen. So we're going to have to deal with that. And from our perspective, as we continue restructuring and get ready for a challenging 2017, it will be more favorable coming through a very difficult last 18 months, but still a challenging environment for us. But we are well positioned and will continue to be well positioned to drive levels of profitability that would generate great cash flow and returns. And over time, we'll continue to return to a growth mode that we know when inside Emerson. 
So yes, I look back at the third quarter, a tough one, but we've got a lot done. Within 12 months from the announcement of the concept of our repositioning and selling our Network Power business, LSCT, we did it. We got it announced. We're looking at how reorganized on the company to drive longer-term value, very good. The game is still on. The hard work is still happening. And I want to thank the entire management team globally working so hard here the last 12 months and in this quarter to deliver what we need to deliver to continue to move Emerson forward to remain relevant and an industry leader in the space as we serve today and will continue to serve going forward in 2017 and beyond. 
With that, I open the floor for questions or comments. Thank you."

And from our -- we have a lot of restructuring underway in process. A lot of things have been announced and will be starting to book or started to book already. So as we expect, it will be close to the $90 million global restructuring in that fourth quarter. Clearly, you have timings when things get pushed and shoved, but we're going to continue the restructuring there in the fourth quarter, but also in the first half for process automation. It looks to me right now the process automation from a profitability standpoint are going to be going down into the operating level, probably around the high 17, low 18 EBIT margins, obviously lower because of restructuring. And they'll bounce back in to that 20 level, but will not bounce back in '17 based on what we see right now. I do start to see the growth coming in the process will drive that leverage back up. So we are in the mode [ph] right now, we're trying to protect and minimize the downfall and profitability. And so what we're looking at right now probably from profitability is somewhere between 200, 250 basis points, I would say, deterioration and profitability at the operating level line of the process business for 2016. And that we'll stabilize that as we get into that -- into '17."

But right now, Process is such a big piece. It's down at a level that we have not seen the lift to pull us up. So that's where we see it right now.

But right now, as you think about our company, you think about our free cash -- let's think about our free cash flow next year, and let's say we take the dividend up marginally a little bit like we did this year. Our dividend coverage, our cash flow -- the free cash flow to dividend coverage is going to go around the mid 60% level. And -- so our goal is to figure out how to keep that -- peak at that mid-60s, maybe higher 60s, and then move it back down in the range of 40% to 50%. As I've told the shareholders, however, let's say that we're not able to find significant strategic acquisitions. We're in -- we're not able to get the growth necessary to get back up to the size of the earnings and cash flow base that we had just a couple of years ago. Then we will, as a board, we'll have to consider, do we cut the dividend? But that is not where we sit right now. Right now, we have the capability, both in funding internally and doing the dividend, and will dial back the share repurchase. And this year, we are going to end up around $600 million of share repurchase. Next year, we'll probably be somewhere in the $100 million and $200 million range, just basic covering what -- any stock that we're putting out there for employees and -- but we'll dial that back. The intention of the board, as we've discussed a lot over the last 12 months, the use of proceeds that work in our balance sheet, to go out and to continue do aggressively, and make investments within the 2 core spaces we're maintaining or keeping the company. And that's where our focus is going to be."

And that's in -- and so that's what I see right now. Until I see our customer base willing to invest more for productivity, invest for next-generation capacity or whatever it takes, then it's going to be a tough environment. So I don't see that. On the commercial residential, we do see underlying growth, and we do see a little bit of improvement in profitability. Next year, the focus of that business will be the integration of some of the various businesses. As we've talked about streamlining and creating a very strong global, integrated business. And so that's where that focus is going to be. So next year, I would say that business will be -- we'll have a positive underlying growth.

I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Katherine Button Bell, Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. 
Today's call will summarize Emerson's third quarter 2016 results and also provide an update on Emerson's business transformation. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website at emerson.com. 
A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. 
I will start with the third quarter summary as shown on Page 2 of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 7% versus the prior year to $5.1 billion, with underlying sales down 5%. The third quarter results reflected the continuation and challenging demand conditions in our key served markets. Oil and gas spending, both capital investment and operational expenditures, remains at significantly depressed levels. Automation markets in North America have been extremely challenging, as anticipated improvements in spending did not materialize as we had forecast. Data center and telecommunications infrastructure demand continued to be favorable while global air conditioning and refrigeration and U.S. construction markets were mixed. The trailing 3-month orders for June were down 6.7% on a GAAP basis with underlying trends down 4.4%, excluding approximately 2% per currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes $37 million of separation cost, decreased 5% to $0.80. 
Reported earnings per share were $0.74. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $718 million. 
Turning to Slide 3. Despite lower-than-expected sales, EBIT margin increased 20 basis points versus the prior year, driven by benefits from restructuring actions and solid operational execution within our businesses. No additional shares were repurchased during the quarter, and separation costs were significantly lower than expected. 
Turning to Slide 4. Underlying sales decreased in all regions except Europe. The results by region were similar to the second quarter as the global environment for business investment remains challenging. 
Turning to Slide 5. Total segment margin was up 50 basis points to 16% as 3 segments reported improved margins. Both the Climate Technology and Commercial & Residential Solutions segments reported up margins despite lower volumes. And improved cost structure resulted in operating cash flow of $718 million in the quarter. Capital spending continues to be reduced, in line with overall business conditions. 
Turning to Slide 6. Process Management underlying sales decreased 13% in the quarter. Energy spending, particularly in North America, continues to be reduced -- continued to be reduced as customers evaluate the stability of current oil and gas prices, while power and life sciences markets continue to provide growth. 
Restructuring programs will be further increased in response to weak demand conditions from global oil and gas customers and the expectation that weaker conditions will continue into 2017. 
Segment margin decreased 290 basis points primarily due to a sharp volume reduction and the resulting deleverage, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions.
Turning to Slide 7. Industrial Automation third quarter underlying sales declined 11%, reflecting continued weakness in industrial spending and upstream oil and gas capital investments, while wind projects remained favorable for the drives business. Segment margin decreased 110 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage and price, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Mix demand forecasts among the businesses are expected to result in improved levels of sales and profitability in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 8. Network Power underlying sales increased 10% in the quarter as strong order trends in both data center and telecommunications infrastructure markets translated into positive growth. Sales increased in all regions except Europe, which reflected a difficult comparison to the prior year from large project revenues. 
Segment margin improved 550 basis points to 9.1%, driven by volume leverage in savings from restructuring actions. Benefits from restructuring actions and new product program support the expectation for continued margin improvement in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. Climate Technologies underlying sales decreased 1% in the quarter as decreases in Asia and the Middle East more than offset increases in other regions. Underlying sales growth in North America and Europe reflected low single-digit growth in both the air conditioning and commercial refrigeration businesses. Segment margin increased 270 basis points to 22.4% primarily due to savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment, partially offset by lower pricing. The near-term outlook for global demand in our served markets supports the expectation for modest sales growth in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 10. Underlying sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment decreased 1% as growth in food waste disposers was offset by declines in all other businesses, which were impacted by customer-driven inventory reduction. Segment margin improved 380 basis points to 24.4%, reflecting the impact of the divestiture, savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Modest levels of underlying growth are expected in the fourth quarter as we anticipate favorable conditions in U.S. construction to continue and channel inventory reduction should be complete.
Turning to Slide 11. Earlier today, we announced agreements to sell our Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses for a combined value of $5.2 billion, which is in line with the guidance we provided at our February investor conference. These agreements represent a significant step forward in the overall portfolio repositioning strategy we announced last year in June. And with these agreements now in place, the strategic repositioning squarely focuses on acquisitions within our core platforms of Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions as Emerson management and the board determine how best to redeploy the cash proceeds from these divestitures.
Turning to Slide 12. The third quarter results continue to reflect the low growth global environment facing our businesses today. And the outlook remains challenging as markets will continue to be impacted by reduced levels of investment spending, weaker global economics and political uncertainty. Considering these conditions, coupled with the fact that anticipated improvement in order trends did not materialize, the company now expects fiscal year underlying sales to be down 5% to 6%, excluding currency translation and an impact from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. Adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year are now expected to be $2.90 to $3, excluding $200 million to $250 million of separation costs and a fourth quarter loss of approximately $100 million related to the agreements to sell Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques. 
I will now turn the presentation over to Kathy to talk about our business transformation."

I'm positive you're all anxious to hear from Dave, so I will try to use your incredibly valuable time with great care and sensitivity. It is clear to me that I'm merely the warm-up band, and you're eager to get the main act. 
Today, we're going to briefly discuss how we are planning our market expertise to better redefine our great company, to accelerate change, drive growth and imagine a different future. I believe you've already witnessed some highly tangible efforts of this, this morning. 
Go to Page 2. Although today is about moving your view beyond our financial pie charts, this particular one holds all the excitement about our new possibilities. This demonstrates how we are adapting to a new reality, utilizing our already industry leadership positions in adjacent markets and driving our single source, end-to-end solution.
Go to Page 3. This is not revolutionary for an already well-managed and financially strong company. We're on a 126-year-old journey of complexity reduction and perpetual integration of our businesses. We're driving efficiencies through a tighter brand, which should deliver more collaboration and more customer focus, resulting in more integrated solutions innovation between our businesses. We are therefore more capable of cross-leveraging our remaining portfolio and making it easier for all to navigate our business. 
Slide 4. So we need to accelerate past our previous transformations, evolving our business and our messaging from doing many things to concentrating our efforts on the critical challenges facing our customers, specifically in the process, industrial, commercial and residential markets. For Automation Solutions, this means being the most trusted partner and problem-solver for our customers during the current business crisis for them. This also becomes a showcase for our Internet of Things initiatives as we build on our legacy of long-term success of networked intelligence in the field via our groundbreaking PlantWeb technology and our unmatched wireless heritage. For our Commercial & Residential business, we can focus on the criticality of human comfort, connected homes, food quality and advancing energy efficiency at home and work as well as sustainability. 
Slide 5. As conglomerates have fallen out of favor, we've quickly transitioned to a more highly focused enterprise. The best example of this has been the new emerson.com debuting on October 1. But all of our communications, both internal and outside, will reflect and promote our new positioning. Talent acquisition migrates from fragmented business units to an Emerson career-centric approach. Our social media has historically been product brand-focused, and now we're trying to expose our deep industry expertise and to humanize our brand. 
Finally, advertising, which previously portrayed us as wide and deep, now can support 2 major businesses and their own deep special expertise. 
Slide 6. So a great example of this was our truly unexpected foundational sponsorship of CERAWeek, which is you probably know as the Davos meeting of the oil and gas industry. As we were developing our new Emerson Automation Solutions positioning, this seemed like a great opportunity to dramatically demonstrate our leadership position in the industry and launch our unique and desperately needed approach for the oil and gas businesses facing a crucial moment in their troubled marketplace. Top quartile solutions were a breakthrough approach for a vulnerable industry, and we tried to optimize our moment in the sun. 
Slide 7. We poured exceptional effort in assets into the Houston-based event with full immersion media and social media training for all the Emerson executives, as we drove a full frontal media approach at the city, venue and with all the participants. The extraordinary results were the positive outcome of tightly choreographed messaging strategy as well as very well prepared executives. This is Emerson at its best applying full energy in singular focus. 
Slide 8. For Emerson's newly combined Commercial & Residential Solutions business, the opening of our new Helix Innovation Center in Dayton offered a similarly tightly focused media and promotional event. It was designed to showcase the advantages mostly aligned in these businesses. Innovation Center clearly demonstrates our unique research capabilities around energy efficiency, connected homes and businesses in a real-time simulated environment. This miraculously includes a fully built-in IKEA-furnished house, a commercial kitchen which serves the entire Dayton campus of catering and a convenience store. This all exists under a single roof and allows for monitoring and research under an exceptional array of climate environments and variable conditions. 
Slide 9. From a marketing viewpoint, like CERAWeek, the opening of the Helix allowed for a widely focused media event. We continued our highly publicized STEM support initiative with a survey on the issues of STEM education. For you financial guys, STEM is the acronym for science, technology, engineering and math. We again tapped Internet science superstar Hank Green in the backdrop of our innovation center on the University of Dayton campus. It was media magic. We showcased our engineering initiatives and allowed Hank to do his storytelling sorcery to millions of network viewers, social media networkers and even thousands of potential investors. This was astonishingly successful for a B2B initiative where media interest was stoked by the authentic connected story of STEM careers, sustainable research, a science geek and a real university setting. This was not just another product launch event. 
Slide 10. As we all know, digital access and transparency has changed all of our business lives forever. We also know that an extraordinary amount of research and private exploration goes on long before a salesman is invited to the party. Your website is the window to your company's soul, and undoubtedly has the ability to expose one's capability to better explain as well as execute one's business. Most multibillion-dollar companies cannot unify and face the challenge of reconstituting their digital presence. The unique inflection point of today's divestitures have swung open an opportunity to begin again. We've been working for 12 months on Phase 1 of our new web presence to launch single taxonomy, single product catalog, single technology approach, resulting in mobile-always all-glass responsive design. This will result in a cleaner, portable, searchable new emerson.com. It will take us 2 more years to complete the technology transition, keep, kill, edit, invent. We had over 700,000 pages in our previous environment, but we will be, at the very least, a more nimble, unified player. This is the one thing I believe our competitors would not expect from us and would fear the most: a better, more fully integrated Emerson.
Slide 11. So Dave has generously allowed me to give you a 3.5-minute quick tour of the emerson.com prototype. This is giving you all a sneak preview into our Phase 1 of the new site. I think you will find it as a new vision of our streamlined, tightly focused selves, exemplifying enduring strength and adaptability to change as we rise to the new challenge. 
Here with me, as we thought it was technically safer to videotape the prototypes as it is a little jumpy, and we didn't want to take you out of the webcast, here is emerson.com. Please roll the video.
[Presentation]
Here they go. Okay. The front page is dedicated to introducing our clean design, inviting customers to explore, career seekers to learn and investors to fall in love all over again. It is meant to be a showcase of our great stories and a window to our values. The new site is an exceptional initiative to bust our silos and unify our businesses. In usability research, our customers said it was usable [indiscernible] and visually appealing, and that the images highlight the breadth of our industries and humanize our brand.
As we move to About Us, you'll see we introduced our visitors to our transformation story. This describes how we plan to increase value to both our customers and shareholders with our tight focus on 2 major business segments. Our realignment is about accelerated cultural change inside, customer joy outside and value creation for all. As we wind our visitors down the page, they will encounter our new Social Responsibility Report, access to our educational I Love STEM page and extensive -- or much more extensive Join our Team Careers section. I'm also very proud of our more extensive social channels selector. You'll see from YouTube -- Twitter to YouTube, we are ready to connect. 
Finally, we head to our investors' happy home. Our Investors page is meant to be a familiar, but improved user experience for all of you. Rollover resources, back year annual reports, profiles and SEC filings are at your mouse tip. Finally, an up-to-the-minute mergers and acquisition updates section will be available, but not currently available in our 30-day-old prototype. 
Emerson Automation Solutions is the doorway to our ever-broadening offering in the industry and process industries. We immediately discuss capital projects, operational efficiency and tour our Internet of things offering on a global scale of a level. We -- our site is founded on an industry-centric approach allowing us to better explain our end-to-end solutions with an industry view.
Our world-famous signature brands are still prominent and easily searchable so every customer can still reach each SKU by bookmark, new easy search and relatable discovery. 
The Emerson Commercial & Residential Solutions business introduces us to the unified concept of optimized performance for connected buildings with energy control. All our products and services form the basis for many cohesive growth opportunities based on connected equipment, home and business monitoring, energy-efficient improvement and infrastructure support. World-class signature brands like Rigid, Sensi and InSinkErator form the basis for scalable solutions and are the bedrock of this B2B business and our only B2C Empire. 
As I introduced earlier, the Helix is the metaphor for Commercial & Residential businesses. Our 5 simulated environments are almost impossible to appreciate from a distance as the building offers us the ability to control the external environment -- think winter in Alaska, summer in Dubai -- in order to measure the energy efficiency of the home or business inside. Our innovation center has been a terrific real-life laboratory, so the Emerson's most impressive sustainable innovations like InSinkErator [indiscernible] energy food waste initiatives to Sensi Wi-Fi thermostats and groundbreaking compressor health controls. 
So thanks -- thank you very much for your time and attention. And I will hand it back to Dave Farr."

I wanted to -- the shareholders to understand, the investors to understand where we're trying to take the company going forward. A lot of work will be undertaken here the next 60 days as we get ready to launch. It's very important for our employees and our customers to understand what we're trying to do with Emerson and reposition the company into these 2 core business units. 
Clearly, a little over a year ago, we announced our repositioning efforts. We announced that we were going to sell or spin Network Power and sell the Leroy-Somer CT business. Today, we're very excited to announce that we found 2 strong partners to buy these respected businesses. Platinum buying the Network Power business, and a great solution for this business and one that we are excited about for Platinum, the management team, and long term, even potentially us, given that we will have some potential upside if they're successful with our 15% equity ownership down the road. Also, Nidec, a strong Japanese company that we've known for a long time, I’ve known the Chairman for years, is buying our Leroy-Somer CT business and managing that business going forward. Again, a great solution for these 2 businesses with a good outcome for Emerson with over $5 billion of investment value for Emerson and our shareholders and for allowing us to reposition the company. We will have one more transaction in 2017. If you remember, we talked about selling ClosetMaid, and we said we'd do that in '17. In total, we’d do somewhere between $5 billion and $6 billion in proceeds. And so we're well within what we expected back in February. 
So we look forward to closing these 2 transactions before the end of the calendar year and moving forward as the new Emerson and trying to drive a stronger valuable proposition for our customers and for our shareholders. 
Now the third quarter. Yes, it was a tough quarter, a very tough quarter. June was a very challenging industrial marketplace for us, especially on process. Given the recent announcements of the GDP numbers, it shouldn't surprise any of us. The numbers announced last week from business investment for the last 9 months were negative and declining. Restatements for the last couple of years made it worse. So we're facing a very tough environment. And we saw that very quickly in the month of June as our process transactional business really slowed down as our customers continued to protect cash flow and their investments to make sure they have the cash needed to run the businesses or pay dividends or whatever they're doing. Clearly, a very challenging environment, but an environment where our team across Emerson knows what to do. And we're acting on it very aggressively and making sure we keep our costs in line, making sure we do the right things internally to protect the key investments, but also keep our costs in line to allow us to generate the profits, the cash and the returns we expect at this company. 
In total, profitability for the third quarter was pretty good. We generate operating margins flat with last year at 17.4% -- in case you didn't figure that out, 17.4%, with down underlying sales of over 4%. Cash flow was very strong in the quarter. We're strong in cash flow for the first 9 months. We will continue to generate the cash flow to run the company, to invest and pay money back to our shareholders and do what we need to do. But we have to face the reality of what we see today. It's a tough market. We did see a bounce back in July in our process orders, which is a good sign. But in reality, we are looking at a marketplace right now where people are being very cautious, they're being very careful what they're spending money on, and they're very uncertain relative to what's going on around the world from a political standpoint relative to just a business environment standpoint and where things are heading. So we're staying very focused on trying to drive the necessary actions to protect the short-term profitability. At the same time, staying very focused on making the right relevant long-term investments to drive the necessary change that we'll see in this business, this industry, when we come out. We will come out. This industry will come out. But clearly, a challenging marketplace right now and one that we fully understand that we have to deal with. And we will deal with it. 
Now let's think on the positive side of this. We had many people out there doubted that Emerson could take the transaction, the repositioning and get the job done. But the team within corporate, the team within Network Power, the team within LSCT and our external partners did a lot of work the last 12 months and came up with very strong proposition both for our shareholders and for the buyers of these actions and also remaining assets that are being bought. Very pleased with the work there. Not easy to do in a marketplace, by the way, which is quite challenging. So my hats off to the entire team around the world for making this happen. I also want to thank the team for landing a tough quarter, a quarter that was a lot tougher than we started out thinking about it. And in reality, it ended up being very challenging, but we got the job done and delivered pretty good levels of profitability and levels of cash flow. No, it was not what we expected, but still very good in the environment we're seeing. 
From the perspective of the board and the senior management team, we're very focused on the future of the company. We have been repositioning the company, and we continue to reposition the company. It is a very solid company when we get down to the 2 businesses that will remain at the end of the calendar year. And we're very much focused on making the necessary investments internally and through our strategic acquisitions to build upon these 2 businesses to once again return to over $20 billion in sales, profitable sales and profitable returns. The opportunities are there, and we're working on those. Yes, it's a tough environment, but there's no problem within Emerson. We deal with tough environments, that's what we do, it's our DNA. Clearly, would I like to have a better time? Yes. But that's not what we face today. So we're facing reality. We're very much focused on driving a stronger company, a more profitable company, a faster-growing company and remain an industry leader in the 2 key business units -- business segments that we’ll have when we finish. A tough quarter. Fourth quarter is going to be tough, too. Wasn't that long ago I thought that maybe we'd actually have flat or up sales in the fourth quarter, that's not going to happen. So we're going to have to deal with that. And from our perspective, as we continue to restructure and get ready for a challenging 2017, it will be more favorable coming through a very difficult last 18 months, but still a challenging environment for us. But we are well positioned and we’ll continue to be well positioned to drive levels of profitability that would generate great cash flow and returns. And over time, we'll continue to return to a growth mode that we know when inside Emerson. 
So yes, I look back at the third quarter, a tough one, but we've got a lot done. Within 12 months from the announcement of the concept of repositioning and selling our Network Power business, LSCT, we did it. We got it announced. We're looking at how reorganized on the company to drive longer-term value, very good. The game is still on. The hard work is still happening. And I want to thank the entire management team globally working so hard here the last 12 months and in this quarter to deliver what we need to deliver to continue to move Emerson forward to remain relevant and an industry leader in the spaces we serve today and will continue to serve going forward in 2017 and beyond. 
With that, I open the floor for questions or comments. Thank you."

So as we expect, it will be close to the $90 million global restructuring in that fourth quarter. Clearly, you have timings when things get pushed and shoved, but we're going to continue the restructuring there in the fourth quarter, but also in the first half for process automation. It looks to me right now the process automation from a profitability standpoint are going to be going down into the operating level, probably around the high 17, low 18 EBIT margins, obviously lower because of restructuring. And they'll bounce back into that 20 level, but will not bounce back in '17 based on what we see right now. I do start to see the growth coming in the process will drive that leverage back up. So we are in the mode right now of trying to protect and minimize the downfall in profitability. And so what we're looking at right now probably from profitability is somewhere between 200, 250 basis points, I would say, deterioration in profitability at the operating level line of the process business for 2016. And that we'll stabilize that as we get into that -- into '17."

So I'm expecting him to create a more of a solutions type of environment around this and to leverage the core assets, leading assets we have in that space. So -- but it's going to be smaller sensing solution software type of acquisitions, and companies you probably never even heard of or thought of, to be honest."

First of all, thank you very much for recognizing the sale. I appreciate that. As I've been communicating for over a year on our -- sort of our utilization of cash flow going forward, yes, the dividend's important to us. It’s important not to us per se, but to our shareholders. And from our perspective, where we are right now, with the shrinking of the company down to say around $15 billion, and the cash flow coming down along those lines, we will be protecting our dividend, as we've discussed at the board level, from the next couple of years. The goal is obviously to grow the company both organically and through acquisitions to rebuild the cash flow base that we're losing from the divestitures. But right now, as you think about our company, you think about our free cash -- let's think about our free cash flow next year, and let's say we take the dividend up marginally a little bit like we did this year. Our dividend coverage, our cash flow -- the free cash flow to dividend coverage is going to go around the mid 60% level. And -- so our goal is to figure out how to keep that -- peak at that mid-60s, maybe higher 60s, and then move it back down in the range of 40% to 50%. As I've told the shareholders, however, let's say that we're not able to find significant strategic acquisitions. We're in -- we're not able to get the growth necessary to get back up to the size of the earnings and cash flow base that we had just a couple of years ago. Then we will, as a board, we'll have to consider, do we cut the dividend? But that is not where we sit right now. Right now, we have the capability, both in funding internally and doing the dividend, and we’ll dial back the share repurchase. And this year, we are going to end up around $600 million of share repurchase. Next year, we'll probably be somewhere in the $100 million and $200 million range, just basic covering what -- any stock that we're putting out there for employees and -- but we'll dial that back. The intention of the board, as we've discussed a lot over the last 12 months, the use of proceeds that were in our balance sheet, to go out and to continue to do aggressively, and make investments within the 2 core spaces we're maintaining or keeping the company. And that's where our focus is going to be."

And that's in -- and so that's what I see right now. Until I see our customer base willing to invest more for productivity, invest for next-generation capacity or whatever it takes, then it's going to be a tough environment. So I don't see that. On the commercial residential, we do see underlying growth, and we do see a little bit of improvement in profitability. Next year, the focus of that business will be the integration of some of the various businesses. As we've talked about streamlining and creating a very strong global, integrated business. And so that's where that focus is going to be. So next year, I would say that business will be -- we'll have a positive underlying growth.

I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Katherine Button Bell, Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. 
Today's call will summarize Emerson's third quarter 2016 results and also provide an update on Emerson's business transformation. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website at emerson.com. 
A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. 
I will start with the third quarter summary as shown on Page 2 of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 7% versus the prior year to $5.1 billion, with underlying sales down 5%. The third quarter results reflected the continuation and challenging demand conditions in our key served markets. Oil and gas spending, both capital investment and operational expenditures, remains at significantly depressed levels. Automation markets in North America have been extremely challenging, as anticipated improvements in spending did not materialize as we had forecast. Data center and telecommunications infrastructure demand continued to be favorable while global air conditioning and refrigeration and U.S. construction markets were mixed. The trailing 3-month orders for June were down 6.7% on a GAAP basis with underlying trends down 4.4%, excluding approximately 2% per currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes $37 million of separation cost, decreased 5% to $0.80. 
Reported earnings per share were $0.74. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $718 million. 
Turning to Slide 3. Despite lower-than-expected sales, EBIT margin increased 20 basis points versus the prior year, driven by benefits from restructuring actions and solid operational execution within our businesses. No additional shares were repurchased during the quarter, and separation costs were significantly lower than expected. 
Turning to Slide 4. Underlying sales decreased in all regions except Europe. The results by region were similar to the second quarter as the global environment for business investment remains challenging. 
Turning to Slide 5. Total segment margin was up 50 basis points to 16% as 3 segments reported improved margins. Both the Climate Technology and Commercial & Residential Solutions segments reported up margins despite lower volumes. And improved cost structure resulted in operating cash flow of $718 million in the quarter. Capital spending continues to be reduced, in line with overall business conditions. 
Turning to Slide 6. Process Management underlying sales decreased 13% in the quarter. Energy spending, particularly in North America, continues to be reduced -- continued to be reduced as customers evaluate the stability of current oil and gas prices, while power and life sciences markets continue to provide growth. 
Restructuring programs will be further increased in response to weak demand conditions from global oil and gas customers and the expectation that weaker conditions will continue into 2017. 
Segment margin decreased 290 basis points primarily due to a sharp volume reduction and the resulting deleverage, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions.
Turning to Slide 7. Industrial Automation third quarter underlying sales declined 11%, reflecting continued weakness in industrial spending and upstream oil and gas capital investments, while wind projects remained favorable for the drives business. Segment margin decreased 110 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage and price, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Mix demand forecasts among the businesses are expected to result in improved levels of sales and profitability in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 8. Network Power underlying sales increased 10% in the quarter as strong order trends in both data center and telecommunications infrastructure markets translated into positive growth. Sales increased in all regions except Europe, which reflected a difficult comparison to the prior year from large project revenues. 
Segment margin improved 550 basis points to 9.1%, driven by volume leverage in savings from restructuring actions. Benefits from restructuring actions and new product program support the expectation for continued margin improvement in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. Climate Technologies underlying sales decreased 1% in the quarter as decreases in Asia and the Middle East more than offset increases in other regions. Underlying sales growth in North America and Europe reflected low single-digit growth in both the air conditioning and commercial refrigeration businesses. Segment margin increased 270 basis points to 22.4% primarily due to savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment, partially offset by lower pricing. The near-term outlook for global demand in our served markets supports the expectation for modest sales growth in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 10. Underlying sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment decreased 1% as growth in food waste disposers was offset by declines in all other businesses, which were impacted by customer-driven inventory reduction. Segment margin improved 380 basis points to 24.4%, reflecting the impact of the divestiture, savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Modest levels of underlying growth are expected in the fourth quarter as we anticipate favorable conditions in U.S. construction to continue and channel inventory reduction should be complete.
Turning to Slide 11. Earlier today, we announced agreements to sell our Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses for a combined value of $5.2 billion, which is in line with the guidance we provided at our February investor conference. These agreements represent a significant step forward in the overall portfolio repositioning strategy we announced last year in June. And with these agreements now in place, the strategic repositioning squarely focuses on acquisitions within our core platforms of Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions as Emerson management and the board determine how best to redeploy the cash proceeds from these divestitures.
Turning to Slide 12. The third quarter results continue to reflect the low growth global environment facing our businesses today. And the outlook remains challenging as markets will continue to be impacted by reduced levels of investment spending, weaker global economics and political uncertainty. Considering these conditions, coupled with the fact that anticipated improvement in order trends did not materialize, the company now expects fiscal year underlying sales to be down 5% to 6%, excluding currency translation and an impact from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. Adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year are now expected to be $2.90 to $3, excluding $200 million to $250 million of separation costs and a fourth quarter loss of approximately $100 million related to the agreements to sell Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques. 
I will now turn the presentation over to Kathy to talk about our business transformation."

I'm positive you're all anxious to hear from Dave, so I will try to use your incredibly valuable time with great care and sensitivity.

I'm positive you're all anxious to hear from Dave, so I will try to use your incredibly valuable time with great care and sensitivity. It is clear to me that I'm merely the warm-up band, and you're eager to get the main act. 
Today, we're going to briefly discuss how we are planning our market expertise to better redefine our great company, to accelerate change, drive growth and imagine a different future. I believe you've already witnessed some highly tangible efforts of this, this morning. 
Go to Page 2. Although today is about moving your view beyond our financial pie charts, this particular one holds all the excitement about our new possibilities. This demonstrates how we are adapting to a new reality, utilizing our already industry leadership positions in adjacent markets and driving our single source, end-to-end solution.
Go to Page 3. This is not revolutionary for an already well-managed and financially strong company. We're on a 126-year-old journey of complexity reduction and perpetual integration of our businesses. We're driving efficiencies through a tighter brand, which should deliver more collaboration and more customer focus, resulting in more integrated solutions innovation between our businesses. We are therefore more capable of cross-leveraging our remaining portfolio and making it easier for all to navigate our business. 
Slide 4. So we need to accelerate past our previous transformations, evolving our business and our messaging from doing many things to concentrating our efforts on the critical challenges facing our customers, specifically in the process, industrial, commercial and residential markets. For Automation Solutions, this means being the most trusted partner and problem-solver for our customers during the current business crisis for them. This also becomes a showcase for our Internet of Things initiatives as we build on our legacy of long-term success of networked intelligence in the field via our groundbreaking PlantWeb technology and our unmatched wireless heritage. For our Commercial & Residential business, we can focus on the criticality of human comfort, connected homes, food quality and advancing energy efficiency at home and work as well as sustainability. 
Slide 5. As conglomerates have fallen out of favor, we've quickly transitioned to a more highly focused enterprise. The best example of this has been the new emerson.com debuting on October 1. But all of our communications, both internal and outside, will reflect and promote our new positioning. Talent acquisition migrates from fragmented business units to an Emerson career-centric approach. Our social media has historically been product brand-focused, and now we're trying to expose our deep industry expertise and to humanize our brand. 
Finally, advertising, which previously portrayed us as wide and deep, now can support 2 major businesses and their own deep special expertise. 
Slide 6. So a great example of this was our truly unexpected foundational sponsorship of CERAWeek, which is you probably know as the Davos meeting of the oil and gas industry. As we were developing our new Emerson Automation Solutions positioning, this seemed like a great opportunity to dramatically demonstrate our leadership position in the industry and launch our unique and desperately needed approach for the oil and gas businesses facing a crucial moment in their troubled marketplace. Top quartile solutions were a breakthrough approach for a vulnerable industry, and we tried to optimize our moment in the sun. 
Slide 7. We poured exceptional effort in assets into the Houston-based event with full immersion media and social media training for all the Emerson executives, as we drove a full frontal media approach at the city, venue and with all the participants. The extraordinary results were the positive outcome of tightly choreographed messaging strategy as well as very well prepared executives. This is Emerson at its best applying full energy in singular focus. 
Slide 8. For Emerson's newly combined Commercial & Residential Solutions business, the opening of our new Helix Innovation Center in Dayton offered a similarly tightly focused media and promotional event. It was designed to showcase the advantages mostly aligned in these businesses. Innovation Center clearly demonstrates our unique research capabilities around energy efficiency, connected homes and businesses in a real-time simulated environment. This miraculously includes a fully built-in IKEA-furnished house, a commercial kitchen which serves the entire Dayton campus of catering and a convenience store. This all exists under a single roof and allows for monitoring and research under an exceptional array of climate environments and variable conditions. 
Slide 9. From a marketing viewpoint, like CERAWeek, the opening of the Helix allowed for a widely focused media event. We continued our highly publicized STEM support initiative with a survey on the issues of STEM education. For you financial guys, STEM is the acronym for science, technology, engineering and math. We again tapped Internet science superstar Hank Green in the backdrop of our innovation center on the University of Dayton campus. It was media magic. We showcased our engineering initiatives and allowed Hank to do his storytelling sorcery to millions of network viewers, social media networkers and even thousands of potential investors. This was astonishingly successful for a B2B initiative where media interest was stoked by the authentic connected story of STEM careers, sustainable research, a science geek and a real university setting. This was not just another product launch event. 
Slide 10. As we all know, digital access and transparency has changed all of our business lives forever. We also know that an extraordinary amount of research and private exploration goes on long before a salesman is invited to the party. Your website is the window to your company's soul, and undoubtedly has the ability to expose one's capability to better explain as well as execute one's business. Most multibillion-dollar companies cannot unify and face the challenge of reconstituting their digital presence. The unique inflection point of today's divestitures have swung open an opportunity to begin again. We've been working for 12 months on Phase 1 of our new web presence to launch single taxonomy, single product catalog, single technology approach, resulting in mobile-always all-glass responsive design. This will result in a cleaner, portable, searchable new emerson.com. It will take us 2 more years to complete the technology transition, keep, kill, edit, invent. We had over 700,000 pages in our previous environment, but we will be, at the very least, a more nimble, unified player. This is the one thing I believe our competitors would not expect from us and would fear the most: a better, more fully integrated Emerson.
Slide 11. So Dave has generously allowed me to give you a 3.5-minute quick tour of the emerson.com prototype. This is giving you all a sneak preview into our Phase 1 of the new site. I think you will find it as a new vision of our streamlined, tightly focused selves, exemplifying enduring strength and adaptability to change as we rise to the new challenge. 
Here with me, as we thought it was technically safer to videotape the prototypes as it is a little jumpy, and we didn't want to take you out of the webcast, here is emerson.com. Please roll the video.
[Presentation]
Here they go. Okay. The front page is dedicated to introducing our clean design, inviting customers to explore, career seekers to learn and investors to fall in love all over again. It is meant to be a showcase of our great stories and a window to our values. The new site is an exceptional initiative to bust our silos and unify our businesses. In usability research, our customers said it was usable [indiscernible] and visually appealing, and that the images highlight the breadth of our industries and humanize our brand.
As we move to About Us, you'll see we introduced our visitors to our transformation story. This describes how we plan to increase value to both our customers and shareholders with our tight focus on 2 major business segments. Our realignment is about accelerated cultural change inside, customer joy outside and value creation for all. As we wind our visitors down the page, they will encounter our new Social Responsibility Report, access to our educational I Love STEM page and extensive -- or much more extensive Join our Team Careers section. I'm also very proud of our more extensive social channels selector. You'll see from YouTube -- Twitter to YouTube, we are ready to connect. 
Finally, we head to our investors' happy home. Our Investors page is meant to be a familiar, but improved user experience for all of you. Rollover resources, back year annual reports, profiles and SEC filings are at your mouse tip. Finally, an up-to-the-minute mergers and acquisition updates section will be available, but not currently available in our 30-day-old prototype. 
Emerson Automation Solutions is the doorway to our ever-broadening offering in the industry and process industries. We immediately discuss capital projects, operational efficiency and tour our Internet of things offering on a global scale of a level. We -- our site is founded on an industry-centric approach allowing us to better explain our end-to-end solutions with an industry view.
Our world-famous signature brands are still prominent and easily searchable so every customer can still reach each SKU by bookmark, new easy search and relatable discovery. 
The Emerson Commercial & Residential Solutions business introduces us to the unified concept of optimized performance for connected buildings with energy control. All our products and services form the basis for many cohesive growth opportunities based on connected equipment, home and business monitoring, energy-efficient improvement and infrastructure support. World-class signature brands like Rigid, Sensi and InSinkErator form the basis for scalable solutions and are the bedrock of this B2B business and our only B2C Empire. 
As I introduced earlier, the Helix is the metaphor for Commercial & Residential businesses. Our 5 simulated environments are almost impossible to appreciate from a distance as the building offers us the ability to control the external environment -- think winter in Alaska, summer in Dubai -- in order to measure the energy efficiency of the home or business inside. Our innovation center has been a terrific real-life laboratory, so the Emerson's most impressive sustainable innovations like InSinkErator [indiscernible] energy food waste initiatives to Sensi Wi-Fi thermostats and groundbreaking compressor health controls. 
So thanks -- thank you very much for your time and attention. And I will hand it back to Dave Farr."

I wanted to -- the shareholders to understand, the investors to understand where we're trying to take the company going forward. A lot of work will be undertaken here the next 60 days as we get ready to launch. It's very important for our employees and our customers to understand what we're trying to do with Emerson and reposition the company into these 2 core business units. 
Clearly, a little over a year ago, we announced our repositioning efforts. We announced that we were going to sell or spin Network Power and sell the Leroy-Somer CT business. Today, we're very excited to announce that we found 2 strong partners to buy these respected businesses. Platinum buying the Network Power business, and a great solution for this business and one that we are excited about for Platinum, the management team, and long term, even potentially us, given that we will have some potential upside if they're successful with our 15% equity ownership down the road. Also, Nidec, a strong Japanese company that we've known for a long time, I’ve known the Chairman for years, is buying our Leroy-Somer CT business and managing that business going forward. Again, a great solution for these 2 businesses with a good outcome for Emerson with over $5 billion of investment value for Emerson and our shareholders and for allowing us to reposition the company. We will have one more transaction in 2017. If you remember, we talked about selling ClosetMaid, and we said we'd do that in '17. In total, we’d do somewhere between $5 billion and $6 billion in proceeds. And so we're well within what we expected back in February. 
So we look forward to closing these 2 transactions before the end of the calendar year and moving forward as the new Emerson and trying to drive a stronger valuable proposition for our customers and for our shareholders. 
Now the third quarter. Yes, it was a tough quarter, a very tough quarter. June was a very challenging industrial marketplace for us, especially on process. Given the recent announcements of the GDP numbers, it shouldn't surprise any of us. The numbers announced last week from business investment for the last 9 months were negative and declining. Restatements for the last couple of years made it worse. So we're facing a very tough environment. And we saw that very quickly in the month of June as our process transactional business really slowed down as our customers continued to protect cash flow and their investments to make sure they have the cash needed to run the businesses or pay dividends or whatever they're doing. Clearly, a very challenging environment, but an environment where our team across Emerson knows what to do. And we're acting on it very aggressively and making sure we keep our costs in line, making sure we do the right things internally to protect the key investments, but also keep our costs in line to allow us to generate the profits, the cash and the returns we expect at this company. 
In total, profitability for the third quarter was pretty good. We generate operating margins flat with last year at 17.4% -- in case you didn't figure that out, 17.4%, with down underlying sales of over 4%. Cash flow was very strong in the quarter. We're strong in cash flow for the first 9 months. We will continue to generate the cash flow to run the company, to invest and pay money back to our shareholders and do what we need to do. But we have to face the reality of what we see today. It's a tough market. We did see a bounce back in July in our process orders, which is a good sign. But in reality, we are looking at a marketplace right now where people are being very cautious, they're being very careful what they're spending money on, and they're very uncertain relative to what's going on around the world from a political standpoint relative to just a business environment standpoint and where things are heading. So we're staying very focused on trying to drive the necessary actions to protect the short-term profitability. At the same time, staying very focused on making the right relevant long-term investments to drive the necessary change that we'll see in this business, this industry, when we come out. We will come out. This industry will come out. But clearly, a challenging marketplace right now and one that we fully understand that we have to deal with. And we will deal with it. 
Now let's think on the positive side of this. We had many people out there doubted that Emerson could take the transaction, the repositioning and get the job done. But the team within corporate, the team within Network Power, the team within LSCT and our external partners did a lot of work the last 12 months and came up with very strong proposition both for our shareholders and for the buyers of these actions and also remaining assets that are being bought. Very pleased with the work there. Not easy to do in a marketplace, by the way, which is quite challenging. So my hats off to the entire team around the world for making this happen. I also want to thank the team for landing a tough quarter, a quarter that was a lot tougher than we started out thinking about it. And in reality, it ended up being very challenging, but we got the job done and delivered pretty good levels of profitability and levels of cash flow. No, it was not what we expected, but still very good in the environment we're seeing. 
From the perspective of the board and the senior management team, we're very focused on the future of the company. We have been repositioning the company, and we continue to reposition the company. It is a very solid company when we get down to the 2 businesses that will remain at the end of the calendar year. And we're very much focused on making the necessary investments internally and through our strategic acquisitions to build upon these 2 businesses to once again return to over $20 billion in sales, profitable sales and profitable returns. The opportunities are there, and we're working on those. Yes, it's a tough environment, but there's no problem within Emerson. We deal with tough environments, that's what we do, it's our DNA. Clearly, would I like to have a better time? Yes. But that's not what we face today. So we're facing reality. We're very much focused on driving a stronger company, a more profitable company, a faster-growing company and remain an industry leader in the 2 key business units -- business segments that we’ll have when we finish. A tough quarter. Fourth quarter is going to be tough, too. Wasn't that long ago I thought that maybe we'd actually have flat or up sales in the fourth quarter, that's not going to happen. So we're going to have to deal with that. And from our perspective, as we continue to restructure and get ready for a challenging 2017, it will be more favorable coming through a very difficult last 18 months, but still a challenging environment for us. But we are well positioned and we’ll continue to be well positioned to drive levels of profitability that would generate great cash flow and returns. And over time, we'll continue to return to a growth mode that we know when inside Emerson. 
So yes, I look back at the third quarter, a tough one, but we've got a lot done. Within 12 months from the announcement of the concept of repositioning and selling our Network Power business, LSCT, we did it. We got it announced. We're looking at how reorganized on the company to drive longer-term value, very good. The game is still on. The hard work is still happening. And I want to thank the entire management team globally working so hard here the last 12 months and in this quarter to deliver what we need to deliver to continue to move Emerson forward to remain relevant and an industry leader in the spaces we serve today and will continue to serve going forward in 2017 and beyond. 
With that, I open the floor for questions or comments. Thank you."

So as we expect, it will be close to the $90 million global restructuring in that fourth quarter. Clearly, you have timings when things get pushed and shoved, but we're going to continue the restructuring there in the fourth quarter, but also in the first half for process automation. It looks to me right now the process automation from a profitability standpoint are going to be going down into the operating level, probably around the high 17, low 18 EBIT margins, obviously lower because of restructuring. And they'll bounce back into that 20 level, but will not bounce back in '17 based on what we see right now. I do start to see the growth coming in the process will drive that leverage back up. So we are in the mode right now of trying to protect and minimize the downfall in profitability. And so what we're looking at right now probably from profitability is somewhere between 200, 250 basis points, I would say, deterioration in profitability at the operating level line of the process business for 2016. And that we'll stabilize that as we get into that -- into '17."

Most of the opportunities within the Commercial & Residential Solution, I'll use the real names, not the abbreviation. I've got Kathy, my Head of Marketing, and she's beating over the top of my head with my own baseball bat. From our perspective, what we're looking forward's is sensing -- we're looking for sensing type of technologies to allow us to create a bigger solution within our core product that we have there today. We're looking for software, we're looking for monitoring, we're looking for the transformation that we did in the process world back 20 years ago, when we created a very strong component business and created sensing solutions, the software, and that's where we're taking the position for the commercial residential. The business acquisitions, most of them right now will be probably in the $20 million to $100 million range. There might be another $100 million, $200 million. No big significant acquisitions in, for what I would say, the next 12, 18, 24 months. Bob Sharp and his team is driving the solution strategy around us right now. So they're early days into understanding on how to create that. One of thing is, Bob is coming from the process world and understanding that. So I'm expecting him to create a more of a solutions type of environment around this and to leverage the core assets, leading assets we have in that space. So -- but it's going to be smaller sensing solution software type of acquisitions, and companies you probably never even heard of or thought of, to be honest."

First of all, thank you very much for recognizing the sale. I appreciate that. As I've been communicating for over a year on our -- sort of our utilization of cash flow going forward, yes, the dividend's important to us. It’s important not to us per se, but to our shareholders. And from our perspective, where we are right now, with the shrinking of the company down to say around $15 billion, and the cash flow coming down along those lines, we will be protecting our dividend, as we've discussed at the board level, from the next couple of years. The goal is obviously to grow the company both organically and through acquisitions to rebuild the cash flow base that we're losing from the divestitures. But right now, as you think about our company, you think about our free cash -- let's think about our free cash flow next year, and let's say we take the dividend up marginally a little bit like we did this year. Our dividend coverage, our cash flow -- the free cash flow to dividend coverage is going to go around the mid 60% level. And -- so our goal is to figure out how to keep that -- peak at that mid-60s, maybe higher 60s, and then move it back down in the range of 40% to 50%. As I've told the shareholders, however, let's say that we're not able to find significant strategic acquisitions. We're in -- we're not able to get the growth necessary to get back up to the size of the earnings and cash flow base that we had just a couple of years ago. Then we will, as a board, we'll have to consider, do we cut the dividend? But that is not where we sit right now. Right now, we have the capability, both in funding internally and doing the dividend, and we’ll dial back the share repurchase. And this year, we are going to end up around $600 million of share repurchase. Next year, we'll probably be somewhere in the $100 million and $200 million range, just basic covering what -- any stock that we're putting out there for employees and -- but we'll dial that back. The intention of the board, as we've discussed a lot over the last 12 months, the use of proceeds that were in our balance sheet, to go out and to continue to do aggressively, and make investments within the 2 core spaces we're maintaining or keeping the company. And that's where our focus is going to be."

And that's in -- and so that's what I see right now. Until I see our customer base willing to invest more for productivity, invest for next-generation capacity or whatever it takes, then it's going to be a tough environment. So I don't see that. On the commercial residential, we do see underlying growth, and we do see a little bit of improvement in profitability. Next year, the focus of that business will be the integration of some of the various businesses. As we've talked about streamlining and creating a very strong global, integrated business. And so that's where that focus is going to be. So next year, I would say that business will be -- we'll have a positive underlying growth. And most likely, we'll see little bit of continued margin improvement in which -- and the business is running at pretty good levels of profitability right now."

But -- let's just put it this way, I’m not looking to go out and do something really quick and crazy with a $4 billion which I don't have yet. But I think, from our perspective, we see the opportunity and we see a situation, we're going to take advantage of the situation right now. It's a tough marketplace out there. And you try to find -- ever try to guess bottoms when to buy stocks or buy things, you're going to lose. That's a loser strategy. We're going to buy assets we think we can make money.

I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 re",1226,"Thank you, William. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. 
In the fourth quarter, results for the Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses were reported in discontinued operations. Considering this and to aid in comparisons to prior quarters, we provided results both on a continuing operations basis and on an adjusted basis, which include these discontinued operations and exclude such items such as separation costs for consistency. A further explanation of the reporting formats can be found on Slide 2. Detailed bridges can also be found in the appendix to this presentation. 
Please turn to Slide 3 for a summary of the fiscal year results. Fiscal year sales of $20.2 billion decreased 9% versus the prior year with underlying sales down 6%. The fiscal year results reflected a more challenging economic environment than we expected as we entered the year as the company has faced difficult conditions in its key served markets for 7 consecutive quarters. Within our industrial businesses, the most significant factors have been the impact of -- on energy-related customer spending from persistently low oil and gas prices as well as weak general industrial and emerging market spending. Across our other businesses, we did find bright spots related to generally more favorable market conditions in U.S. construction, data center spending, particularly cloud-based and co-location customers, telecommunications infrastructure and global air conditioning and refrigeration. 
Adjusted earnings per share decreased 6% to $2.98. As a result of the continuation of difficult market conditions, restructuring spending totaled $112 million for the fiscal year, exceeding our previous guidance of $90 million to $100 million. The completion of the actions also positions us for what we expect to be a challenging 2017. 
Finally, solid earnings conversion and improved trade working capital performance resulted in strong operating work -- operating cash flow generation of $2.9 billion or $3.1 billion, which was 15.1% of sales, excluding $179 million of separation costs. 
Turning to Slide 4. Net sales of $5.5 billion were down 6% with underlying sales down 5% in the quarter. Served market conditions in the fourth quarter remained generally consistent to previous quarters with weak oil and gas and general-industrial spending outweighing favorable data center, telecommunications, air conditioning and refrigeration spend. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.96 increased 3%. For the quarter, working capital improvement drove operating cash flow generation of $957 million. 
Turning to Slide 5. Favorable materials cost containment, restructuring benefits and solid operational execution led to gross profit of 41.7%, which was up 100 basis points, and EBIT margin of 16.8%, up 60 basis points versus the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 6. The continuation of a low growth environment led to underlying sales decreases in all geographies for the fiscal year. Fourth quarter underlying sales were generally representative of the full year, but improved in some regions, such as Asia, China and the United States. 
Turning to Slide 7. Total segment margin was up 140 basis points to 17.1%, primarily driven by benefits from restructuring actions and operational execution. Capital spending was held to $169 million, equal to the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Process Management sales decreased 11% as spending levels in energy-related markets remain low for both capital and operational expenditures, while power and life sciences customers continue to provide growth opportunities. Restructuring spending in the quarter was $54 million, slightly above the prior year. Segment margin decreased 280 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions. The automation businesses will remain under pressure through the majority of fiscal 2017, with the possibility of orders recovery in the second half, assuming stability in oil and gas prices. 
Turning to Slide 9. Industrial Automation sales decreased 7%, resulting from a continuation of low levels of spending in upstream oil and gas and weak but slightly improving conditions in general-industrial markets. Segment margin increased 190 basis points to 16.3%, primarily due to business mix, benefits from restructuring actions and lower restructuring spend in the quarter. The divestitures of the Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses remain on track to close by the end of the calendar year. Looking ahead to 2017, general industrial markets will remain challenging with slightly improving conditions as the year progresses. 
Turning to Slide 10. Network Power underlying sales were flat in the quarter, supported by favorable demand in power products, thermal management and service. Strong growth in North America was led by cloud-based and co-location data center customers as well as telecommunication spending by mobile and broadband providers. Segment margin improved 650 basis points to 13.1%, benefiting from favorable mix, savings from restructuring actions and gross profit improvement programs. The Network Power divestiture also remains on track for completion by the end of the calendar year. 
Turning to Slide 11. Climate Technologies sales increased 6%, driven by strong growth in U.S. residential and commercial air conditioning as well as refrigeration and residential air conditioning markets in China. Segment margin increased 320 basis points to 21.1%, primarily due to volume leverage, savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment, partially offset by lower pricing. The 2017 outlook for global demand in air conditioning and refrigeration markets supports our expectation for low single-digit growth for our Climate businesses. 
Turning to Slide 12. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were equal to the prior year as growth in food waste disposers and wet/dry vacuums offset declines in other businesses. Segment margin improved 370 basis points to 25.9% from the benefits of restructuring actions and the impact of the InterMetro divestiture. Favorable conditions in U.S. construction markets are expected to support our outlook for low single-digit growth in fiscal 2017. 
Turning to Slide 13. Fiscal year 2016 was a more difficult -- was more difficult than we had expected, impacted by a significant and unprecedentedly long global industrial downturn that we expect to continue into 2017. Our automation business will remain under pressure from these market headwinds, while our commercial businesses will benefit from favorable conditions in global air conditioning and refrigeration and from construction markets in the United States and Asia. Considering these factors, we provide the following guidance for fiscal year 2017.: net and underlying sales will be down 1% to 3% with the Automation Solutions platform down 4% to 7% and the Commercial & Residential Solutions platform up 2% to 4%. The Automation Solutions platform will be comprised of our current Process Management segment and the remaining businesses from the Industrial Automation segment, while the Commercial & Residential Solutions platform will be comprised of the businesses within our current Climate Technology and Commercial & Residential Solutions segment. Earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $2.35 to $2.50, which compares to earnings per share on a continuing basis and including divestiture gains of $2.45 in 2016 and $2.81 in 2015. The 2017 EPS guidance also includes any impact from the pending acquisition of Pentair Valves & Controls business. 
And now I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr."

And in case you guys don't realize, Craig is rooting for the Cleveland Indians tonight to win and take the World Series. So he's not totally paying attention right now. He's focused on the Cleveland Indians. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. Again, it's a good way to finish a very challenging global industrial world. It was not easier, but a very challenging year nonetheless. And I think we continue to execute [indiscernible] are positioned in the right condition for better growth in the future. I want to thank all the employees, the corporate leaders, the team members who support our effort this year. I mean we got a lot done in a very tough global business environment, which has been challenging for us for the last 2 years. And with a good finish on the fiscal '16 and the fourth quarter, even though sales were down, margins were close to record levels from last year. We had strong cash flow, a good conversion. In the quarter, we also announced the sale -- cash sales for Network Power, cash sale for Leroy-Somer CT, generating over $5.2 million -- billion [ph] of cash and an agreement to purchase the Pentair Valves & Controls business for $3.15 billion. As Craig mentioned, most likely, we'll get the divestitures done by the end of this quarter. We clearly are driving -- trying to get the Valves & Controls business closed by the end of this quarter. We still have to get global government approvals on that acquisition, and we're moving forward with that. That acquisition is uniquely strategic to us relative to our end markets. Our solutions package and our ability to really integrate that and fit it well within our broad global customer offering. And so we're very excited about the opportunity there to generate future growth, earnings and cash flow. 
We executed for the second year on restructuring. Restructuring number was down from the prior year because we had very high levels of restructuring in fiscal 2015, but still over $100 million of restructuring throughout the year in 2016, and the savings are flowing through. We nearly maintained a 17% [ph] operating profit this year despite sales being down 9%, which is quite a major task given the big dropoff that we saw in the Automation Solutions business. We had strong cash flow again this year, better than last year when you take out the cost of doing the repositioning. Excellent conversion. So we're exiting the year with 2 strategic divestitures, 1 unique strategic acquisition, strong balance sheet, good cash position. And we have a very good vision, where we see things unfolding here for the next 12 months. 
You now have the new GAAP P&L and balance sheet for Emerson. I'm sure you'll have a lot of questions about it. We will supply 5 years of history in the end report. We'll also give you a very good 2014, too, and I think, 3-year details, and give you a chance to start to understand the new Emerson. Also, we'll start giving out the sales and orders relative to our platform, the 2 platforms, the Automation Solutions and then also the Commercial & Residential Solutions. 
So we'll start giving some information. Craig has the information. Start feeding it out to you, and we'll get more to you as we go forward here in the 10-K. And then also we will give more as we report our first quarter in fiscal '17. We made a decision to give you a little bit more insight to what we see for next year, given what the new company is structured with the new P&L looks like, the new balance sheet looks like. Right now, we see underlying sales down 1% to 3%, with Automation Solutions being still in a challenging mode, down 4% to 7%, which will be third year in a row Automation Solutions is down. Our Commercial & Residential business has turned the corner and has grown, and we expect that will continue to grow 2% to 4% next year. Both will deliver solid margins. Operating margins in both will be better. Restructuring around the Automation Solutions will continue, but at a little lower level, excluding our integration of Pentair Valves & Controls. Some minor restructuring going on underneath the Commercial & Residential Solutions, but primarily we're making significant investment solutions in the infrastructure to create best cost locations, to create a more efficient structure within the new Commercial & Residential underneath Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann. A lot of integration work going on there. And then eventually, when we get clearance from the governments, we'll get integration work with Pentair Valves & Controls. We're ready to go. We already have our day 1 through 6 months plans ready to implement and working very, very hard on. So a lot underway relative to our execution around this acquisition. So we feel good about how we finish the year, feel good about how we're going in to our position relative to our repositioning effort. 
With EPS, it's all about how do we maintain -- or have a slight increase in EPS next year. We gave you the range of $2.35 to $2.50, but we're very much focused and we delivered some moderate, low single -- [indiscernible] single growth -- and the next -- underlying sales and execute better margins and deliver a little better earnings per share. We're very much focused on running this business now that we have the repositioning effort under way. 
It's been a tough market. There's not a lot of growth out there. It's a challenging market, but we know where we have to go. We've got -- from our perspective, from the management team, we downsized around the world both in the operating units and also the core -- corporate units. We have a very solid team ready to execute around our plan for 2017 and 2018 and beyond. 
Restructuring, our cost position is pretty good shape right now. There's always more restructuring to do, but we've got the majority of the big heavy-lifting behind us when you exclude the Pentair Valves & Controls, but we've really got our position from our perspective in good shape. 
We're very much focused on trying to again bring in some additional acquisitions in 2017. We will end -- from the 2 pre-positioning and acquisition, we'll end up with over $4.5 billion of cash, position in the right place to invest, and so we'll continue to look on at the small bolt-on strategic-type acquisitions rebuild our base, as we talked about back to $20 billion within this 5-year time period, getting our operating cash flow back to over $3.2 billion, which allow us to drive modest increase in dividends and get that free cash flow to dividend payout ratio back under 50%. [ph] We've showed that plan. We did that in Morgan Stanley conference a couple of weeks ago -- a couple of months ago. We are on course to make sure we execute around that vision. So that's what we're all about. 
I want to thank the organization for the work they've done the last 12 months. We have changed a lot in Emerson the last 12 months, from the change in the businesses, from the restructuring, to delivering very solid earnings and cash in a very challenging year, to improving our cost structure, to making a bigger acquisition, hopefully, we'll get finalized at the end of this calendar year and then going forward, in the new company, yes, it's a smaller company. It's a very profitable company, but a company that's well positioned, I think, to grow and recover as a global investment start happening again. So I like where we are right now. We had a good session with the board today, talking about how we wrapped up the year, where we're going to go forward. But I think we're really good shape. We have a very, very difficult first quarter. We had a very good first quarter last year. The Automation Solutions business is looking at probably down 10% sales in the first quarter. If you remember -- if you've been watching this -- the orders for last several -- in 6 or 8 months, the orders have been down around the 10%, 12%, 13% range. They've got to get through that. And so we have a very difficult first quarter from Automation Solutions. And we know that, and we're built for that. We'll try to get some restructuring done. But that's the facts at this point in time. That's built into our forecast, and the year will get better as we go forward. But clearly, it's -- we've got to get through the next 2 or 3 months here, finish that divestitures, make acquisitions and move forward with the new company. So with that, I'll open up the door and the windows in the phone lines and let people talk. Ask any questions you want. No one gave me the questions ahead of time. I tried to call CNN, but unfortunately, they didn't return my phone call. So I don't have the questions ahead of time. And Craig will still focus on reading to them box score from the baseball game, which they lost Internet, that they didn't give me any questions here. So with that, we'll open up the phone lines and take questions. Thank you."

The key issue -- let's talk -- break it down in 2 pieces, and then I'll give you total perspective from a CEO industry perspective, okay? On the Commercial & Residential Solutions, Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann laid out a plan. They're integrating these businesses today, and we see some opportunities in between the creases, let's say, to improve plant efficiency, plant cost, distribution, things like that. So we see the ability to bid -- to point out a cost structure, improve the profitability by a point over the next couple of years, get some working capital out, take some of that money, invest it, try to get to grow that business, but also that some of that money through -- flow through. So there, we're looking at like emerging -- putting the pieces together, some efficiencies that we have today by separate business by putting together. But once that's done, it's got -- we've got to grow because the cost structure would be very, very, very good. From an Automation Solutions standpoint, we probably have $40 million, $50 million of the core company left. And then you got some very, very difficult issues there. From -- you start going after things you don't want to go after to jeopardize the future, technology innovation and the value base of this company. The acquisition of Pentair Valves & Controls gives us a chance to do -- to go after even more. And that's why we're going to be looking at $50 million to $75 million in the first year, depending on when we get this done on the restructuring. And there's potentially -- we'll do even more than that in the next 2 years. So the acquisition of Pentair Valves & Controls gives us a chance to refresh opportunities for us to integrate again a much larger business. You take the $7 billion Automation Solutions business today. You add $1.6 billion in there to get -- to do things. Now if the economy doesn't grow and we continue struggle for growth, hence, you're going to see -- acquisitions. That's seeing acquisitions. U.S. companies have been going through a lot of restructuring, taking costs out. We're running at levels at pretty high levels of profitability for the level of sales we have. And hence, that's why you're seeing acquisitions. That's why you're going to see that continue, I think, in the short term, unless there's some kind of growth in '17, which I don't see at this point in time. So if this thing keeps going and get sloppy, then we're going to have to add to our acquisition pool. And that's why we're going to be looking at an additional $3 billion to $4 billion of acquisitions over the next 2 or 3 years to continue to feed our chance to reposition, restructure and drive top line growth through acquisitions that is the core economic growth, we do not see coming through for the next couple of years. That's what this CEO sees from a cost perspective and growth perspective."

I'll give you what I feel, okay, Steve? I give you what I have at this point in time. I fundamentally believe right now we are -- about as close as we've been for a while relative to price cost pressures, seeing pricing, as you know, has been basically flat for us, I think, last year, last 2 years, basically slightly up, slightly down, 0.1, 0.2. Now we've been able to offset that with stronger net material inflation. I -- what I see coming into us right now, either this quarter or next quarter, is our price cost ratio pressures are going to build. And so we're factoring into higher cost reduction efforts within the company because I wouldn't be surprised if we do not go red for 1 or 2 quarters on our price cost ratios in 2017. I've told people at the Fed this same issue. There is inflation brewing relative to specific skill set. Material deflation is slowing down. It's not starting come up. And our pricing capability is not that strong right now because there's plenty of capacity out there. there's not a lot of demand. So the pressure is building on this whole price cost scenario. So what we're building in right now, in our plan is basically to stay neutral because I think if you let it run its course, we're going to be slightly red in our price cost situation. We have to increase our cost reductions. And it's going to be primarily around cost reduction. The productivity is tough. We're probably 1% or 2% next year in productivity. We're better than the U.S. economy, but there's not a lot of growth out there. So it's extremely hard to get a lot more productivity without some additional growth. So right now, we're having to ramp up our cost reductions around sort of discretionary things and keep the place kind of tight. So that's how I see unfolding next year. We're going to get -- we've got that savings that we've -- from the restructuring we did last year, earlier this year. But in order to hold our margins, improve our profitability next year, we're going to have to come up with more stronger discretionary cost savings because I think price cost will be working against us. That's my call. I'm sure you've not heard that from anybody, but that's my call."

Or -- going back, seriously, I was being [indiscernible] people on the phone listening. I did not tell Rob to [indiscernible] buy stock [indiscernible] All those people from the SEC have no sense of humor. So '17. There's 2 numbers you need to think about for '17. This is driven into our heads across the organization. $2.5 billion operating cash flow and $2 billion free cash flow. A number that's pretty tight to our modeling, and we're going to manage according -- as the organization is talking about it. And so if we can beat it, we can beat it. But that would put us at 62% [ph] of dividend to free cash flow cover, okay? Then as we move into '18 and '19, we're not assuming any big breakout or anything like that, but we're trying to get back into adding about $100 million of cash -- $150 million of operating cash flow per year. Now our plan is to continue to keep the dividend going up modestly, as I told the people, $0.02. We'll have share repurchase of around $500 million per year. That allows us to basically keep the dividend -- the actual payments flat to slightly down. And so we'll see, as we get into, right now, 2020, 2021, we'll be back down towards that 50% [ph] level. If we do not make any more acquisitions [indiscernible] that's what's going to happen. If we make any additional acquisition on top of Pentair, our game plan is to get that number back, our operating cash flow back up to $3.2 billion, spending around $600 million of capital. That get us back in the high 40s free cash flow to dividends from that perspective. So our model right now says that we'll continue to make acquisitions. We'll continue to integrate them, generate cash flows. We'll continue to buy stock back and continue to increase our dividend modestly. So that's what we're looking at right now, and our model looks at, do we do nothing other than Pentair that does that, we'll get closer to 50. If we do some additional deals, which we want to do, then we'll obviously get back under 50% [ph] in the next 5 years."

I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 re",1228,"Thank you, William. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. 
In the fourth quarter, results for the Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses were reported in discontinued operations. Considering this, and to aid in comparisons to prior quarters, we have provided results both on a continuing operations basis and on an adjusted basis, which includes these discontinued operations and excludes such items such as separation costs for consistency. A further explanation of the reporting formats can be found on Slide 2. Detailed bridges can also be found in the appendix to this presentation. 
Please turn to Slide 3 for a summary of the fiscal year results. Fiscal year sales of $20.2 billion decreased 9% versus the prior year, with underlying sales down 6%. The fiscal year results reflected a more challenging economic environment than we expected as we entered the year as the company has faced difficult conditions in its key served markets for 7 consecutive quarters. Within our industrial businesses, the most significant factors have been the impact of -- on energy-related customer spending from persistently low oil and gas prices as well as weak general industrial and emerging markets spending. Across our other businesses, we did find bright spots related to generally more favorable market conditions in: U.S. construction; data center spending, particularly cloud-based and co-location customers; telecommunications infrastructure; and global air conditioning and refrigeration. 
Adjusted earnings per share decreased 6% to $2.98. As a result of the continuation of difficult market conditions, restructuring spending totaled $112 million for the fiscal year, exceeding our previous guidance of $90 million to $100 million. The completion of the actions also positions us for what we expect to be a challenging 2017. 
Finally, solid earnings conversion and improved trade working capital performance resulted in strong operating work -- operating cash flow generation of $2.9 billion or $3.1 billion, which was 15.1% of sales, excluding $179 million of separation costs. 
Turning to Slide 4. Net sales of $5.5 billion were down 6%, with underlying sales down 5% in the quarter. Served market conditions in the fourth quarter remained generally consistent to previous quarters, with weak oil and gas and general industrial spending outweighing favorable data center, telecommunications, air conditioning and refrigeration spend. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.96 increased 3%. For the quarter, working capital improvement drove operating cash flow generation of $957 million. 
Turning to Slide 5. Favorable materials cost containment, restructuring benefits and solid operational execution led to gross profit of 41.7%, which was up 100 basis points, and EBIT margin of 16.8%, up 60 basis points versus the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 6. The continuation of a low-growth environment led to underlying sales decreases in all geographies for the fiscal year. Fourth quarter underlying sales were generally representative of the full year, but improved in some regions, such as Asia, China and the United States. 
Turning to Slide 7. Total segment margin was up 140 basis points to 17.1%, primarily driven by benefits from restructuring actions and operational execution. Capital spending was held to $169 million, equal to the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Process Management sales decreased 11% as spending levels in energy-related markets remained low for both capital and operational expenditures, while power and life sciences customers continue to provide growth opportunities. Restructuring spending in the quarter was $54 million, slightly above the prior year. Segment margin decreased 280 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions. The automation businesses will remain under pressure through the majority of fiscal 2017, with the possibility of orders recovery in the second half, assuming stability in oil and gas prices. 
Turning to Slide 9. Industrial Automation sales decreased 7%, resulting from a continuation of low levels of spending in upstream oil and gas and weak but slightly improving conditions in general industrial markets. Segment margin increased 190 basis points to 16.3%, primarily due to business mix, benefits from restructuring actions and lower restructuring spend in the quarter. The divestitures of the Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses remain on track to close by the end of the calendar year. Looking ahead to 2017, general industrial markets will remain challenging, with slightly improving conditions as the year progresses. 
Turning to Slide 10. Network Power underlying sales were flat in the quarter, supported by favorable demand in power products, thermal management and service. Strong growth in North America was led by cloud-based and co-location data center customers as well as telecommunication spending by mobile and broadband providers. Segment margin improved 650 basis points to 13.1%, benefiting from favorable mix, savings from restructuring actions and gross profit improvement programs. The Network Power divestiture also remains on track for completion by the end of the calendar year. 
Turning to Slide 11. Climate Technologies sales increased 6%, driven by strong growth in U.S. residential and commercial air conditioning as well as refrigeration and residential air conditioning markets in China. Segment margin increased 320 basis points to 21.1%, primarily due to volume leverage, savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment, partially offset by lower pricing. The 2017 outlook for global demand in air conditioning and refrigeration markets supports our expectation for low single-digit growth for our Climate businesses. 
Turning to Slide 12. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were equal to the prior year as growth in food waste disposers and wet/dry vacuums offset declines in other businesses. Segment margin improved 370 basis points to 25.9% from the benefits of restructuring actions and the impact of the InterMetro divestiture. Favorable conditions in U.S. construction markets are expected to support our outlook for low single-digit growth in fiscal 2017. 
Turning to Slide 13. Fiscal year 2016 was a more difficult -- was more difficult than we had expected, impacted by a significant and unprecedentedly long global industrial downturn that we expect to continue into 2017. Our automation businesses will remain under pressure from these market headwinds, while our commercial businesses will benefit from favorable conditions in global air conditioning and refrigeration and from construction markets in the United States and Asia. Considering these factors, we provide the following guidance for fiscal year 2017. Net and underlying sales will be down 1% to 3%, with the Automation Solutions platform down 4% to 7% and the Commercial & Residential Solutions platform up 2% to 4%. The Automation Solutions platform will be comprised of our current Process Management segment and our remaining businesses from the Industrial Automation segment, while the Commercial & Residential Solutions platform will be comprised of the businesses within our current Climate Technology and Commercial & Residential Solutions segment. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.50, which compares to earnings per share on a continuing basis and including divestiture gains of $2.45 in 2016 and $2.81 in 2015. The 2017 EPS guidance also includes any impact from the pending acquisition of Pentair Valves & Controls business. 
And now I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr."

And in case you guys don't realize, Craig is rooting for the Cleveland Indians tonight to win and take the World Series. So he's not totally paying attention right now. He's focused on the Cleveland Indians. 
I want to thank everybody for joining us today to -- again, it's a good way to finish a very challenging global industrial world. It was not an easy year, but a very challenging year nonetheless. And I think we continue to execute and get our position in the right condition for better growth in the future. I want to thank all the employees, the corporate leaders, the OCE members for their support and their effort this year. I mean, we got a lot done in a very tough global business environment, which has been challenging for us for the last 2 years. And with a good finish on the fiscal '16 in the fourth quarter, even though sales were down, margins were close to record levels from last year. We had strong cash flow and good conversion. In the quarter, we also announced the sale -- cash sale for Network Power, cash sale for Leroy-Somer and CT, generating over $5.2 million -- $5.2 billion of cash and an agreement to purchase the Pentair Valves & Controls business for $3.15 billion. As Craig mentioned, most likely, we'll get the divestitures done by the end of this quarter. We clearly are driving, trying to get the Valves & Controls business closed by the end of this quarter. We still have to get global government approvals on that acquisition, and we're moving forward with that. That acquisition is uniquely strategic to us relative to our end markets, our solutions package and our ability to really integrate that and fit it well within our broad global customer offering. And so we're very excited about the opportunity there to generate future growth, earnings and cash flow. 
We executed for the second year on restructuring. The restructuring number was down from the prior year because we had very high levels of restructuring in fiscal 2015, but still over $100 million of restructuring throughout the year in 2016, and the savings are flowing through. We nearly maintained a 17% operating profit this year despite sales being down 9%, which is quite a major task given the big dropoff that we saw in the Automation Solutions business. We had strong cash flow again this year, better than last year when you take out the cost of doing the repositioning. Excellent conversion. So we're exiting the year with 2 strategic divestitures, 1 unique strategic acquisition, strong balance sheet, good cash position. And we have a very good vision, where we see things unfolding here for the next 12 months. 
You now have the new GAAP P&L and balance sheet for Emerson. I'm sure you'll have a lot of questions about it. We will supply 5 years of history in the annual report. We'll also give you a very good 2014, too, and I think -- and 3-year details, and give you a chance to start to understand the new Emerson. Also, we'll start giving out the sales and orders relative to our platform, the 2 platforms, the Automation Solutions and then also the Commercial & Residential Solutions. 
So we'll start giving some information. Craig has the information. I'll start feeding it out to you, and we'll give more to you as we go forward here in the 10-K. And then also, we'll give more as we report our first quarter in fiscal '17. 
We made a decision to give you a little bit more insight into what we see for next year, given what the new company is structured, what the new P&L looks like, what the new balance sheet looks like. Right now, we see underlying sales down 1% to 3%, with Automation Solutions being still in a challenging mode, down 4% to 7%, which will be the third year in a row the Automation Solutions is down. Our Commercial & Residential business has turned the corner and has grown, and we expect that will continue to grow 2% to 4% next year. Both will deliver solid margins. Operating margins in both will be better. Restructuring around Automation Solutions will continue, but at a little lower level, excluding our integration of Pentair Valves & Controls. Some minor restructuring going on underneath the Commercial & Residential Solutions, but primarily we're making significant increased investments in the infrastructure to create best cost locations, to create a more efficient structure within the new Commercial & Residential underneath Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann. A lot of integration work going on there. And then eventually, when we get clearance from the governments, we'll get integration work under Pentair Valves & Controls. We're ready to go. We already have our day 1 through 6-month plans ready to implement and working very, very hard on. So a lot under way relative to our execution around this acquisition. So we feel good about how we finished the year, feel good about how we're going in to our position relative to our repositioning effort. 
With EPS, it's all about how do we maintain or have a slight increase in EPS next year. We gave you the range of $2.35 to $2.50, but we're very much focused, can we deliver some moderate, low single -- negative single growth -- in earning -- underlying sales and execute better margins and deliver a little bit better earnings per share. We're very much focused on running this business now that we have the repositioning effort under way. 
It's been a tough market. There's not a lot of growth out there. It's a challenging market, but we know where we have to go. We've got -- from our perspective, from the management team, we downsized around the world, both in the operating units and also the core corporate units. We have a very solid team ready to execute around our plan for 2017 and 2018 and beyond. 
Restructuring, our cost position is pretty good shape right now. There's always more restructuring to do, but we've got the majority of the big heavy lifting behind us when you exclude the Pentair Valves & Controls. But we've really got our position from our perspective in good shape. 
We're very much focused on trying to, again, bring in some additional acquisitions in 2017. We will end -- from the 2 pre-positioning [ph] and acquisition, we'll end up with over $4.5 billion of cash, positioned in the right place to invest and so we'll continue to look on at the small bolt-on strategic-type acquisitions to rebuild our base, as we've talked about, back to $20 billion within this 5-year time period; getting our operating cash flow back to over $3.2 billion, which allow us to drive modest increase in dividends and get that free cash flow to dividend payout ratio back under 50%. We've showed that plan. We did that in the Morgan Stanley conference a couple of weeks ago -- a couple of months ago. We are on course to make sure we execute around that vision. So that's what we're all about. 
I want to thank the organization for the work they've done in the last 12 months. We have changed a lot in Emerson in the last 12 months, from the change in the businesses, from the restructuring to delivering very solid earnings and cash in a very challenging year, to improving our cost structure, to making a big acquisition, and hopefully, we'll get finalized at the end of this calendar year. And then moving forward in the new company, yes, it's a smaller company. It's a very profitable company, but a company that's well positioned, I think, to grow and recover as global investments start happening again. So I like where we are right now. We had a good session with the board today, talking about how we wrapped up the year and where we're going to go forward. But I think we're in really good shape. We have a very, very difficult first quarter. We had a very good first quarter last year. The Automation Solutions business is looking at probably down 10% sales in the first quarter. If you remember -- if you've been watching this -- their orders -- for the last several 6 or 8 months, their orders have been down around the 10%, 12%, 13% range. They've got to get through that. And so we have a very difficult first quarter from Automation Solutions. And we know that, and we're built for that. We'll try to get some more restructuring done. But that's the facts at this point in time. That's built into our forecast, and the year will get better as we go forward. 
But clearly, it's -- we've got to get through the next 2 or 3 months here, finish the divestitures, make the acquisition and move forward with the new company. 
So with that, I'll open up the door and the windows and the phone lines and let people talk. Ask any questions you want. No one gave me the questions ahead of time. I tried to call CNN but, unfortunately, they didn't return my phone call. So I don't have the questions ahead of time. And Craig was so focused on reading the damn box score from the baseball game, which they lost the other night, that he didn't give me any questions here. So with that, we'll open up the phone lines and take questions. Thank you."

So that $15 billion collection right there is that -- where does that number turn up? Right now we're saying it's going to start getting better in the early calendar year of 2017, but we will not go positive until late -- on the Automation Solutions standpoint until late '17. That's where it is."

I think we will not get clarity until that first calendar quarter from our major investors as they fish out their fiscal year, as they see their cost structure.

And that's where we are right now. So we're expecting moderate growth in China in our Commercial & Residential Solutions business for 2017. Our orders in Automation Solutions have stabilized in China. Again, you keep in mind the markets we serve in China, not necessarily in the big down -- oil and gas -- new fields and things like that. We're looking at efficiency. We're looking at power plants. We're looking at programs to help incremental capacity and save energy and things like that. Those markets are starting to -- are actually starting to solidify in China. So we are cautiously optimistic about China, that we will see low single-digit positive growth in 2017. Now ask me that question in February, I might give a different answer. But right now, that's what we're seeing based on our indication of orders in the last couple of months with our customers. So I feel good about that. The other market I feel good about will be Europe. If you look at the new Emerson, the Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential, our European -- Europe grew last year, and I think it will grow again this year.

The key issue -- let's talk -- break it down in 2 pieces, and I'm going to give you a -- I mean, I'm going to give you a total perspective from a CEO industry perspective, okay? On the Commercial & Residential Solutions, Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann laid out a plan. They're integrating these businesses today, and we see some opportunities in between the creases, let's say, to improve plant efficiency, plant cost, distribution, things like that. So we see the ability to basically get a point out of a cost structure and improve the profitability by a point over the next couple of years, get some working capital out. Take some of that money, invest it, try to get -- to grow that business, but also let some of that money through -- flow through. So there, we're looking at, like emerging -- putting the business together, some inefficiencies [ph] that we have today by separate business by putting together. But once that's done, it's got -- we've got to grow because the cost structure will be very, very, very good. On an Automation Solutions standpoint, we probably have $40 million, $50 million of the core company left. And then you got some very, very difficult issues there. From the -- you start to go after things you don't want to go after sort of jeopardizes the future technology innovation and the value base of this company. The acquisition of Pentair Valves & Controls gives us a chance to do -- to go after even more. And that's why we're going to be looking at $50 million to $75 million in the first year, depending on when we get this done on the restructuring. And there's -- potentially, we'll do even more than that in the next 2 years. So the acquisition of Pentair Valves & Controls gives us a chance to refresh opportunities for us to integrate again a much larger business. You take the $7 billion Automation Solutions business today, you add $1.6 billion in there to -- you get -- you have the chance to do things. Now if the economy doesn't grow and we continue to struggle for growth, hence, you're going to see -- you're going to continue to see acquisitions. That's why you're seeing acquisitions. U.S. companies have been going through a lot of restructuring, taking costs out. We're running at levels -- at pretty high levels of profitability for the level of sales we have. And hence, that's why you're seeing acquisitions. That's why you're going to see that continue, I think, in the short term, unless there's some kind of growth in '17, which I don't see at this point in time. So if this thing keeps going and gets sloppy, then we're going to have to add to our acquisition pool. And that's why we're going to be looking at an additional $3 billion to $4 billion of acquisitions over the next 2 to 3 years to continue to feed our chance to reposition, restructure and drive top line growth through acquisitions because the core economic growth, we do not see coming through for the next couple of years. That's what this CEO sees from a cost perspective and growth perspective."

I'll give you what I feel, okay, Steve? I'll give you the best feel I have at this point in time. I fundamentally believe right now we are about as close as we've been for a while relative to this price-cost pressures. Seeing pricing, as you know, has been basically flat for us. I think, last year, the last 2 years, basically slightly up, slightly down, 0.1, 0.2. Now we've been able to offset that with stronger net material inflation. I -- what I see coming into us right now, either this quarter or next quarter, is our price-cost ratio pressures are going to build. And so we're factoring into higher-cost reduction efforts within the company because I wouldn't be surprised if we do not go red for 1 or 2 quarters on our price-cost ratios in 2017. I've told people at the Fed this same issue. There is inflation brewing relative to specific skill set. Material deflation is slowing down, it's not starting come up. And our pricing capability is not that strong right now because there's plenty of capacity out there and there's not a lot of demand. So the pressure is building on this whole price-cost scenario. So what we're building in right now in our plan is, basically, to stay neutral because I think if you let it run its course, we're going to be slightly red on our price-cost situation. We have to increase our cost reductions. And it's going to be primarily around cost reduction. Productivity is going to be tough. We'll probably be 1% or 2% next year on productivity. We're better than the U.S. economy, but there's not a lot of growth out there. So it's extremely hard to get a lot more productivity without some additional growth. So right now, we're having to ramp up our cost reductions around sort of discretionary things and keep the place kind of tight. So that's how I see that unfolding next year. Now we're going to get -- we've got the savings that we've -- from the restructuring we did last year early this year. But in order to hold our margins, improve our profitability next year, we're going to have to come up with more stronger discretionary cost savings because I think price-cost will be working against us. That's my call. I'm sure you've not heard that from anybody, but that's my call."

People on the phone listening, I did not tell Rob to buy stocks for his kids. Most people from the SEC has no humor. For '17, there's 2 numbers you need to think about for '17. This is driven into our heads across the organization: $2.5 billion operating cash flow and $2 billion free cash flow. A number that's pretty tight to our modeling, and we're going to manage according -- as the organization is talking about it. So if we can beat it, we can beat it. But that would put us at 62% of dividend to free cash flow cover, okay? Then as we move into '18 and '19, we're not assuming any big breakout or anything like that, but we're trying to get back into adding about $100 million of cash, $150 million of operating cash flow per year. Now our plan is to continue to keep the dividend going up modestly, as I told the people, $0.02. We'll have share repurchase of around $500 million per year. That allows us to basically keep the dividend -- the actual payments flat or slightly down. And so we'll see as we get into -- right now, 2020, 2021, we'll be back down towards that 50% level. If we do not make any more addition -- acquisitions, that's what's going to happen. If we make additional acquisitions on top of Pentair, our game plan is to get that number back, our operating cash flow back up to $3.2 billion, spending around $600 million of capital. That gets us back into the high 40s free cash flow to dividends from that perspective. So our model right now says that we'll continue to make acquisitions. We'll continue to integrate them, generate cash flows. We'll continue to buy stock back and continue to increase our dividend modestly. So that's what we're looking at right now. And our model looks at: Do we do nothing other than Pentair? And if that does that, we'll get closer to 50%. If we do some additional deals which we want to do, then we'll obviously get back under 50% in the next 5 years."

Now we go forward here. Now we're out here sitting in late in the year, and we're sitting here in the November time period. Oil pricing and the gas prices have been stabilizing here for several months, and the trend line has been a little bit better. It does go up and down.

The commercial and the residential channel is pretty tight right now. They had late heat. And so that channel has gotten pretty tight, so some work going on there. So I would expect us to have a good first fiscal quarter there as they hit the channel to where they need it, Rich. The other thing going on right now is there's a lot of changes relative to the efficiencies, to the refrigerants and new products coming out from our customer base. So there's a lot of work being done in that, which is driving some incremental growth for us. We're seeing that both in efficiency stuff going on in China. We see that across Asia, and we're seeing that in Europe. So we're -- well, anytime you start seeing a lot of changes in some of the new targets come out relative into the HFCs and the efficiencies, we get a benefit from that a little bit earlier than most people because they have to build up ahead of time. So we've seen a decent pattern of growth. And then our housing business has held up reasonably well, but it's definitely stalled where it was. The growth rate has definitely stalled. And then a couple of our businesses within the Commercial & Residential Solutions business actually get benefit from, what I would, call environmental problems like flooding and bad weather and stuff like that. There's been some across North America here in the last couple of months. And so it's -- things have gone our way there for a change. And so I think Bob and his team got a great cost structure right now, all the restructuring so they're driving very good margin. They got a couple environmental things and the trends going their way right now. So hopefully, they make hay for this quarter because we knows what's going to happen next quarter there, so that's where we are right now."

I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 re",1228,"Thank you, William. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. 
In the fourth quarter, results for the Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses were reported in discontinued operations. Considering this, and to aid in comparisons to prior quarters, we have provided results both on a continuing operations basis and on an adjusted basis, which includes these discontinued operations and excludes such items such as separation costs for consistency. A further explanation of the reporting formats can be found on Slide 2. Detailed bridges can also be found in the appendix to this presentation. 
Please turn to Slide 3 for a summary of the fiscal year result. Fiscal year sales of $20.2 billion decreased 9% versus the prior year, with underlying sales down 6%. The fiscal year results reflected a more challenging economic environment than we expected as we entered the year as the company has faced difficult conditions in its key served markets for 7 consecutive quarters. Within our industrial businesses, the most significant factors have been the impact of -- on energy-related customer spending from persistently low oil and gas prices as well as weak general industrial and emerging markets spending. Across our other businesses, we did find bright spots related to generally more favorable market conditions in: U.S. construction; data center spending, particularly cloud-based and co-location customers; telecommunications infrastructure; and global air conditioning and refrigeration. 
Adjusted earnings per share decreased 6% to $2.98. As a result of the continuation of difficult market conditions, restructuring spending totaled $112 million for the fiscal year, exceeding our previous guidance of $90 million to $100 million. The completion of the actions also positions us for what we expect to be a challenging 2017. 
Finally, solid earnings conversion and improved trade working capital performance resulted in strong operating work -- operating cash flow generation of $2.9 billion or $3.1 billion, which was 15.1% of sales, excluding $179 million of separation costs. 
Turning to Slide 4. Net sales of $5.5 billion were down 6%, with underlying sales down 5% in the quarter. Served market conditions in the fourth quarter remained generally consistent to previous quarters, with weak oil and gas and general industrial spending outweighing favorable data center, telecommunications, air conditioning and refrigeration spend. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.96 increased 3%. For the quarter, working capital improvement drove operating cash flow generation of $957 million. 
Turning to Slide 5. Favorable materials cost containment, restructuring benefits and solid operational execution led to gross profit of 41.7%, which was up 100 basis points, and EBIT margin of 16.8%, up 60 basis points versus the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 6. The continuation of a low-growth environment led to underlying sales decreases in all geographies for the fiscal year. Fourth quarter underlying sales were generally representative of the full year, but improved in some regions, such as Asia, China and the United States. 
Turning to Slide 7. Total segment margin was up 140 basis points to 17.1%, primarily driven by benefits from restructuring actions and operational execution. Capital spending was held to $169 million, equal to the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Process Management sales decreased 11% as spending levels in energy-related markets remained low for both capital and operational expenditures, while power and life sciences customers continue to provide growth opportunities. Restructuring spending in the quarter was $54 million, slightly above the prior year. Segment margin decreased 280 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions. The automation businesses will remain under pressure through the majority of fiscal 2017, with the possibility of orders recovery in the second half, assuming stability in oil and gas prices. 
Turning to Slide 9. Industrial Automation sales decreased 7%, resulting from a continuation of low levels of spending in upstream oil and gas and weak but slightly improving conditions in general industrial markets. Segment margin increased 190 basis points to 16.3%, primarily due to business mix, benefits from restructuring actions and lower restructuring spend in the quarter. The divestitures of the Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses remain on track to close by the end of the calendar year. Looking ahead to 2017, general industrial markets will remain challenging, with slightly improving conditions as the year progresses. 
Turning to Slide 10. Network Power underlying sales were flat in the quarter, supported by favorable demand in power products, thermal management and service. Strong growth in North America was led by cloud-based and co-location data center customers as well as telecommunication spending by mobile and broadband providers. Segment margin improved 650 basis points to 13.1%, benefiting from favorable mix, savings from restructuring actions and gross profit improvement programs. The Network Power divestiture also remains on track for completion by the end of the calendar year. 
Turning to Slide 11. Climate Technologies sales increased 6%, driven by strong growth in U.S. residential and commercial air conditioning as well as refrigeration and residential air conditioning markets in China. Segment margin increased 320 basis points to 21.1%, primarily due to volume leverage, savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment, partially offset by lower pricing. The 2017 outlook for global demand in air conditioning and refrigeration markets supports our expectation for low single-digit growth for our Climate businesses. 
Turning to Slide 12. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were equal to the prior year as growth in food waste disposers and wet/dry vacuums offset declines in other businesses. Segment margin improved 370 basis points to 25.9% from the benefits of restructuring actions and the impact of the InterMetro divestiture. Favorable conditions in U.S. construction markets are expected to support our outlook for low single-digit growth in fiscal 2017. 
Turning to Slide 13. Fiscal year 2016 was a more difficult -- was more difficult than we had expected, impacted by a significant and unprecedentedly long global industrial downturn that we expect to continue into 2017. Our automation businesses will remain under pressure from these market headwinds, while our commercial businesses will benefit from favorable conditions in global air conditioning and refrigeration and from construction markets in the United States and Asia. Considering these factors, we provide the following guidance for fiscal year 2017. Net and underlying sales will be down 1% to 3%, with the Automation Solutions platform down 4% to 7% and the Commercial & Residential Solutions platform up 2% to 4%. The Automation Solutions platform will be comprised of our current Process Management segment and the remaining businesses from the Industrial Automation segment, while the Commercial & Residential Solutions platform will be comprised of the businesses within our current Climate Technology and Commercial & Residential Solutions segments. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.50, which compares to earnings per share on a continuing basis and including divestiture gains of $2.45 in 2016 and $2.81 in 2015. The 2017 EPS guidance also includes any impact from the pending acquisition of Pentair's Valves & Controls business. 
And now I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr."

And in case you guys don't realize, Craig is rooting for the Cleveland Indians tonight to win and take the World Series. So he's not totally paying attention right now. He's focused on the Cleveland Indians. 
I want to thank everybody for joining us today to -- again, it's a good way to finish a very challenging global industrial world. It was not an easy year, but a very challenging year nonetheless. And I think we continue to execute and get our position in the right condition for better growth in the future. I want to thank all the employees, the corporate leaders, the OCE members for their support and their effort this year. I mean, we got a lot done in a very tough global business environment, which has been challenging for us for the last 2 years. And with a good finish on the fiscal '16 in the fourth quarter, even though sales were down, margins were close to record levels from last year. We had strong cash flow and good conversion. In the quarter, we also announced the sale -- cash sale for Network Power, cash sale for Leroy-Somer and CT, generating over $5.2 million -- $5.2 billion of cash and an agreement to purchase the Pentair Valves & Controls business for $3.15 billion. As Craig mentioned, most likely, we'll get the divestitures done by the end of this quarter. We clearly are driving, trying to get the Valves & Controls business closed by the end of this quarter. We still have to get global government approvals on that acquisition, and we're moving forward with that. That acquisition is uniquely strategic to us relative to our end markets, our solutions package and our ability to really integrate that and fit it well within our broad global customer offering. And so we're very excited about the opportunity there to generate future growth, earnings and cash flow. 
We executed for the second year on restructuring. The restructuring number was down from the prior year because we had very high levels of restructuring in fiscal 2015, but still over $100 million of restructuring throughout the year in 2016, and the savings are flowing through. We nearly maintained a 17% operating profit this year despite sales being down 9%, which is quite a major task given the big drop-off that we saw in the Automation Solutions business. We had strong cash flow again this year, better than last year when you take out the cost of doing the repositioning. Excellent conversion. So we're exiting the year with 2 strategic divestitures, 1 unique strategic acquisition, strong balance sheet, good cash position. And we have a very good vision, where we see things unfolding here for the next 12 months. 
You now have the new GAAP P&L and balance sheet for Emerson. I'm sure you'll have a lot of questions about it. We will supply 5 years of history in the end report. We'll also give you a very good 2014, too, and I think -- and 3-year details, and give you a chance to start to understand the new Emerson. Also, we'll start giving out the sales and orders relative to our platform, the 2 platforms, the Automation Solutions and then also the Commercial & Residential Solutions. 
So we'll start giving some information. Craig had the information. I'll start feeding it out to you, and we'll give more to you as we go forward here in the 10-K. And then also, we'll give more as we report our first quarter in fiscal '17. 
We made a decision to give you a little bit more insight into what we see for next year, given what the new company is structured, what the new P&L looks like, what the new balance sheet looks like. Right now, we see underlying sales down 1% to 3%, with Automation Solutions being still in a challenging mode, down 4% to 7%, which will be the third year in a row the Automation Solutions is down. Our Commercial & Residential business has turned the corner and has grown, and we expect that will continue to grow 2% to 4% next year. Both will deliver solid margins. Operating margins in both will be better. Restructuring around the Automation Solutions will continue, but at a little lower level, excluding our integration of Pentair Valves & Controls. Some minor restructuring going on underneath the Commercial & Residential Solutions, but primarily we're making significant increased investments in the infrastructure to create best cost locations, to create a more efficient structure within the new Commercial & Residential underneath Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann. A lot of integration work going on there. And then eventually, when we get clearance from the governments, we'll get integration work under Pentair Valves & Controls. We're ready to go. We already have our day 1 through 6-month plans ready to implement and working very, very hard on. So a lot under way relative to our execution around this acquisition. So we feel good about how we finished the year, feel good about how we're going in to our position relative to our repositioning effort. 
With EPS, it's all about how do we maintain or have a slight increase in EPS next year. We gave you the range of $2.35 to $2.50, but we're very much focused, can we deliver some moderate, low single -- negative single growth -- in earning -- underlying sales and execute better margins and deliver a little bit better earnings per share. We're very much focused on running this business now that we have the repositioning effort under way. 
It's been a tough market. There's not a lot of growth out there. It's a challenging market, but we know where we have to go. We've got -- from our perspective, from the management team, we downsized around the world, both in the operating units and also the core corporate units. We have a very solid team really to execute around our plan for 2017 and 2018 and beyond. 
Restructuring, our cost position is pretty good shape right now. There's always more restructuring to do, but we've got the majority of the big heavy lifting behind us when you exclude the Pentair Valves & Controls. But we've really got our position from our perspective in good shape. 
We're very much focused on trying to, again, bring in some additional acquisitions in 2017. We will end -- from the 2 pre-positioning [ph] and acquisition, we'll end up with over $4.5 billion of cash, positioned in the right place to invest and so we'll continue to look on at the small bolt-on strategic-type acquisitions to rebuild our base, as we've talked about, back to $20 billion within this 5-year time period; getting our operating cash flow back to over $3.2 billion, which allow us to drive modest increase in dividends and get that free cash flow to dividend payout ratio back under 50%. We've showed that plan. We did that in the Morgan Stanley conference a couple of weeks ago -- a couple of months ago. We are on course to make sure we execute around that vision. So that's what we're all about. 
I want to thank the organization for the work they've done in the last 12 months. We have changed a lot in Emerson in the last 12 months, from the change in the businesses, from the restructuring to delivering very solid earnings and cash in a very challenging year, to improving our cost structure, to making a big acquisition, and hopefully, we'll get finalized at the end of this calendar year. And then moving forward in a new company, yes, it's a smaller company. It's a very profitable company, but a company that's well positioned, I think, to grow and recover as global investments start happening again. So I like where we are right now. We had a good session with the board today, talking about how we wrapped up the year and where we're going to go forward. But I think we're in really good shape. We have a very, very difficult first quarter. We had a very good first quarter last year. The Automation Solutions business is looking at probably down 10% sales in the first quarter. If you remember -- if you've been watching this -- their orders -- for the last several 6 or 8 months, their orders have been down around the 10%, 12%, 13% range. They've got to get through that. And so we have a very difficult first quarter from Automation Solutions. And we know that, and we're built for that. We'll try to get some more restructuring done. But that's the facts at this point in time. That's built into our forecast, and the year will get better as we go forward. 
But clearly, it's -- we've got to get through the next 2 or 3 months here, finish the divestitures, make the acquisition and then move forward with the new company. 
So with that, I'll open up the door and the windows and the phone lines and let people talk. Ask any questions you want. No one gave me the questions ahead of time. I tried to call CNN but, unfortunately, they didn't return my phone call. So I don't have the questions ahead of time. And Craig was so focused on reading the damn box score from the baseball game, which they lost the other night, that he didn't give me any questions either. So with that, we'll open up the phone lines and take questions. Thank you."

And that's where the bet is here right now. That's how we see everything laying out, basically, from our customers and our initial reactions. So that $15 billion collection right there is at -- where does that number turn up? Right now we're saying it's going to start getting better in the early calendar year of 2017, but we will not go positive until late -- on the Automation Solutions standpoint until late '17. That's where it is."

And that's where we are right now. So we're expecting moderate growth in China in our Commercial & Residential Solutions business for 2017. Our orders in Automation Solutions have stabilized in China. Again, you keep in mind the markets we serve in China, not necessarily in the big down -- oil and gas -- new fields and things like that. We're looking at efficiency. We're looking at power plants. We're looking at programs to help incremental capacity and save energy and things like that. Those markets are starting to -- are actually starting to solidify in China. So we are cautiously optimistic about China, that we will see low single-digit positive growth in 2017. Now ask me that question in February, I might give you a different answer. But right now, that's what we're seeing based on our indication of orders the last couple of months with our customers. So I feel good about that. The other market I feel good about will be Europe. If you look at the new Emerson, the Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential, our European -- Europe grew last year, and I think it will grow again this year.

The key issue -- let's talk -- break it down in 2 pieces, and I'm going to give you a -- I mean, I'm going to give you a total perspective from a CEO industry perspective, okay? On the Commercial & Residential Solutions, Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann laid out a plan. They're integrating these businesses today, and we see some opportunities in between the creases, let's say, to improve plant efficiency, plant cost, distribution, things like that. So we see the ability to basically get a point out of a cost structure and improve the profitability by a point over the next couple of years, get some working capital out. Take some of that money, invest it, try to get -- to grow that business, but also let some of that money through -- flow through. So there, we're looking at, by merging -- putting the business together, some inefficiencies [ph] that we have today by separate business by putting together. But once that's done, it's got -- we've got to grow because the cost structure will be very, very, very good. On an Automation Solutions standpoint, we probably have $40 million, $50 million of the core company left. And then you got some very, very difficult issues there. From the -- starting to go after things you don't want to go after sort of jeopardizes the future technology innovation [ph] and the value base of this company. The acquisition of Pentair Valves & Controls gives us a chance to do -- to go after even more. And that's why we're going to be looking at $50 million to $75 million in the first year, depending on when we get this done on the restructuring. And there's -- potentially, we'll do even more than that in the next 2 years. So the acquisition of Pentair Valves & Controls gives us a chance to refresh opportunities for us to integrate again a much larger business. You take the $7 billion Automation Solutions business today, you add $1.6 billion in there to -- you get -- you have the chance to do things. Now if the economy doesn't grow and we continue to struggle for growth, hence, you're going to see -- you're going to continue to see acquisitions. That's why you're seeing acquisitions. U.S. companies have been going through a lot of restructuring, taking costs out. We're running at levels -- pretty high levels of profitability for the level of sales we have. And hence, that's why you're seeing acquisitions. That's why you're going to see that continue, I think, in the short term, unless there's some kind of growth in '17, which I don't see at this point in time. So if this thing keeps going and gets sloppy, then we're going to have to add to our acquisition pool. And that's why we're going to be looking at an additional $3 billion to $4 billion of acquisitions over the next 2 or 3 years to continue to feed our chance to reposition, restructure and drive top line growth through acquisitions because the core economic growth, we do not see coming through for the next couple of years. That's what this CEO sees from the cost perspective and growth perspective."

I'll give you what I feel, okay, Steve? I'll give you the best feel I have at this point in time. I fundamentally believe right now we are about as close as we've been for a while relative to this price-cost pressures. Being pricing, as you know, has been basically flat for us. I think, last year, the last 2 years, basically slightly up, slightly down, 0.1, 0.2. Now we've been able to offset that with stronger net material inflation. I -- what I see coming into us right now, either this quarter or next quarter, is our price-cost ratio pressures are going to build. And so we're factoring into higher-cost reduction efforts within the company because I wouldn't be surprised if we do not go red for 1 or 2 quarters on our price-cost ratios in 2017. I've told people at the Fed this same issue. There is inflation brewing relative to specific skill set. Material deflation is slowing down; it's not starting to come up. And our pricing capability is not that strong right now because there's plenty of capacity out there and there's not a lot of demand. So the pressure is building on this whole price-cost scenario. So what we're building in right now in our plan is, basically, to stay neutral because I think if you let it run its course, we're going to be slightly red on our price-cost situation. We have to increase our cost reductions. And it's going to be primarily around cost reduction. Productivity is going to be tough. We'll probably be 1% or 2% next year on productivity. We're better than the U.S. economy, but there's not a lot of growth out there. So it's extremely hard to get a lot more productivity without some additional growth. So right now, we're having to ramp up our cost reductions around sort of discretionary things and keep the place kind of tight. So that's how I see that unfolding next year. Now we're going to get -- we've got the savings that we've -- from the restructuring we did last year, early this year. But in order to hold our margins, improve our profitability next year, we're going to have to come up with more, stronger discretionary cost savings because I think price-cost will be working against us. That's my call. I'm sure you've not heard that from anybody, but that's my call."

This was driven into our heads across the organization: $2.5 billion operating cash flow and $2 billion free cash flow. A number that's pretty tight to our modeling, and we're going to manage according -- as the organization is talking about it. So if we can beat it, we can beat it. But that would put us at 62% of dividend to free cash flow cover, okay? Then as we move into '18 and '19, we're not assuming any big breakout or anything like that, but we're trying to get back into adding about $100 million of cash to $150 million of operating cash flow per year. Now our plan is to continue to keep the dividend going up modestly, as I told the people, $0.02. We'll have share repurchase of around $500 million per year. That allows us to basically keep the dividend -- the actual payments flat or slightly down. And so we'll see as we get into -- right now, 2020, 2021, we'll be back down towards that 50% level. If we do not make any more addition -- acquisitions, that's what's going to happen. If we make additional acquisitions on top of Pentair, our game plan is to get that number back, our operating cash flow back up to $3.2 billion, spending around $600 million of capital. That gets us back into high 40s free cash flow to dividends from that perspective. So our model right now says that we'll continue to make acquisitions. We'll continue to integrate them, generate cash flows. We'll continue to buy stock back and continue to increase our dividend modestly. So that's what we're looking at right now. And our model looks at: Do we do nothing other than Pentair? And if that does that, we'll get closer to 50%. If we do some additional deals which we want to do, then we'll obviously get back under 50% in the next 5 years."

So they cut capital much deeper than they said originally, that they had told us in January, February where we get the early indications from them. So that's what happened there. Now we go forward here. Now we're out here sitting in late in the year, and we're sitting here in the November time period. Oil pricing and the gas prices have been stabilizing here for several months, and the trend line has been a little bit better. It does go up and down. They have now got a year behind them relative to their whole capital structure. Some of the big projects had to get done.

So I would expect us to have a good first fiscal quarter there as they get the channel to where they need it, Rich. The other thing going on right now is there's a lot of changes relative to the efficiencies, to the refrigerants and new products coming out from our customer base. So there's a lot of work being done in that, which is driving some incremental growth for us. We're seeing that both in efficiency stuff going on in China. We see that across Asia, and we're seeing that in Europe. So we're -- well, anytime you start seeing a lot of changes in some of the new targets come out relative into the HFCs and the efficiencies, we get a benefit from that a little bit earlier than most people because they have to build up ahead of time. So we've seen a decent pattern of growth. And then our housing business has held up reasonably well, but it's definitely stalled where it was. The growth rate has definitely stalled. And then a couple of our businesses within the Commercial & Residential Solutions business actually get benefit from, what I would call environmental problems like flooding and bad weather and stuff like that. There's been some across North America here in the last couple of months. And so it's -- things have gone our way there for a change. And so I think Bob and his team got great cost structure right now, all the restructuring so they're driving very good margins. They got a couple environmental things and the trends going their way right now. So hopefully, they make hay for this quarter because who knows what's going to happen next quarter there, so that's where we are right now."

I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 re",1228,"Thank you, William. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. 
In the fourth quarter, results for the Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses were reported in discontinued operations. Considering this, and to aid in comparisons to prior quarters, we have provided results both on a continuing operations basis and on an adjusted basis, which includes these discontinued operations and excludes such items such as separation costs for consistency. A further explanation of the reporting formats can be found on Slide 2. Detailed bridges can also be found in the appendix to this presentation. 
Please turn to Slide 3 for a summary of the fiscal year result. Fiscal year sales of $20.2 billion decreased 9% versus the prior year, with underlying sales down 6%. The fiscal year results reflected a more challenging economic environment than we expected as we entered the year as the company has faced difficult conditions in its key served markets for 7 consecutive quarters. Within our industrial businesses, the most significant factors have been the impact of -- on energy-related customer spending from persistently low oil and gas prices as well as weak general industrial and emerging markets spending. Across our other businesses, we did find bright spots related to generally more favorable market conditions in: U.S. construction; data center spending, particularly cloud-based and co-location customers; telecommunications infrastructure; and global air conditioning and refrigeration. 
Adjusted earnings per share decreased 6% to $2.98. As a result of the continuation of difficult market conditions, restructuring spending totaled $112 million for the fiscal year, exceeding our previous guidance of $90 million to $100 million. The completion of the actions also positions us for what we expect to be a challenging 2017. 
Finally, solid earnings conversion and improved trade working capital performance resulted in strong operating work -- operating cash flow generation of $2.9 billion or $3.1 billion, which was 15.1% of sales, excluding $179 million of separation costs. 
Turning to Slide 4. Net sales of $5.5 billion were down 6%, with underlying sales down 5% in the quarter. Served market conditions in the fourth quarter remained generally consistent to previous quarters, with weak oil and gas and general industrial spending outweighing favorable data center, telecommunications, air conditioning and refrigeration spend. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.96 increased 3%. For the quarter, working capital improvement drove operating cash flow generation of $957 million. 
Turning to Slide 5. Favorable materials cost containment, restructuring benefits and solid operational execution led to gross profit of 41.7%, which was up 100 basis points, and EBIT margin of 16.8%, up 60 basis points versus the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 6. The continuation of a low-growth environment led to underlying sales decreases in all geographies for the fiscal year. Fourth quarter underlying sales were generally representative of the full year, but improved in some regions, such as Asia, China and the United States. 
Turning to Slide 7. Total segment margin was up 140 basis points to 17.1%, primarily driven by benefits from restructuring actions and operational execution. Capital spending was held to $169 million, equal to the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Process Management sales decreased 11% as spending levels in energy-related markets remained low for both capital and operational expenditures, while power and life sciences customers continue to provide growth opportunities. Restructuring spending in the quarter was $54 million, slightly above the prior year. Segment margin decreased 280 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions. The automation businesses will remain under pressure through the majority of fiscal 2017, with the possibility of orders recovery in the second half, assuming stability in oil and gas prices. 
Turning to Slide 9. Industrial Automation sales decreased 7%, resulting from a continuation of low levels of spending in upstream oil and gas and weak but slightly improving conditions in general industrial markets. Segment margin increased 190 basis points to 16.3%, primarily due to business mix, benefits from restructuring actions and lower restructuring spend in the quarter. The divestitures of the Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses remain on track to close by the end of the calendar year. Looking ahead to 2017, general industrial markets will remain challenging, with slightly improving conditions as the year progresses. 
Turning to Slide 10. Network Power underlying sales were flat in the quarter, supported by favorable demand in power products, thermal management and service. Strong growth in North America was led by cloud-based and co-location data center customers as well as telecommunication spending by mobile and broadband providers. Segment margin improved 650 basis points to 13.1%, benefiting from favorable mix, savings from restructuring actions and gross profit improvement programs. The Network Power divestiture also remains on track for completion by the end of the calendar year. 
Turning to Slide 11. Climate Technologies sales increased 6%, driven by strong growth in U.S. residential and commercial air conditioning as well as refrigeration and residential air conditioning markets in China. Segment margin increased 320 basis points to 21.1%, primarily due to volume leverage, savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment, partially offset by lower pricing. The 2017 outlook for global demand in air conditioning and refrigeration markets supports our expectation for low single-digit growth for our Climate businesses. 
Turning to Slide 12. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were equal to the prior year as growth in food waste disposers and wet/dry vacuums offset declines in other businesses. Segment margin improved 370 basis points to 25.9% from the benefits of restructuring actions and the impact of the InterMetro divestiture. Favorable conditions in U.S. construction markets are expected to support our outlook for low single-digit growth in fiscal 2017. 
Turning to Slide 13. Fiscal year 2016 was a more difficult -- was more difficult than we had expected, impacted by a significant and unprecedentedly long global industrial downturn that we expect to continue into 2017. Our automation businesses will remain under pressure from these market headwinds, while our commercial businesses will benefit from favorable conditions in global air conditioning and refrigeration and from construction markets in the United States and Asia. Considering these factors, we provide the following guidance for fiscal year 2017. Net and underlying sales will be down 1% to 3%, with the Automation Solutions platform down 4% to 7% and the Commercial & Residential Solutions platform up 2% to 4%. The Automation Solutions platform will be comprised of our current Process Management segment and the remaining businesses from the Industrial Automation segment, while the Commercial & Residential Solutions platform will be comprised of the businesses within our current Climate Technology and Commercial & Residential Solutions segments. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.50, which compares to earnings per share on a continuing basis and including divestiture gains of $2.45 in 2016 and $2.81 in 2015. The 2017 EPS guidance also includes any impact from the pending acquisition of Pentair's Valves & Controls business. 
And now I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr."

And in case you guys don't realize, Craig is rooting for the Cleveland Indians tonight to win and take the World Series. So he's not totally paying attention right now. He's focused on the Cleveland Indians. 
I want to thank everybody for joining us today to -- again, it's a good way to finish a very challenging global industrial world. It was not an easy year, but a very challenging year nonetheless. And I think we continue to execute and get our position in the right condition for better growth in the future. I want to thank all the employees, the corporate leaders, the OCE members for their support and their effort this year. I mean, we got a lot done in a very tough global business environment, which has been challenging for us for the last 2 years. And with a good finish on the fiscal '16 in the fourth quarter, even though sales were down, margins were close to record levels from last year. We had strong cash flow and good conversion. In the quarter, we also announced the sale -- cash sale for Network Power, cash sale for Leroy-Somer and CT, generating over $5.2 million -- $5.2 billion of cash and an agreement to purchase the Pentair Valves & Controls business for $3.15 billion. As Craig mentioned, most likely, we'll get the divestitures done by the end of this quarter. We clearly are driving, trying to get the Valves & Controls business closed by the end of this quarter. We still have to get global government approvals on that acquisition, and we're moving forward with that. That acquisition is uniquely strategic to us relative to our end markets, our solutions package and our ability to really integrate that and fit it well within our broad global customer offering. And so we're very excited about the opportunity there to generate future growth, earnings and cash flow. 
We executed for the second year on restructuring. The restructuring number was down from the prior year because we had very high levels of restructuring in fiscal 2015, but still over $100 million of restructuring throughout the year in 2016, and the savings are flowing through. We nearly maintained a 17% operating profit this year despite sales being down 9%, which is quite a major task given the big drop-off that we saw in the Automation Solutions business. We had strong cash flow again this year, better than last year when you take out the cost of doing the repositioning. Excellent conversion. So we're exiting the year with 2 strategic divestitures, 1 unique strategic acquisition, strong balance sheet, good cash position. And we have a very good vision, where we see things unfolding here for the next 12 months. 
You now have the new GAAP P&L and balance sheet for Emerson. I'm sure you'll have a lot of questions about it. We will supply 5 years of history in the end report. We'll also give you a very good 2014, too, and I think -- and 3-year details, and give you a chance to start to understand the new Emerson. Also, we'll start giving out the sales and orders relative to our platform, the 2 platforms, the Automation Solutions and then also the Commercial & Residential Solutions. 
So we'll start giving some information. Craig had the information. I'll start feeding it out to you, and we'll give more to you as we go forward here in the 10-K. And then also, we'll give more as we report our first quarter in fiscal '17. 
We made a decision to give you a little bit more insight into what we see for next year, given what the new company is structured, what the new P&L looks like, what the new balance sheet looks like. Right now, we see underlying sales down 1% to 3%, with Automation Solutions being still in a challenging mode, down 4% to 7%, which will be the third year in a row the Automation Solutions is down. Our Commercial & Residential business has turned the corner and has grown, and we expect that will continue to grow 2% to 4% next year. Both will deliver solid margins. Operating margins in both will be better. Restructuring around the Automation Solutions will continue, but at a little lower level, excluding our integration of Pentair Valves & Controls. Some minor restructuring going on underneath the Commercial & Residential Solutions, but primarily we're making significant increased investments in the infrastructure to create best cost locations, to create a more efficient structure within the new Commercial & Residential underneath Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann. A lot of integration work going on there. And then eventually, when we get clearance from the governments, we'll get integration work under Pentair Valves & Controls. We're ready to go. We already have our day 1 through 6-month plans ready to implement and working very, very hard on. So a lot underway relative to our execution around this acquisition. So we feel good about how we finished the year, feel good about how we're going in to our position relative to our repositioning effort. 
With EPS, it's all about how do we maintain or have a slight increase in EPS next year. We gave you the range of $2.35 to $2.50, but we're very much focused, can we deliver some moderate, low single -- negative single growth -- in earning -- underlying sales and execute better margins and deliver a little bit better earnings per share. We're very much focused on running this business now that we have the repositioning effort under way. 
It's been a tough market. There's not a lot of growth out there. It's a challenging market, but we know where we have to go. We've got -- from our perspective, from the management team, we downsized around the world, both in the operating units and also the core corporate units. We have a very solid team really to execute around our plan for 2017 and 2018 and beyond. 
Restructuring, our cost position is pretty good shape right now. There's always more restructuring to do, but we've got the majority of the big heavy lifting behind us when you exclude the Pentair Valves & Controls. But we've really got our position from our perspective in good shape. 
We're very much focused on trying to, again, bring in some additional acquisitions in 2017. We will end -- from the 2 pre-positioning [ph] and acquisition, we'll end up with over $4.5 billion of cash, positioned in the right place to invest and so we'll continue to look on at the small bolt-on strategic-type acquisitions to rebuild our base, as we've talked about, back to $20 billion within this 5-year time period; getting our operating cash flow back to over $3.2 billion, which allow us to drive modest increase in dividends and get that free cash flow to dividend payout ratio back under 50%. We've showed that plan. We did that in the Morgan Stanley conference a couple of weeks ago -- a couple of months ago. We are on course to make sure we execute around that vision. So that's what we're all about. 
I want to thank the organization for the work they've done in the last 12 months. We have changed a lot in Emerson in the last 12 months, from the change in the businesses, from the restructuring to delivering very solid earnings and cash in a very challenging year, to improving our cost structure, to making a big acquisition, and hopefully, we'll get finalized at the end of this calendar year. And then moving forward in a new company, yes, it's a smaller company. It's a very profitable company, but a company that's well positioned, I think, to grow and recover as global investments start happening again. So I like where we are right now. We had a good session with the board today, talking about how we wrapped up the year and where we're going to go forward. But I think we're in really good shape. We have a very, very difficult first quarter. We had a very good first quarter last year. The Automation Solutions business is looking at probably down 10% sales in the first quarter. If you remember -- if you've been watching this -- their orders -- for the last several 6 or 8 months, their orders have been down around the 10%, 12%, 13% range. They've got to get through that. And so we have a very difficult first quarter from Automation Solutions. And we know that, and we're built for that. We'll try to get some more restructuring done. But that's the facts at this point in time. That's built into our forecast, and the year will get better as we go forward. 
But clearly, it's -- we've got to get through the next 2 or 3 months here, finish the divestitures, make the acquisition and then move forward with the new company. 
So with that, I'll open up the door and the windows and the phone lines and let people talk. Ask any questions you want. No one gave me the questions ahead of time. I tried to call CNN but, unfortunately, they didn't return my phone call. So I don't have the questions ahead of time. And Craig was so focused on reading the damn box score from the baseball game, which they lost the other night, that he didn't give me any questions either. So with that, we'll open up the phone lines and take questions. Thank you."

And so that's the marketplace that we have to see that stability and we have to see them starting to spend some MRO in this North America market. And how long can they keep deferring that? I think we will not get clarity until that first calendar quarter from our major investors as they fish out their fiscal year, as they see their cost structure. So that's why I think the first fiscal quarter, which is the fourth calendar quarter, will be very, very difficult because I think our customer base will be tight, tight, tight with cash and be concerned. So that's where I see it right now, Julian."

They've continued here early on in this fiscal quarter -- first quarter. So we see that market turn. Now obviously, after being down real negative for a while, you get a nice bounce. And that's where we are right now. So we're expecting moderate growth in China in our Commercial & Residential Solutions business for 2017. Our orders in Automation Solutions have stabilized in China. Again, you keep in mind the markets we serve in China, not necessarily in the big down -- oil and gas -- new fields and things like that. We're looking at efficiency. We're looking at power plants. We're looking at programs to help incremental capacity and save energy and things like that. Those markets are starting to -- are actually starting to solidify in China. So we are cautiously optimistic about China, that we will see low single-digit positive growth in 2017. Now ask me that question in February, I might give you a different answer. But right now, that's what we're seeing based on our indication of orders the last couple of months with our customers. So I feel good about that. The other market I feel good about will be Europe. If you look at the new Emerson, the Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential, our European -- Europe grew last year, and I think it will grow again this year. Those are the 2 positive markets. And then it gets real short after that."

The key issue -- let's talk -- break it down in 2 pieces, and I'm going to give you a -- I mean, I'm going to give you a total perspective from a CEO industry perspective, okay? On the Commercial & Residential Solutions, Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann laid out a plan. They're integrating these businesses today, and we see some opportunities in between the creases, let's say, to improve plant efficiency, plant cost, distribution, things like that. So we see the ability to basically get a point out of a cost structure and improve the profitability by a point over the next couple of years, get some working capital out. Take some of that money, invest it, try to get -- to grow that business, but also let some of that money through -- flow through. So there, we're looking at, by merging -- putting the business together, some inefficiencies [ph] that we have today by separate business by putting together. But once that's done, it's got -- we've got to grow because the cost structure will be very, very, very good. On an Automation Solutions standpoint, we probably have $40 million, $50 million of the core company left. And then you got some very, very difficult issues there. From the -- starting to go after things you don't want to go after sort of jeopardizes the future technology innovation [ph] and the value base of this company. The acquisition of Pentair Valves & Controls gives us a chance to do -- to go after even more. And that's why we're going to be looking at $50 million to $75 million in the first year, depending on when we get this done on the restructuring. And there's -- potentially, we'll do even more than that in the next 2 years. So the acquisition of Pentair Valves & Controls gives us a chance to refresh opportunities for us to integrate again a much larger business. You take the $7 billion Automation Solutions business today, you add $1.6 billion in there to -- you get -- you have the chance to do things. Now if the economy doesn't grow and we continue to struggle for growth, hence, you're going to see -- you're going to continue to see acquisitions. That's why you're seeing acquisitions. U.S. companies have been going through a lot of restructuring, taking costs out. We're running at levels -- pretty high levels of profitability for the level of sales we have. And hence, that's why you're seeing acquisitions. That's why you're going to see that continue, I think, in the short term, unless there's some kind of growth in '17, which I don't see at this point in time. So if this thing keeps going and gets sloppy, then we're going to have to add to our acquisition pool. And that's why we're going to be looking at an additional $3 billion to $4 billion of acquisitions over the next 2 or 3 years to continue to feed our chance to reposition, restructure and drive top line growth through acquisitions because the core economic growth, we do not see coming through for the next couple of years. That's what this CEO sees from the cost perspective and growth perspective."

I'll give you what I feel, okay, Steve? I'll give you the best feel I have at this point in time. I fundamentally believe right now we are about as close as we've been for a while relative to this price-cost pressures. Being pricing, as you know, has been basically flat for us. I think, last year, the last 2 years, basically slightly up, slightly down, 0.1, 0.2. Now we've been able to offset that with stronger net material inflation. I -- what I see coming into us right now, either this quarter or next quarter, is our price-cost ratio pressures are going to build. And so we're factoring into higher-cost reduction efforts within the company because I wouldn't be surprised if we do not go red for 1 or 2 quarters on our price-cost ratios in 2017. I've told people at the Fed this same issue. There is inflation brewing relative to specific skill set. Material deflation is slowing down; it's not starting to come up. And our pricing capability is not that strong right now because there's plenty of capacity out there and there's not a lot of demand. So the pressure is building on this whole price-cost scenario. So what we're building in right now in our plan is, basically, to stay neutral because I think if you let it run its course, we're going to be slightly red on our price-cost situation. We have to increase our cost reductions. And it's going to be primarily around cost reduction. Productivity is going to be tough. We'll probably be 1% or 2% next year on productivity. We're better than the U.S. economy, but there's not a lot of growth out there. So it's extremely hard to get a lot more productivity without some additional growth. So right now, we're having to ramp up our cost reductions around sort of discretionary things and keep the place kind of tight. So that's how I see that unfolding next year. Now we're going to get -- we've got the savings that we've -- from the restructuring we did last year, early this year. But in order to hold our margins, improve our profitability next year, we're going to have to come up with more, stronger discretionary cost savings because I think price-cost will be working against us. That's my call. I'm sure you've not heard that from anybody, but that's my call."

This was driven into our heads across the organization: $2.5 billion operating cash flow and $2 billion free cash flow. A number that's pretty tight to our modeling, and we're going to manage according -- as the organization is talking about it. So if we can beat it, we can beat it. But that would put us at 62% of dividend to free cash flow cover, okay? Then as we move into '18 and '19, we're not assuming any big breakout or anything like that, but we're trying to get back into adding about $100 million of cash to $150 million of operating cash flow per year. Now our plan is to continue to keep the dividend going up modestly, as I told the people, $0.02. We'll have share repurchase of around $500 million per year. That allows us to basically keep the dividend -- the actual payments flat or slightly down. And so we'll see as we get into -- right now, 2020, 2021, we'll be back down towards that 50% level. If we do not make any more addition -- acquisitions, that's what's going to happen. If we make additional acquisitions on top of Pentair, our game plan is to get that number back, our operating cash flow back up to $3.2 billion, spending around $600 million of capital. That gets us back into high 40s free cash flow to dividends from that perspective. So our model right now says that we'll continue to make acquisitions. We'll continue to integrate them, generate cash flows. We'll continue to buy stock back and continue to increase our dividend modestly. So that's what we're looking at right now. And our model looks at: Do we do nothing other than Pentair? And if that does that, we'll get closer to 50%. If we do some additional deals which we want to do, then we'll obviously get back under 50% in the next 5 years."

So they cut capital much deeper than they said originally, that they had told us in January, February where we get the early indications from them. So that's what happened there. Now we go forward here. Now we're out here sitting in late in the year, and we're sitting here in the November time period. Oil pricing and the gas prices have been stabilizing here for several months, and the trend line has been a little bit better. It does go up and down. They have now got a year behind them relative to their whole capital structure. Some of the big projects had to get done.

Both the commercial and the residential channel is pretty tight right now. They had late heat. And so that channel has gotten pretty tight, so some work going on there. So I would expect us to have a good first fiscal quarter there as they get the channel to where they need it, Rich. The other thing going on right now is there's a lot of changes relative to the efficiencies, to the refrigerants and new products coming out from our customer base. So there's a lot of work being done in that, which is driving some incremental growth for us. We're seeing that both in efficiency stuff going on in China. We see that across Asia, and we're seeing that in Europe. So we're -- well, anytime you start seeing a lot of changes in some of the new targets come out relative into the HFCs and the efficiencies, we get a benefit from that a little bit earlier than most people because they have to build up ahead of time. So we've seen a decent pattern of growth. And then our housing business has held up reasonably well, but it's definitely stalled where it was. The growth rate has definitely stalled. And then a couple of our businesses within the Commercial & Residential Solutions business actually get benefit from, what I would call environmental problems like flooding and bad weather and stuff like that. There's been some across North America here in the last couple of months. And so it's -- things have gone our way there for a change. And so I think Bob and his team got great cost structure right now, all the restructuring so they're driving very good margins. They got a couple environmental things and the trends going their way right now. So hopefully, they make hay for this quarter because who knows what's going to happen next quarter there, so that's where we are right now."

Mike Train got a lot more restructuring done in the last 3 or 4 months in Automation Solutions. As you notice, our restructuring number went up. But his volumes is going to be down 10% in the first quarter. And Mike is a good business leader, but he ain't that -- he can't work miracles. So it's going to come down, and then we should start seeing that come back up as we move it in the second quarter. So our -- we're all hands on deck in this first quarter right now because Automation Solutions has got a very difficult -- the order patterns have been weak for a while, and we know the mix is not going to be good. So Bob's businesses are trying as hard as possible. But the Automation Solutions is going to be a tough number. So I think that's going to be the big issue for us. We're going to be definitely very weak in the first quarter in profitability, and we'll start coming back. Because the restructuring is getting done, and we just -- the volume is dropping so hard in this first quarter."

So thank you, everybody. Take care. We'll see everybody around, and we'll definitely see everybody in February at our Investors Conference. Take care now. Bye."
