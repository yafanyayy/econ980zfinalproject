Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call to discuss third quarter 2016 earnings results. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review our earnings release and supplemental information. We've also posted a presentation and prepared remarks to our Investor Relations events webpage. 
Speakers on today's call are Mike Brown, Symantec's President and CEO; and Thomas Seifert, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our website. I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. Implied Billings refer to revenue plus the change in sequential deferred revenue. We provide year-over-year constant currency growth rate in our prepared remarks, except for statements about net income and EPS.
I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates for you. Mike Brown will be presenting at the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on February 29 and attending the JMP Technology Conference on March 1 in San Francisco. Thomas Seifert will be presenting at the Raymond James Institutional Investor Conference in Orlando on March 7. We intend to announce fourth quarter earnings on May 12 and will be hosting a Financial Analyst Day on May 26 in New York City. 
Please note non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.
Please refer to cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You'll also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors and our filings with the SEC, and in particular, in our annual report on Form 10-K and the year ended April 3, 2015. 
In connection with the Veritas sale, we have provided 7 quarters of recast GAAP and non-GAAP financial income statements, third quarter and prior year-end balance sheets and GAAP cash flow statements for the trailing 3 quarters and fiscal year 2015. All non-GAAP revenue and expenses exclude the impact of Veritas. However, the continuing operations deferred revenue on the balance sheet and the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement includes a portion of Veritas deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered into prior to operational separation. The Veritas deferred revenue from those contracts will amortize into discontinued operations.
As a result, Implied Billings growth calculated from change in deferred on the balance sheet or cash flow statement will not be representative of standalone Symantec's performance as it will include an impact from Veritas. This quarter and going forward, we will disclose the amount of deferred revenue on the balance sheet that will represent standalone Symantec for calculating Implied Billings. 
And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mike Brown. Go ahead, Mike."

I am pleased first to announce that Silver Lake Partners has made a $500 million strategic investment, which is a strong vote of confidence in both our transformation as well as our future as the world leader in cyber",2029,"Thanks, Jonathan, and good afternoon. I am pleased first to announce that Silver Lake Partners has made a $500 million strategic investment, which is a strong vote of confidence in both our transformation as well as our future as the world leader in cybersecurity. Additionally, I'm excited to have Ken Hao, Silver Lake managing partner, join our board, given his deep expertise in technology and track record of creating value.
As you know, we have been undergoing a 3-year transformation which began in April 2014. At that time, we laid out 5 priorities that we have since successfully executed against: first, managing our businesses with a portfolio approach, which included divesting Veritas and improving the profitability of our consumer business while we invest for growth in Enterprise Security; second, within Enterprise Security, we have been investing for growth by reallocating R&D spending to high-growth markets; third, improving our cost structure where we have improved non-GAAP operating margins to 28% this quarter; fourth, building a talented executive team, including new C-level leadership across most major functions; and fifth, returning significant cash to shareholders, with $2.1 billion in total share repurchases and dividends since April 2014.
During this period, we also developed a well-articulated strategy for our security business, which we call Unified Security. This strategy leverages our key competitive differentiator, the global scale and footprint of our large installed base where we can correlate threat that our products and services see with Symantec's Global Intelligence Network, the 8 trillion objects we monitor globally and in realtime. After completing the divestiture of Veritas, we are a more focused company as the world leader in cybersecurity.
The second half of our transformation plan began last October and is focused on 4 priorities: number one, delivering upon a product roadmap that leverages our Unified Security strategy; number two, building our Enterprise Security pipeline and go-to-market capabilities; number three, improving our cost structure further; and number four, continuing to efficiently allocate capital. I'll now cover each one of these priorities, starting with the first, delivering upon our product roadmap that leverages our Unified Security strategy.
On a daily basis, Chief Information Security Officers and security operations analysts are overwhelmed by the vast number of security alerts that make it difficult to pinpoint advanced threats attacking their IT environments. Moreover, attacks are constantly evolving and leveraging a variety of techniques. 
This leaves traditional point solution vendors that are only focused on a specific attack method at a disadvantage. Protecting against these advanced attacks involves a unified approach to security to guard against multiple attack methods and an understanding of global threats in real time. This is Symantec's strategy, which leverages our installed base and competitive differentiation and using a big data approach to understand more about the threat landscape than any of our competitors.
The first generation of products leveraging our Unified Security strategy are new solutions in the areas of advanced threat protection, data loss prevention, cybersecurity services and applications that run on our Unified Security Analytics platform. In total, we have launched 6 of the 12 new Enterprise Security products we outlined last year at our Financial Analyst Day. We plan to release the remaining half within the next 2 quarters and have an additional set of new products in the pipeline for the second half of fiscal 2017.
The first 3 of these, our newly-released Advanced Threat Protection or ATP solutions, harness threat telemetry from the major control points of endpoint, e-mail and network to not only detect, correlate and prioritize but also remediate threats. This solution does this all from one console without adding an additional endpoint agent. 
Key differentiators of Symantec's ATP approach are a cloud-based expandable sandboxing capability that works without expensive on-premise hardware as well as the ability to correlate threats across the control points within an enterprise and against Symantec's global real-time intelligence network. 
In recent independent third-party testing from Miercom and Dennis Technology Labs, Symantec's ATP solutions received the highest scores across all test categories against vendors, including FireEye, Cisco, Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet, meaning we stopped more attacks and blocked more threats with fewer false positives than any of our competitors.
Our ATP solutions build upon a key core offering, Symantec's Endpoint Protection or SEP, which is our largest product line within Enterprise Security and which is delivering next-generation endpoint protection today. Many competitors are delivering only a subset of endpoint protection techniques. As a result, customers would be required to install numerous agents on their endpoints to match the same level of protection that we deliver today with SEP. This slows performance at the endpoint and is cumbersome to manage. 
Symantec Endpoint Protection already combines multiple advanced protection engines across intrusion prevention, whitelisting, behavior-based machine learning, signature-less detection of malware and suspicious activity, automation, application control, clustering and remediation all deployed from a single agent. This layered approach, which includes multiple protection engines, goes far beyond antivirus and delivering next-generation capability, which is already being delivered to our more than 300,000 endpoint customers, protecting over 110 million endpoints and enterprises. This is the installed base for which we are targeting our ATP solutions.
In our cybersecurity service offering, Symantec is also delivering Unified Security capabilities to customers through our managed security offering. This service monitors Symantec's solution as well as third-party security products to correlate threats against Symantec's global real-time intelligence network. In many cases, our managed security service operates side-by-side in existing customer's SOC to act as complementary protection capability or layered defense against attackers. And Symantec has been named a leader 12 times in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Managed Security Services.
Finally, we will also deliver Unified Security capability through new applications that will sit on top of our analytics platform and leverage the vast threat data we see globally and in real time. Risk Insight, which benchmarks an enterprise's security posture against peers, is the first in a series of applications we plan to build on top of this platform. The solution is currently running in beta at a large financial services company and will become generally available this quarter. We are excited about this wave of innovation at Symantec, which is resulting in the most robust organically developed product cycle in our history.
Now on to the second of our 4 priorities, which is building Enterprise Security pipeline by improving our go-to-market capabilities. Building robust pipeline incorporates strong brand recognition, a robust channel program, lead generation and focused sales plays. To educate the channel on our next-generation security portfolio and product roadmap, we conducted partner conferences across our 3 major geographies and special training sessions, which included meeting with over 1,000 partners. 
During the quarter, we saw early momentum from the global system integrators and now are focusing to further enable our VARs, distributors, service providers and cloud providers. Additionally, we have launched a set of focused field sales plays aimed at driving new product sales in our installed base as well as replacing competition. 
For example, our ATP cross-sell campaign has identified over 3,000 accounts that have a SEP installation, which represent over tens of millions of control points. Within those accounts, we have identified a subset that are immediate candidates for our ATP solution over the next 5 quarters as they have an upcoming endpoint or e-mail renewal. 
We are already seeing positive results despite ATP only being generally available for just over 30 days. As of February 1, we had nearly 1,200 customers that have either attended an ATP webinar or engaged with a Symantec expert, over 350 customers who are actively evaluating our ATP solutions and dozens of initial wins. 
One of the most notable wins was with a U.S. food manufacturer and existing SEP and e-mail customer who purchased our full ATP Endpoint e-mail and gateway solution to monitor over 10,000 control points. This customer reviewed competitive offerings and selected Symantec, given our integrated suite, single console and no need to deploy a new endpoint agent. 
Another example of a new go-to-market offering is how we're helping customers securely transition to Office 365 by leveraging our recently launched bundle that includes DLP for cloud, User Authentication and our .cloud e-mail solution. Our Office 365 solution provides customers a cloud-based solution that secures inbound and outbound data for customers as they transition those workloads and associated administration to the cloud. 
With cloud-based workloads, it's even more important to ensure an authorized user is accessing information that is encrypted traffic and that data that shouldn't leave a customer's environment doesn't leave. Symantec's bundle combines these security capabilities for our customers. We're currently in discussions with many existing and prospective customers who plan to migrate tens of thousands of users to Office 365. Some will be brand-new wins for us and others will be an upsell opportunity.
Our third priority is continuing to improve our cost structure now that the divestiture of Veritas is complete. We're announcing today a target of $400 million in cost reduction to be achieved over the next 2 years. Specifically, over the next 18 months, we plan to eliminate $130 million of TSAs and stranded costs, resulting from the sale of Veritas, of which there are large opportunities in the areas of IT infrastructure and real estate. 
Beyond the impact of TSAs and stranded costs, we believe we can achieve further reductions across the company. The majority of these incremental savings will benefit us in fiscal 2018 and beyond. As a result, we expect to reach a 30% operating margin as we enter fiscal 2018.
Now our fourth priority, capital allocation. Our management team and board believe proper capital allocation is key to maximizing long-term shareholder value. And we have demonstrated this with a consistent track record of returning capital through dividends and share buybacks. We continue that consistent track record with our announcement today that we will return $5 billion in additional capital to shareholders by the end of March 2017 through a special dividend and share repurchases, bringing our total capital return in connection with the Veritas transaction to $5.5 billion.
Next, I'd like to provide an overview of Q3 results. Enterprise Security revenue increased 1% year-over-year, the third consecutive quarter of revenue growth, driven by 15% growth from information protection. Specifically, DLP again grew double digits. We are witnessing a resurgence in DLP demand across industries beyond the traditional verticals of financial services and health care that we've sold into as more organizations realize they need to secure their intellectual property. We are the best positioned company to capitalize on this opportunity, which is further demonstrated by our market share, which is twice the size of the closest competition and our recognition as a leader in Gartner's January 2016 Data Loss Prevention Magic Quadrant.
Moving to our Consumer Security business. Revenues here declined 6%, which was at the better end of our down 6% to 8% expectation and an improvement from Q2. During the quarter, we signed an agreement with a large Indian telco to provide paid mobile security services to their customers. This is significant as monetizing the mobile opportunity is still in its infancy when compared with traditional form factors. 
We believe mobile security sold through partners will be one of the levers to return the consumer business to growth over the long term. As Thomas will describe in more detail, we are on track to convert our entire customer base to a subscription service and acquire more new customers directly online. Further, as we execute against our broader consumer product roadmap, we will expand the offering to address broader personal privacy and home IoT security opportunity. 
In summary, I believe we are well positioned for acceleration in fiscal year 2017. Our consumer business will see moderating decline while remaining extremely profitable at greater than 50% operating margins. We expect our Enterprise Security business to continue to grow in fiscal year '17 based on the strengthening product portfolio and building pipeline. Finally, we have a focused organization to execute against our priorities.
Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our third quarter financial results and guidance for our fourth quarter. Thomas?"

Third quarter total revenue was $909 million, a decline of 2% year-over-year but above the midpoint of our guided range on a constant currency basis. In Q3, approximately 88% of revenue is recurring in nature, 5% is perpetual and 7% is from services. Over time, we expect recurring revenue to become a larger portion of overall revenue as more products are sold as a subscription.
Deferred revenue was $2.5 billion, which includes $396 million deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied Billings, excluding Veritas, were $865 million. The U.S. dollar appreciated against most major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of approximately $40 million to third quarter revenue on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 27.9% and exceeded our guided range. Excluding the impact from the TSA costs, non-GAAP operating margin would have been approximately 30%, which is in line with our margin target. Non-GAAP net income was $172 million, resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.26, above the high end of our guidance.
Let me now provide further detail on our revenue performance by product area. Enterprise Security revenue was up 1% year-over-year. Enterprise Security operating margins were 5%. To note, Enterprise Security carries a higher burden of stranded costs. 
Within Enterprise Security, Threat Protection was down 4%, and within Threat Protection, Endpoint Protection grew in low single digits. Offsetting this growth was continued weakness in our Endpoint Management solution, which will soon be refreshed with our new unified Endpoint Management platform available this quarter. 
Information Protection revenue grew 15%, driven by both Data Loss Prevention, DLP, and User Authentication, with both up double digits year-over-year. During the quarter, we closed over 2 dozen new DLP deals greater than $300,000, including one of the largest health care systems in the nation, where we beat out the competition to replace a legacy installation with our market-leading DLP solution.
Cyber Security Services, CSS, was flat year-over-year. During the quarter, we opened a Singapore SOC, which should further accelerate our expansion internationally. We are seeing positive underlying trends in CSS from both a secular and an execution standpoint and expect the business to improve its revenue growth performance in fiscal year 2017.
Website security grew 3%. We continue to be the de facto standard for enterprise-level customers to secure their websites, which is a stable and profitable business. Beyond the enterprise, we see demand for encryption and authentication accelerating as security and privacy imperatives and identify an application like eCommerce grow among businesses of all sizes, which we believe represents at least 40 million additional websites worldwide of opportunity for our solutions.
Now on to the Norton Consumer Security segment. Third quarter Consumer Security revenue was down 6% and operating margins were 56%. However, we are seeing improvement in the underlying fundamentals of the customer business -- consumer business performance, which gives us confidence that revenue performance will continue to improve. 
From a business modeling standpoint, we evaluate the Consumer Security business based on 4 primary factors: customer satisfaction, subscriber renewal rates, new subscriber growth and pricing. For competitive reasons, we do not quantify those metrics externally but believe it would be helpful to directionally describe our performance. 
First, customer satisfaction. We track our progress through Net Promoter Score, which is one of the highest in our industry and expect that metric to trend higher. Second, renewal rates. We have completed the transition to subscription globally. This quarter, we've reached the 1-year anniversary of subscription transition in the U.S. and will reach the 1-year anniversary in Europe at the end of fiscal second -- '17 second quarter. Customers on subscription renew at a significantly higher rate than those not in subscription. We expect renewal rates to continue to improve over the medium term as we transition more customers to subscription, and the acquisition mix continues moving to our digital channels.
Third, new customer acquisition. We are focusing on acquiring more customers online and through ISPs as those channels have proven higher lifetime values. During the quarter, new subscriptions from online again grew 8% year-over-year. This represents approximately half of new acquisition.
Lastly, we expect pricing to remain healthy as we deliver increased value to our customers in the form of next-generation consumer Endpoint Protection. Given the steady improvement in both renewal rates and new customer additions, we believe we are exiting the trough of the consumer business declines.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operations -- operating activities for the December quarter totaled $153 million and includes $56 million in outflows related to separation cost. Capital expenditures were $114 million in Q3. We expect capital expenditures for Q4 to be approximately $50 million to $60 million.
Now turning to capital return. As we mentioned previously, we would update our capital return plan post the completion of the Veritas sale. We will now be returning $5.5 billion, which include the $500 million AFR that we executed in Q3 and an additional capital return of $5 billion. The $5 billion will be executed through a $4 per share special dividend, which will amount to $2.7 billion and a $2.3 billion share repurchase program to be completed by March 2017. 
The record date for the special dividend payable to shareholders will be close of business on March 8, 2016, and the dividend will be payable on March 22. Once we complete the special dividend, we'll initiate our stock repurchase program. We expect execute approximately $900 million of share repurchases within Q4. After the completion of the capital return, we'll have returned more cash to shareholders than the net cash proceeds from the sale of Veritas. 
Lastly, we're adjusting our ongoing quarterly dividend to a $0.075 a share starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This adjustment reflects our lower domestic free cash flow post Veritas sale but still represents a significant payout ratio on domestically generated free cash flow. We're committed to increasing this dividend as free cash flow grows over time.
Now turning to guidance. Our constant currency Q4 revenue guidance of down 4% to flat is slightly higher than our previous guidance. We now expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 26% to 28%, down slightly from our previous guidance due to the negative impact from currency. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.24 to $0.27, in line with our previous guidance as the lower tax rate offsets the decrease in operating margin expectation. We will provide fiscal 2017 guidance when we report our Q4 results in May.
In conclusion, we are seeing the underlying fundamentals of the business improve, and we are well positioned to execute on the second half of our transformation. Now I will turn the call back over to Jon."

So here's how we're thinking about it. From a revenue standpoint and thinking about the 2 segments, on the consumer side, we expect consumer business to perform basically in line with the outlook that we've been providing, so moderating declines as we go forward. And our guidance really is consistent with what we provided at Financial Analyst Day. Our consumer business very much on track. On the Enterprise side equation, it's more difficult to forecast. And we're in a period now where we have so many new products as I talked about in my remarks. And until we have some better visibility into the traction that we see converting that pipeline into revenue, we would rather be -- we'd rather be conservative with our thoughts about the Enterprise side. But I think it's fair to say that we'll be looking at where we finished Q4, and we will expect that, that will be the starting point. And we would expect to grow modestly from where we finished Q4 as we go throughout fiscal year '17. On the margin side, we should keep in mind a few things. Number one, seasonality -- from a seasonal standpoint, margins are typically down for us from Q4 to Q1. And as we've also talked about, we have a significant amount of these stranded costs supporting Veritas and then the stranded costs obviously that we need to take out. That accounts for about 200 basis points of margin. If you add those 200 basis points to the margin we reported today you'd see we were at, which is 28%, you'd see we were at the 30% target. But as we go forward into fiscal year '17, we're expecting that the reported -- as reported non-GAAP margins where we're not able to adjust for those stranded costs will be about the 200 basis points lower than what we see in FY '16. So lower operating margins -- and that's our task as we begin this effort to take out $400 million in cost over 2 years to ensure that those are eliminated. So as we start the following fiscal year, fiscal year '18, we'll be able to start that back at our target of 30%. So that gives you a little bit of a feel how we're thinking about it."

So I think we can do better there. And I think when we think about the capabilities that we're bringing, especially with ATP, we see that as a big opportunity. As many of you all on the call have commented, 2016 is likely to be the Renaissance of the Endpoint. Now that we're through a major refresh of firewalls, next-generation firewalls, many CISOs are turning to the Endpoint because that's where unencrypted data lives. And that's where they're looking to be more effective against attacks. So when we think about the combination of capabilities that we're offering, we think it's unparalleled in the marketplace. So just a couple of examples. We believe we're the only player effectively providing advanced attack protection across all vectors, so that's what our ATP solution does. You're really able to stop attacks, correlate and that might have been aimed at the network or e-mail or endpoint, we could correlate those. The second, as I talked about in my remarks, we're using multiple advanced techniques that go well beyond signatures, things like behavior monitoring, machine learning, global intelligence, advanced analytics. So we've already got multiple protection engines that are incorporated in SEP. The third would be the ability to remediate attacks. That comes with our ATP solutions. So it's not just about protection but what can I do to remediate the situation. And then one of the things that Symantec has a strength in relative to a startup competitor is obviously delivering endpoint protection at scale without performance drag because we can provide all these capabilities to a single agent. So we think we're really in an unmatched position now, and adding the ATP capability gives us even stronger leadership. So we're still, as you'd expect, very excited about the Endpoint. We think the capabilities we're adding with ATP solutions really make us the leader get in terms of the technology to protect as well as remediate attacks at the endpoint."

There's a feeling that Symantec as being a legacy vendor really is providing antivirus protection and that's all. So what's true is we're providing antivirus. When I talk about multiple protection engines, antivirus is just one of those. We often call that signature-based technology for protection. But here's where we're adding those multiple layers. So we spent years developing, through our advanced research, these multiple techniques to protect you so that we can see what attacks are frankly coming in across the network. So frankly, the capability that stops more attacks than antivirus is something called intrusion prevention that's really scanning what is the traffic coming in over the network. That stops more attacks than antivirus today. And we combine that with other techniques that we talked about, behavior. We use the wisdom of crowds to understand what are the reputations as endpoint users might go out to access other files or URL addresses. And again, the vast telemetry that we collect reputations on those 25 billion files, 30 billion URLs. So we'll block the user from going to unexpected site or opening an infected file before they do that. So again, these multiple protection engines and techniques that allow us to provide that best protection at the endpoint. So a lot of competitors like to think we're just antivirus. But it's far from the truth."

The reduction on the dividend is more a reflection on the operations and the size of the operations moving forward and keeping the operational flexibility to take care what is in front of us in terms of adjusting our cost infrastructure, investing in the business. And then we said we are going to increase the dividend if cash flow allows for that. But I think those are 2 separate topics. One is the capital return, very efficient capital return of the Veritas proceeds, and the other is around how we adjust to the smaller footprint. But keep in mind, we are still -- even the dividend is still a majority of our domestically generated cash flow moving forward."

Then the strategic question is just given the big chunk of cash returned that's coming from Veritas, how does this impact how you guys think about M&A and potential deals on a going-forward basis? Does this kind of have the security towards smaller deals versus something larger, given that you are going to invest so much cash?"

And we think that is achievable over the long term, meaning over the next several years. So whi",594,"So Keith, thanks for the question on the consumer business because it gives us an opportunity to say, our goal is to get the returns consumer business to grow. And we think that is achievable over the long term, meaning over the next several years. So while we're not forecasting that for next year, as we continue to work through the transitions that we've already began in the consumer business, we clearly see that as an opportunity, meaning returning the business of top line revenue growth over a longer timeframe. And distribution is a key part of that. So most important for us was making sure that we build a stronger foundation for the business. That has to do with reducing the churn rate, and of course, what we've done primarily there is move to a subscription. And what we're seeing as we're now reaching the 1-year anniversary of customers who started in a subscription is that the retention rate of those customers is significantly higher than what we had before within auto renewal program where they needed to proactively sign up year after year. So staying in a subscription, of course, meaning that they continue to be protected and pay us year after year without an opt-in. And the retention rates are significantly higher we're already seeing that in the business. That's important because that gives us a stronger model from which to approach OEMs. So if we had lower retention rate, higher churn rates, an OEM customer doesn't make it much sense. So now that we are fixing the foundation in the business, meaning improving the retention rate, now there's an opportunity to think about expanding distribution. So today, we're primarily acquiring new customers through online acquisition. And Thomas talked about the fact that we're up 8% year-over-year in terms of our online acquisition. So one part of our channel growing there. The second part that's growing from a channel perspective is the new customers we're acquiring through large partners. These tend to be cable or telco companies. And I talked in my remarks about the fact that new opportunity for us to there is monetizing mobile customers. We're starting to do that really for the first time. Then as we look at retail and OEM, OEM has been in decline for us but now with the stronger model, it will be time for us to think about OEMs again, and in fact, we're competing for a major OEM contract this year. So we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. But with a stronger model, we'll be in a great position to be competitive there and have that be profitable for Symantec, which as we talked about was a different with some of those OEM contract before. They weren't profitable for us and our churn rate was such that we weren't able to generate the right lifetime customer value. Moving on to your second question about our balance sheet and strategic flexibility. We do not believe that the capital return program limits our strategic flexibility in the least. So we'll -- as you are aware, we'll have a very strong balance sheet going forward. We estimate we'll have something in the neighborhood of $5 billion in cash as we end fiscal year '17, with strong cash flow generation capabilities. So we do not see what limits our strategic flexibility, and we're going to continue to think about what is the right other capabilities that we like to add to Symantec that are tightly aligned with this Unified Security strategy."

You would expect that the margin for standalone software business in this space is getting double digit.

We have a very strong balance sheet and strong cash flow. But we will be very judicious as we think about this. If you look at our track record for the last 18 months or so, we've only done 2 small acquisitions. Those were very tightly aligned with the strategy that we talked about, meaning they significantly add to Unified Security.

So what we view as the installed base is growing going but growing slowly at this point. So that's the broader context. Now opportunity for us is to move beyond traditional PC form factor in the mobile. We talked about that a bit today. We also talked about additional buttocks that we can add that use Norton's capabilities. We talked about other capabilities like privacy in the home, like what we could do for IoT as we protect other devices in the home. So I think there are other product opportunities that go beyond the traditional PC form factor but the overwhelming proportion of our business today is obviously is PC. Then as we look at the changes we've made in Norton, which are primarily from a channel perspective, significant declines in OEM and retail as we focus on online acquisition and partners. Now that we have a stronger model as we discussed earlier, which means higher lifetime customer value that we achieve by moving people to subscription, we can look again at where does it make sense to grow in retail and OEM. In fact, retail for the regions outside of North America is already growing again. We don't have that growing in North America but that's something that we have as a goal for this coming year. And then we talked about early in the call, given the strength of the model, we can also look at OEMs as well. So I'm quite optimistic that over the long term, there are enough opportunities for Norton to be able to grow. It's just going to take us a little while to realize those opportunities, Phil."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call to discuss third quarter 2016 earnings results. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review our earnings release and supplemental information. We've also posted a presentation and prepared remarks to our Investor Relations events web page. 
Speakers on today's call are Mike Brown, Symantec's President and CEO; and Thomas Seifert, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our website. 
I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Implied Billings refer to revenue plus the change in sequential deferred revenue. We provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, except for statements about net income and EPS.
I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates for you. Mike Brown will be presenting at the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on February 29 and attending the JMP Technology Conference on March 1 in San Francisco. Thomas Seifert will be presenting at the Raymond James Institutional Investor Conference in Orlando on March 7. We intend to announce fourth quarter earnings on May 12 and will be hosting a Financial Analyst Day on May 26 in New York City. 
Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.
Please refer to cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You'll also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, in our annual report on Form 10-K in the year ended April 3, 2015. 
In connection with the Veritas sale, we have provided 7 quarters of recast GAAP and non-GAAP financial income statements, third quarter and prior year-end balance sheets and GAAP cash flow statements for the trailing 3 quarters and fiscal year 2015. All non-GAAP revenue and expenses exclude the impact of Veritas. However, the continuing operations deferred revenue on the balance sheet and the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement includes a portion of Veritas deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered into prior to operational separation. The Veritas deferred revenue from those contracts will amortize into discontinued operations.
As a result, Implied Billings growth calculated from change in deferred on the balance sheet or cash flow statement will not be representative of standalone Symantec's performance as it will include an impact from Veritas. This quarter and going forward, we will disclose the amount of deferred revenue on the balance sheet that will represent standalone Symantec for calculating Implied Billings. 
And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mike Brown. Go ahead, Mike."

I am pleased first to announce that Silver Lake Partners has made a $500 million strategic investment, which is a strong vote of confidence in both our transformation as well as our future as the world leader in cyber",2034,"Thanks, Jonathan, and good afternoon. I am pleased first to announce that Silver Lake Partners has made a $500 million strategic investment, which is a strong vote of confidence in both our transformation as well as our future as the world leader in cybersecurity. Additionally, I'm excited to have Ken Hao, Silver Lake Managing Partner, join our board, given his deep expertise in technology and track record of creating value.
As you know, we have been undergoing a 3-year transformation which began in April 2014. At that time, we laid out 5 priorities that we have since successfully executed against: first, managing our businesses with a portfolio approach, which included divesting Veritas and improving the profitability of our consumer business while we invest for growth in Enterprise Security; second, within Enterprise Security, we have been investing for growth by reallocating R&D spending to high-growth markets; third, improving our cost structure where we have improved non-GAAP operating margins to 28% this quarter; fourth, building a talented executive team, including new C-level leadership across most major functions; and fifth, returning significant cash to shareholders, with $2.1 billion in total share repurchases and dividends since April 2014.
During this period, we also developed a well-articulated strategy for our security business, which we call Unified Security. This strategy leverages our key competitive differentiator, the global scale and footprint of our large install base where we can correlate threats that our products and services see with Symantec's Global Intelligence Network, the 8 trillion objects we monitor globally and in real time. After completing the divestiture of Veritas, we are a more focused company as the world leader in cybersecurity.
The second half of our transformation plan began last October and is focused on 4 priorities: number one, delivering upon our product road map that leverages our Unified Security strategy; number two, building our Enterprise Security pipeline and go-to-market capabilities; number three, improving our cost structure further; and number four, continuing to efficiently allocate capital. I'll now cover each one of these priorities, starting with the first, delivering upon our product road map that leverages our Unified Security strategy.
On a daily basis, Chief Information Security Officers and Security Operations Analysts are overwhelmed by the vast number of security alerts that make it difficult to pinpoint advanced threats attacking their IT environments. Moreover, attacks are constantly evolving and leveraging a variety of techniques. 
This leaves traditional point solution vendors that are only focused on a specific attack method at a disadvantage. Protecting against these advanced attacks involves a unified approach to security to guard against multiple attack methods and an understanding of global threats in real time. This is Symantec's strategy, which leverages our install base and competitive differentiation and using a big data approach to understand more about the threat landscape than any of our competitors.
The first generation of products leveraging our Unified Security strategy are new solutions in the areas of advanced threat protection, data loss prevention, cybersecurity services and applications that run on our Unified Security Analytics platform. In total, we have launched 6 of the 12 new Enterprise Security products we outlined last year at our Financial Analyst Day. We plan to release the remaining half within the next 2 quarters and have an additional set of new products in the pipeline for the second half of fiscal 2017.
The first 3 of these, our newly-released advanced threat or protection ATP solutions, harness threat telemetry from the major control points of endpoint, email and network to not only detect, correlate and prioritize but also remediate threats. This solution does this all from one console without adding an additional endpoint agent. 
Key differentiators of Symantec's ATP approach are a cloud-based expandable sandboxing capability that works without expensive on-premise hardware as well as the ability to correlate threats across the control points within an enterprise and against Symantec's global real-time intelligence network. 
In recent independent, third-party testing from Miercom and Dennis Technology Labs, Symantec's ATP solutions received the highest scores across all test categories against vendors, including FireEye, Cisco, Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet, meaning we stopped more attacks and blocked more threats with fewer false positives than any of our competitors.
Our ATP solutions build upon a key core offering, Symantec's Endpoint Protection or SEP, which is our largest product line within Enterprise Security and which is delivering next-generation endpoint protection today. Many competitors are delivering only a subset of endpoint protection techniques. As a result, customers would be required to install numerous agents on their endpoints to match the same level of protection that we deliver today with SEP. This slows performance at the endpoint and is cumbersome to manage. 
Symantec Endpoint Protection already combines multiple advanced protection engines across intrusion prevention, whitelisting, behavior-based machine learning, signature-less detection of malware and suspicious activity, automation, application control, clustering and remediation all deployed from a single agent. This layered approach, which includes multiple protection engines, goes far beyond antivirus and delivering next-generation capability, which is already being delivered to our more than 300,000 endpoint customers, protecting over 110 million endpoints and enterprises. This is the install base for which we are targeting our ATP solutions.
In Our cybersecurity service offerings, Symantec is also delivering Unified Security capabilities to customers through our managed security offering. This service monitors Symantec's solutions as well as third-party security products to correlate threats against Symantec's global real-time intelligence network. In many cases, our managed security service operates side-by-side in existing customer's SOC to act as complementary protection capability or layered defense against attackers. And Symantec has been named a leader 12 times in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Managed Security Services.
Finally, we will also deliver Unified Security capability through new applications that will sit on top of our analytics platform and leverage the vast threat data we see globally and in real time. Risk Insight, which benchmarks and enterprises security posture against peers, is the first in a series of applications we plan to build on top of this platform. The solution is currently running in beta at a large financial services company and will become generally available this quarter. We are excited about this wave of innovation at Symantec, which is resulting in the most robust, organically developed product cycle in our history.
Now onto the second of our 4 priorities, which is building Enterprise Security pipeline by improving our go-to-market capabilities. Building robust pipeline incorporates strong brand recognition, a robust channel program, lead generation and focused sales plays. To educate the channel on our next-generation security portfolio and product road map, we conducted partner conferences across our 3 major geographies and special training sessions, which included meeting with over 1,000 partners. 
During the quarter, we saw early momentum from the global system integrators and now are focusing to further enable our VARs, distributors, service providers and cloud providers. Additionally, we have launched a set of focused field sales plays aimed at driving new product sales in our install base as well as replacing competition. 
For example, our ATP cross-sell campaign has identified over 3,000 accounts that have a SEP installation, which represent over tens of millions of control points. Within those accounts, we have identified a subset that are immediate candidates for our ATP solution over the next 5 quarters as they have an upcoming endpoint or email renewal. 
We are already seeing positive results despite ATP only being generally available for just over 30 days. As of February 1, we had nearly 1,200 customers that have either attended an ATP webinar or engaged with a Symantec expert, over 350 customers who are actively evaluating our ATP solutions and dozens of initial wins. 
One of the most notable wins was with a U.S. food manufacturer and existing SEP and email customer who purchased our full ATP Endpoint, Email and Gateway solution to monitor over 10,000 control points. This customer reviewed competitive offerings and selected Symantec, given our integrated suite, single console and no need to deploy a new endpoint agent. 
Another example of a new go-to-market offering is how we're helping customers securely transition to Office 365 by leveraging our recently launched bundle that includes DLP for cloud, User Authentication and our .cloud email solution. Our Office 365 solution provides customers a cloud-based solution that secures inbound and outbound data for customers as they transition those workloads and associated administration to the cloud. 
With cloud-based workloads, it's even more important to ensure an authorized user is accessing information that is encrypted traffic and that data that shouldn't leave a customer's environment doesn't leave. Symantec's bundle combines these security capabilities for our customers. We're currently in discussions with many existing and prospective customers who plan to migrate tens of thousands of users to Office 365. Some will be brand-new wins for us and others will be an upsell opportunity.
Our third priority is continuing to improve our cost structure, now that the divestiture of Veritas is complete. We're announcing today a target of $400 million in cost reduction to be achieved over the next 2 years. Specifically, over the next 18 months, we plan to eliminate $130 million of TSAs and stranded costs, resulting from the sale of Veritas, of which there are large opportunities in the areas of IT infrastructure and real estate. 
Beyond the impact of TSAs and stranded costs, we believe we can achieve further reductions across the company. The majority of these incremental savings will benefit us in fiscal 2018 and beyond. As a result, we expect to reach a 30% operating margin as we enter fiscal 2018.
Now our fourth priority, capital allocation. Our management team and board believe proper capital allocation is key to maximizing long-term shareholder value. And we have demonstrated this with a consistent track record of returning capital through dividends and share buybacks. We continue that consistent track record with our announcement today that we will return $5 billion in additional capital to shareholders by the end of March 2017 through a special dividend and share repurchases, bringing our total capital return in connection with the Veritas transaction to $5.5 billion.
Next, I'd like to provide an overview of Q3 results. Enterprise Security revenue increased 1% year-over-year, the third consecutive quarter of revenue growth, driven by 15% growth from Information Protection. Specifically, DLP again grew double digits. We are witnessing a resurgence in DLP demand across industries beyond the traditional verticals of financial services and health care that we've sold into, as more organizations realize they need to secure their intellectual property. We are the best positioned company to capitalize on this opportunity, which is further demonstrated by our market share, which is twice the size of the closest competition and our recognition as a leader in Gartner's January 2016 Data Loss Prevention Magic Quadrant.
Moving to our Consumer Security business. Revenues here declined 6%, which was at the better end of our down 6% to 8% expectation and an improvement from Q2. During the quarter, we signed an agreement with a large Indian telco to provide paid mobile security services to their customers. This is significant as monetizing the mobile opportunity is still in its infancy when compared with traditional form factors. 
We believe mobile security sold through partners will be one of the levers to return the consumer business to growth over the long term. As Thomas will describe in more detail, we are on track to convert our entire customer base to a subscription service and acquire more new customers directly online. Further, as we execute against our broader consumer product road map, we will expand the Norton offering to address broader personal privacy and home IoT security opportunity. 
In summary, I believe we are well positioned for acceleration in fiscal year 2017. Our Consumer business will see moderating decline while remaining extremely profitable at greater than 50% operating margins. We expect our Enterprise Security business to continue to grow in fiscal year '17 based on the strengthening product portfolio and building pipeline. Finally, we have a focused organization to execute against our priorities.
Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our third quarter financial results and guidance for our fourth quarter. Thomas?"

Third quarter total revenue was $909 million, a decline of 2% year-over-year, and was above the midpoint of our guided range on a constant-currency basis. In Q3, approximately 88% of revenue is recurring in nature, 5%",1128,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon. Third quarter total revenue was $909 million, a decline of 2% year-over-year, and was above the midpoint of our guided range on a constant-currency basis. In Q3, approximately 88% of revenue is recurring in nature, 5% is perpetual and 7% is from services. Over time, we expect recurring revenue to become a larger portion of overall revenue as more products are sold as a subscription.
Deferred revenue was $2.5 billion, which includes $396 million deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied Billings, excluding Veritas, were $865 million. The U.S. dollar appreciated against most major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of approximately $40 million to third quarter revenue on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 27.9% and exceeded our guided range. Excluding the impact from the TSA costs, non-GAAP operating margin would have been approximately 30%, which is in line with our margin target. Non-GAAP net income was $172 million, resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.26, above the high end of our guidance.
Let me now provide further detail on our revenue performance by product area. Enterprise Security revenue was up 1% year-over-year. Enterprise Security operating margins were 5%. To note, Enterprise Security carries a higher burden of stranded costs. 
Within Enterprise Security, Threat Protection was down 4%, and within Threat Protection, Endpoint Protection grew in low single digits. Offsetting this growth was continued weakness in our Endpoint Management solution, which will soon be refreshed with our new unified Endpoint Management platform available this quarter. 
Information Protection revenue grew 15%, driven by both Data Loss Prevention, DLP, and User Authentication, was both up double digits year-over-year. During the quarter, we closed over 2 dozens new DLP deals greater than $300,000, including one of the largest health care systems in the nation, where we beat out the competition to replace a legacy installation with our market-leading DLP solution.
Cyber Security Services, CSS, was flat year-over-year. During the quarter, we opened a Singapore SOC, which should further accelerate our expansion internationally. We are seeing positive underlying trends in CSS from both a secular and an execution standpoint and expect the business to improve its revenue growth performance in fiscal year 2017.
Website security grew 3%. We continue to be the de facto standard for enterprise-level customers to secure their websites, which is a stable and profitable business. Beyond the enterprise, we see demand for encryption and authentication accelerating, as security and privacy imperatives and identify and applications like eCommerce grow among businesses of all sizes, which we believe represents at least 40 million additional websites worldwide of opportunity for our solutions.
Now on to the Norton Consumer Security segment. Third quarter Consumer Security revenue was down 6% and operating margins were 56%. However, we are seeing improvement in the underlying fundamentals of the customer business -- Consumer Business performance, which gives us confidence that revenue performance will continue to improve. 
From a business modeling standpoint, we evaluate the Consumer Security business based on 4 primary factors: customer satisfaction, subscriber renewal rates, new subscriber growth and pricing. For competitive reasons, we do not quantify those metrics externally but believe it would be helpful to directionally describe our performance. 
First, customer satisfaction. We track our progress through Net Promoter Score, which is one of the highest in our industry and expect that metric to trend higher. Second, renewal rates. We have completed the transition to subscription globally. This quarter, we've reached the 1-year anniversary of subscription transition in the U.S. and will reach the 1-year anniversary in Europe at the end of fiscal second -- '17 second quarter. Customers on subscription renew at a significantly higher rate than those not in subscription. We expect renewal rates to continue to improve over the medium term as we transition more customers to subscription, and the acquisition makes continuous moving towards digital channels.
Third, new customer acquisition. We are focusing on acquiring more customers online and through ISPs, as those channels have proven higher lifetime values. During the quarter, new subscriptions from online again grew 8% year-over-year. This represents approximately half of new acquisition.
Lastly, we expect pricing to remain healthy as we deliver increased value to our customers in the form of next-generation consumer Endpoint Protection. Given the steady improvement in both renewal rates and new customer additions, we believe we are exiting the trough of the consumer business decline.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operations -- operating activities for the December quarter totaled $153 million and includes $56 million in outflows related to separation cost. Capital expenditures were $114 million in Q3. We expect capital expenditures for Q4 to be approximately $50 million to $60 million.
Now turning to capital return. As we mentioned previously, we would update our capital return plan post the completion of the Veritas sale. We will now be returning $5.5 billion, which include the $500 million ASR that we executed in Q3 and an additional capital return of $5 billion. The $5 billion will be executed through a $4 per share special dividend, which will amount to $2.7 billion and a $2.3 billion share repurchase program to be completed by March 2017. 
The record date for the special dividend payable to shareholders will be close of business on March 8, 2016, and the dividend will be payable on March 22. Once we complete the special dividend, we'll initiate our stock repurchase program. We expect to execute approximately $900 million of share repurchases within Q4. After the completion of the capital return, we'll have returned more cash to shareholders than the net cash proceeds from the sale of Veritas. 
Lastly, we're adjusting our ongoing quarterly dividend to a $0.075 a share starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This adjustment reflects our lower domestic free cash flow post Veritas sale, but still represents a significant payout ratio on domestically generated free cash flow. We are committed to increasing this dividend as free cash flow grows over time.
Now turning to guidance. Our constant currency Q4 revenue guidance of down 4% to flat is slightly higher than our previous guidance. We now expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 26% to 28%, down slightly from our previous guidance due to a negative impact from currency. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.24 to $0.27, in line with our previous guidance as the lower tax rate offsets the decrease in operating margin expectations. We will provide fiscal 2017 guidance when we report our Q4 results in May.
In conclusion, we are seeing the underlying fundamentals of the business improve, and we are well positioned to execute on the second half of our transformation. Now I will turn the call back over to Jon."

So here's how we're thinking about it. From a revenue standpoint and thinking about the 2 segments, on the consumer side, we expect consumer business to perform basically in line with the outlook that we've been providing, so moderating declines as we go forward. And our guidance is really is consistent with what we provided at the Financial Analyst Day. Our Consumer business is very much on track. 
On the Enterprise side equation, it's more difficult to forecast. And we're in a period now where we have so many new products as I talked about in my remarks. And until we have some better visibility into the traction that we see converting that pipeline into revenue, we would rather be -- we'd rather be conservative with our thoughts about the Enterprise side. But I think it's fair to say that we'll be looking at where we finished Q4, and we will expect that, that will be the starting point. And we would expect to grow modestly from where we finished Q4 as we go throughout fiscal year '17. 
On the margin side, we should keep in mind a few things. Number one, seasonality -- from a seasonal standpoint, margins are typically down for us from Q4 to Q1. And as we've also talked about, we have significant amount of these stranded costs supporting Veritas and the stranded costs obviously that we need to take out. That accounts for about 200 basis points of margin. If you add those 200 basis points to the margin we reported today, you'd see we were at -- which is 28%, you'd see we were at the 30% target. But as we go forward into fiscal year '17, we're expecting that the reported -- as reported non-GAAP margins where we're not able to adjust for those stranded costs will be about the 200 basis points lower than what we'd see in FY '16. So lower operating margins -- and that's our task as we begin this effort to take out $400 million in costs over 2 years to ensure that those are eliminated. So as we start the following fiscal year, fiscal year '18, we'll be able to start that back at our target of 30%. So that gives you a little bit of a feel how we're thinking about it."

So I think we can do better there. And I think when we think about the capabilities that we're bringing, especially with ATP, we see that as a big opportunity. As many of you all on the call have commented, 2016 is likely to be the Renaissance of the Endpoint. Now that we're through a major refresh of firewalls, next-generation firewalls, many CISOs are turning to the Endpoint because that's where unencrypted data lives. And that's where they're looking to be more effective against attacks. So when we think about the combination of capabilities that we're offering, we think it's unparalleled in the marketplace. So just a couple of examples. We believe we're the only player effectively providing advanced attack protection across all vectors, so that's what our ATP solution does. You're really able to stop attacks and correlate them, that might have been aimed at the network or email or endpoint, we could correlate those. The second, as I talked about in my remarks, we're using multiple advanced techniques that go well beyond static signatures, things like behavior monitoring, machine learning, global intelligence, advanced analytics. So we've already got multiple protection engines that are incorporated in SEP. The third would be the ability to remediate attacks. That comes with our ATP solutions. So it's not just about protection but what can I do to remediate a situation. And then one of the things that Symantec has a strength in relative to some startup competitor is it's obviously delivering endpoint protection at scale without performance drag because we can provide all these capabilities with a single agent. So we think we're really in an unmatched position now, and adding the ATP capability gives us even stronger leadership. So we're still, as you'd expect, very excited about the Endpoint. We think the capabilities we're adding with ATP solutions really make us the leader again in terms of the technology to protect as well as remediate attacks at the endpoint."

There's a feeling that Symantec as being a legacy vendor really is providing antivirus protection and that's all. So what's true is we're providing antivirus. So when I talk about multiple protection engines, antivirus is just one of those. We often call that signature-based technology for protection. But here's where we're adding those multiple layers. So we spent years developing, through our advanced research, these multiple techniques to protect you so that we can see what attacks are frankly coming in across the network. So frankly, the capability that stops more attacks than antivirus is something called intrusion prevention that's really scanning what is the traffic coming in over the network. That blocks more attacks than antivirus today. And we combined that with other techniques that we talked about, behavior. We use the wisdom of crowds to understand what are the reputations as endpoint users might go out to access other files or URL addresses. And again, the vast telemetry that we collect keeps reputations on those 25 billion files, 30 billion URLs. So we'll block the user from going to an infected site or opening an infected file before they do that. So it's again, these multiple protection engines and techniques that allow us to provide that best protection at the endpoint. So a lot of competitors like to think we're just antivirus. But it's far from the truth."

And then we said we are going to increase the dividend, if cash flow allows for that, but I think those are 2 separate topics. One is the capital return, very efficient capital return of the Veritas proceeds, and the other decision is around how we adjust the smaller footprint. But keep in mind, we are still -- even the reduced dividend is still a majority of our domestically generated cash flow moving forward."

On the top line question, focusing on the consumer side of the equation, it sounds like starting to trend in the right direction. Can you talk to us about sort of how you guys are thinking about distribution on a going-forward basis? You're seeing good traction with the electronic distribution. Is there a potential sort of extending that back out into maybe -- putting your toe in the water, getting back in some of the OEM relationships? How should we think about how you're going to get the net new subscriber here on out, how are you going to sort of turn that ship fully around and actually start to get growth in that consumer side of the equation? That's the revenue question. Then the strategic question is just, given the big chunk of cash returned that's coming from Veritas, how does this impact? How you guys think about M&A and potential deals on a going-forward basis? Does this kind of have the security towards smaller deals versus something larger, given that you are given back that you are getting to invest so much of this cash?"

And we think that is achievable over the long term, meaning over the next several years. So whi",594,"So Keith, thanks for the question on the Consumer business because it gives us an opportunity to say, our goal is to -- return the consumer business to growth. And we think that is achievable over the long term, meaning over the next several years. So while we're not forecasting that for next year, as we continue to work through the transitions that we've already began in the consumer business, we clearly see that as an opportunity, meaning returning business to top line revenue growth over a longer time frame. And distribution is a key part of that. So most important for us was making sure that we build a stronger foundation for the business. That has to do with reducing the churn rate, and of course, what we've done primarily there is move to a subscription. And what we're seeing as we're now reaching the 1-year anniversary of customers who started in a subscription is that the retention rate of those customers is significantly higher than what we had before within auto renewal program where they needed to proactively sign up year after year. So staying in a subscription, of course, means that they continue to be protected and pay us year after year without an opt-in. And the retention rates are significantly higher, we're already seeing that in the business. That's important because that gives us a stronger model from which to approach OEMs. So if we had lower retention rate, higher churn rates, an OEM customer doesn't make as much sense. So now that we are fixing the foundation in the business, meaning improving the retention rate, now there's an opportunity to think about expanding distribution. So today, we're primarily acquiring new customers through online acquisition. And Thomas talked about the fact that we're up 8% year-over-year in terms of our online acquisition. So one part of our channel growing there. The second part that's growing from a channel perspective is the new customers we're acquiring through large partners. These tend to be cable or telco companies. And I talked in my remarks about the fact that a new opportunity for us there is monetizing mobile customers. We're starting to do that really for the first time. Then as we look at retail and OEM, OEM has been in decline for us but now with the stronger model, it will be time for us to think about OEMs again, and in fact, we're competing for a major OEM contract this year. So we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. But with a stronger model, we'll be in a great position to be competitive there and have that be profitable witness Symantec, which as we talked about was a different with some of those OEM contract before. They weren't profitable for us and our churn rate was such that we weren't able to generate the right lifetime customer value. Moving on to your second question about our balance sheet and strategic flexibility. We do not believe that the capital return program limits our strategic flexibility in the least. So we'll -- as you are aware, we'll have a very strong balance sheet going forward. We estimate we'll have something in the neighborhood of $5 billion in cash as we end fiscal year '17, with strong 9cash flow generation capabilities. So we do not feel what limits our strategic flexibility, and we're going to continue to think about what is the right other capabilities that we like to add to Symantec that are tightly aligned with this Unified Security strategy."

You would expect that the margin for a standalone software business in this space is getting double digit.

We have a very strong balance sheet and strong cash flow. But we will be very judicious as we think about this. I mean, if you look at our track record for the last 18 months or so, we've only done 2 small acquisitions. Those were very tightly aligned with the strategy that we've talked about, meaning they significantly add to Unified Security.

So we're going to continue to be very judicious as we think about what are the right assets that need to be tightly aligned with the strategy, and they need to make financial sense over a similar timeframe, meaning a couple year timeframe for us.

How do I protect myself, knowing that there are threats that might have occurred in another part of the world aimed at the same vertical that I am in? And that's where I think our strategy is really resonating. So if you think about what we described with ATP, we're giving customers a view across their entire enterprise, and then we're giving them access to the global threat intelligence that we have. And we're finding that customers are looking for that ability to find a needle in the haystack. How do I see that attack if I'm a bank that's occurred in an Australian bank today because the attackers are trying to leverage their business model, so really they're just replicating whatever attacks that worked with another vertical in another part of the world. So that's why I think the Symantec intelligence network really pays off.

We had a lot of moving parts with the separation and the restructuring cost and also CapEx impact on the separation side really being able to separate specially the IT infrastructure. So a normalized operating cash flow number globally is probably in the neighborhood of $700 million. And then we will have to look at fiscal year '17, the gives and takes that are coming from putting a more efficient capital structure in place that will have an impact and also how the -- how we approach the cost reduction of $400 million is going to have an impact on that number. So there will be a baseline, and we'll have to make gives and takes on that number. And then as we generate and make progress on the $400 million cost reduction, that will be a significant tailwind moving forward. So I think the run rate number I gave is a good run rate number, and then we'll be more precise at our next earnings call so I think by then we understand really what the gives and takes are going to be over the fiscal year '17."

So what we view this in is that the install base is growing going but growing slowly at this point. So that's the broader context. Now an opportunity for us is to move beyond traditional PC form factor into mobile. We talked about that a bit today. We also talked about additional products that we can add that use Norton's capabilities. We talked about other capabilities like privacy in the home, like what we could do for IoT as we protect the other devices in the home. So I think there are other product opportunities that go beyond the traditional PC form factor but the overwhelming proportion of our business today obviously is PC. Then as we look at the changes we've made in Norton, which are primarily from a channel perspective, significant declines in OEM and retail as we focused on online acquisition and partners. Now that we have a stronger model, as we discussed earlier, which means higher lifetime customer value that we achieved by moving people to subscription, we can look again at where does it make sense to grow in retail and OEM. In fact, retail for the regions outside of North America is already growing again. We don't have that growing in North America but that's something that we have as a goal for this coming year. And then we talked about early in the call, given the strength of the model, we can also look at OEMs as well. So I'm quite optimistic that over the long term, there are enough opportunities for Norton to be able to grow. It's just going to take us a little while to realize those opportunities, Phil.

Speakers on today's call are Mike Brown, Symantec's President and CEO; and Thomas Seifert, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our website. 
I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Implied Billings refer to revenue plus the change in sequential deferred revenue. We provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, except for statements about net income and EPS.
I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates for you. Mike Brown will be presenting at the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on February 29 and attending the JMP Technology Conference on March 1 in San Francisco. Thomas Seifert will be presenting at the Raymond James Institutional Investor Conference in Orlando on March 7. We intend to announce fourth quarter earnings on May 12 and will be hosting a Financial Analyst Day on May 26 in New York City. 
Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.
Please refer to cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You'll also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, in our annual report on Form 10-K in the year ended April 3, 2015. 
In connection with the Veritas sale, we have provided 7 quarters of recast GAAP and non-GAAP financial income statements, third quarter and prior year-end balance sheets and GAAP cash flow statements for the trailing 3 quarters and fiscal year 2015. All non-GAAP revenue and expenses exclude the impact of Veritas. However, the continuing operations deferred revenue on the balance sheet and the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement includes a portion of Veritas deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered into prior to operational separation. The Veritas deferred revenue from those contracts will amortize into discontinued operations.
As a result, implied billings growth calculated from change in deferred on the balance sheet or cash flow statement will not be representative of standalone Symantec's performance as it will include an impact from Veritas. This quarter and going forward, we will disclose the amount of deferred revenue on the balance sheet that will represent standalone Symantec for calculating implied billings. 
And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mike Brown. Go ahead, Mike."

I am pleased first to announce that Silver Lake Partners has made a $500 million strategic investment, which is a strong vote of confidence in both our transformation as well as our future as the world leader in cyber",2034,"Thanks, Jonathan, and good afternoon. I am pleased first to announce that Silver Lake Partners has made a $500 million strategic investment, which is a strong vote of confidence in both our transformation as well as our future as the world leader in cybersecurity. Additionally, I'm excited to have Ken Hao, Silver Lake Managing Partner, join our board, given his deep expertise in technology and track record of creating value.
As you know, we have been undergoing a 3-year transformation which began in April 2014. At that time, we laid out 5 priorities that we have since successfully executed against: first, managing our businesses with a portfolio approach, which included divesting Veritas and improving the profitability of our consumer business while we invest for growth in Enterprise Security; second, within Enterprise Security, we have been investing for growth by reallocating R&D spending to high-growth markets; third, improving our cost structure where we have improved non-GAAP operating margins to 28% this quarter; fourth, building a talented executive team, including new C-level leadership across most major functions; and fifth, returning significant cash to shareholders, with $2.1 billion in total share repurchases and dividends since April 2014.
During this period, we also developed a well-articulated strategy for our security business, which we call Unified Security. This strategy leverages our key competitive differentiator, the global scale and footprint of our large install base where we can correlate threats that our products and services see with Symantec's Global Intelligence Network, the 8 trillion objects we monitor globally and in real time. After completing the divestiture of Veritas, we are a more focused company as the world leader in cybersecurity.
The second half of our transformation plan began last October and is focused on 4 priorities: number one, delivering upon our product road map that leverages our Unified Security strategy; number two, building our Enterprise Security pipeline and go-to-market capabilities; number three, improving our cost structure further; and number four, continuing to efficiently allocate capital. I'll now cover each one of these priorities, starting with the first, delivering upon our product road map that leverages our Unified Security strategy.
On a daily basis, Chief Information Security Officers and Security Operations Analysts are overwhelmed by the vast number of security alerts that make it difficult to pinpoint advanced threats attacking their IT environments. Moreover, attacks are constantly evolving and leveraging a variety of techniques. 
This leaves traditional point solution vendors that are only focused on a specific attack method at a disadvantage. Protecting against these advanced attacks involves a unified approach to security to guard against multiple attack methods and an understanding of global threats in real time. This is Symantec's strategy, which leverages our install base and competitive differentiation and using a big data approach to understand more about the threat landscape than any of our competitors.
The first generation of products leveraging our Unified Security strategy are new solutions in the areas of advanced threat protection, data loss prevention, cybersecurity services and applications that run on our Unified Security Analytics platform. In total, we have launched 6 of the 12 new Enterprise Security products we outlined last year at our Financial Analyst Day. We plan to release the remaining half within the next 2 quarters and have an additional set of new products in the pipeline for the second half of fiscal 2017.
The first 3 of these, our newly-released advanced threat or protection ATP solutions, harness threat telemetry from the major control points of Endpoint, email and network to not only detect, correlate and prioritize but also remediate threats. This solution does this all from one console without adding an additional Endpoint agent. 
Key differentiators of Symantec's ATP approach are a cloud-based expandable sandboxing capability that works without expensive on-premise hardware as well as the ability to correlate threats across the control points within an enterprise and against Symantec's global real-time intelligence network. 
In recent independent, third-party testing from Miercom and Dennis Technology Labs, Symantec's ATP solutions received the highest scores across all test categories against vendors, including FireEye, Cisco, Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet, meaning we stopped more attacks and blocked more threats with fewer false positives than any of our competitors.
Our ATP solutions build upon a key core offering, Symantec's Endpoint Protection or SEP, which is our largest product line within Enterprise Security and which is delivering next-generation Endpoint Protection today. Many competitors are delivering only a subset of Endpoint Protection techniques. As a result, customers would be required to install numerous agents on their endpoints to match the same level of protection that we deliver today with SEP. This slows performance at the Endpoint and is cumbersome to manage. 
Symantec Endpoint Protection already combines multiple advanced protection engines across intrusion prevention, whitelisting, behavior-based machine learning, signature-less detection of malware and suspicious activity, automation, application control, clustering and remediation all deployed from a single agent. This layered approach, which includes multiple protection engines, goes far beyond antivirus and delivering next-generation capability, which is already being delivered to our more than 300,000 Endpoint customers, protecting over 110 million endpoints and enterprises. This is the install base for which we are targeting our ATP solutions.
In our cybersecurity service offerings, Symantec is also delivering Unified Security capabilities to customers through our managed security offering. This service monitors Symantec's solutions as well as third-party security products to correlate threats against Symantec's global real-time intelligence network. In many cases, our managed security service operates side-by-side in existing customer's SOC to act as complementary protection capability or layered defense against attackers. And Symantec has been named a leader 12 times in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Managed Security Services.
Finally, we will also deliver Unified Security capability through new applications that will sit on top of our analytics platform and leverage the vast threat data we see globally and in real time. Risk Insight, which benchmarks and enterprises security posture against peers, is the first in a series of applications we plan to build on top of this platform. The solution is currently running in beta at a large financial services company and will become generally available this quarter. We are excited about this wave of innovation at Symantec, which is resulting in the most robust, organically developed product cycle in our history.
Now onto the second of our 4 priorities, which is building Enterprise Security pipeline by improving our go-to-market capabilities. Building robust pipeline incorporates strong brand recognition, a robust channel program, lead generation and focused sales plays. To educate the channel on our next-generation security portfolio and product road map, we conducted partner conferences across our 3 major geographies and special training sessions, which included meeting with over 1,000 partners. 
During the quarter, we saw early momentum from the global system integrators and now are focusing to further enable our VARs, distributors, service providers and cloud providers. Additionally, we have launched a set of focused field sales plays aimed at driving new product sales in our install base as well as replacing competition. 
For example, our ATP cross-sell campaign has identified over 3,000 accounts that have a SEP installation, which represent over tens of millions of control points. Within those accounts, we have identified a subset that are immediate candidates for our ATP solution over the next 5 quarters as they have an upcoming Endpoint or Email renewal. 
We are already seeing positive results despite ATP only being generally available for just over 30 days. As of February 1, we had nearly 1,200 customers that have either attended an ATP webinar or engaged with a Symantec expert, over 350 customers who are actively evaluating our ATP solutions and dozens of initial wins. 
One of the most notable wins was with a U.S. food manufacturer and existing SEP and email customer who purchased our full ATP Endpoint, Email and Gateway solution to monitor over 10,000 control points. This customer reviewed competitive offerings and selected Symantec, given our integrated suite, single console and no need to deploy a new Endpoint agent. 
Another example of a new go-to-market offering is how we're helping customers securely transition to Office 365 by leveraging our recently launched bundle that includes DLP for cloud, User Authentication and our .cloud email solution. Our Office 365 solution provides customers a cloud-based solution that secures inbound and outbound data for customers as they transition those workloads and associated administration to the cloud. 
With cloud-based workloads, it's even more important to ensure an authorized user is accessing information, that it's encrypted traffic and that data that shouldn't leave a customer's environment doesn't leave. Symantec's bundle combines these security capabilities for our customers. We're currently in discussions with many existing and prospective customers who plan to migrate tens of thousands of users to Office 365. Some will be brand-new wins for us and others will be an upsell opportunity.
Our third priority is continuing to improve our cost structure, now that the divestiture of Veritas is complete. We're announcing today a target of $400 million in cost reductions to be achieved over the next 2 years. Specifically, over the next 18 months, we plan to eliminate $130 million of TSAs and stranded costs, resulting from the sale of Veritas, of which there are large opportunities in the areas of IT infrastructure and real estate. 
Beyond the impact of TSAs and stranded costs, we believe we can achieve further reductions across the company. The majority of these incremental savings will benefit us in fiscal 2018 and beyond. As a result, we expect to reach a 30% operating margin as we enter fiscal 2018.
Now our fourth priority, capital allocation. Our management team and board believe proper capital allocation is key to maximizing long-term shareholder value. And we have demonstrated this with a consistent track record of returning capital through dividends and share buybacks. We continue that consistent track record with our announcement today that we will return $5 billion in additional capital to shareholders by the end of March 2017 through a special dividend and share repurchases, bringing our total capital return in connection with the Veritas transaction to $5.5 billion.
Next, I'd like to provide an overview of Q3 results. Enterprise Security revenue increased 1% year-over-year, the third consecutive quarter of revenue growth, driven by 15% growth from Information Protection. Specifically, DLP again grew double digits. We are witnessing a resurgence in DLP demand across industries beyond the traditional verticals of financial services and health care that we've sold into, as more organizations realize they need to secure their intellectual property. We are the best positioned company to capitalize on this opportunity, which is further demonstrated by our market share, which is twice the size of the closest competition and our recognition as a leader in Gartner's January 2016 Data Loss Prevention Magic Quadrant.
Moving to our Consumer Security business. Revenues here declined 6%, which was at the better end of our down 6% to 8% expectation and an improvement from Q2. During the quarter, we signed an agreement with a large Indian telco to provide paid mobile security services to their customers. This is significant as monetizing the mobile opportunity is still in its infancy when compared with traditional form factors. 
We believe mobile security sold through partners will be one of the levers to return the consumer business to growth over the long term. As Thomas will describe in more detail, we are on track to convert our entire customer base to a subscription service and acquire more new customers directly online. Further, as we execute against our broader consumer product road map, we will expand the Norton offering to address broader personal privacy and home IoT security opportunity. 
In summary, I believe we are well positioned for acceleration in fiscal year 2017. Our Consumer business will see moderating decline while remaining extremely profitable at greater than 50% operating margins. We expect our Enterprise Security business to continue to grow in fiscal year '17 based on the strengthening product portfolio and building pipeline. Finally, we have a focused organization to execute against our priorities.
Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our third quarter financial results and guidance for our fourth quarter. Thomas?"

Third quarter total revenue was $909 million, a decline of 2% year-over-year, and was above the midpoint of our guided range on a constant-currency basis. In Q3, approximately 88% of revenue is recurring in nature, 5%",1129,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon. Third quarter total revenue was $909 million, a decline of 2% year-over-year, and was above the midpoint of our guided range on a constant-currency basis. In Q3, approximately 88% of revenue is recurring in nature, 5% is perpetual and 7% is from services. Over time, we expect recurring revenue to become a larger portion of overall revenue as more products are sold as a subscription.
Deferred revenue was $2.5 billion, which includes $396 million deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied Billings, excluding Veritas, were $865 million. The U.S. dollar appreciated against most major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of approximately $40 million to third quarter revenue on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 27.9% and exceeded our guided range. Excluding the impact from the TSA costs, non-GAAP operating margin would have been approximately 30%, which is in line with our margin target. Non-GAAP net income was $172 million, resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.26, above the high end of our guidance.
Let me now provide further detail on our revenue performance by product area. Enterprise Security revenue was up 1% year-over-year. Enterprise Security operating margins were 5%. To note, Enterprise Security carries a higher burden of stranded costs. 
Within Enterprise Security, Threat Protection was down 4%, and within Threat Protection, Endpoint Protection grew in low single digits. Offsetting this growth was continued weakness in our Endpoint Management solution, which will soon be refreshed with our new unified Endpoint Management platform available this quarter. 
Information Protection revenue grew 15%, driven by both Data Loss Prevention, DLP, and User Authentication, was both up double digits year-over-year. During the quarter, we closed over 2 dozens new DLP deals greater than $300,000, including one of the largest health care systems in the nation, where we beat out the competition to replace a legacy installation with our market-leading DLP solution.
Cyber Security Services, CSS, was flat year-over-year. During the quarter, we opened a Singapore SOC, which should further accelerate our expansion internationally. We are seeing positive underlying trends in CSS from both a secular and an execution standpoint and expect the business to improve its revenue growth performance in fiscal year 2017.
Website security grew 3%. We continue to be the de facto standard for enterprise-level customers to secure their websites, which is a stable and profitable business. Beyond the enterprise, we see demand for encryption and authentication accelerating, as security and privacy imperatives and identify and applications like eCommerce grow among businesses of all sizes, which we believe represents at least 40 million additional websites worldwide of opportunity for our solutions.
Now on to the Norton Consumer Security segment. Third quarter Consumer Security revenue was down 6% and operating margins were 56%. However, we are seeing improvement in the underlying fundamentals of the customer business -- Consumer Business performance, which gives us confidence that revenue performance will continue to improve. 
From a business modeling standpoint, we evaluate the Consumer Security business based on 4 primary factors: customer satisfaction, subscriber renewal rates, new subscriber growth and pricing. For competitive reasons, we do not quantify those metrics externally but believe it would be helpful to directionally describe our performance. 
First, customer satisfaction. We track our progress through Net Promoter Score, which is one of the highest in our industry and expect that metric to trend higher. Second, renewal rates. We have completed the transition to subscription globally. This quarter, we've reached the 1-year anniversary of subscription transition in the U.S. and will reach the 1-year anniversary in Europe at the end of fiscal second -- '17 second quarter. Customers on subscription renew at a significantly higher rate than those not in subscription. We expect renewal rates to continue to improve over the medium term as we transition more customers to the subscription, and the acquisition mix continuous moving towards digital channels.
Third, new customer acquisition. We are focusing on acquiring more customers online and through ISPs, as those channels have proven higher lifetime values. During the quarter, new subscriptions from online again grew 8% year-over-year. This represents approximately half of new acquisition.
Lastly, we expect pricing to remain healthy as we deliver increased value to our customers in the form of next-generation consumer Endpoint Protection. Given the steady improvement in both renewal rates and new customer additions, we believe we are exiting the trough of the consumer business decline.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operations -- operating activities for the December quarter totaled $153 million and includes $56 million in outflows related to separation cost. Capital expenditures were $114 million in Q3. We expect capital expenditures for Q4 to be approximately $50 million to $60 million.
Now turning to capital return. As we mentioned previously, we would update our capital return plan post the completion of the Veritas sale. We will now be returning $5.5 billion, which include the $500 million ASR that we executed in Q3 and an additional capital return of $5 billion. The $5 billion will be executed through a $4 per share special dividend, which will amount to $2.7 billion and a $2.3 billion share repurchase program to be completed by March 2017. 
The record date for the special dividend payable to shareholders will be close of business on March 8, 2016, and the dividend will be payable on March 22. Once we complete the special dividend, we'll initiate our stock repurchase program. We expect to execute approximately $900 million of share repurchases within Q4. After the completion of the capital return, we'll have returned more cash to shareholders than the net cash proceeds from the sale of Veritas. 
Lastly, we're adjusting our ongoing quarterly dividend to a $0.075 a share starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This adjustment reflects our lower domestic free cash flow post Veritas sale, but still represents a significant payout ratio on domestically generated free cash flow. We are committed to increasing this dividend as free cash flow grows over time.
Now turning to guidance. Our constant currency Q4 revenue guidance of down 4% to flat is slightly higher than our previous guidance. We now expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 26% to 28%, down slightly from our previous guidance due to a negative impact from currency. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.24 to $0.27, in line with our previous guidance as the lower tax rate offsets the decrease in operating margin expectations. We will provide fiscal 2017 guidance when we report our Q4 results in May.

So here's how we're thinking about it. From a revenue standpoint and thinking about the 2 segments, on the consumer side, we expect consumer business to perform basically in line with the outlook that we've been providing, so moderating declines as we go forward. And our guidance is really is consistent with what we provided at the Financial Analyst Day. Our Consumer business is very much on track. 
On the Enterprise side of course, it's more difficult to forecast. And we're in a period now where we have so many new products as I talked about in my remarks. And until we have some better visibility into the traction that we see converting that pipeline into revenue, we would rather be -- we'd rather be conservative with our thoughts about the Enterprise side. But I think it's fair to say that we'll be looking at where we finished Q4, and we will expect that, that will be the starting point. And we would expect to grow modestly from where we finished Q4 as we go throughout fiscal year '17. 
On the margin side, we should keep in mind a few things. Number one, seasonality -- from a seasonal standpoint, margins are typically down for us from Q4 to Q1. And as we've also talked about, we have significant amount of these stranded costs supporting Veritas and the stranded costs obviously that we need to take out. That accounts for about 200 basis points of margin. If you add those 200 basis points to the margin we reported today, you'd see we were at -- which is 28%, you'd see we were at the 30% target. But as we go forward into fiscal year '17, we're expecting that the reported -- as reported non-GAAP margins where we're not able to adjust for those stranded costs will be about the 200 basis points lower than what we'd see in FY '16. So lower operating margins -- and that's our task as we begin this effort to take out $400 million in costs over 2 years to ensure that those are eliminated. So as we start the following fiscal year, fiscal year '18, we'll be able to start that back at our target of 30%. So that gives you a little bit of a feel how we're thinking about it."

So I think we can do better there. And I think when we think about the capabilities that we're bringing, especially with ATP, we see that as a big opportunity. As many of you all on the call have commented, 2016 is likely to be the Renaissance of the Endpoint. Now that we're through a major refresh of firewalls, next-generation firewalls, many CISOs are turning to the Endpoint because that's where unencrypted data lives. And that's where they're looking to be more effective against attacks. So when we think about the combination of capabilities that we're offering, we think it's unparalleled in the marketplace. So just a couple of examples. We believe we're the only player effectively providing advanced attack protection across all vectors, so that's what our ATP solution does. You're really able to stop attacks and correlate them, that might have been aimed at the network or Email or Endpoint, we could correlate those. The second, as I talked about in my remarks, we're using multiple advanced techniques that go well beyond static signatures, things like behavior monitoring, machine learning, global intelligence, advanced analytics. So we've already got multiple protection engines that are incorporated in SEP. The third would be the ability to remediate attacks. That comes with our ATP solutions. So it's not just about protection but what can I do to remediate a situation. And then one of the things that Symantec has a strength in relative to some startup competitor is it's obviously delivering Endpoint Protection at scale without performance drag because we can provide all these capabilities with a single agent. So we think we're really in an unmatched position now, and adding the ATP capability gives us even stronger leadership. So we're still, as you'd expect, very excited about the Endpoint. We think the capabilities we're adding with ATP solutions really make us the leader again in terms of the technology to protect as well as remediate attacks at the Endpoint."

There's a feeling that Symantec as being a legacy vendor really is providing antivirus protection and that's all. So what's true is we're providing antivirus. So when I talk about multiple protection engines, antivirus is just one of those. We often call that signature-based technology for protection. But here's where we're adding those multiple layers. So we spent years developing, through our advanced research, these multiple techniques to protect you so that we can see what attacks are frankly coming in across the network. So frankly, the capability that stops more attacks than antivirus is something called intrusion prevention that's really scanning what is the traffic coming in over the network. That blocks more attacks than antivirus today. And we combined that with other techniques that we talked about, behavior. We use the wisdom of crowds to understand what are the reputations as Endpoint users might go out to access other files or URL addresses. And again, the vast telemetry that we collect keeps reputations on those 25 billion files, 30 billion URLs. So we'll block the user from going to an infected site or opening an infected file before they do that. So it's again, these multiple protection engines and techniques that allow us to provide that best protection at the Endpoint. So a lot of competitors like to think we're just antivirus. But it's far from the truth."

And then we said we are going to increase the dividend, if cash flow allows for that, but I think those are 2 separate topics. One is the capital return, very efficient capital return of the Veritas proceeds, and the other decision is around how we adjust the smaller footprint. But keep in mind, we are still -- even the reduced dividend is still a majority of our domestically generated cash flow moving forward."

On the top line question, focusing on the consumer side of the equation, it sounds like starting to trend in the right direction. Can you talk to us about sort of how you guys are thinking about distribution on a going-forward basis? You're seeing good traction with the electronic distribution. Is there a potential sort of extending that back out into maybe -- putting your toe in the water, getting back in some of the OEM relationships? How should we think about how you're going to get the net new subscriber here on out, how are you going to sort of turn that ship fully around and actually start to get growth in that consumer side of the equation? That's the revenue question. Then the strategic question is just, given the big chunk of cash returned that's coming from Veritas, how does this impact how you guys think about M&A and potential deals on a going-forward basis? Does this kind of have the security towards smaller deals versus something larger, given that you are giving back so much of this cash?"

And we think that is achievable over the long term, meaning over the next several years. So whi",596,"So Keith, thanks for the question on the Consumer business because it gives us an opportunity to say, our goal is to -- return the consumer business to growth. And we think that is achievable over the long term, meaning over the next several years. So while we're not forecasting that for next year, as we continue to work through the transitions that we've already began in the consumer business, we clearly see that as an opportunity, meaning returning business to top line revenue growth over a longer time frame. And distribution is a key part of that. So most important for us was making sure that we build a stronger foundation for the business. That has to do with reducing the churn rate, and of course, what we've done primarily there is move to a subscription. And what we're seeing as we're now reaching the 1-year anniversary of customers who started in a subscription is that the retention rate of those customers is significantly higher than what we had before with an auto renewal program where they needed to proactively sign up year after year. So staying in a subscription, of course, means that they continue to be protected and pay us year after year without an opt-in. And the retention rates are significantly higher, we're already seeing that in the business. That's important because that gives us a stronger model from which to approach OEMs. So if we had lower retention rates, higher churn rates, an OEM customer doesn't make as much sense. So now that we are fixing the foundation in the business, meaning improving the retention rate, now there's an opportunity to think about expanding distribution. So today, we're primarily acquiring new customers through online acquisition. And Thomas talked about the fact that we're up 8% year-over-year in terms of our online acquisition. So one part of our channel growing there. The second part that's growing from a channel perspective is the new customers we're acquiring through large partners. These tend to be cable or telco companies. And I talked in my remarks about the fact that a new opportunity for us there is monetizing mobile customers. We're starting to do that really for the first time. Then as we look at retail and OEM, OEM has been in decline for us but now with the stronger model, it will be time for us to think about OEMs again, and in fact, we're competing for a major OEM contract this year. So we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. But with a stronger model, we'll be in a great position to be competitive there and have that be profitable business for Symantec, which as we talked about was a different with some of those OEM contract before. They weren't profitable for us and our churn rate was such that we weren't able to generate the right lifetime customer value. Moving on to your second question about our balance sheet and strategic flexibility. We do not believe that the capital return program limits our strategic flexibility in the least. So we'll -- as you are aware, we'll have a very strong balance sheet going forward. We estimate we'll have something in the neighborhood of $5 billion in cash as we end fiscal year '17, with strong cash flow generation capabilities. So we do not feel what limits our strategic flexibility, and we're going to continue to think about what is the right other capabilities that we like to add to Symantec that are tightly aligned with this Unified Security strategy."

We have a very strong balance sheet and strong cash flow. But we will be very judicious as we think about this. I mean, if you look at our track record for the last 18 months or so, we've only done 2 small acquisitions. Those were very tightly aligned with the strategy that we've talked about, meaning they significantly add to Unified Security.

So many of our customers are saying -- overwhelmed with a number of point solutions that are out there, people coming to me saying, they've got a clever new way to block this single exploit. Or what can we do that might help stop one type of attack. And they're looking for something that's a more integrated solution here. How do I get a view across my Enterprise? How do I protect myself, knowing that there are threats that might have occurred in another part of the world aimed at the same vertical that I am in? And that's where I think our strategy is really resonating. So if you think about what we described with ATP, we're giving customers a view across their entire enterprise, and then we're giving them access to the global threat intelligence that we have. And we're finding that customers are looking for that ability to find a needle in the haystack. How do I see that attack if I'm a bank that's occurred in an Australian bank today because the attackers are trying to leverage their business model, so really they're just replicating whatever attacks that worked with another vertical in another part of the world. So that's why I think the Symantec intelligence network really pays off. And then for individual customers not only that, but again, how do I get an integrated view versus I don't want to be the integrator of 50 different technologies. Those are some of the trends that we're seeing."

We had a lot of moving parts with the separation and the restructuring cost and also CapEx impacted us on the separation side really being able to separate specially the IT infrastructure.

And then we will have to look at fiscal year '17, the gives and takes that are coming from putting a more efficient capital structure in place that will have an impact and also how the -- how we approach the cost reduction of $400 million is going to have an impact on that number. So there will be a baseline, and we'll have to make gives and takes on that number. And then as we generate and make progress on the $400 million cost reduction, that will be a significant tailwind moving forward.

So what we view this in is that the install base is growing going but growing slowly at this point. So that's the broader context. Now an opportunity for us is to move beyond traditional PC form factor into mobile. We talked about that a bit today. We also talked about additional products that we can add that use Norton's capabilities. We talked about other capabilities like privacy in the home, like what we could do for IoT as we protect the other devices in the home. So I think there are other product opportunities that go beyond the traditional PC form factor but the overwhelming proportion of our business today obviously is PC. Then as we look at the changes we've made in Norton, which are primarily from a channel perspective, significant declines in OEM and retail as we focused on online acquisition and partners. Now that we have a stronger model, as we discussed earlier, which means higher lifetime customer value that we achieved by moving people to subscription, we can look again at where does it make sense to grow in retail and OEM. In fact, retail for the regions outside of North America is already growing again. We don't have that growing in North America but that's something that we have as a goal for this coming year. And then we talked about earlier in the call, given the strength of the model, we can also look at OEMs as well. So I'm quite optimistic that over the long term, there are enough opportunities for Norton to be able to grow. It's just going to take us a little while to realize those opportunities, Phil.

Speakers on today's call are Mike Brown, Symantec's President and CEO; and Thomas Seifert, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our website. 
I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Implied Billings refer to revenue plus the change in sequential deferred revenue. We provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, except for statements about net income and EPS.
I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates for you. Mike Brown will be presenting at the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on February 29 and attending the JMP Technology Conference on March 1 in San Francisco. Thomas Seifert will be presenting at the Raymond James Institutional Investor Conference in Orlando on March 7. We intend to announce fourth quarter earnings on May 12 and will be hosting a Financial Analyst Day on May 26 in New York City. 
Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.
Please refer to cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You'll also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, in our annual report on Form 10-K in the year ended April 3, 2015. 
In connection with the Veritas sale, we have provided 7 quarters of recast GAAP and non-GAAP financial income statements, third quarter and prior year-end balance sheets and GAAP cash flow statements for the trailing 3 quarters and fiscal year 2015. All non-GAAP revenue and expenses exclude the impact of Veritas. However, the continuing operations deferred revenue on the balance sheet and the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement includes a portion of Veritas deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered into prior to operational separation. The Veritas deferred revenue from those contracts will amortize into discontinued operations.
As a result, implied billings growth calculated from change in deferred on the balance sheet or cash flow statement will not be representative of standalone Symantec's performance as it will include an impact from Veritas. This quarter and going forward, we will disclose the amount of deferred revenue on the balance sheet that will represent standalone Symantec for calculating implied billings. 
And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mike Brown. Go ahead, Mike."

I am pleased first to announce that Silver Lake Partners has made a $500 million strategic investment, which is a strong vote of confidence in both our transformation as well as our future as the world leader in cyber",2034,"Thanks, Jonathan, and good afternoon. I am pleased first to announce that Silver Lake Partners has made a $500 million strategic investment, which is a strong vote of confidence in both our transformation as well as our future as the world leader in cybersecurity. Additionally, I'm excited to have Ken Hao, Silver Lake Managing Partner, join our board, given his deep expertise in technology and track record of creating value.
As you know, we have been undergoing a 3-year transformation which began in April 2014. At that time, we laid out 5 priorities that we have since successfully executed against: first, managing our businesses with a portfolio approach, which included divesting Veritas and improving the profitability of our consumer business while we invest for growth in Enterprise Security; second, within Enterprise Security, we have been investing for growth by reallocating R&D spending to high-growth markets; third, improving our cost structure where we have improved non-GAAP operating margins to 28% this quarter; fourth, building a talented executive team, including new C-level leadership across most major functions; and fifth, returning significant cash to shareholders, with $2.1 billion in total share repurchases and dividends since April 2014.
During this period, we also developed a well-articulated strategy for our security business, which we call Unified Security. This strategy leverages our key competitive differentiator, the global scale and footprint of our large install base where we can correlate threats that our products and services see with Symantec's Global Intelligence Network, the 8 trillion objects we monitor globally and in real time. After completing the divestiture of Veritas, we are a more focused company as the world leader in cybersecurity.
The second half of our transformation plan began last October and is focused on 4 priorities: number one, delivering upon our product road map that leverages our Unified Security strategy; number two, building our Enterprise Security pipeline and go-to-market capabilities; number three, improving our cost structure further; and number four, continuing to efficiently allocate capital. I'll now cover each one of these priorities, starting with the first, delivering upon our product road map that leverages our Unified Security strategy.
On a daily basis, Chief Information Security Officers and Security Operations Analysts are overwhelmed by the vast number of security alerts that make it difficult to pinpoint advanced threats attacking their IT environments. Moreover, attacks are constantly evolving and leveraging a variety of techniques. 
This leaves traditional point solution vendors that are only focused on a specific attack method at a disadvantage. Protecting against these advanced attacks involves a unified approach to security to guard against multiple attack methods and an understanding of global threats in real time. This is Symantec's strategy, which leverages our install base and competitive differentiation in using a big data approach to understand more about the threat landscape than any of our competitors.
The first generation of products leveraging our Unified Security strategy are new solutions in the areas of advanced threat protection, data loss prevention, cybersecurity services and applications that run on our Unified Security Analytics platform. In total, we have launched 6 of the 12 new Enterprise Security products we outlined last year at our Financial Analyst Day. We plan to release the remaining half within the next 2 quarters and have an additional set of new products in the pipeline for the second half of fiscal 2017.
The first 3 of these, our newly-released advanced threat or protection ATP solutions, harness threat telemetry from the major control points of Endpoint, email and network to not only detect, correlate and prioritize but also remediate threats. This solution does this all from one console without adding an additional Endpoint agent. 
Key differentiators of Symantec's ATP approach are a cloud-based expandable sandboxing capability that works without expensive on-premise hardware as well as the ability to correlate threats across the control points within an enterprise and against Symantec's global real-time intelligence network. 
In recent independent, third-party testing from Miercom and Dennis Technology Labs, Symantec's ATP solutions received the highest scores across all test categories against vendors, including FireEye, Cisco, Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet, meaning we stopped more attacks and blocked more threats with fewer false positives than any of our competitors.
Our ATP solutions build upon a key core offering, Symantec's Endpoint Protection or SEP, which is our largest product line within Enterprise Security and which is delivering next-generation Endpoint Protection today. Many competitors are delivering only a subset of Endpoint Protection techniques. As a result, customers would be required to install numerous agents on their endpoints to match the same level of protection that we deliver today with SEP. This slows performance at the Endpoint and is cumbersome to manage. 
Symantec Endpoint Protection already combines multiple advanced protection engines across intrusion prevention, whitelisting, behavior-based machine learning, signature-less detection of malware and suspicious activity, automation, application control, clustering and remediation all deployed from a single agent. This layered approach, which includes multiple protection engines, goes far beyond antivirus in delivering next-generation capability, which is already being delivered to our more than 300,000 Endpoint customers, protecting over 110 million endpoints and enterprises. This is the install base for which we are targeting our ATP solutions.
In our cybersecurity service offerings, Symantec is also delivering Unified Security capabilities to customers through our managed security offering. This service monitors Symantec's solutions as well as third-party security products to correlate threats against Symantec's global real-time intelligence network. In many cases, our managed security service operates side-by-side in existing customer's SOC to act as complementary protection capability or layered defense against attackers. And Symantec has been named a leader 12 times in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Managed Security Services.
Finally, we will also deliver Unified Security capability through new applications that will sit on top of our analytics platform and leverage the vast threat data we see globally and in real time. Risk Insight, which benchmarks and enterprises security posture against peers, is the first in a series of applications we plan to build on top of this platform. The solution is currently running in beta at a large financial services company and will become generally available this quarter. We are excited about this wave of innovation at Symantec, which is resulting in the most robust, organically developed product cycle in our history.
Now onto the second of our 4 priorities, which is building Enterprise Security pipeline by improving our go-to-market capabilities. Building robust pipeline incorporates strong brand recognition, a robust channel program, lead generation and focused sales plays. To educate the channel on our next-generation security portfolio and product road map, we conducted partner conferences across our 3 major geographies and special training sessions, which included meeting with over 1,000 partners. 
During the quarter, we saw early momentum from the global system integrators and now are focusing to further enable our VARs, distributors, service providers and cloud providers. Additionally, we have launched a set of focused field sales plays aimed at driving new product sales in our install base as well as replacing competition. 
For example, our ATP cross-sell campaign has identified over 3,000 accounts that have a SEP installation, which represent over tens of millions of control points. Within those accounts, we have identified a subset that are immediate candidates for our ATP solution over the next 5 quarters as they have an upcoming Endpoint or Email renewal. 
We are already seeing positive results despite ATP only being generally available for just over 30 days. As of February 1, we had nearly 1,200 customers that have either attended an ATP webinar or engaged with a Symantec expert, over 350 customers who are actively evaluating our ATP solutions and dozens of initial wins. 
One of the most notable wins was with a U.S. food manufacturer and existing SEP and email customer who purchased our full ATP Endpoint, Email and Gateway solution to monitor over 10,000 control points. This customer reviewed competitive offerings and selected Symantec, given our integrated suite, single console and no need to deploy a new Endpoint agent. 
Another example of a new go-to-market offering is how we're helping customers securely transition to Office 365 by leveraging our recently launched bundle that includes DLP for cloud, User Authentication and our .cloud email solution. Our Office 365 solution provides customers a cloud-based solution that secures inbound and outbound data for customers as they transition those workloads and associated administration to the cloud. 
With cloud-based workloads, it's even more important to ensure an authorized user is accessing information, that it's encrypted traffic and that data that shouldn't leave a customer's environment doesn't leave. Symantec's bundle combines these security capabilities for our customers. We're currently in discussions with many existing and prospective customers who plan to migrate tens of thousands of users to Office 365. Some will be brand-new wins for us and others will be an upsell opportunity.
Our third priority is continuing to improve our cost structure, now that the divestiture of Veritas is complete. We're announcing today a target of $400 million in cost reductions to be achieved over the next 2 years. Specifically, over the next 18 months, we plan to eliminate $130 million of TSAs and stranded costs, resulting from the sale of Veritas, of which there are large opportunities in the areas of IT infrastructure and real estate. 
Beyond the impact of TSAs and stranded costs, we believe we can achieve further reductions across the company. The majority of these incremental savings will benefit us in fiscal 2018 and beyond. As a result, we expect to reach a 30% operating margin as we enter fiscal 2018.
Now our fourth priority, capital allocation. Our management team and board believe proper capital allocation is key to maximizing long-term shareholder value. And we have demonstrated this with a consistent track record of returning capital through dividends and share buybacks. We continue that consistent track record with our announcement today that we will return $5 billion in additional capital to shareholders by the end of March 2017 through a special dividend and share repurchases, bringing our total capital return in connection with the Veritas transaction to $5.5 billion.
Next, I'd like to provide an overview of Q3 results. Enterprise Security revenue increased 1% year-over-year, the third consecutive quarter of revenue growth, driven by 15% growth from Information Protection. Specifically, DLP again grew double digits. We are witnessing a resurgence in DLP demand across industries beyond the traditional verticals of financial services and health care that we've sold into, as more organizations realize they need to secure their intellectual property. We are the best positioned company to capitalize on this opportunity, which is further demonstrated by our market share, which is twice the size of the closest competition and our recognition as a leader in Gartner's January 2016 Data Loss Prevention Magic Quadrant.
Moving to our Consumer Security business. Revenues here declined 6%, which was at the better end of our down 6% to 8% expectation and an improvement from Q2. During the quarter, we signed an agreement with a large Indian telco to provide paid mobile security services to their customers. This is significant as monetizing the mobile opportunity is still in its infancy when compared with traditional form factors. 
We believe mobile security sold through partners will be one of the levers to return the consumer business to grow over the long term. As Thomas will describe in more detail, we are on track to convert our entire customer base to a subscription service and acquire more new customers directly online. Further, as we execute against our broader consumer product road map, we will expand the Norton offering to address broader personal privacy and home IoT security opportunity. 
In summary, I believe we are well positioned for acceleration in fiscal year 2017. Our Consumer business will see moderating decline while remaining extremely profitable at greater than 50% operating margins. We expect our Enterprise Security business to continue to grow in fiscal year '17 based on the strengthening product portfolio and building pipeline. Finally, we have a focused organization to execute against our priorities.
Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our third quarter financial results and guidance for our fourth quarter. Thomas?"

Third quarter total revenue was $909 million, a decline of 2% year-over-year, and was above the midpoint of our guided range on a constant-currency basis. In Q3, approximately 88% of revenue is recurring in nature, 5% is perpetual and 7% is from services. Over time, we expect recurring revenue to become a larger portion of overall revenue as more products are sold as a subscription.
Deferred revenue was $2.5 billion, which includes $396 million deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied Billings, excluding Veritas, were $865 million. The U.S. dollar appreciated against most major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of approximately $40 million to third quarter revenue on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 27.9% and exceeded our guided range. Excluding the impact from the TSA costs, non-GAAP operating margin would have been approximately 30%, which is in line with our margin target. Non-GAAP net income was $172 million, resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.26, above the high end of our guidance.
Let me now provide further detail on our revenue performance by product area. Enterprise Security revenue was up 1% year-over-year. Enterprise Security operating margins were 5%. To note, Enterprise Security carries a higher burden of stranded costs. 
Within Enterprise Security, Threat Protection was down 4%, and within Threat Protection, Endpoint Protection grew in low single digits. Offsetting this growth was continued weakness in our Endpoint Management solution, which will soon be refreshed with our new unified Endpoint Management platform available this quarter. 
Information Protection revenue grew 15%, driven by both Data Loss Prevention, DLP, and User Authentication, was both up double digits year-over-year. During the quarter, we closed over 2 dozens new DLP deals greater than $300,000, including one of the largest health care systems in the nation, where we beat out the competition to replace a legacy installation with our market-leading DLP solution.
Cyber Security Services, CSS, was flat year-over-year. During the quarter, we opened a Singapore SOC, which should further accelerate our expansion internationally. We are seeing positive underlying trends in CSS from both a secular and an execution standpoint and expect the business to improve its revenue growth performance in fiscal year 2017.
Website security grew 3%. We continue to be the de facto standard for enterprise-level customers to secure their websites, which is a stable and profitable business. Beyond the enterprise, we see demand for encryption and authentication accelerating, as security and privacy imperatives and identify and applications like eCommerce grow among businesses of all sizes, which we believe represents at least 40 million additional websites worldwide of opportunity for our solutions.
Now on to the Norton Consumer Security segment. Third quarter Consumer Security revenue was down 6% and operating margins were 56%. However, we are seeing improvement in the underlying fundamentals of the customer business -- Consumer Business performance, which gives us confidence that revenue performance will continue to improve. 
From a business modeling standpoint, we evaluate the Consumer Security business based on 4 primary factors: customer satisfaction, subscriber renewal rates, new subscriber growth and pricing. For competitive reasons, we do not quantify those metrics externally but believe it would be helpful to directionally describe our performance. 
First, customer satisfaction. We track our progress through Net Promoter Score, which is one of the highest in our industry and expect that metric to trend higher. Second, renewal rates. We have completed the transition to subscription globally. This quarter, we've reached the 1-year anniversary of subscription transition in the U.S. and will reach the 1-year anniversary in Europe at the end of fiscal second -- '17 second quarter. Customers on subscription renew at a significantly higher rate than those not in subscription. We expect renewal rates to continue to improve over the medium term as we transition more customers to the subscription, and the acquisition mix continuous moving towards digital channels.
Third, new customer acquisition. We are focusing on acquiring more customers online and through ISPs, as those channels have proven higher lifetime values. During the quarter, new subscriptions from online again grew 8% year-over-year. This represents approximately half of new acquisition.
Lastly, we expect pricing to remain healthy as we deliver increased value to our customers in the form of next-generation consumer Endpoint Protection. Given the steady improvement in both renewal rates and new customer additions, we believe we are exiting the trough of the consumer business decline.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operations -- operating activities for the December quarter totaled $153 million and includes $56 million in outflows related to separation cost. Capital expenditures were $114 million in Q3. We expect capital expenditures for Q4 to be approximately $50 million to $60 million.
Now turning to capital return. As we mentioned previously, we would update our capital return plan post the completion of the Veritas sale. We will now be returning $5.5 billion, which include the $500 million ASR that we executed in Q3 and an additional capital return of $5 billion. The $5 billion will be executed through a $4 per share special dividend, which will amount to $2.7 billion and a $2.3 billion share repurchase program to be completed by March 2017. 
The record date for the special dividend payable to shareholders will be close of business on March 8, 2016, and the dividend will be payable on March 22. Once we complete the special dividend, we'll initiate our stock repurchase program. We expect to execute approximately $900 million of share repurchases within Q4. After the completion of the capital return, we'll have returned more cash to shareholders than the net cash proceeds from the sale of Veritas. 
Lastly, we're adjusting our ongoing quarterly dividend to a $0.075 a share starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This adjustment reflects our lower domestic free cash flow post Veritas sale, but still represents a significant payout ratio on domestically generated free cash flow. We are committed to increasing this dividend as free cash flow grows over time.
Now turning to guidance. Our constant currency Q4 revenue guidance of down 4% to flat is slightly higher than our previous guidance. We now expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 26% to 28%, down slightly from our previous guidance due to a negative impact from currency. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.24 to $0.27, in line with our previous guidance as the lower tax rate offsets the decrease in operating margin expectations. We will provide fiscal 2017 guidance when we report our Q4 results in May.
In conclusion, we are seeing the underlying fundamentals of the business improve, and we are well positioned to execute on the second half of our transformation. Now I will turn the call back over to Jon."

So here's how we're thinking about it. From a revenue standpoint and thinking about the 2 segments, on the consumer side, we expect consumer business to perform basically in line with the outlook that we've been providing, so moderating declines as we go forward. And our guidance is really is consistent with what we provided at the Financial Analyst Day. Our Consumer business is very much on track. 
On the Enterprise side of course, it's more difficult to forecast. And we're in a period now where we have so many new products as I talked about in my remarks. And until we have some better visibility into the traction that we see converting that pipeline into revenue, we would rather be -- we'd rather be conservative with our thoughts about the Enterprise side. But I think it's fair to say that we'll be looking at where we finished Q4, and we will expect that, that will be the starting point. And we would expect to grow modestly from where we finished Q4 as we go throughout fiscal year '17. 
On the margin side, we should keep in mind a few things. Number one, seasonality -- from a seasonal standpoint, margins are typically down for us from Q4 to Q1. And as we've also talked about, we have significant amount of these stranded costs supporting Veritas and the stranded costs obviously that we need to take out. That accounts for about 200 basis points of margin. If you add those 200 basis points to the margin we reported today, you'd see we were at -- which is 28%, you'd see we were at the 30% target. But as we go forward into fiscal year '17, we're expecting that the reported -- as reported non-GAAP margins where we're not able to adjust for those stranded costs will be about the 200 basis points lower than what we'd see in FY '16. So lower operating margins -- and that's our task as we begin this effort to take out $400 million in costs over 2 years to ensure that those are eliminated. So as we start the following fiscal year, fiscal year '18, we'll be able to start that back at our target of 30%. So that gives you a little bit of a feel how we're thinking about it."

So I think we can do better there. And I think when we think about the capabilities that we're bringing, especially with ATP, we see that as a big opportunity. As many of you all on the call have commented, 2016 is likely to be the Renaissance of the Endpoint. Now that we're through a major refresh of firewalls, next-generation firewalls, many CISOs are turning to the Endpoint because that's where unencrypted data lives. And that's where they're looking to be more effective against attacks. So when we think about the combination of capabilities that we're offering, we think it's unparalleled in the marketplace. So just a couple of examples. We believe we're the only player effectively providing advanced attack protection across all vectors, so that's what our ATP solution does. You're really able to stop attacks and correlate them, that might have been aimed at the network or Email or Endpoint, we could correlate those. The second, as I talked about in my remarks, we're using multiple advanced techniques that go well beyond static signatures, things like behavior monitoring, machine learning, global intelligence, advanced analytics. So we've already got multiple protection engines that are incorporated in SEP. The third would be the ability to remediate attacks. That comes with our ATP solutions. So it's not just about protection but what can I do to remediate a situation. And then one of the things that Symantec has a strength in relative to some startup competitor is it's obviously delivering Endpoint Protection at scale without performance drag because we can provide all these capabilities with a single agent. So we think we're really in an unmatched position now, and adding the ATP capability gives us even stronger leadership. So we're still, as you'd expect, very excited about the Endpoint. We think the capabilities we're adding with ATP solutions really make us the leader again in terms of the technology to protect as well as remediate attacks at the Endpoint."

There's a feeling that Symantec as being a legacy vendor really is providing antivirus protection and that's all. So what's true is we're providing antivirus. So when I talk about multiple protection engines, antivirus is just one of those. We often call that signature-based technology or protection. But here's where we're adding those multiple layers. So we spent years developing, through our advanced research, these multiple techniques to protect you so that we can see what attacks are frankly coming in across the network. So frankly, the capability that stops more attacks than antivirus is something called intrusion prevention that's really scanning what is the traffic coming in over the network. That blocks more attacks than antivirus today. And we combined that with other techniques that we talked about, behavior. We use the wisdom of crowds to understand what are the reputations as Endpoint users might go out to access other files or URL addresses. And again, the vast telemetry that we collect keeps reputations on those 25 billion files, 30 billion URLs. So we'll block the user from going to an infected site or opening an infected file before they do that. So it's again, these multiple protection engines and techniques that allow us to provide that best protection at the Endpoint. So a lot of competitors like to think we're just antivirus. But it's far from the truth."

And then we said we are going to increase the dividend, if cash flow allows for that, but I think those are 2 separate topics. One is the capital return, very efficient capital return of the Veritas proceeds, and the other position is around how we adjust the smaller footprint. But keep in mind, we are still -- even the reduced dividend is still a majority of our domestically generated cash flow moving forward."

On the top line question, focusing on the consumer side of the equation, it sounds like starting to trend in the right direction. Can you talk to us about sort of how you guys are thinking about distribution on a going-forward basis? You're seeing good traction with the electronic distribution. Is there a potential sort of extending that back out into maybe -- putting your toe in the water, getting back in some of the OEM relationships? How should we think about how you're going to get the net new subscriber here on out, how are you going to sort of turn that ship fully around and actually start to get growth in that consumer side of the equation? That's the revenue question. Then the strategic question is just, given the big chunk of cash returned that's coming from Veritas, how does this impact how you guys think about M&A and potential for doing deals on a going-forward basis? Does this kind of have the security towards smaller deals versus something larger, given that you are giving back so much of this cash?"

And we think that is achievable over the long term, meaning over the next several years",598,"So Keith, thanks for the question on the Consumer business because it gives us an opportunity to say, our goal is to get the -- return the consumer business to growth. And we think that is achievable over the long term, meaning over the next several years. So while we're not forecasting that for next year, as we continue to work through the transitions that we've already began in the consumer business, we clearly see that as an opportunity, meaning returning business to top line revenue growth over a longer time frame. And distribution is a key part of that. So most important for us was making sure that we build a stronger foundation for the business. That has to do with reducing the churn rate, and of course, what we've done primarily there is move to a subscription. And what we're seeing as we're now reaching the 1-year anniversary of customers who started in a subscription is that the retention rate of those customers is significantly higher than what we had before with an auto renewal program where they needed to proactively sign up year after year. So staying in a subscription, of course, means that they continue to be protected and pay us year after year without an opt-in. And the retention rates are significantly higher, we're already seeing that in the business. That's important because that gives us a stronger model from which to approach OEMs. So if we had lower retention rates, higher churn rates, an OEM customer doesn't make as much sense. So now that we are fixing the foundation in the business, meaning improving the retention rate, now there's an opportunity to think about expanding distribution. So today, we're primarily acquiring new customers through online acquisition. And Thomas talked about the fact that we're up 8% year-over-year in terms of our online acquisition. So one part of our channel growing there. The second part that's growing from a channel perspective is the new customers we're acquiring through large partners. These tend to be cable or telco companies. And I talked in my remarks about the fact that a new opportunity for us there is monetizing mobile customers. We're starting to do that really for the first time. Then as we look at retail and OEM, OEM has been in decline for us but now with the stronger model, it will be time for us to think about OEMs again, and in fact, we're competing for a major OEM contract this year. So we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. But with a stronger model, we'll be in a great position to be competitive there and have that be profitable business for Symantec, which as we talked about was a different with some of those OEM contract before. They weren't profitable for us and our churn rate was such that we weren't able to generate the right lifetime customer value. Moving on to your second question about our balance sheet and strategic flexibility. We do not believe that the capital return program limits our strategic flexibility in the least. So we'll -- as you are aware, we'll have a very strong balance sheet going forward. We estimate we'll have something in the neighborhood of $5 billion in cash as we end fiscal year '17, with strong cash flow generation capabilities. So we do not feel what limits our strategic flexibility, and we're going to continue to think about what is the right other capabilities that we like to add to Symantec that are tightly aligned with this Unified Security strategy."

I hope today's announcement of a capital return program alleviates some of those concerns as we've now returned all of the proceeds or in process of returning all the proceeds of the Veritas transaction to shareholders because I think that was a concern. As I said before, when Keith and I were talking though, we don't feel this limits our flexibility in terms of looking at potential acquisitions down the road. We have a very strong balance sheet and strong cash flow. But we will be very judicious as we think about this. I mean, if you look at our track record for the last 18 months or so, we've only done 2 small acquisitions. Those were very tightly aligned with the strategy that we've talked about, meaning they significantly add to Unified Security. And in part, that was because we saw that the valuations were such that it was very difficult to make an acquisition, have the right level of returns for ourselves and our shareholders. So we're going to continue to be very judicious as we think about what are the right assets that need to be tightly aligned with the strategy, and they need to make financial sense over a similar time frame, meaning a couple year time frame for us. It can't be something that's going to pay off 10 years from now. One of the additional capabilities we'll have now is Silver Lake's extensive capability in assessing companies. So they are interested in helping us with this issue as well, both from the standpoint of looking at the opportunities but also in making sure that we understand the targets that we're looking at in depth."

On top of that, there's operational cash flow. And then there will be some additional debt involved going the full way at least until we can create some more efficient ways to repatriate capital. But I think this is something where we have not crossed all Ts and dotted all Is, and that is work that is in process. But I think for the first step as the special dividend and the first step towards -- and efficient buyback in -- starting already in the fourth quarter.

So many of our customers are saying -- overwhelmed with a number of point solutions that are out there, people coming to me saying, they've got a clever new way to block this single exploit. Or what can we do that might help stop one type of attack. And they're looking for something that's a more integrated solution here. How do I get a view across my Enterprise? How do I protect myself, knowing that there are threats that might have occurred in another part of the world aimed at the same vertical that I am in? And that's where I think our strategy is really resonating. So if you think about what we described with ATP, we're giving customers a view across their entire enterprise, and then we're giving them access to the global threat intelligence that we have. And we're finding that customers are looking for that ability to find a needle in the haystack. How do I see that attack if I'm a bank that's occurred in an Australian bank today because the attackers are trying to leverage their business model, so really they're just replicating whatever attacks that worked with another vertical in another part of the world. So that's where I think the Symantec intelligence network really pays off. And then for individual customers not only that, but again, how do I get an integrated view versus I don't want to be the integrator of 50 different technologies. Those are some of the trends that we're seeing."

We had a lot of moving parts with the separation and the restructuring cost and also CapEx impacted us on the separation side really being able to separate that especially the IT infrastructure. So a normalized operating cash flow number globally is probably in the neighborhood of $700 million. And then we will have to look at fiscal year '17, the gives and takes that are coming from putting a more efficient capital structure in place that will have an impact and also how the -- how we approach the cost reduction of $400 million is going to have an impact on that number. So there will be a baseline, and we'll have to make gives and takes on that number. And then as we generate and make progress on the $400 million cost reduction, that will be a significant tailwind moving forward. So I think the run rate number I gave is a good run rate number, and then we'll be more precise at our next earnings call so I think by then we understand really what the gives and takes are going to be over the fiscal year '17."

We also talked about additional products that we can add that use Norton's capabilities. We talked about other capabilities like privacy in the home, like what we could do for IoT as we protect the other devices in the home. So I think there are other product opportunities that go beyond the traditional PC form factor but the overwhelming proportion of our business today obviously is PC. Then as we look at the changes we've made in Norton, which are primarily from a channel perspective, significant declines in OEM and retail as we focused on online acquisition and partners. Now that we have a stronger model, as we discussed earlier, which means higher lifetime customer value that we achieved by moving people to subscription, we can look again at where does it make sense to grow in retail and OEM. In fact, retail for the regions outside of North America is already growing again. We don't have that growing in North America but that's something that we have as a goal for this coming year. And then we talked about earlier in the call, given the strength of the model, we can also look at OEMs as well.

35000,331205678,983634,"Symantec Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 12, 2016",2016-05-12,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jonathan. As many of you know, we provided preliminary fourth quarter results on April 28 and also announced that I will step down once our next CEO starts.

As many of you know, we provided preliminary fourth quarter results on April 28 and also announced that I will step down once our next CEO starts. Last November, as we entered the second half of Symantec's 3-year transformation, we outlined 4 priorities: first, delivering new products that leverage our Unified Security strategy; second, building our go-to-market capabilities in Enterprise Security; third, further improving our cost structure to eliminate stranded costs from the Veritas transaction and going further to achieve 30-plus percent operating margins in fiscal year 2018; and fourth, continuing to efficiently allocate capital. I'll cover our progress and plans on the first 2 of these. Thomas will cover in more detail the cost structure improvement work and update to our capital allocation.
Let's start with a view of the threat environment, and then I'll share how our Unified Security strategy addresses what we're seeing. The threat environment continues to obstruct enterprises' ability to efficiently conduct business and will cost our global economy in the neighborhood of $2 trillion to $3 trillion annually. 
To combat this, chief information security officers are looking to standardize on integrated security platforms, which incorporate visibility, faster remediation and analytics to secure their environments from advanced threats and manage more cloud-based workloads. Through our Unified Security strategy, Symantec is bringing to market a wave of organically developed solutions to provide our customers with 4 key capabilities: one, visibility into a broader view of the threats; two, automating repetitive tasks that security operations analysts face as well as enable these professionals to remediate threats, not just monitor alerts; three, protecting more cloud-based workloads through our new security-as-a-service offering as well as provide visibility and protection to these workloads through our Information Protection solution; and four, accessing Symantec's Global Intelligence Network in realtime to help understand which of the 8 trillion objects we're monitoring are threats to that customer's environment. Many companies offer the potential of security analytics, but only Symantec offers an unparalleled amount of data upon which to run these analytics.
Many of the network security vendors in the market today such as FireEye and Palo Alto only provide threat protection offering. These offerings are focused on keeping bad actors out of the network and do not provide protection for the data itself. Symantec combines the power of Threat Protection to keep bad actors out plus offerings we call Information Protection to secure the data and authenticate users. These Information Protection offerings are DLP, encryption, identity and access management and user behavior analytics.
The combined power of our Threat Protection and Information Protection offerings, along with Symantec's Global Intelligence Network, is our platform for not only protecting customers against threats but also authenticating users and protecting critical data. Symantec is the only security company with a platform this broad or with the access to this much global realtime data on which to run analytics.
With our new offerings this year, we will bring more of the power of this platform approach to customers to provide more secure outcomes. The first of our new offerings to leverage this Unified Security strategy is our ATP solution, which consists of ATP Endpoint, ATP Email and ATP Network.
Our ATP Management Console provides a single pane of glass that correlates threats across our network, endpoint and email solutions to determine the highest-impact threats to an organization and provide fast remediation. In addition, our ATP solution leverages the Symantec Global Intelligence Network to spot threats that have affected any of our global base of 370,000 enterprise customers and 65 million consumers to stop these threats from spreading. 
In future releases of ATP, we plan to provide a complete set of third-party APIs and integrations into other major security products. We expect this third-party functionality to be released during our current fiscal year and will include out-of-the-box integration to major SIM, network and IT ticketing workflow products to help customers leverage their existing security investments.
Additionally, we will be adding an agentless endpoint detection and response capability that will enable us to sell ATP into environments with competitors' endpoint products. In other words, ATP will work with competitor endpoints to provide advanced protection and triple our addressable market for this ATP solution.
In fiscal 2017, beyond ATP, we will launch additional new and organically developed offerings which leverage our Unified Security strategy. First, Symantec unified Endpoint Protection, a fully SaaS-based endpoint security and management solution aimed at small and midsize enterprises; second, data center security.cloud, a fully cloud-based solution to discover and automatically secure cloud workloads on AWS and Azure; and third, the next version of Symantec Endpoint Protection or SEP, which will include further enhancements in areas such as cloud-based detection, proactive exploit protection and machine learning.
As mentioned before, Symantec is unique in the industry in providing Information Protection solutions as part of its platform to protect data as it travels from on-premise to the cloud. In order to provide visibility into the movement of this data and these cloud-based workloads, Symantec combines its industry-leading Data Loss Prevention and User Authentication solutions. 
During fiscal 2017, we plan to release additional DLP cloud enhancements for cloud services such as Box, OneDrive and salesforce.com and User Authentication enhancements for continuous and proximity-based authentication. We are already selling DLP Cloud for Office 365 and Gmail. Additionally, we authenticate over 1 billion devices a year and provide millions of users with multiple factor authentication without the need for passwords.
Beyond our Threat Protection and Information Protection offering, the third part of our portfolio is Cyber Security Services, which monitor third-party offerings as well as our own products in customer environments, making this service a source of additional data about the threat landscape, while this also benefits from our Global Intelligence Network. As a result, these offerings also leverage our Unified Security strategy. We help customers during every stage of the attack life cycle by providing the security and threat intelligence expertise required to protect customers' environments since security expertise is so scarce.
Now let's talk about the second of those 4 transformation priorities: building our Enterprise Security pipeline by improving our go-to-market capability. During fiscal 2016, we reenergized our brand to focus solely on cybersecurity, align marketing dollars against dedicated sales plays and went to market with security-only sales professionals. 
Given the number of our new offerings coming, we are building a robust pipeline with our direct sales force and our channel complemented by new marketing efforts. We are investing in a more powerful lead generation engine to improve the quality of the pipeline marketing is delivering to sales. We are adding 20% more quota-carrying field reps without increasing our sales spend by reducing further sales overhead. We are also continuing to focus on channel partners with more security expertise through our award-winning Secure One program that certifies our partners on our products and provides better rewards for those partners that focus on Symantec.
However, we also saw that during the fourth quarter, our new business mix was weighted toward subscription and ratable type contracts relative to on-premise licenses. Considering the cloud-based nature of the new products we are bringing to market, the majority of these products will be sold as subscription. 
Beyond the changing cloud-based mix of our new products, customer buying preferences for our existing products are shifting to deals with more subscriptions or ratable revenue to lower their capital expenditures and provide increased security as a variable operating expense. We expect this trend toward more subscriptions to continue, and as a result, we will see a headwind to the year-over-year comparison for our in-period license revenue, which will be offset by a corresponding tailwind to deferred revenue. Thomas will further outline this business model transition in more detail in his remarks.
Now let me provide an overview to our fourth quarter results, which reflect this shift to less in-period license revenue and more subscriptions sold. Enterprise Security revenue was down 4%, driven by declines in both Threat Protection and Information Protection that were offset by growth in security services and other services. 
Within Threat Protection, Endpoint Security again grew in total. ATP performed especially well during its first full quarter of availability as we sold over 1.2 million ATP subscriptions with a number of high profile wins across verticals. This initial penetration represents just a fraction of our total Symantec Endpoint Protection installed base.
We are seeing pricing for ATP Endpoint well in excess of 100% of current SEP recurring revenue as we sell an ATP subscription for a multiple of our SEP renewal subscriptions. We already have a fiscal 2017 sales pipeline of well over $100 million for ATP across a variety of industries and customer sizes.
Within Information Protection, DLP revenue for Q4 declined 5%. The Q4 DLP decline was mainly a result of more new business shifting to subscription versions of DLP and lower-than-expected close rates of large DLP deals. For fiscal year 2016, DLP grew 13%.
CSS revenue grew in the quarter 5%, and new business activity measured by billings increased at double-digit percentage rates. In the second half of 2016, we witnessed improved execution across our services business through the addition of sales specialists and our CyberOne offering. CyberOne provides the value of our CSS solutions in one comprehensive offering: our monitored service, Incident Response, Threat Intelligence and simulation training.
Revenue from our website security offerings to protect eCommerce grew 1%. During the fourth quarter, significantly, we launched Encryption Everywhere, which is a freemium offering available through web hosting providers to integrate entry-level encryption into every website. We expect Encryption Everywhere to enable us to grow our unit market share dramatically and generate revenue upside from a range of security solutions as we convert newly acquired free customers to freemium website services.
Moving to our Consumer Security business. The underlying fundamentals of our consumer business continue to improve, driven by the move to subscriptions as well as acquiring new customers online and through partners rather than through OEMs. Later this year, we will expand our opportunities through new consumer upsell offering for WiFi privacy and identity theft protection. 
As of March 2016, over 95% of customers in the U.S. were enrolled in Norton subscription and renewed automatically. In line with our expectations, we saw higher year-over-year retention rates in March and April. By this fall, customers worldwide will be renewing their Norton subscription automatically as we reach the 1-year anniversary of transitioning customers to our subscription service in Europe and Japan. We continue to grow our online acquisition of customers, which grew 10% during the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year.
Norton mobile offerings, sold through our telco partners, grew 67% in Q4 and 50% for the fiscal year. This growth did not include any impact from the Indian telco we announced last quarter where we expect to begin generating revenue during this fiscal year.
For fiscal year '17, we continue to expect the consumer revenue declines to moderate to down 6% to down 3% and be able to maintain operating margins in the low to mid-50s. And for fiscal year '18, these declines will moderate further. Now I will turn the call over to Thomas."

Today, I'll provide a brief review of our fourth quarter results and capital structure, expand upon the key areas of our $400 million efficiency improvement program, outline our shifting business model and conclude with our financial outl",1165,"Thank you, Mike. Today, I'll provide a brief review of our fourth quarter results and capital structure, expand upon the key areas of our $400 million efficiency improvement program, outline our shifting business model and conclude with our financial outlook. Additional details are provided in our CFO commentary, which is available on our Investor Relations website.
Fourth quarter total revenue was $873 million, a decline of 6%. The U.S. dollar strengthened slightly against most major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of approximately $3 million to fourth quarter revenue on a year-over-year basis.
Deferred revenue was $2.6 billion, which includes $330 million deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied billings, excluding Veritas, were $1 billion and grew 3% year-over-year on a reported basis and benefited from a tailwind from currency. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 25%, and fully diluted earnings per share were $0.22.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operating activities for the March quarter totaled $1.2 billion and include $74 million in outflows related to restructuring and separation costs and a $900 million benefit from taxes payable related to gain on the sale of Veritas. In regards to this payable, we will pay approximately $900 million in cash taxes on June 15.
In line with our previous capital structure plans and in order to maintain flexibility in our capital structure while returning significant capital to shareholders, we have recently closed a $2 billion credit facility. $1 billion of this facility is a term loan, which we fully borrowed at close. The loan matures in 3 years and is pre-payable. The remaining $1 billion is a 5-year revolving credit facility and replaces our existing $1 billion revolving credit agreement. As a reminder, we have returned $4 billion of the Veritas proceeds, and we will return $1.3 billion by the end of the current fiscal year.
Moving on to our $400 million cost efficiency program. As you can see from our segment results, the Consumer Security business operates at a solid margin in the low- to mid-50s. Within the Enterprise Security segment, our website security products are over 95% recurring revenue and operate at a healthy operating margin, above our corporate average. As a result, the savings that result from our efficiency plan will mainly benefit our Enterprise Security Products.
Our net $400 million efficiency program is composed of savings across stranded costs from the Veritas divestiture, procurement, organizational effectiveness, real estate and Enterprise Security portfolio simplification.
Let me quantify the approximate savings we expect to realize from each of these areas. First, TSAs and stranded costs across IT and other shared services left over from the divestiture of Veritas. In total, we expect to achieve approximately $130 million of savings from eliminating these costs.
Second, procurement. We are tightening our focus on how we spend across the more than $1 billion of products and services we consume. We have identified over $100 million in procurement savings that we are in the process of achieving.
Third, we're improving our organizational efficiency to remove layers of management, consolidate operations and rebalance some positions to lower cost regions. These changes to the organization will result in just under $100 million in savings and reduce our net headcount by approximately 1,200 positions.
Fourth, we expect to improve our real estate utilization by 25%, which will result in an estimated savings of approximately $35 million. And finally, we are streamlining our spending within our Enterprise Security Products portfolio to invest in solutions that accelerate our Unified Security strategy. As part of this initiative, we are reducing the number of SKUs, and we are improving how we deliver our technology to customers. We expect to achieve approximately 40 -- $50 million of savings from this initiative.
As part of our $400 million in net savings, we'll be taking a $230 million to $280 million charge in restructuring to our GAAP results over the next 2 years. Of the $400 million in reductions, we expect just over 50% to be realized in fiscal year '17 on a run rate basis, and this enables us to enter fiscal year at an operating margin of 30%.
Let me now provide an overview of our Enterprise Security performance during the fourth quarter and some insight into our ship-to-more subscription and ratable revenue. Enterprise Security revenue declined 4% as a shift in customer buying preferences resulted in less license revenue during the quarter and more revenue being deferred to future periods. This included a faster-than-expected shift within our product mix to subscription and ratable contract structures. 
Specifically, the move to a more ratable mix resulted in just over $30 million revenue shortfall relative to our internal forecast, but our deferred revenue overachieved by a similar amount. This provides a tailwind to our fiscal 2017 revenue outlook. However, we expect the trend of lower in-period license revenue to continue. And as a result, we expect a headwind to billings and revenue growth that will vary, depending on the speed of this transition. Underlying this shift, you'll still see solid demand for our solutions and expect sustainable long-term top line growth for our Enterprise security solution.
Now turning to outlook. We expect Q1 revenue to be down 6% to down 3%; operating margin of 24.5% to 26.5%; and EPS of $0.24 to $0.26. For Q2, we expect revenue growth and margins to be similar to Q1 and improve in the second half of 2017 as we benefit from the deferred revenue tailwind and more -- of more ratable revenue and start to see the results from our efficiency program. We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be down 4% to down 1%. From a segment standpoint, we expect fiscal year '17 Consumer Security revenue of down minus -- down 6% to down 3% and Enterprise Security revenue to be down 2% to flat. Fiscal 2017 operating margins and EPS are expected to be 26.5% to 27.5% and EPS between $1.06 to $1.10, respectively.
In summary, when you put all of these changes together, we believe that fiscal year '18 will be a much stronger year both in -- both for top line growth and for improved profitability. As we enter fiscal 2018, we expect total revenue performance to improve as we benefit from the declines in the consumer business moderating to down low single digits. The shift in more subscription and ratable revenue will provide a growth tailwind to our Enterprise Security business. And from a profitability standpoint, we expect to enter fiscal year '18 and 30% operating margins, and for the full fiscal year of 2018, we expect operating margins of 33%.
In conclusion, our Consumer Security top line declines are moderating and profitability remains solid. Our Enterprise Security segment is in the early innings of the most robust organic product cycle in the company's history. And at the same time, we are focused on improving the profitability of the Enterprise Security business to drive long-term value for our shareholders."

We're not flying blind, and like many other enterprise software security companies, we are dealing with similar changes in how new products are sold and how buying preferences are changing. That should not be a surprise. We have seen the first impact of that in Q4, and we tried to anticipate that with the guidance we gave for fiscal year '17. Fiscal year '17, if you compare original expectations to where our guidance is now, I think that we're moving part. For sure, there is the deferred revenue tailwind from our performance in Q4. We said we are -- we overachieved that deferred revenue expectations by about $30 million. That is a tailwind moving into '17 for sure. We have adjusted our assumptions on product mix and yield and the linearity we see because of that. And we put some conservatism on the numbers to make sure that this transition is predictable from a communication perspective. If I had to give color, then that is probably a 30 -- a 70-30 mix in terms of the fact that I just talked about."

So we've learned a little bit from what we did this year and we're making those improvements that I talked about in my prepared remarks going into '17. So I think the overall strength of the portfolio is improving. I think if you were to look at the business separate from this model shift to increasing subscriptions and ratable business, you'd see continued strength. In fact, we saw the Enterprise Security business in total up about 1% for each of the quarters this year. If you modeled in the revenue in-period in Q4 versus going on the balance sheet in deferred, you'd see a similar trend for Q4. And we expect the strength of those new products, the market demand for what we're doing and the improvements in go-to-market would result in similar improvements as we go into FY '17. By the guidance that we give now reflects what we're seeing in terms of this shift in customers' buying preference, and of course, the shift in our offerings being more cloud-based."

We're seeing the renewal rates for SEP improve, and in some cases, we're able to expand our footprint as customers are expanding the number of SEP endpoints that are under protection. So those are all very 3 -- 3 very positive trends. And then additionally, we sell ATP as a subscription which we're selling for multiples of what the SEP or SEP renewal rate is.

We commented that we particularly saw that in March and April as we're now seeing the 1-year anniversary of when we moved those customers into subscription.

We're seeing that our Endpoint Protection is [indiscernible], in fact, growing as I mentioned, even in the face of some other parts of portfolio that are declining. So we continue to be very enthused about how SEP is doing. And I think that's because many of these other endpoint protection companies out there, one, require you to put an additional agent on to get a level of protection; and two, are boasting about some protection that goes beyond antivirus. Symantec's Endpoint Protection already has that. As we talked about so many times before, we're already putting multiple protection engines into the SEP capability. And we continue to add to that. In fact, 1 of the 12 new products that I've talked about are coming for this fiscal year that started with ATP is the next generation of our SEP offering, which includes, as we talked about some of those key capabilities, more detection in the cloud, which shifts some of the workload to the cloud versus the agent itself, making it so much more efficient. Proactive exploit protection, which gives us the ability to see different behaviors of malware and block those by understanding how those typically manifest themselves, and then more advanced machine learning. So we continue to improve on what SEP is capable of doing. We kind of think about next generation as having a couple of key aspects: one, are you providing advanced protection beyond AV? We're already doing that today, have been doing it for years. Many of the new competitors are, as I said, about 1 slice of what's required in protection that's beyond AV. The second would be what can you protect across different control point? Can you control for threats that would come in across e-mail, across the network and across endpoint? Obviously, our ATP capability does that. What can you do to remediate threats so that you have EDR capability? And then the fourth, very importantly, can you scale to hundreds of thousands of endpoints without affecting performance? So we believe, in fact, that Symantec is the only vendor that can provide all 4 of those in what we call next-generation Endpoint Protection. And then I'll just point to the third-party view. In February, we announced that rigorous testing organization, AV-Test, gave us the #1 award on consumer and enterprise.

So I'd say we have invested in our portfolio of solutions out that are more cloud-based. We expect that to directly coincide with customer buying preferences. The other key trend I'd say is real positive for us is the increased focus on the Endpoint. As networks become more porous and more cloud-based workloads, there's less emphasis on next-generation firewall. That doesn't mean they're not going to be important or that those winners are not going to be successful. But we're seeing that there's more of an emphasis on what can you do to protect those workloads in the cloud? Even with those workloads in the cloud, endpoints still has to be protected. And then that also lends some tailwind to our Information Protection offering, which clearly everybody beneficial for our customers that are doing workloads in the cloud."

As many of you know, we provided preliminary fourth quarter results on April 28 and also announced that I will step down once our next CEO starts.

As many of you know, we provided preliminary fourth quarter results on April 28 and also announced that I will step down once our next CEO starts. Last November, as we entered the second half of Symantec's 3-year transformation, we outlined 4 priorities: first, delivering new products that leverage our Unified Security strategy; second, building our go-to-market capabilities in Enterprise Security; third, further improving our cost structure to eliminate stranded costs from the Veritas transaction and going further to achieve 30-plus percent operating margins in fiscal year 2018; and fourth, continuing to efficiently allocate capital. I'll cover our progress and plans on the first 2 of these. Thomas will cover in more detail the cost structure improvement work and update to our capital allocation.
Let's start with a view of the threat environment, and then I'll share how our Unified Security strategy addresses what we're seeing. The threat environment continues to obstruct enterprises' ability to efficiently conduct business and will cost our global economy in the neighborhood of $2 trillion to $3 trillion annually. To combat this, chief information security officers are looking to standardize on integrated security platforms, which incorporate visibility, fast remediation and analytics to secure their environments from advanced threats and manage more cloud-based workloads.
Through our Unified Security strategy, Symantec is bringing to market a wave of organically developed solutions to provide our customers with 4 key capabilities: one, visibility into a broader view of the threats; two, automating repetitive tasks that security operations analysts face as well as enable these professionals to remediate threats, not just monitor alerts; three, protecting more cloud-based workloads through our new security-as-a-service offering as well as provide visibility and protection to these workloads through our Information Protection solution; and four, accessing Symantec's Global Intelligence Network in real time to help understand which of the 8 trillion objects we're monitoring are threats to that customer's environment. Many companies offer the potential of security analytics, but only Symantec offers an unparalleled amount of data upon which to run these analytics.
Many of the network security vendors in the market today such as FireEye and Palo Alto only provide threat protection offerings. These offerings are focused on keeping bad actors out of the network and do not provide protection for the data itself. Symantec combines the power of Threat Protection to keep bad actors out plus offerings we call Information Protection to secure the data and authenticate users. These Information Protection offerings are DLP, encryption, identity and access management and user behavior analytics.
The combined power of our Threat Protection and Information Protection offerings, along with Symantec's Global Intelligence Network, is our platform for not only protecting customers against threats but also authenticating users and protecting critical data. Symantec is the only security company with a platform this broad or with the access to this much global realtime data on which to run analytics.
With our new offerings this year, we will bring more of the power of this platform approach to customers to provide more secure outcomes. The first of our new offerings to leverage this Unified Security strategy is our ATP solution, which consists of ATP Endpoint, ATP Email and ATP Network.
Our ATP management console provides a single pane of glass that correlates threats across our network, endpoint and e-mail solutions to determine the highest-impact threats to an organization and provide fast remediation. In addition, our ATP solution leverages the Symantec Global Intelligence Network to spot threats that have affected any of our global base of 370,000 enterprise customers and 65 million consumers to stop these threats from spreading.
In future releases of ATP, we plan to provide a complete set of third-party APIs and integrations into other major security products. We expect this third-party functionality to be released during our current fiscal year and will include out-of-the-box integration to major SIM, network and IT ticketing workflow products to help customers leverage their existing security investments.
Additionally, we will be adding an agentless endpoint detection and response capability that will enable us to sell ATP into environments with competitors' endpoint products. In other words, ATP will work with competitor endpoints to provide advanced protection and triple our addressable market for this ATP solution.
In fiscal 2017, beyond ATP, we will launch additional new and organically developed offerings which leverage our Unified Security strategy: first, Symantec Unified Endpoint Protection, a fully SaaS-based endpoint security and management solution aimed at small and midsize enterprises; second, Data Center Security .cloud, a fully cloud-based solution to discover and automatically secure cloud workloads on AWS and Azure; and third, the next version of Symantec Endpoint Protection or SEP, which will include further enhancements in areas such as cloud-based detection, proactive exploit protection and machine learning.
As mentioned before, Symantec is unique in the industry in providing Information Protection solutions as part of its platform to protect data as it travels from on-premise to the cloud. In order to provide visibility into the movement of this data and these cloud-based workloads, Symantec combines its industry-leading Data Loss Prevention and User Authentication solutions.
During fiscal 2017, we plan to release additional DLP cloud enhancements for cloud services such as Box, OneDrive and Salesforce.com and User Authentication enhancements for continuous and proximity-based authentication. We are already selling DLP cloud for Office 365 and Gmail. Additionally, we authenticate over 1 billion devices a year and provide millions of users with multiple factor authentication without the need for passwords.
Beyond our Threat Protection and Information Protection offering, the third part of our portfolio is Cyber Security Services, which monitor third-party offerings as well as our own products in customer environments, making this service a source of additional data about the threat landscape, while this service also benefits from our Global Intelligence Network. As a result, these offerings also leverage our Unified Security strategy. We help customers during every stage of the attack life cycle by providing the security and threat intelligence expertise required to protect customers' environments since security expertise is so scarce.
Now let's talk about the second of those 4 transformation priorities: building our Enterprise Security pipeline by improving our go-to-market capability. During fiscal 2016, we reenergized our brand to focus solely on cybersecurity, align marketing dollars against dedicated sales plays and went to market with security-only sales professionals.
Given the number of our new offerings coming, we are building a robust pipeline with our direct sales force and our channel complemented by new marketing efforts. We are investing in a more powerful lead generation engine to improve the quality of the pipeline marketing is delivering to sales. We are adding 20% more quota-carrying field reps without increasing our sales spend by reducing further sales overhead. We are also continuing to focus on channel partners with more security expertise through our award-winning Secure One program that certifies our partners on our products and provides better rewards for those partners that focus on Symantec.
However, we also saw that during the fourth quarter, our new business mix was weighted toward subscription and ratable type contracts relative to on-premise licenses. Considering the cloud-based nature of the new products we are bringing to market, the majority of these products will be sold as subscription.
Beyond the changing cloud-based mix of our new products, customer buying preferences for our existing products are shifting to deals with more subscriptions or ratable revenue to lower their capital expenditures and provide increased security as a variable operating expense. We expect this trend toward more subscriptions to continue, and as a result, we will see a headwind to the year-over-year comparison for our in-period license revenue, which will be offset by a corresponding tailwind to deferred revenue. Thomas will further outline this business model transition in more detail in his remarks.
Now let me provide an overview to our fourth quarter results, which reflect this shift to less in-period license revenue and more subscriptions sold. Enterprise Security revenue was down 4%, driven by declines in both Threat Protection and Information Protection that were offset by growth in Cyber Security Services and other services.
Within Threat Protection, Endpoint Security again grew in total. ATP performed especially well during its first full quarter of availability as we sold over 1.2 million ATP subscriptions with a number of high-profile wins across verticals. This initial penetration represents just a fraction of our total Symantec Endpoint Protection installed base.
We are seeing pricing for ATP Endpoint well in excess of 100% of current SEP recurring revenue as we sell an ATP subscription for a multiple of our SEP renewal subscriptions. We already have a fiscal 2017 sales pipeline of well over $100 million for ATP across a variety of industries and customer sizes.
Within Information Protection, DLP revenue for Q4 declined 5%. The Q4 DLP decline was mainly a result of more new business shifting to subscription versions of DLP and lower-than-expected close rates of large DLP deals. For fiscal year 2016, DLP grew 13%.
CSS revenue grew in the quarter 5%, and new business activity measured by billings increased at double-digit percentage rates. In the second half of 2016, we witnessed improved execution across our services business through the addition of sales specialists and our CyberOne offering. CyberOne provides the value of our CSS solutions in one comprehensive offering: our monitored service, Incident Response, Threat Intelligence and simulation training.
Revenue from our Website Security offerings to protect eCommerce grew 1%. During the fourth quarter, significantly, we launched Encryption Everywhere, which is a freemium offering available through web hosting providers to integrate entry-level encryption into every website. We expect Encryption Everywhere to enable us to grow our unit market share dramatically and generate revenue upside from a range of security solutions as we convert newly acquired free customers to premium website services.
Moving to our Consumer Security business. The underlying fundamentals of our consumer business continue to improve, driven by the move to subscriptions as well as acquiring new customers online and through partners rather than through OEMs. Later this year, we will expand our opportunity through new consumer upsell offerings for WiFi privacy and identity theft protection.
As of March 2016, over 95% of customers in the U.S. were enrolled in Norton subscription and renewed automatically. In line with our expectations, we saw higher year-over-year retention rates in March and April. By this fall, customers worldwide will be renewing their Norton subscription automatically as we reach the 1-year anniversary of transitioning customers to our subscription service in Europe and Japan. We continue to grow our online acquisition of customers, which grew 10% during the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year.
Norton mobile offerings, sold through our telco partners, grew 67% in Q4 and 50% for the fiscal year. This growth did not include any impact from the Indian telco we announced last quarter where we expect to begin generating revenue during this fiscal year.
For fiscal year '17, we continue to expect the consumer revenue declines to moderate to down 6% to down 3% and be able to maintain operating margins in the low to mid-50s. And for fiscal year '18, these declines will moderate further.

Today, I'll provide a brief review of our fourth quarter results and capital structure, expand upon the key areas of our $400 million efficiency improvement program, outline our shifting business model and conclude with our financial outl",1166,"Thank you, Mike. Today, I'll provide a brief review of our fourth quarter results and capital structure, expand upon the key areas of our $400 million efficiency improvement program, outline our shifting business model and conclude with our financial outlook. Additional details are provided in our CFO commentary, which is available on our Investor Relations website.
Fourth quarter total revenue was $873 million, a decline of 6%. The U.S. dollar strengthened slightly against most major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of approximately $3 million to fourth quarter revenue on a year-over-year basis.
Deferred revenue was $2.6 billion, which includes $330 million deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied billings, excluding Veritas, were $1 billion and grew 3% year-over-year on a reported basis and benefited from a tailwind from currency. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 25%, and fully diluted earnings per share were $0.22.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operating activities for the March quarter totaled $1.2 billion and include $74 million in outflows related to restructuring and separation costs and a $900 million benefit from taxes payable related to gain on the sale of Veritas. In regards to this payable, we will pay approximately $900 million in cash taxes on June 15.
In line with our previous capital structure plans and in order to maintain flexibility in our capital structure while returning significant capital to shareholders, we have recently closed a $2 billion credit facility. $1 billion of this facility is a term loan, which we fully borrowed at close. The loan matures in 3 years and is pre-payable. The remaining $1 billion is a 5-year revolving credit facility and replaces our existing $1 billion revolving credit agreement. As a reminder, we have returned $4 billion of the Veritas proceeds, and we will return $1.3 billion by the end of the current fiscal year.
Moving on to our $400 million cost efficiency program. As you can see from our segment results, the Consumer Security business operates at a solid margin in the low- to mid-50s. Within the Enterprise Security segment, our Website Security products are over 95% recurring revenue and operate at a healthy operating margin, above our corporate average. As a result, the savings that result from our efficiency plan will mainly benefit our Enterprise Security Products.
Our net $400 million efficiency program is composed of savings across stranded costs from the Veritas divestiture, procurement, organizational effectiveness, real estate and Enterprise Security portfolio simplification.
Let me quantify the approximate savings we expect to realize from each of these areas. First, TSAs and stranded costs across IT and other shared services left over from the divestiture of Veritas. In total, we expect to achieve approximately $130 million of savings from eliminating these costs.
Second, procurement. We are tightening our focus on how we spend across the more than $1 billion of products and services we consume. We have identified over $100 million in procurement savings that we are in the process of achieving.
Third, we're improving our organizational efficiency to remove layers of management, consolidate operations and rebalance some positions to lower-cost regions. These changes to the organization will result in just under $100 million in savings and reduce our net headcount by approximately 1,200 positions.
Fourth, we expect to improve our real estate utilization by 25%, which will result in an estimated savings of approximately $35 million.
And finally, we are streamlining our spending within our Enterprise Security Product portfolio to invest in solutions that accelerate our Unified Security strategy. As part of this initiative, we are reducing the number of SKUs, and we are improving how we deliver our technology to customers. We expect to achieve approximately 40 -- $50 million of savings from this initiative.
As part of our $400 million in net savings, we'll be taking a $230 million to $280 million charge in restructuring to our GAAP results over the next 2 years. Of the $400 million in reductions, we expect just over 50% to be realized in fiscal year '17 on a run rate basis, and this enables us to enter fiscal year at an operating margin of 30%.
Let me now provide an overview of our Enterprise Security performance during the fourth quarter and some insight into our shift to more subscription and ratable revenue. Enterprise Security revenue declined 4% as a shift in customer buying preferences resulted in less license revenue during the quarter and more revenue being deferred to future periods. This included a faster-than-expected shift within our product mix to subscription and ratable contract structures.
Specifically, the move to a more ratable mix resulted in just over $30 million revenue shortfall relative to our internal forecast, but our deferred revenue overachieved by a similar amount. This provides a tailwind to our fiscal 2017 revenue outlook. However, we expect the trend of lower in-period license revenue to continue. And as a result, we expect a headwind to billings and revenue growth that will vary, depending on the speed of this transition. Underlying this shift, we'll still see solid demand for our solutions and expect sustainable long-term top line growth for our Enterprise Security solution.
Now turning to outlook. We expect Q1 revenue to be down 6% to down 3%; operating margin of 24.5% to 26.5%; and EPS of $0.24 to $0.26. For Q2, we expect revenue growth and margins to be similar to Q1 and improve in the second half of 2017 as we benefit from the deferred revenue tailwind and more -- of more ratable revenue and start to see the results from our efficiency program. We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be down 4% to down 1%. From a segment standpoint, we expect fiscal year '17 Consumer Security revenue of down minus -- down 6% to down 3% and Enterprise Security revenue to be down 2% to flat. Fiscal 2017 operating margins and EPS are expected to be 26.5% to 27.5% and EPS between $1.06 to $1.10, respectively.
In summary, when you put all of these changes together, we believe that fiscal year '18 will be a much stronger year both in -- both for top line growth and for improved profitability. As we enter fiscal 2018, we expect total revenue performance to improve as we benefit from the declines in the consumer business moderating to down low single digits. The shift in more subscription and ratable revenue will provide a growth tailwind to our Enterprise Security business. And from a profitability standpoint, we expect to enter fiscal year '18 in 30% operating margins, and for the full fiscal year of 2018, we expect operating margins of 33%.
In conclusion, our Consumer Security top line declines are moderating and profitability remains solid. Our Enterprise Security segment is in the early innings of the most robust organic product cycle in the company's history. And at the same time, we are focused on improving the profitability of the Enterprise Security business to drive long-term value for our shareholders."

We're not flying blind, and like many other enterprise software security companies, we are dealing with similar changes in how new products are sold and how buying preferences are changing. That should not be a surprise. We have seen the first impact of that in Q4, and we tried to anticipate that with the guidance we gave for fiscal year '17. Fiscal year '17, if you compare original expectations to where our guidance is now, I think there's 3 moving parts. For sure, there is the deferred revenue tailwind from our performance in Q4. We said we are -- we overachieved the -- our deferred revenue expectations by about $30 million. That is a tailwind moving into '17, for sure. We have adjusted our assumptions on product mix and yield and the linearity we see because of that. And we put some conservatism on the numbers to make sure that this transition is predictable from a communication perspective. If I had to give color, then that is probably a 30 -- a 70-30 mix in terms of the fact that I just talked about."

And of course, we're getting a second year now of a focused marketing and sales effort on security only. So we've learned a little bit from what we did this year, and we're making those improvements that I talked about in my prepared remarks as we go into '17. So I think the overall strength of the portfolio is improving. I think if you were to look at the business separate from this model shift to increasing subscriptions and ratable business, you'd see continued strength. In fact, we saw the Enterprise Security business in total up about 1% for each of the quarters this year. If you modeled in the revenue, it appeared in-period in Q4 versus going on the balance sheet in deferred. You'd see a similar trend for Q4. And we expect the strength of those new products, the market demand for what we're doing and the improvements in go-to-market would result in similar improvements as we go into FY '17. But the guidance that we give now reflects what we're seeing in terms of this shift in customers' buying preference, and of course, the shift in our offerings being more cloud-based."

We always have to be aware that an OEM deal is an indirect model to get to business, and that's why what Mike said is so important. For us adding and keeping the profitability and the health of the business segments, we work hard to achieve that. It's key. That doesn't mean that we do not engage in OEM deals, but they have to be well thought through, and they have to add to the modeled we've put in place."

We're seeing the renewal rates for SEP improve, and in some cases, we're able to expand our footprint as customers are expanding the number of SEP endpoints that are under protection. So those are all very 3 -- 3 very positive trends. And then additionally, we sell ATP as a subscription which we're selling for multiples of what the SEP or SEP renewal rate is.

They renew automatically. There's no what we used to call an auto renewal process. So if someone's credit card is current, they basically get notified that their subscription is continuing and they don't need to take any action. And as with so many consumer products that we're all familiar with, the retention rates for those customers in a subscription is so much higher. So we're seeing the benefit of that. We commented that we particularly saw that in March and April as we're now seeing the 1-year anniversary of when we moved those customers into subscription. And then the Indian telco that we announced, which is one of the examples of monetizing mobile protection for consumers, we expect that to contribute to FY '17 revenue for Norton."

We're seeing that our Endpoint Protection is holding up quite well, in fact, growing, as I mentioned, even in the face of some other parts of portfolio that are declining. So we continue to be very enthused about how SEP is doing. And I think that's because many of these other endpoint protection companies out there, one, require you to put an additional agent on to get a level of protection; and two, are boasting about some level of protection that goes beyond antivirus. Symantec's Endpoint Protection already has that. We already -- as we talked about so many times before, we're already putting multiple protection engines into the SEP capability. And we continue to add to that. In fact, 1 of the 12 new products that I've talked about are coming for this fiscal year that started with ATP is the next generation of our SEP offering, which includes, as we talked about, some of those key capabilities: more detection in the cloud, which shifts some of the workload to the cloud versus the agent itself, makes it so much more efficient; proactive exploit protection, which gives us the ability to see different behaviors of malware and block those by understanding how those typically manifest themselves; and then more advanced machine learning. So we continue to improve on what SEP is capable of doing. We kind of think about next generation as having a couple of key aspects: one, are you providing advanced protection beyond AV? We're already doing that today, have been doing it for years. Many of the new competitors are, as I said, throwing about one slice of what's required in protection that's beyond AV. The second would be what can you protect across different control points? Can you control for threats that would come in across e-mail, across the network and across endpoint? Obviously, our ATP capability does that. What can you do to remediate threats so that you have EDR capability? And then the fourth, very importantly, can you scale to hundreds of thousands of endpoints without affecting performance? So we believe, in fact, that Symantec is the only vendor that can provide all 4 of those in what we call next-generation Endpoint Protection. And then I'll just point to the third-party view. In February, we announced that pretty rigorous testing organization, AV-Test, gave us the #1 award on consumer and enterprise. It was the first time it was -- that was ever given to the same company with 20 different endpoint providers were tested and we came out #1, blocking more threats effectively with fewer false positives, so we believe we got third parties verifying what we're saying about Endpoint Protection from Symantec."

It provides a headwind near term, but we think it's obviously going to make us much more predictable long term. And we think it frankly will provide more staying power with the existing customers by getting them on a subscription basis, the same way we're already seeing that benefit in the Norton business. So I'd say as we have invested in our portfolio to bring solutions out that are more cloud-based, we expect that to directly coincide with customer buying preferences. The other key trend I'd say is real positive for us is the increased focus on the Endpoint. As networks become more porous and more cloud-based workloads, there's less emphasis on next-generation firewall. That doesn't mean they're not going to be important or that those vendors are not going to be successful. But we're seeing that there's more of an emphasis on what can you do to protect those workloads in the cloud? Even with those workloads in the cloud, endpoints still has to be protected. And then that also lends some tailwind to our Information Protection offerings, which clearly are very beneficial for our customers that are doing workloads in the cloud."

And it just seems like it's too difficult to do. But you said something about the agentless ATP functionality that's going to work in concert with others' endpoint. I find that really interesting. Is there any work right now being done within Symantec that is still trying to pull everything together?

So as the attack surface expands, it's difficult to think I'm going to consolidate everything under one pane of glass. However, one of the key thrusts behind our Unified Security strategy, and we talked about our platform approach, is to bring more of that visibility under a single pane of glass. So I talked in my prepared remarks about how we're doing that with ATP. I think in the future, you could see our Threat Protection and Information Protection be brought together under one pane of glass. And that's much broader than anyone else in the industry, in our view, has the capability to do. So pipe dream to think it's all going to happen and it's going to happen near term, but we are clearly moving in that direction."

We provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks except for statements about net income and EPS.
Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website.
Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.

You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 3, 2015.
All non-GAAP revenue and expenses exclude the impact of Veritas. However, continuing operations' deferred revenue on the balance sheet includes a portion of Veritas deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered into prior to operational separation. The Veritas deferred revenue from those contracts will amortize into discontinued operation. As a result, implied billings growth calculated from the change in deferred on the balance sheet will not represent of standalone Symantec's performance as it will include an impact from Veritas.

As many of you know, we provided preliminary fourth quarter results on April 28 and also announced that I will step down once our next CEO starts. Last November, as we entered the second half of Symantec's 3-year transformation, we outlined 4 priorities: first, delivering new products that leverage our Unified Security strategy; second, building our go-to-market capabilities in Enterprise Security; third, further improving our cost structure to eliminate stranded costs from the Veritas transaction and going further to achieve 30-plus percent operating margins in fiscal year 2018; and fourth, continuing to efficiently allocate capital. I'll cover our progress and plans on the first 2 of these. Thomas will cover in more detail the cost structure improvement work and update to our capital allocation.
Let's start with a view of the threat environment, and then I'll share how our Unified Security strategy addresses what we're seeing. The threat environment continues to obstruct enterprises' ability to efficiently conduct business and will cost our global economy in the neighborhood of $2 trillion to $3 trillion annually. To combat this, chief information security officers are looking to standardize on integrated security platforms, which incorporate visibility, fast remediation and analytics to secure their environments from advanced threats and manage more cloud-based workloads.
Through our Unified Security strategy, Symantec is bringing to market a wave of organically developed solutions to provide our customers with 4 key capabilities: one, visibility into a broader view of the threats; two, automating repetitive tasks that security operations analysts face as well as enable these professionals to remediate threats, not just monitor alerts; three, protecting more cloud-based workloads through our new security-as-a-service offering as well as provide visibility and protection to these workloads through our Information Protection solution; and four, accessing Symantec's Global Intelligence Network in real time to help understand which of the 8 trillion objects we're monitoring are threats to that customer's environment. Many companies offer the potential of security analytics, but only Symantec offers an unparalleled amount of data upon which to run these analytics.
Many of the network security vendors in the market today such as FireEye and Palo Alto only provide threat protection offerings. These offerings are focused on keeping bad actors out of the network and do not provide protection for the data itself. Symantec combines the power of Threat Protection to keep bad actors out plus offerings we call Information Protection to secure the data and authenticate users. These Information Protection offerings are DLP, encryption, identity and access management and user behavior analytics.
The combined power of our Threat Protection and Information Protection offerings, along with Symantec's Global Intelligence Network, is our platform for not only protecting customers against threats but also authenticating users and protecting critical data. Symantec is the only security company with a platform this broad or with the access to this much global realtime data on which to run analytics.
With our new offerings this year, we will bring more of the power of this platform approach to customers to provide more secure outcomes. The first of our new offerings to leverage this Unified Security strategy is our ATP solution, which consists of ATP Endpoint, ATP Email and ATP Network.
Our ATP management console provides a single pane of glass that correlates threats across our network, endpoint and e-mail solutions to determine the highest-impact threats to an organization and provide fast remediation. In addition, our ATP solution leverages the Symantec Global Intelligence Network to spot threats that have affected any of our global base of 370,000 enterprise customers and 65 million consumers to stop these threats from spreading.
In future releases of ATP, we plan to provide a complete set of third-party APIs and integrations into other major security products. We expect this third-party functionality to be released during our current fiscal year and will include out-of-the-box integration to major SIM, network and IT ticketing workflow products to help customers leverage their existing security investments.
Additionally, we will be adding an agentless endpoint detection and response capability that will enable us to sell ATP into environments with competitors' endpoint products. In other words, ATP will work with competitor endpoints to provide advanced protection and triple our addressable market for this ATP solution.
In fiscal 2017, beyond ATP, we will launch additional new and organically developed offerings which leverage our Unified Security strategy: first, Symantec Unified Endpoint Protection, a fully SaaS-based endpoint security and management solution aimed at small and midsize enterprises; second, Data Center Security .cloud, a fully cloud-based solution to discover and automatically secure cloud workloads on AWS and Azure; and third, the next version of Symantec Endpoint Protection or SEP, which will include further enhancements in areas such as cloud-based detection, proactive exploit protection and machine learning.
As mentioned before, Symantec is unique in the industry in providing Information Protection solutions as part of its platform to protect data as it travels from on-premise to the cloud. In order to provide visibility into the movement of this data and these cloud-based workloads, Symantec combines its industry-leading Data Loss Prevention and User Authentication solutions.
During fiscal 2017, we plan to release additional DLP cloud enhancements for cloud services such as Box, OneDrive and Salesforce.com and User Authentication enhancements for continuous and proximity-based authentication. We are already selling DLP cloud for Office 365 and Gmail. Additionally, we authenticate over 1 billion devices a year and provide millions of users with multiple factor authentication without the need for passwords.
Beyond our Threat Protection and Information Protection offering, the third part of our portfolio is Cyber Security Services, which monitor third-party offerings as well as our own products in customer environments, making this service a source of additional data about the threat landscape, while this service also benefits from our Global Intelligence Network. As a result, these offerings also leverage our Unified Security strategy. We help customers during every stage of the attack life cycle by providing the security and threat intelligence expertise required to protect customers' environments since security expertise is so scarce.
Now let's talk about the second of those 4 transformation priorities: building our Enterprise Security pipeline by improving our go-to-market capability. During fiscal 2016, we reenergized our brand to focus solely on cybersecurity, align marketing dollars against dedicated sales plays and went to market with security-only sales professionals.
Given the number of our new offerings coming, we are building a robust pipeline with our direct sales force and our channel complemented by new marketing efforts. We are investing in a more powerful lead generation engine to improve the quality of the pipeline marketing is delivering to sales. We are adding 20% more quota-carrying field reps without increasing our sales spend by reducing further sales overhead. We are also continuing to focus on channel partners with more security expertise through our award-winning Secure One program that certifies our partners on our products and provides better rewards for those partners that focus on Symantec.
However, we also saw that during the fourth quarter, our new business mix was weighted toward subscription and ratable type contracts relative to on-premise licenses. Considering the cloud-based nature of the new products we are bringing to market, the majority of these products will be sold as subscription.
Beyond the changing cloud-based mix of our new products, customer buying preferences for our existing products are shifting to deals with more subscriptions or ratable revenue to lower their capital expenditures and provide increased security as a variable operating expense. We expect this trend toward more subscriptions to continue, and as a result, we will see a headwind to the year-over-year comparison for our in-period license revenue, which will be offset by a corresponding tailwind to deferred revenue. Thomas will further outline this business model transition in more detail in his remarks.
Now let me provide an overview to our fourth quarter results, which reflect this shift to less in-period license revenue and more subscriptions sold. Enterprise Security revenue was down 4%, driven by declines in both Threat Protection and Information Protection that were offset by growth in Cyber Security Services and other services.
Within Threat Protection, Endpoint Security again grew in total. ATP performed especially well during its first full quarter of availability as we sold over 1.2 million ATP subscriptions with a number of high-profile wins across verticals. This initial penetration represents just a fraction of our total Symantec Endpoint Protection installed base.
We are seeing pricing for ATP Endpoint well in excess of 100% of current SEP recurring revenue as we sell an ATP subscription for a multiple of our SEP renewal subscriptions. We already have a fiscal 2017 sales pipeline of well over $100 million for ATP across a variety of industries and customer sizes.
Within Information Protection, DLP revenue for Q4 declined 5%. The Q4 DLP decline was mainly a result of more new business shifting to subscription versions of DLP and lower-than-expected close rates of large DLP deals. For fiscal year 2016, DLP grew 13%.
CSS revenue grew in the quarter 5%, and new business activity measured by billings increased at double-digit percentage rates. In the second half of 2016, we witnessed improved execution across our services business through the addition of sales specialists and our CyberOne offering. CyberOne provides the value of our CSS solutions in one comprehensive offering: our monitored service, Incident Response, Threat Intelligence and simulation training.
Revenue from our Website Security offerings to protect eCommerce grew 1%. During the fourth quarter, significantly, we launched Encryption Everywhere, which is a freemium offering available through web hosting providers to integrate entry-level encryption into every website. We expect Encryption Everywhere to enable us to grow our unit market share dramatically and generate revenue upside from a range of security solutions as we convert newly acquired free customers to premium website services.
Moving to our Consumer Security business. The underlying fundamentals of our consumer business continue to improve, driven by the move to subscriptions as well as acquiring new customers online and through partners rather than through OEMs. Later this year, we will expand our opportunity through new consumer upsell offerings for WiFi privacy and identity theft protection.
As of March 2016, over 95% of customers in the U.S. were enrolled in Norton subscription and renewed automatically. In line with our expectations, we saw higher year-over-year retention rates in March and April. By this fall, customers worldwide will be renewing their Norton subscription automatically as we reach the 1-year anniversary of transitioning customers to our subscription service in Europe and Japan. We continue to grow our online acquisition of customers, which grew 10% during the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year.
Norton mobile offerings, sold through our telco partners, grew 67% in Q4 and 50% for the fiscal year. This growth did not include any impact from the Indian telco we announced last quarter where we expect to begin generating revenue during this fiscal year.
For fiscal year '17, we continue to expect the consumer revenue declines to moderate to down 6% to down 3% and be able to maintain operating margins in the low to mid-50s. And for fiscal year '18, these declines will moderate further.
Now I will turn the call over to Thomas."

Fourth quarter total revenue was $873 million, a decline of 6%. The U.S. dollar strengthened slightly against most major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of approximately $3 million to fourth quarter revenue on a year-over-year basis.
Deferred revenue was $2.6 billion, which includes $330 million deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied billings, excluding Veritas, were $1 billion and grew 3% year-over-year on a reported basis and benefited from a tailwind from currency. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 25%, and fully diluted earnings per share were $0.22.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operating activities for the March quarter totaled $1.2 billion and include $74 million in outflows related to restructuring and separation costs and a $900 million benefit from taxes payable related to gain on the sale of Veritas. In regards to this payable, we will pay approximately $900 million in cash taxes on June 15.
In line with our previous capital structure plans and in order to maintain flexibility in our capital structure while returning significant capital to shareholders, we have recently closed a $2 billion credit facility. $1 billion of this facility is a term loan, which we fully borrowed at close. The loan matures in 3 years and is pre-payable. The remaining $1 billion is a 5-year revolving credit facility and replaces our existing $1 billion revolving credit agreement. As a reminder, we have returned $4 billion of the Veritas proceeds, and we will return $1.3 billion by the end of the current fiscal year.
Moving on to our $400 million cost efficiency program. As you can see from our segment results, the Consumer Security business operates at a solid margin in the low- to mid-50s. Within the Enterprise Security segment, our Website Security products are over 95% recurring revenue and operate at a healthy operating margin, above our corporate average. As a result, the savings that result from our efficiency plan will mainly benefit our Enterprise Security Products.
Our net $400 million efficiency program is composed of savings across stranded costs from the Veritas divestiture, procurement, organizational effectiveness, real estate and Enterprise Security portfolio simplification.
Let me quantify the approximate savings we expect to realize from each of these areas. First, TSAs and stranded costs across IT and other shared services left over from the divestiture of Veritas. In total, we expect to achieve approximately $130 million of savings from eliminating these costs.
Second, procurement. We are tightening our focus on how we spend across the more than $1 billion of products and services we consume. We have identified over $100 million in procurement savings that we are in the process of achieving.
Third, we're improving our organizational efficiency to remove layers of management, consolidate operations and rebalance some positions to lower-cost regions. These changes to the organization will result in just under $100 million in savings and reduce our net headcount by approximately 1,200 positions.
Fourth, we expect to improve our real estate utilization by 25%, which will result in an estimated savings of approximately $35 million.
And finally, we are streamlining our spending within our Enterprise Security Product portfolio to invest in solutions that accelerate our Unified Security strategy. As part of this initiative, we are reducing the number of SKUs, and we are improving how we deliver our technology to customers. We expect to achieve approximately 40 -- $50 million of savings from this initiative.
As part of our $400 million in net savings, we'll be taking a $230 million to $280 million charge in restructuring to our GAAP results over the next 2 years. Of the $400 million in reductions, we expect just over 50% to be realized in fiscal year '17 on a run rate basis, and this enables us to enter fiscal year at an operating margin of 30%.
Let me now provide an overview of our Enterprise Security performance during the fourth quarter and some insight into our shift to more subscription and ratable revenue. Enterprise Security revenue declined 4% as a shift in customer buying preferences resulted in less license revenue during the quarter and more revenue being deferred to future periods. This included a faster-than-expected shift within our product mix to subscription and ratable contract structures.
Specifically, the move to a more ratable mix resulted in just over $30 million revenue shortfall relative to our internal forecast, but our deferred revenue overachieved by a similar amount. This provides a tailwind to our fiscal 2017 revenue outlook. However, we expect the trend of lower in-period license revenue to continue. And as a result, we expect a headwind to billings and revenue growth that will vary, depending on the speed of this transition. Underlying this shift, we'll still see solid demand for our solutions and expect sustainable long-term top line growth for our Enterprise Security solution.
Now turning to outlook. We expect Q1 revenue to be down 6% to down 3%; operating margin of 24.5% to 26.5%; and EPS of $0.24 to $0.26. For Q2, we expect revenue growth and margins to be similar to Q1 and improve in the second half of 2017 as we benefit from the deferred revenue tailwind and more -- of more ratable revenue and start to see the results from our efficiency program. We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be down 4% to down 1%. From a segment standpoint, we expect fiscal year '17 Consumer Security revenue of down minus -- down 6% to down 3% and Enterprise Security revenue to be down 2% to flat. Fiscal 2017 operating margins and EPS are expected to be 26.5% to 27.5% and EPS between $1.06 to $1.10, respectively.
In summary, when you put all of these changes together, we believe that fiscal year '18 will be a much stronger year both in -- both for top line growth and for improved profitability. As we enter fiscal 2018, we expect total revenue performance to improve as we benefit from the declines in the consumer business moderating to down low single digits. The shift in more subscription and ratable revenue will provide a growth tailwind to our Enterprise Security business. And from a profitability standpoint, we expect to enter fiscal year '18 in 30% operating margins, and for the full fiscal year of 2018, we expect operating margins of 33%.
In conclusion, our Consumer Security top line declines are moderating and profitability remains solid. Our Enterprise Security segment is in the early innings of the most robust organic product cycle in the company's history. And at the same time, we are focused on improving the profitability of the Enterprise Security business to drive long-term value for our shareholders."

We're not flying blind, and like many other enterprise software security companies, we are dealing with similar changes in how new products are sold and how buying preferences are changing. That should not be a surprise. We have seen the first impact of that in Q4, and we tried to anticipate that with the guidance we gave for fiscal year '17. Fiscal year '17, if you compare original expectations to where our guidance is now, I think there's 3 moving parts. For sure, there is the deferred revenue tailwind from our performance in Q4. We said we are -- we overachieved the -- our deferred revenue expectations by about $30 million. That is a tailwind moving into '17, for sure. We have adjusted our assumptions on product mix and yield and the linearity we see because of that. And we put some conservatism on the numbers to make sure that this transition is predictable from a communication perspective. If I had to give color, then that is probably a 30 -- a 70-30 mix in terms of the fact that I just talked about."

So we've learned a little bit from what we did this year, and we're making those improvements that I talked about in my prepared remarks as we go into '17. So I think the overall strength of the portfolio is improving. I think if you were to look at the business separate from this model shift to increasing subscriptions and ratable business, you'd see continued strength. In fact, we saw the Enterprise Security business in total up about 1% for each of the quarters this year. If you modeled in the revenue, it appeared in-period in Q4 versus going on the balance sheet in deferred. You'd see a similar trend for Q4. And we expect the strength of those new products, the market demand for what we're doing and the improvements in go-to-market would result in similar improvements as we go into FY '17. But the guidance that we give now reflects what we're seeing in terms of this shift in customers' buying preference, and of course, the shift in our offerings being more cloud-based."

We're seeing that our Endpoint Protection is holding up quite well, in fact, growing, as I mentioned, even in the face of some other parts of portfolio that are declining. So we continue to be very enthused about how SEP is doing. And I think that's because many of these other endpoint protection companies out there, one, require you to put an additional agent on to get a level of protection; and two, are boasting about some level of protection that goes beyond antivirus. Symantec's Endpoint Protection already has that. We already -- as we talked about so many times before, we're already putting multiple protection engines into the SEP capability. And we continue to add to that. In fact, 1 of the 12 new products that I've talked about are coming for this fiscal year that started with ATP is the next generation of our SEP offering, which includes, as we talked about, some of those key capabilities: more detection in the cloud, which shifts some of the workload to the cloud versus the agent itself, makes it so much more efficient; proactive exploit protection, which gives us the ability to see different behaviors of malware and block those by understanding how those typically manifest themselves; and then more advanced machine learning. So we continue to improve on what SEP is capable of doing. We kind of think about next generation as having a couple of key aspects: one, are you providing advanced protection beyond AV? We're already doing that today, have been doing it for years. Many of the new competitors are, as I said, crowing about one slice of what's required in protection that's beyond AV. The second would be what can you protect across different control points? Can you control for threats that would come in across e-mail, across the network and across endpoint? Obviously, our ATP capability does that. What can you do to remediate threats so that you have EDR capability? And then the fourth, very importantly, can you scale to hundreds of thousands of endpoints without affecting performance? So we believe, in fact, that Symantec is the only vendor that can provide all 4 of those in what we call next-generation Endpoint Protection. And then I'll just point to the third-party view. In February, we announced that pretty rigorous testing organization, AV-Test, gave us the #1 award on consumer and enterprise. It was the first time it was -- that was ever given to the same company with 20 different endpoint providers were tested and we came out #1, blocking more threats effectively with fewer false positives, so we believe we got third parties verifying what we're saying about Endpoint Protection from Symantec."

It provides a headwind near term, but we think it's obviously going to make us much more predictable long term. And we think it frankly will provide more staying power with the existing customers by getting them on a subscription basis, the same way we're already seeing that benefit in the Norton business. So I'd say as we have invested in our portfolio to bring solutions out that are more cloud-based, we expect that to directly coincide with customer buying preferences. The other key trend I'd say is real positive for us is the increased focus on the Endpoint. As networks become more porous and more cloud-based workloads, there's less emphasis on next-generation firewall. That doesn't mean they're not going to be important or that those vendors are not going to be successful. But we're seeing that there's more of an emphasis on what can you do to protect those workloads in the cloud? Even with those workloads in the cloud, endpoints still has to be protected. And then that also lends some tailwind to our Information Protection offerings, which clearly are very beneficial for our customers that are doing workloads in the cloud."

There's some talk out there of providing -- some companies trying to provide everything as a platform, and there's also talk that, well, maybe that's not the best way to go, and so there's a little bit of debate out there. But the real problem here is the customer needs something because it seems like it's getting -- when I talk to customers anyway, they just want someone that sort of bring it all together for them. And it just seems like it's too difficult to do. But you said something about the agentless ATP functionality that's going to work in concert with others' endpoint. I find that really interesting. Is there any work right now being done within Symantec that is still trying to pull everything together?

So as the attack surface expands, it's difficult to think I'm going to consolidate everything under one pane of glass. However, one of the key thrusts behind our Unified Security strategy, and we talked about our platform approach, is to bring more of that visibility under a single pane of glass. So I talked in my prepared remarks about how we're doing that with ATP. I think in the future, you could see our Threat Protection and Information Protection be brought together under one pane of glass. And that's much broader than anyone else in the industry, in our view, has the capability to do. So pipe dream to think it's all going to happen and it's going to happen near term, but we are clearly moving in that direction."

All non-GAAP revenue and expenses exclude the impact of Veritas. However, continuing operations' deferred revenue on the balance sheet includes a portion of Veritas deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered into prior to operational separation. The Veritas deferred revenue from those contracts will amortize into discontinued operation.

As many of you know, we provided preliminary fourth quarter results on April 28 and also announced that I will step down once our next CEO starts. Last November, as we entered the second half of Symantec's 3-year transformation, we outlined 4 priorities: first, delivering new products that leverage our Unified Security strategy; second, building our go-to-market capabilities in Enterprise Security; third, further improving our cost structure to eliminate stranded costs from the Veritas transaction and going further to achieve 30-plus percent operating margins in fiscal year 2018; and fourth, continuing to efficiently allocate capital. I'll cover our progress and plans on the first 2 of these. Thomas will cover in more detail the cost structure improvement work and update to our capital allocation.
Let's start with a view of the threat environment, and then I'll share how our Unified Security strategy addresses what we're seeing. The threat environment continues to obstruct enterprises' ability to efficiently conduct business and will cost our global economy in the neighborhood of $2 trillion to $3 trillion annually. To combat this, chief information security officers are looking to standardize on integrated security platforms, which incorporate visibility, fast remediation and analytics to secure their environments from advanced threats and manage more cloud-based workloads.
Through our Unified Security strategy, Symantec is bringing to market a wave of organically developed solutions to provide our customers with 4 key capabilities: one, visibility into a broader view of the threats; two, automating repetitive tasks that security operations analysts face as well as enable these professionals to remediate threats, not just monitor alerts; three, protecting more cloud-based workloads through our new security-as-a-service offering as well as provide visibility and protection to these workloads through our Information Protection solution; and four, accessing Symantec's Global Intelligence Network in real time to help understand which of the 8 trillion objects we're monitoring are threats to that customer's environment. Many companies offer the potential of security analytics, but only Symantec offers an unparalleled amount of data upon which to run these analytics.
Many of the network security vendors in the market today such as FireEye and Palo Alto only provide threat protection offerings. These offerings are focused on keeping bad actors out of the network and do not provide protection for the data itself. Symantec combines the power of Threat Protection to keep bad actors out plus offerings we call Information Protection to secure the data and authenticate users. These Information Protection offerings are DLP, encryption, identity and access management and user behavior analytics.
The combined power of our Threat Protection and Information Protection offerings, along with Symantec's Global Intelligence Network, is our platform for not only protecting customers against threats but also authenticating users and protecting critical data. Symantec is the only security company with a platform this broad or with the access to this much global realtime data on which to run analytics.
With our new offerings this year, we will bring more of the power of this platform approach to customers to provide more secure outcomes. The first of our new offerings to leverage this Unified Security strategy is our ATP solution, which consists of ATP Endpoint, ATP Email and ATP Network.
Our ATP management console provides a single pane of glass that correlates threats across our network, endpoint and e-mail solutions to determine the highest-impact threats to an organization and provide fast remediation. In addition, our ATP solution leverages the Symantec Global Intelligence Network to spot threats that have affected any of our global base of 370,000 enterprise customers and 65 million consumers to stop these threats from spreading.
In future releases of ATP, we plan to provide a complete set of third-party APIs and integrations into other major security products. We expect this third-party functionality to be released during our current fiscal year and will include out-of-the-box integration to major SIM, network and IT ticketing workflow products to help customers leverage their existing security investments.
Additionally, we will be adding an agentless endpoint detection and response capability that will enable us to sell ATP into environments with competitors' endpoint products. In other words, ATP will work with competitor endpoints to provide advanced protection and triple our addressable market for this ATP solution.
In fiscal 2017, beyond ATP, we will launch additional new and organically developed offerings which leverage our Unified Security strategy: first, Symantec Unified Endpoint Protection, a fully SaaS-based endpoint security and management solution aimed at small and midsize enterprises; second, Data Center Security .cloud, a fully cloud-based solution to discover and automatically secure cloud workloads on AWS and Azure; and third, the next version of Symantec Endpoint Protection or SEP, which will include further enhancements in areas such as cloud-based detection, proactive exploit protection and machine learning.
As mentioned before, Symantec is unique in the industry in providing Information Protection solutions as part of its platform to protect data as it travels from on-premise to the cloud. In order to provide visibility into the movement of this data and these cloud-based workloads, Symantec combines its industry-leading Data Loss Prevention and User Authentication solutions.
During fiscal 2017, we plan to release additional DLP cloud enhancements for cloud services such as Box, OneDrive and Salesforce.com and User Authentication enhancements for continuous and proximity-based authentication. We are already selling DLP cloud for Office 365 and Gmail. Additionally, we authenticate over 1 billion devices a year and provide millions of users with multiple factor authentication without the need for passwords.
Beyond our Threat Protection and Information Protection offering, the third part of our portfolio is Cyber Security Services, which monitor third-party offerings as well as our own products in customer environments, making this service a source of additional data about the threat landscape, while this service also benefits from our Global Intelligence Network. As a result, these offerings also leverage our Unified Security strategy. We help customers during every stage of the attack life cycle by providing the security and threat intelligence expertise required to protect customers' environments since security expertise is so scarce.
Now let's talk about the second of those 4 transformation priorities: building our Enterprise Security pipeline by improving our go-to-market capability. During fiscal 2016, we reenergized our brand to focus solely on cybersecurity, align marketing dollars against dedicated sales plays and went to market with security-only sales professionals.
Given the number of our new offerings coming, we are building a robust pipeline with our direct sales force and our channel complemented by new marketing efforts. We are investing in a more powerful lead generation engine to improve the quality of the pipeline marketing is delivering to sales. We are adding 20% more quota-carrying field reps without increasing our sales spend by reducing further sales overhead. We are also continuing to focus on channel partners with more security expertise through our award-winning Secure One program that certifies our partners on our products and provides better rewards for those partners that focus on Symantec.
However, we also saw that during the fourth quarter, our new business mix was weighted toward subscription and ratable type contracts relative to on-premise licenses. Considering the cloud-based nature of the new products we are bringing to market, the majority of these products will be sold as subscription.
Beyond the changing cloud-based mix of our new products, customer buying preferences for our existing products are shifting to deals with more subscriptions or ratable revenue to lower their capital expenditures and provide increased security as a variable operating expense. We expect this trend toward more subscriptions to continue, and as a result, we will see a headwind to the year-over-year comparison for our in-period license revenue, which will be offset by a corresponding tailwind to deferred revenue. Thomas will further outline this business model transition in more detail in his remarks.
Now let me provide an overview to our fourth quarter results, which reflect this shift to less in-period license revenue and more subscriptions sold. Enterprise Security revenue was down 4%, driven by declines in both Threat Protection and Information Protection that were offset by growth in Cyber Security Services and other services.
Within Threat Protection, Endpoint Security again grew in total. ATP performed especially well during its first full quarter of availability as we sold over 1.2 million ATP subscriptions with a number of high-profile wins across verticals. This initial penetration represents just a fraction of our total Symantec Endpoint Protection installed base.
We are seeing pricing for ATP Endpoint well in excess of 100% of current SEP recurring revenue as we sell an ATP subscription for a multiple of our SEP renewal subscriptions. We already have a fiscal 2017 sales pipeline of well over $100 million for ATP across a variety of industries and customer sizes.
Within Information Protection, DLP revenue for Q4 declined 5%. The Q4 DLP decline was mainly a result of more new business shifting to subscription versions of DLP and lower-than-expected close rates of large DLP deals. For fiscal year 2016, DLP grew 13%.
CSS revenue grew in the quarter 5%, and new business activity measured by billings increased at double-digit percentage rates. In the second half of 2016, we witnessed improved execution across our services business through the addition of sales specialists and our CyberOne offering. CyberOne provides the value of our CSS solutions in one comprehensive offering: our monitored service, Incident Response, Threat Intelligence and simulation training.
Revenue from our Website Security offerings to protect eCommerce grew 1%. During the fourth quarter, significantly, we launched Encryption Everywhere, which is a freemium offering available through web hosting providers to integrate entry-level encryption into every website. We expect Encryption Everywhere to enable us to grow our unit market share dramatically and generate revenue upside from a range of security solutions as we convert newly acquired free customers to premium website services.
Moving to our Consumer Security business. The underlying fundamentals of our consumer business continue to improve, driven by the move to subscriptions as well as acquiring new customers online and through partners rather than through OEMs. Later this year, we will expand our opportunity through new consumer upsell offerings for WiFi privacy and identity theft protection.
As of March 2016, over 95% of customers in the U.S. were enrolled in Norton subscription and renewed automatically. In line with our expectations, we saw higher year-over-year retention rates in March and April. By this fall, customers worldwide will be renewing their Norton subscription automatically as we reach the 1-year anniversary of transitioning customers to our subscription service in Europe and Japan. We continue to grow our online acquisition of customers, which grew 10% during the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year.
Norton mobile offerings, sold through our telco partners, grew 67% in Q4 and 50% for the fiscal year. This growth did not include any impact from the Indian telco we announced last quarter where we expect to begin generating revenue during this fiscal year.
For fiscal year '17, we continue to expect the consumer revenue declines to moderate to down 6% to down 3% and be able to maintain operating margins in the low to mid-50s. And for fiscal year '18, these declines will moderate further.
Now I will turn the call over to Thomas."

Today, I'll provide a brief review of our fourth quarter results and capital structure, expand upon the key areas of our $400 million efficiency improvement program, outline our shifting business model and conclude with our financial outlook. Additional details are provided in our CFO commentary, which is available on our Investor Relations website.
Fourth quarter total revenue was $873 million, a decline of 6%. The U.S. dollar strengthened slightly against most major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of approximately $3 million to fourth quarter revenue on a year-over-year basis.
Deferred revenue was $2.6 billion, which includes $330 million deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied billings, excluding Veritas, were $1 billion and grew 3% year-over-year on a reported basis and benefited from a tailwind from currency. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 25%, and fully diluted earnings per share were $0.22.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operating activities for the March quarter totaled $1.2 billion and include $74 million in outflows related to restructuring and separation costs and a $900 million benefit from taxes payable related to gain on the sale of Veritas. In regards to this payable, we will pay approximately $900 million in cash taxes on June 15.
In line with our previous capital structure plans and in order to maintain flexibility in our capital structure while returning significant capital to shareholders, we have recently closed a $2 billion credit facility. $1 billion of this facility is a term loan, which we fully borrowed at close. The loan matures in 3 years and is pre-payable. The remaining $1 billion is a 5-year revolving credit facility and replaces our existing $1 billion revolving credit agreement. As a reminder, we have returned $4 billion of the Veritas proceeds, and we will return $1.3 billion by the end of the current fiscal year.
Moving on to our $400 million cost efficiency program. As you can see from our segment results, the Consumer Security business operates at a solid margin in the low- to mid-50s. Within the Enterprise Security segment, our Website Security products are over 95% recurring revenue and operate at a healthy operating margin, above our corporate average. As a result, the savings that result from our efficiency plan will mainly benefit our Enterprise Security Products.
Our net $400 million efficiency program is composed of savings across stranded costs from the Veritas divestiture, procurement, organizational effectiveness, real estate and Enterprise Security portfolio simplification.
Let me quantify the approximate savings we expect to realize from each of these areas. First, TSAs and stranded costs across IT and other shared services left over from the divestiture of Veritas. In total, we expect to achieve approximately $130 million of savings from eliminating these costs.
Second, procurement. We are tightening our focus on how we spend across the more than $1 billion of products and services we consume. We have identified over $100 million in procurement savings that we are in the process of achieving.
Third, we're improving our organizational efficiency to remove layers of management, consolidate operations and rebalance some positions to lower-cost regions. These changes to the organization will result in just under $100 million in savings and reduce our net headcount by approximately 1,200 positions.
Fourth, we expect to improve our real estate utilization by 25%, which will result in an estimated savings of approximately $35 million.
And finally, we are streamlining our spending within our Enterprise Security Product portfolio to invest in solutions that accelerate our Unified Security strategy. As part of this initiative, we are reducing the number of SKUs, and we are improving how we deliver our technology to customers. We expect to achieve approximately 40 -- $50 million of savings from this initiative.
As part of our $400 million in net savings, we'll be taking a $230 million to $280 million charge in restructuring to our GAAP results over the next 2 years. Of the $400 million in reductions, we expect just over 50% to be realized in fiscal year '17 on a run rate basis, and this enables us to enter fiscal year at an operating margin of 30%.
Let me now provide an overview of our Enterprise Security performance during the fourth quarter and some insight into our shift to more subscription and ratable revenue. Enterprise Security revenue declined 4% as a shift in customer buying preferences resulted in less license revenue during the quarter and more revenue being deferred to future periods. This included a faster-than-expected shift within our product mix to subscription and ratable contract structures.
Specifically, the move to a more ratable mix resulted in just over $30 million revenue shortfall relative to our internal forecast, but our deferred revenue overachieved by a similar amount. This provides a tailwind to our fiscal 2017 revenue outlook. However, we expect the trend of lower in-period license revenue to continue. And as a result, we expect a headwind to billings and revenue growth that will vary, depending on the speed of this transition. Underlying this shift, we'll still see solid demand for our solutions and expect sustainable long-term top line growth for our Enterprise Security solution.
Now turning to outlook. We expect Q1 revenue to be down 6% to down 3%; operating margin of 24.5% to 26.5%; and EPS of $0.24 to $0.26. For Q2, we expect revenue growth and margins to be similar to Q1 and improve in the second half of 2017 as we benefit from the deferred revenue tailwind and more -- of more ratable revenue and start to see the results from our efficiency program. We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be down 4% to down 1%. From a segment standpoint, we expect fiscal year '17 Consumer Security revenue of down minus -- down 6% to down 3% and Enterprise Security revenue to be down 2% to flat. Fiscal 2017 operating margins and EPS are expected to be 26.5% to 27.5% and EPS between $1.06 to $1.10, respectively.
In summary, when you put all of these changes together, we believe that fiscal year '18 will be a much stronger year both in -- both for top line growth and for improved profitability. As we enter fiscal 2018, we expect total revenue performance to improve as we benefit from the declines in the consumer business moderating to down low single digits. The shift in more subscription and ratable revenue will provide a growth tailwind to our Enterprise Security business. And from a profitability standpoint, we expect to enter fiscal year '18 in 30% operating margins, and for the full fiscal year of 2018, we expect operating margins of 33%.
In conclusion, our Consumer Security top line declines are moderating and profitability remains solid. Our Enterprise Security segment is in the early innings of the most robust organic product cycle in the company's history. And at the same time, we are focused on improving the profitability of the Enterprise Security business to drive long-term value for our shareholders."

We're not flying blind, and like many other enterprise software security companies, we are dealing with similar changes in how new products are sold and how buying preferences are changing. That should not be a surprise. We have seen the first impact of that in Q4, and we tried to anticipate that with the guidance we gave for fiscal year '17. Fiscal year '17, if you compare original expectations to where our guidance is now, I think there's 3 moving parts. For sure, there is the deferred revenue tailwind from our performance in Q4. We said we are -- we overachieved the -- our deferred revenue expectations by about $30 million. That is a tailwind moving into '17, for sure. We have adjusted our assumptions on product mix and yield and the linearity we see because of that. And we put some conservatism on the numbers to make sure that this transition is predictable from a communication perspective. If I had to give color, then that is probably a 30 -- a 70-30 mix in terms of the fact that I just talked about."

So we've learned a little bit from what we did this year, and we're making those improvements that I talked about in my prepared remarks as we go into '17. So I think the overall strength of the portfolio is improving. I think if you were to look at the business separate from this model shift to increasing subscriptions and ratable business, you'd see continued strength. In fact, we saw the Enterprise Security business in total up about 1% for each of the quarters this year. If you modeled in the revenue, it appeared in-period in Q4 versus going on the balance sheet in deferred. You'd see a similar trend for Q4. And we expect the strength of those new products, the market demand for what we're doing and the improvements in go-to-market would result in similar improvements as we go into FY '17. But the guidance that we give now reflects what we're seeing in terms of this shift in customers' buying preference, and of course, the shift in our offerings being more cloud-based."

We're seeing that our Endpoint Protection is holding up quite well, in fact, growing, as I mentioned, even in the face of some other parts of portfolio that are declining. So we continue to be very enthused about how SEP is doing. And I think that's because many of these other endpoint protection companies out there, one, require you to put an additional agent on to get a level of protection; and two, are boasting about some level of protection that goes beyond antivirus. Symantec's Endpoint Protection already has that. We already -- as we talked about so many times before, we're already putting multiple protection engines into the SEP capability. And we continue to add to that. In fact, 1 of the 12 new products that I've talked about are coming for this fiscal year that started with ATP is the next generation of our SEP offering, which includes, as we talked about, some of those key capabilities: more detection in the cloud, which shifts some of the workload to the cloud versus the agent itself, makes it so much more efficient; proactive exploit protection, which gives us the ability to see different behaviors of malware and block those by understanding how those typically manifest themselves; and then more advanced machine learning. So we continue to improve on what SEP is capable of doing. We kind of think about next generation as having a couple of key aspects: one, are you providing advanced protection beyond AV? We're already doing that today, have been doing it for years. Many of the new competitors are, as I said, crowing about one slice of what's required in protection that's beyond AV. The second would be what can you protect across different control points? Can you control for threats that would come in across e-mail, across the network and across endpoint? Obviously, our ATP capability does that. What can you do to remediate threats so that you have EDR capability? And then the fourth, very importantly, can you scale to hundreds of thousands of endpoints without affecting performance? So we believe, in fact, that Symantec is the only vendor that can provide all 4 of those in what we call next-generation Endpoint Protection. And then I'll just point to the third-party view. In February, we announced that pretty rigorous testing organization, AV-Test, gave us the #1 award on consumer and enterprise. It was the first time it was -- that was ever given to the same company with 20 different endpoint providers were tested and we came out #1, blocking more threats effectively with fewer false positives, so we believe we got third parties verifying what we're saying about Endpoint Protection from Symantec."

It provides a headwind near term, but we think it's obviously going to make us much more predictable long term. And we think it frankly will provide more staying power with the existing customers by getting them on a subscription basis, the same way we're already seeing that benefit in the Norton business. So I'd say as we have invested in our portfolio to bring solutions out that are more cloud-based, we expect that to directly coincide with customer buying preferences. The other key trend I'd say is real positive for us is the increased focus on the Endpoint. As networks become more porous and more cloud-based workloads, there's less emphasis on next-generation firewall. That doesn't mean they're not going to be important or that those vendors are not going to be successful. But we're seeing that there's more of an emphasis on what can you do to protect those workloads in the cloud? Even with those workloads in the cloud, endpoints still has to be protected. And then that also lends some tailwind to our Information Protection offerings, which clearly are very beneficial for our customers that are doing workloads in the cloud."

There's some talk out there of providing -- some companies trying to provide everything as a platform, and there's also talk that, well, maybe that's not the best way to go, and so there's a little bit of debate out there. But the real problem here is the customer needs something because it seems like it's getting -- when I talk to customers anyway, they just want someone that sort of bring it all together for them. And it just seems like it's too difficult to do. But you said something about the agentless ATP functionality that's going to work in concert with others' endpoint. I find that really interesting. Is there any work right now being done within Symantec that is still trying to pull everything together? Whoever's product those are, whether those, I guess, peers and sometimes competitors are working with you or not necessarily working with you, is this just a pipe dream or is it something you think can still really happen?"

So as the attack surface expands, it's difficult to think I'm going to consolidate everything under one pane of glass. However, one of the key thrusts behind our Unified Security strategy, and we talked about our platform approach, is to bring more of that visibility under a single pane of glass. So I talked in my prepared remarks about how we're doing that with ATP. I think in the future, you could see our Threat Protection and Information Protection be brought together under one pane of glass. And that's much broader than anyone else in the industry, in our view, has the capability to do. So pipe dream to think it's all going to happen and it's going to happen near term, but we are clearly moving in that direction."

Customers are looking to do more with fewer vendors rather than continue to proliferate the best-of-breed buy from 100 different vendors and integrate.

We provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, except for statements about net income and EPS. non-GAAP revenue and expenses exclude impact of Veritas. However, the continuing operations deferred revenue on the balance sheet includes a portion of Veritas deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered into prior to operational separation. The Veritas deferred revenue from those contracts will amortize into discontinued operation.  As a result, implied billings growth calculated from the change in deferred revenue on the balance sheet will not be representative of stand-alone Symantec's performance, as it will include an impact from Veritas. Implied billings referred to in our prepared remarks and provided in the supplemental materials reflect revenue plus the change in sequential deferred revenue, excluding the portion of deferred Veritas revenue.

It's an exciting time for the new Symantec, and I'm proud to be lead the company that will define the future of cybersecurity. 
We are already off to a great start by closing the Blue Coat acquisition earlier than expected in under 2 months since announcement. This has allowed us to move rapidly into the execution of our innovation strategy.  Since the announcement of the acquisition, we have pressure tested our financial assumptions and continue to remain confident in achieving fiscal 2018 EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.80, which we disclosed when we announced the acquisition in June. Our combined product portfolio separates us as the most strategic security player in the industry, with a portfolio solutions that addresses over 50% of the enterprise security budgets or an approximate $40 billion of total available market. 
Furthermore, we are the only security company that has the scale and vision to be considered by the CIO as one of the most strategic technology partners. As you saw from dimension data's quote in our closing press release earlier this week, partners are extremely optimistic about the technology that the combined company can bring to market. In addition to great support from our partners, we have had an outstanding feedback from the customer base. I'll provide more customer feedback later in my remarks. 
First, Thomas will begin by providing an overview of the Symantec Q1 results and our financial outlook. Then I will address why we are confident that we have the deep leadership expertise in place to integrate the 2 companies and deliver upon our financial targets. I will wrap up by describing major cybersecurity challenges enterprises are facing, and how Symantec is best position to usher in a new era of cybersecurity solutions to solve these multibillion-dollar opportunities."

Nearly 2 years ago, we announced our intention to become the leading pure play cybersecurity company. With the close of the Blue Coat acquisition, we've accelerated that strategy and now are positioned to execute on our integration road map while we define the future of cybersecurity. 
Today, I will provide an overview of our first quarter results, update you on our $550 million cost efficiencies and Blue Coat integration synergies and conclude with our combined financial outlook. Additional details are provided in our CFO commentary, which is available on our Investor Relations website.
Our first quarter total revenue was $884 million, above the midpoint of our guided range, driven by improved performance within Enterprise Security and continued in line results from Consumer Security. From a macro and security spending standpoint, we did not see any incremental weakness in Europe related to Brexit. However, we continue to monitor our European pipeline very closely.  Deferred revenue was $2.4 billion, which includes $243 million of deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied billings excluding Veritas were $788 million declined 1.6% on a reported basis. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 28.6% and 210 basis points above the high end of our guided range of 24.5% to 26.5%. And the upside was evenly split by an early start to our cost efficiency savings and some onetime expense benefits. 
Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.29 and above our guidance of $0.24 to $0.26. Our non-GAAP tax rate and share count were in line with guidance. 
Cash flow from continuing operations during the quarter was a negative $742 million, which included a tax payment of $887 million related to the gain from the sale of Veritas and $39 million in cash outflows related to restructuring and the Veritas separation. 
Let me now provide further detail on our performance by segment.  Enterprise Security revenue was $481 million and declined 1% year-over-year, which was at the high end of our guidance of down 4% to down 1%, driven by strength in both information protection and cybersecurity services. 
Now I will review the product areas within our Enterprise Security segment.  Threat protection revenue was down 5%. However, endpoint security including ATP grew low single digits year-over-year. Our newly launched ATP solutions showed continued momentum in what is a seasonally slower quarter. During Q1, we sold ATP subscriptions to 115 customers. And importantly, 2/3 of the Q1 ATP deals were sold independent of a renewal. Overall, we continue to maintain the value of our SEP and .cloud recurring revenue and in some cases, expand our footprint within the account. Since its launch in December, we have sold ATP to 270 customers. Within the install base, there remains significant opportunity for additional ATP module cross-sell or seat expansion.
Information protection revenue grew 4%. DLP revenue grew 18% and is benefiting from a tailwind of strong prior quarter deferred revenue growth and a favorable prior year compare. Looking forward, we have a solid pipeline for DLP, driven by data protection requirements as our customers adopt cloud-based applications. In addition, we are excited about the future of our data protection growth as we package DLP with our market-leading secure web gateway.
Cybersecurity services and other services grew 9%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth with solid performance across Managed security Services, incident response, threat intelligence and other security-focused professional services. Underlying these results, we continue to see strong demand for actionable cyber threat intelligence. 
Website security revenue grew 1% and performed in line with our expectations. We continue to see good performance from the higher end of our website security portfolio where our complete Website Security offering is gaining traction. On the lower end of the market, we expect our Encryption Everywhere solution to provide a tailwind to results in fiscal 2018 as we begin to benefit from the conversion of this offering.
Now on to the Norton Consumer Security segment. Consumer Security revenue was down slightly less than 8%, which was at the lower end of our guidance of down 8% to down 5%. The underlying fundamentals of our consumer business continue to improve, driven by the move to subscription and online customer acquisition. We are also seeing early pipeline building for new solutions such as WiFi privacy and home IoT offerings. 
Let me now review some additional performance metrics for the Norton business. During Q1, retention rates continued to increase on a year-over-year basis following the anniversary of our transition to subscription model in the U.S. we will reach the 1-year anniversary internationally at the end of the fiscal Q2. We continue to grow our online acquisition of customers, which grew new subscriptions 4% during the first quarter.
Finally, earlier this summer, we launched our WiFi privacy offering. This solution provides a secure connection while connected to an unsecured network. We are targeting the solution as both an upsell into our current install base and as a stand-alone solution to attract new Norton subscribers.
Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. On August 1, we added $2.8 billion of new debt and $1.25 billion of convertible notes. We have $5.6 billion in cash and $7.3 billion in total debt, including the $1.75 billion of convertible notes. As we previously said, we expect to delever our balance sheet over the medium term. 
As of last Friday, our current ASR is 58% complete, and we expect this it to finish in the fall of this year. We remain committed to maintaining our quarterly dividend.
Shifting gears to our $550 million of cost savings initiatives and the Blue Coat integration synergies. We've already made progress achieving savings across the areas of procurement, organizational effectiveness and, to a lesser extent, real estate. On an annualized basis, we have realized approximately $50 million of a run rate net cost efficiencies. In addition to efficiency savings, we expect to achieve synergies from the Blue Coat acquisition by the end of fiscal 2018. The earlier close provides us a head start achieving these.
Before providing our guidance, let me walk through the underlying mechanics. We will be referring to the non-GAAP performance of the business, and please see the CFO commentary for more detailed description. 
Going forward, Blue Coat will be reported as part of our Enterprise Security segment, given our plans to integrate multiple product solutions. It is important to note that historically, Blue Coat's fiscal second quarter has ended on October 31. Therefore, our fiscal second quarter guidance will include 2 months of contribution from Blue Coat from August 1 to September 30.  It is also important to note that Blue Coat's revenue linearity is heavily weighted to the last month of the quarter. Therefore, embedded in our Q2 guidance is up to 50% of Blue Coat's prior Q2 non-GAAP revenue forecast. However, from a cost standpoint, won't be burdened by approximately 2/3 of Blue Coat's second quarter spending, with only half the revenue. From a reporting standpoint, this linearity difference puts an abnormal burden on our operating margin in Q2.
We are focused on maintaining strong sales execution during our integration. However, we believe that it is prudent to set conservative top line guidance for Q2 and fiscal 2017 as we combine the 2 companies. 
We expect second quarter non-GAAP revenue to be up 4% to 8% to $960 million to $990 million. We expect consumer revenue to be down approximately 7% to $395 million to $400 million. We expect Enterprise Security, which includes a 2-month contribution from Blue Coat, to be up 14% to 20% to $565 million to $590 million. 
We expect an operating margin of 21% to 24%. To reiterate, a portion of the incremental margins is due to our burden from 2/3 of the spend, but only 50% of revenue benefits from Blue Coat. And we expect approximately $13 million of the headwind to non-GAAP operating margin related to retention payments and sales force incentives put in place to ensure stability during our integration.  
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.21, with a tax rate of 29% and a fully diluted average share count of 640 million.
Now on to fiscal 2017 guidance. As a reminder, our fiscal 2017 outlook only includes 8 months of revenue contribution from Blue Coat. 
We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be up 11% to 13% to $4,040 million to $4,120 million. Fiscal 2017 operating margin is expected to be in the range of 26% to 28%. We expect approximately $45 million of onetime expense related to retention payments and sales force incentives put in place to ensure stability during our integration. We expect EPS of $1.08 to $1.14, with a tax rate of 29% and a fully diluted average share count of 616 million. 
our fiscal 2018 outlook, we plan to enter fiscal 2018 with an operating margin of 30%. For fiscal 2018, we continue to expect EPS in the range of $1.70 to $1.80.

Let's begin with why I am confident we have the leadership team in place to deliver the leading cyber defense portfolio while integrating our 2 companies in achieving our financial targets.  With the Veritas divestiture behind us, we are focused on removing the remaining stranded costs and further improving our operating efficiency. This is an important step to deliver our commitment to the $550 million in savings and synergies. 
When I joined Blue Coat in 2011, the company had multiple quarters of revenue declines with below-average profitability. While at Blue Coat, we delivered substantial improvements in operating effectiveness, acquisitions were fully integrated and the company returned to growth. This experience is highly relevant to delivering process efficiencies at Symantec. We focused the product strategy to cybersecurity, rebuild the go-to-market engine and improved profitability and thoughtfully leveraged our balance sheet to successfully acquire market-leading technologies. Blue Coat today is a clear leader in cloud security with the #1 market share of the secure web gateway. Organic revenue growth is now in the mid-teens with operating margins in the high 20s.  When we combined Blue Coat leadership team with the many talented executives from Symantec, the outcome is a deep bench across all functions, with a technology portfolio that is market-leading back by substantial development talent totaling over 4,000 engineers.
Let me turn to some early feedback from customers and our channel. I was recently visiting the CIO of a global financial institution that said the combination of Symantec and Blue Coat not only makes us their most strategic security partner, but we are now considered one of the top overall strategic technology partners. This type of recognition is not taken for granted and offers a clear advantage versus our competition. Many other large enterprise customers have proactively reached out to us not only to express excitement about the further integration of our product lines, but are even more enthusiastic about our longer-term vision and our relevance in their migration and adoption to cloud solutions. 
Furthermore, our channel provides that service to mid-market have expressed excitement around the power of our endpoint solution integrated into our cloud security platform. It is in the mid-market where securely adopting cloud applications is essential. 
Now I will comment on how we plan to maintain strong sales execution while we realize the $550 million in cost efficiencies and Blue Coat synergies. As previously announced, Mike Fey has been appointed as COO and President. Mike's organization was instrumental in leading the Blue Coat sales force and channel in consistently meeting or beating our sales plans and taking market share. 
We plan to maintain our combined sales capacity. Together, we have the largest dedicated security sales force with deep technical strength to bring our products to market. Combined sales capacity is substantially increased in the enterprise market. 
As we outlined on the acquisition announcement, we find less-than-expected customer overlap during our due diligence, which over the medium term offers us a meaningful cross-sell opportunity and provides tailwinds for fiscal 2018. We are also excited about working with our many channel partners across the globe and bringing differentiated value to our joint customers.
Let me touch on our plans beyond sales. The Consumer Security team will remain a stand-alone unit from an operational standpoint and report directly to me. The management team in this business unit is excellent. We are pleased with the stability of the business encouraged by the product road map. We will continue to make investments that extend the Norton value beyond the traditional PC to return the segment to growth. These include new products such as WiFi privacy and home IoT. 
From an enterprise security standpoint, during the planning process, we jointly reviewed product road maps with respective teams. I am truly impressed by the level of game-changing product leadership our development teams are pursuing. We'll be sharing many of these in the upcoming quarters. 
With regards to operational integration, we have worked diligently to put integration plan in place that is led by seasoned executives, and we are on track to achieve our targets. We expect to be substantially operationally integrated by the end of our fiscal year, March 2017. 
Turning to Blue Coat's fiscal Q1 performance. As many of you know, Blue Coat historically has been a July month-ending first quarter. While we are still closing our books, we do not yet have official results, I'm pleased to share that from an overall performance standpoint that our Q1 results were ahead of expectations and we saw strong momentum across all products. 
Now let's switch gears to address how our combined portfolio can help solve the biggest security problems that our customers are facing.  First, the largest opportunity we see in the market is securing enterprises, governments and consumers from advanced attacks, securing our customers as they adopt cloud. When it comes to staying ahead of advanced threats, a key differentiator is the speed at which one can identify and mitigate malicious activity across a functionally rich set of products. Together, Symantec and Blue Coat have the broadest and deepest set of threat intelligence data in the industry, combined with the fastest threat propagation time. Symantec for years has been focused on identifying malicious. Content, and Blue Coat has been categorizing, mapping and fingerprinting the Internet with purview to the darkest parts of the web and malware tradecraft. Together, Symantec with Blue Coat will have the most powerful combination of threat intelligence as well as an open platform in which to deliver enhanced cyber defense and anchored in threat intelligence. 
Within the coming months, we will have integrated many aspects of the threat intelligence, including Symantec's endpoint and email solutions ecosystem with Blue Coat's intelligence network. This combined intelligence database and detection engines will allow our current products to become more robust and outperform the competition. The capabilities of the combined portfolio work towards a world of automated discovery with an integrated advanced threat protection dashboard that identifies, correlates and remediates threats beyond what any solution is capable of today. 
While we will lead within integrated solution on a stand-alone basis, we will continue to deliver best-of-breed security at the enforcement points, including the web gateway, [indiscernible] a email and endpoint, and are committed to an open platform for customers' ISVs. For enterprises that are adopting the cloud, our combined solutions provide the best defense in depth for the cloud generation. 
We remain very optimistic about the progress we're making with our managed security service. This is an important offer for customers that have difficulty hiring and retaining experienced security professionals. We're also committed to empowering our managed security service partners and committed to empowering this important sector as service providers and SIs are important players in the migration to the cloud.
The second major opportunity we see in the marketplace is protecting the mobile workforce. The traditional IT perimeter is expanding, as employees are doing more work outside the network firewall and are accessing cloud services and corporate data directly from a variety of devices. In addition, there has been a significant rise in nontraditional Internet-connected devices within the enterprise, such as medical devices and industrial equipment, automobiles, office equipment and other next generation endpoints and IoT devices. many of these nontraditional devices are unprotected from modern threats. Proxies are essential in protecting these technologies in the cloud generation.
This evolution in workforce computing creates gaps in the traditional security architecture, which lead to infiltration of bad actors and insider threats. And we're bringing in more secure and scalable architectural solution that combines the Symantec endpoint with the cloud generation security from Blue Coat. As a result, the Symantec endpoint will have a continuous coverage inside perimeter or while roaming, protecting users and data. We have already begun integration of the SEP endpoint security with the cloud security proxy, email, DLP and CASB, which provides complete security coverage no matter where and enterprise devices travel. In addition to this, our managed security service can assist our customers and partners in reducing costs related to incident response.
For example, the SEP agent will direct all outbound traffic to the Blue Coat security fund for inspection. If a defect is found, our cloud security proxy from Blue Coat can quickly quarantine the user and remediate. We will autoremediate via the SEP endpoint removing substantial cost from incident response. This remediation also includes forensic recordings for the breach and can isolate the endpoint device as well as the users' cloud-based application identities by our web gateway and CASB. This sets a new bar for next generation endpoints.  This is where many next-gen endpoint vendors come up short as they only focus on traditional means of protecting laptops, desktops and servers. 
The Blue Coat acquisition allows us to bring many crucial aspects of the endpoint inspection into the cloud and open the aperture to protect any type of enterprise device, its users and the users' cloud applications. We further augment our ability to protect customers by our security analytics technology. This technology keeps a recording of activity from an endpoint, enables advanced machine learning techniques such as behavioral analysis to identify previously undetected malware. This also allows us to improve our threat detection by true root cause analysis of the vulnerability and malware tradecraft.
This is a large market, and our solution will be disruptive to alternatives. For our customers, our solutions improve cyber defense and reduce costs for remediation. No other security provider in the market today has our unique capability of deep functionality on endpoint, combined with visibility and time to remediation capabilities inherent in our cloud security platform. We believe the work we're doing is important enough to redefine cyber defense.
The third major opportunity is helping customers securely embrace the cloud as they increase the use of cloud-based applications and services. As customers access more cloud applications and leverage the cloud for their IT infrastructure, they are still responsible for securing their users and enterprise data. We believe our Cloud Generation Security platform uniquely delivers the ability to achieve this and enables a defense in depth by our open platform and the many security vendors and technologies that can be incorporate. This defense in depth future proofs an organization against attack vectors in years to come. 
A portion of the functionality needed to protect cloud services are referred to by the industry analyst as cloud security access brokers. We believe the market opportunity that goes beyond the CASB functionality to what we consider a Cloud Generation Security stack, which includes CASB, data protection, encryption, cloud incident response and elements of web security. Developing a Cloud Generation Security stack requires 3 major components. First, enterprises must deliver, categorize and instrument policies for cloud applications. Blue Coat's solution combined with the policies in force of the Blue Coat proxy is a clear leader in discovering and defining these policies. Next, enterprises must monitor and reinforce how data can be moved and accessed as it migrates around the cloud. Blue Coat's web gateway and Symantec's data protection are the market leaders controlling the access and movement of data and are already integrated into many customer environments today. Finally, enterprises will, decide based on their data policy, whether to encrypt or tokenize information. Together, we will have the leading encryption and tokenizing technology. In the market today, Symantec is the only provider that can deliver this end-to-end solution. To assemble the same level of protection through multiple vendors will result in costly, loosely integrated security architecture and a dependence on retaining the people that built it. Our customers are telling us that these sustainment costs and risks are a substantial problem.
In conclusion, let me reiterate the following points. We have a seasoned executive team with deep cybersecurity experience as well as the operational expertise for turning around, operating and growing technology businesses at scale. The product portfolios from Symantec and Blue Coat are highly complementary and positioned well for where the market is moving. Our solutions are defining the future of cybersecurity by securing consumers, enterprises and governments from advanced attacks, protecting the workforce of the future and helping customers embrace the file generation.
And I will end with that we are confident hitting the guidance Thomas outlined earlier in his remarks and the ability to deliver our commitments for fiscal 2018. Thank you for your time. Operator, we'll now open the call for Q&A."

That product is really proving to be very effective in advanced malware detection. And we have -- the customers as Thomas mentioned, we closed a good clip of customers in Q1 with that technology. And the point that he mentioned in his remarks I think is really important is 2/3 of those customers were not at an endpoint renewal. They bought it in advanced threat needs they had and added it to the environment that was already there. I think that's a really good show of faith. The road map on that product is excellent. The threat database that it's sitting on is phenomenal. And we are really excited about our ability to also integrate that in the network by the web gateways both in the cloud and on-premise. We already have, through our content analysis system, the ability to execute the advanced threat platform as one of the choices that we give customers for how to [indiscernible] those same address threats as they manifest in the network. Again, the telemetry that that platform is sitting on is we believe the deepest in the industry, taking everything from the consumer world at Norton and everything from the enterprise endpoints, and very shortly, everything from the Blue Coat world.

And we feel very good about the ability to upsell that both on from the endpoint route to market and also from our network point of presence and also [indiscernible] threat."

If you take an endpoint and you have one that's dealing with the sort of essential needs of keeping up with the antivirus. And you put some of the next generation things on it we have in 14. And then you go and put in the integration of that to any of these SOCs. And you stitch that up with any of the remediation technologies. You create a very expensive and fragile world that customers have said, ""If you can just put that together for us, we won't have to build ahead of ourselves. It's expensive for us to own it, to life [ph] sustain it. And that has been something we do believe you have an open platform. We can integrate other vendors in here, Symantec. That's great. If you put these pieces together for us, it really delivers value that is very helpful to keep that stuff going through all the releases and all of the folks you have to employ and retain to make it continue to work."" So that's been consistent feedback. We've got a great story there that's doing well. The other piece is really in the integration of the endpoint to cloud. Everyone wants to adopt the cloud. We still have to protect the endpoint. we were very bullish about solving problems desktops are old model these days. Everyone has laptops, and they carry in and out of the office. That's all are connected to the cloud, always connected to the cloud across messaging, web use, anything in your internal data centers, also all of the cloud applications, cloud infrastructure. That's the -- that resonates consistent the through customers, I think. So 2 things: complexity in building a really advanced cyber defense and a true life sustainment of that. And the second thing is really the adoption of the cloud generation really making the endpoint to the cloud security platform [indiscernible] are the 2 major things."

First of all, Symantec had a pretty strong presence in the mid-market. Blue Coat was primarily focused on the higher end of the enterprise. if we sort of take the sales force component that dealt with named account selling at the higher end of the enterprise, the combination of the 2 sales forces is actually very complementary. So we were, on the Blue Coat side, looking for a bunch of capacity expansion anyway. So we had really strong demand. And we have enough of that demand that as we look towards 2018, we do not need to make any reductions in that sales capacity. And also so in between now and us assigning all of those territories, we came up with a compensation model. And we have really invested in making sure that we can compensate both account reps that are calling on the same account in a way that ensures their interests are aligned. And if there is a Blue Coat sales, someone at Symantec gets [indiscernible] Blue Coat sale. Someone at Blue Coat gets someone if there was a new sale of a new thing that wasn't there before, everyone wins in a bigger way. So we put a ton of work in the last number of months how we would do that and really taken that all the way down and pressure testing that in the be territories that matter eastern seaboard of the U.S. where you have a large bank that's carrying big chunk of commission and making sure that that's going to work with those folks and even get Greg through talking to them all about it so we are we don't reach of that discussion in we have made those clear in our organization. And we feel really good about how that's going to go. In the mid-market, Symantec already had strong presence, and we didn't at Blue Coat. And so that's an easy one. That's a great piece of the puzzle. is just getting a better solution to get into those partners and customers in the market. So net-net, we are -- I think we're pretty good at this topic on both the Symantec and Blue Coat side. How to think about it is we just increased our sales capacity. And we have enough demand that we do believe we have makeable plans for all of the selling teams across the territories. And we feel really good about that. The cross-sell and upsell I think once that sales force is ramped and both sides can sell a lot of the other's products, so we should see nice tailwinds in '18 as that becomes productive. So we feel really good about the top line 6 to 9 months from now as that really starts to fire. And the other piece, I think, is also really key is that many of the Blue Coat sales force, which we grew substantially over the last couple of years, has sold endpoint and has sold the other like solutions that Symantec has, such as DLP and things like that. And the Blue Coat sales forces selling DLP because [indiscernible] orchestrates most of the deal in market anyway. So we feel really good about the 2, big market-leading Symantec endpoint and DLP products [indiscernible] to be able to be executed by the named account reps on the Blue Coat side. So we're optimistic about having some good calls with you throughout '18."

And the reason why some of our enterprise endpoints and why we're much better in effectiveness because we know a lot about what bad guys are doing and a lot of that information comes from people that perhaps think [indiscernible].

So in our comments before, we really extending what we're doing in the consumer brands to get more value than just on the endpoint, an early start to look at the network and the use of the Internet by the consumer. And we are already we're working on a bunch of things that are really going out to really excite consumers more about wanting to make the decision around Norton their consumer security needs. Because it's more than just the PC. So getting off that PC platform that's important. We actually know a lot about it because we've been working with telecom provides for many years at Blue Coat. And we know technologies we have and our quality of service and be able to do things like measure screen time. And we've already been in contact control for a long time. So we actually really want to extend the value of Norton off PC platform, the other kind of just technical endpoints, more into what that users doing and helping them with some of the new challenges that they have on the Internet. So you'll be hearing more from us over time, but we definitely have technology in this space. And we have the networking cred to get in and help out from that part of the store you for consumers. What we're doing in WiFi and some of the home IoT is also impressive. And so John, we don't want to sit around and kind of watch that getting tied on the PC platform really. We want to address that part of the business also."

So first of all when we talk about next-gen endpoints and we actually think about what's going on in the platform, we're seriously competitive against all of the other folks that are there right now, things like flight recorders, things like being able to have behavioral analysis, machine learning. They all exist and serious tech and in terms of very experienced people that are working on them here at Symantec. I'd say if I was going to give us a ding on something, I'd say we don't talk about it enough. But we have a very powerful platform and the latest releases of SEP. has very competitive against the next gen endpoints we've been able to win with that next gen integrated with the ATP stuff we were talking about. We've been taking on some of the guys who are not [indiscernible] into this next-gen endpoints something had contact with competitors. But I tell you we have a very good competitive offering just head-to-head on modern techniques that they call modern techniques, which means the old techniques, I can tell you, old techniques are also seriously still needed. The modern techniques are also useful. And they were always be the next modern techniques because the bad guys are smart and they change the way they do things. But being able to defend against what are the most advanced threats today, we do well in that space. We do have a good platform there. we don't market it as well as we should. We will change that. And then in addition to that, the number of technologists that are very good at what they do, that we are investing in this space, is substantial. And we will continue to do that. We will grow that. And we are after the best and brightest all the time in the industry. one of the things my reputation in every company I've been involved, I've gone after best experts and retaining best ones we have and getting more. And we are setting our crosshairs on this ownership of this next-gen endpoint. So then we move to what are we doing for the other guys aren't doing and that the other guys will have a big problem doing? It's very difficult to think about protection of users when you don't think about protection of those users in the SaaS applications that they are using when the application used to be all inside a data center, you can isolate an endpoint and protect that identity and associated data. Half of those applications left the building. If you can't isolate the user's identity in the cloud applications and to do that, you need logic like a CASB. It's difficult to really go to company and say have isolated Greg, really get Greg as related salesforce.com, ServiceNow? Did I get Netsuite stuff locked up? what about other database so the now whatever happens. So we are right now the only next-gen endpoints that can adjust isolation of the user. In that if you really want to get into the bowels of it, if we start talking about multiphased attacks, the network assist to given our endpoint and multiphased attacks, then being able to vaccinate those from the messaging layer from the web. We feel really good about competing against the endpoint vendor. And then a final point I'd like to make is when you move to the cloud, you don't get to picture your next gen firewall. When you're not taking your next gen firewall, the [indiscernible] between next gen firewall and the advanced endpoint breaks. So we feel really good about our cloud platform connected to the Symantec next-gen endpoints and our ability to really change the game over the next-gen endpoints. So we will really work hard to make sure the industry understands what I was just talking about. There was a lot there and that, that architecture in our ability to executed and delivered as well understood. And I feel pretty good about our ability to stem the tide of what I'd say had been may be a better execution from cemented that would have taken some of the tail out of some of the next-gen endpoints folks. one more point, one of the most important points, we have a very strong balance sheet. And this next-gen endpoint is going to go on for a long time. And we are going to be there. And we're going to be there with a strong investment all the way through it. And I'm not so sure that's the case in many others. So that's hopefully helpful. 
I think that's it. I think we running out of time. But I just like to thank all of you for taking some time to talk to us today and your support of Symantec. Thank you very much. Thank you."

It's an exciting time for the new Symantec, and I'm proud to be lead the company that will define the future of cybersecurity. 
We are already off to a great start by closing the Blue Coat acquisition earlier than expected in under 2 months since announcement. This has allowed us to move rapidly into the execution of our innovation strategy.  Since the announcement of the acquisition, we have pressure tested our financial assumptions and continue to remain confident in achieving fiscal 2018 EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.80, which we disclosed when we announced the acquisition in June. Our combined product portfolio separates us as the most strategic security player in the industry, with a portfolio solutions that addresses over 50% of the enterprise security budgets or an approximate $40 billion of total available market. 
Furthermore, we are the only security company that has the scale and vision to be considered by the CIO as one of the most strategic technology partners. As you saw from dimension data's quote in our closing press release earlier this week, partners are extremely optimistic about the technology that the combined company can bring to market. In addition to great support from our partners, we have had an outstanding feedback from the customer base. I'll provide more customer feedback later in my remarks.

Then I will address why we are confident that we have the deep leadership expertise in place to integrate the 2 companies and deliver upon our financial targets. I will wrap up by describing major cybersecurity challenges enterprises are facing, and how Symantec is best position to usher in a new era of cybersecurity solutions to solve these multibillion-dollar opportunities."

Nearly 2 years ago, we announced our intention to become the leading pure play cybersecurity company. With the close of the Blue Coat acquisition, we've accelerated that strategy and now are positioned to execute on our integration road map while we define the future of cybersecurity. 
Today, I will provide an overview of our first quarter results, update you on our $550 million cost efficiencies and Blue Coat integration synergies and conclude with our combined financial outlook. Additional details are provided in our CFO commentary, which is available on our Investor Relations website.
Our first quarter total revenue was $884 million, above the midpoint of our guided range, driven by improved performance within Enterprise Security and continued in line results from Consumer Security. From a macro and security spending standpoint, we did not see any incremental weakness in Europe related to Brexit. However, we continue to monitor our European pipeline very closely.  Deferred revenue was $2.4 billion, which includes $243 million of deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied billings excluding Veritas were $788 million declined 1.6% on a reported basis. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 28.6% and 210 basis points above the high end of our guided range of 24.5% to 26.5%. And the upside was evenly split by an early start to our cost efficiency savings and some onetime expense benefits. 
Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.29 and above our guidance of $0.24 to $0.26. Our non-GAAP tax rate and share count were in line with guidance. 
Cash flow from continuing operations during the quarter was a negative $742 million, which included a tax payment of $887 million related to the gain from the sale of Veritas and $39 million in cash outflows related to restructuring and the Veritas separation. 
Let me now provide further detail on our performance by segment.  Enterprise Security revenue was $481 million and declined 1% year-over-year, which was at the high end of our guidance of down 4% to down 1%, driven by strength in both information protection and cybersecurity services. 
Now I will review the product areas within our Enterprise Security segment.  Threat protection revenue was down 5%. However, endpoint security including ATP grew low single digits year-over-year. Our newly launched ATP solutions showed continued momentum in what is a seasonally slower quarter. During Q1, we sold ATP subscriptions to 115 customers. And importantly, 2/3 of the Q1 ATP deals were sold independent of a renewal. Overall, we continue to maintain the value of our SEP and .cloud recurring revenue and in some cases, expand our footprint within the account. Since its launch in December, we have sold ATP to 270 customers. Within the install base, there remains significant opportunity for additional ATP module cross-sell or seat expansion.
Information protection revenue grew 4%. DLP revenue grew 18% and is benefiting from a tailwind of strong prior quarter deferred revenue growth and a favorable prior year compare. Looking forward, we have a solid pipeline for DLP, driven by data protection requirements as our customers adopt cloud-based applications. In addition, we are excited about the future of our data protection growth as we package DLP with our market-leading secure web gateway.
Cybersecurity services and other services grew 9%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth with solid performance across Managed security Services, incident response, threat intelligence and other security-focused professional services. Underlying these results, we continue to see strong demand for actionable cyber threat intelligence. 
Website security revenue grew 1% and performed in line with our expectations. We continue to see good performance from the higher end of our website security portfolio where our complete Website Security offering is gaining traction. On the lower end of the market, we expect our Encryption Everywhere solution to provide a tailwind to results in fiscal 2018 as we begin to benefit from the conversion of this offering.
Now on to the Norton Consumer Security segment. Consumer Security revenue was down slightly less than 8%, which was at the lower end of our guidance of down 8% to down 5%. The underlying fundamentals of our consumer business continue to improve, driven by the move to subscription and online customer acquisition. We are also seeing early pipeline building for new solutions such as WiFi privacy and home IoT offerings. 
Let me now review some additional performance metrics for the Norton business. During Q1, retention rates continued to increase on a year-over-year basis following the anniversary of our transition to subscription model in the U.S. we will reach the 1-year anniversary internationally at the end of the fiscal Q2. We continue to grow our online acquisition of customers, which grew new subscriptions 4% during the first quarter.
Finally, earlier this summer, we launched our WiFi privacy offering. This solution provides a secure connection while connected to an unsecured network. We are targeting the solution as both an upsell into our current install base and as a stand-alone solution to attract new Norton subscribers.
Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. On August 1, we added $2.8 billion of new debt and $1.25 billion of convertible notes. We have $5.6 billion in cash and $7.3 billion in total debt, including the $1.75 billion of convertible notes. As we previously said, we expect to delever our balance sheet over the medium term. 
As of last Friday, our current ASR is 58% complete, and we expect this it to finish in the fall of this year. We remain committed to maintaining our quarterly dividend.
Shifting gears to our $550 million of cost savings initiatives and the Blue Coat integration synergies. We've already made progress achieving savings across the areas of procurement, organizational effectiveness and, to a lesser extent, real estate. On an annualized basis, we have realized approximately $50 million of a run rate net cost efficiencies. In addition to efficiency savings, we expect to achieve synergies from the Blue Coat acquisition by the end of fiscal 2018. The earlier close provides us a head start achieving these.
Before providing our guidance, let me walk through the underlying mechanics. We will be referring to the non-GAAP performance of the business, and please see the CFO commentary for more detailed description. 
Going forward, Blue Coat will be reported as part of our Enterprise Security segment, given our plans to integrate multiple product solutions. It is important to note that historically, Blue Coat's fiscal second quarter has ended on October 31. Therefore, our fiscal second quarter guidance will include 2 months of contribution from Blue Coat from August 1 to September 30.  It is also important to note that Blue Coat's revenue linearity is heavily weighted to the last month of the quarter. Therefore, embedded in our Q2 guidance is up to 50% of Blue Coat's prior Q2 non-GAAP revenue forecast. However, from a cost standpoint, won't be burdened by approximately 2/3 of Blue Coat's second quarter spending, with only half the revenue. From a reporting standpoint, this linearity difference puts an abnormal burden on our operating margin in Q2.
We are focused on maintaining strong sales execution during our integration. However, we believe that it is prudent to set conservative top line guidance for Q2 and fiscal 2017 as we combine the 2 companies. 
We expect second quarter non-GAAP revenue to be up 4% to 8% to $960 million to $990 million. We expect consumer revenue to be down approximately 7% to $395 million to $400 million. We expect Enterprise Security, which includes a 2-month contribution from Blue Coat, to be up 14% to 20% to $565 million to $590 million. 
We expect an operating margin of 21% to 24%. To reiterate, a portion of the incremental margins is due to our burden from 2/3 of the spend, but only 50% of revenue benefits from Blue Coat. And we expect approximately $13 million of the headwind to non-GAAP operating margin related to retention payments and sales force incentives put in place to ensure stability during our integration.  
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.21, with a tax rate of 29% and a fully diluted average share count of 640 million.
Now on to fiscal 2017 guidance. As a reminder, our fiscal 2017 outlook only includes 8 months of revenue contribution from Blue Coat. 
We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be up 11% to 13% to $4,040 million to $4,120 million. Fiscal 2017 operating margin is expected to be in the range of 26% to 28%. We expect approximately $45 million of onetime expense related to retention payments and sales force incentives put in place to ensure stability during our integration. We expect EPS of $1.08 to $1.14, with a tax rate of 29% and a fully diluted average share count of 616 million. 
our fiscal 2018 outlook, we plan to enter fiscal 2018 with an operating margin of 30%. For fiscal 2018, we continue to expect EPS in the range of $1.70 to $1.80. 
Now let me turn the call back to Greg"

Let's begin with why I am confident we have the leadership team in place to deliver the leading cyber defense portfolio while integrating our 2 companies in achieving our financial targets.  With the Veritas divestiture behind us, we are focused on removing the remaining stranded costs and further improving our operating efficiency. This is an important step to deliver our commitment to the $550 million in savings and synergies. 
When I joined Blue Coat in 2011, the company had multiple quarters of revenue declines with below-average profitability. While at Blue Coat, we delivered substantial improvements in operating effectiveness, acquisitions were fully integrated and the company returned to growth. This experience is highly relevant to delivering process efficiencies at Symantec. We focused the product strategy to cybersecurity, rebuild the go-to-market engine and improved profitability and thoughtfully leveraged our balance sheet to successfully acquire market-leading technologies. Blue Coat today is a clear leader in cloud security with the #1 market share of the secure web gateway. Organic revenue growth is now in the mid-teens with operating margins in the high 20s.  When we combined Blue Coat leadership team with the many talented executives from Symantec, the outcome is a deep bench across all functions, with a technology portfolio that is market-leading back by substantial development talent totaling over 4,000 engineers.
Let me turn to some early feedback from customers and our channel. I was recently visiting the CIO of a global financial institution that said the combination of Symantec and Blue Coat not only makes us their most strategic security partner, but we are now considered one of the top overall strategic technology partners. This type of recognition is not taken for granted and offers a clear advantage versus our competition. Many other large enterprise customers have proactively reached out to us not only to express excitement about the further integration of our product lines, but are even more enthusiastic about our longer-term vision and our relevance in their migration and adoption to cloud solutions. 
Furthermore, our channel provides that service to mid-market have expressed excitement around the power of our endpoint solution integrated into our cloud security platform. It is in the mid-market where securely adopting cloud applications is essential. 
Now I will comment on how we plan to maintain strong sales execution while we realize the $550 million in cost efficiencies and Blue Coat synergies. As previously announced, Mike Fey has been appointed as COO and President. Mike's organization was instrumental in leading the Blue Coat sales force and channel in consistently meeting or beating our sales plans and taking market share. 
We plan to maintain our combined sales capacity. Together, we have the largest dedicated security sales force with deep technical strength to bring our products to market. Combined sales capacity is substantially increased in the enterprise market. 
As we outlined on the acquisition announcement, we find less-than-expected customer overlap during our due diligence, which over the medium term offers us a meaningful cross-sell opportunity and provides tailwinds for fiscal 2018. We are also excited about working with our many channel partners across the globe and bringing differentiated value to our joint customers.
Let me touch on our plans beyond sales. The Consumer Security team will remain a stand-alone unit from an operational standpoint and report directly to me. The management team in this business unit is excellent. We are pleased with the stability of the business encouraged by the product road map. We will continue to make investments that extend the Norton value beyond the traditional PC to return the segment to growth. These include new products such as WiFi privacy and home IoT. 
From an enterprise security standpoint, during the planning process, we jointly reviewed product road maps with respective teams. I am truly impressed by the level of game-changing product leadership our development teams are pursuing. We'll be sharing many of these in the upcoming quarters. 
With regards to operational integration, we have worked diligently to put integration plan in place that is led by seasoned executives, and we are on track to achieve our targets. We expect to be substantially operationally integrated by the end of our fiscal year, March 2017. 
Turning to Blue Coat's fiscal Q1 performance. As many of you know, Blue Coat historically has been a July month-ending first quarter. While we are still closing our books, we do not yet have official results, I'm pleased to share that from an overall performance standpoint that our Q1 results were ahead of expectations and we saw strong momentum across all products. 
Now let's switch gears to address how our combined portfolio can help solve the biggest security problems that our customers are facing.  First, the largest opportunity we see in the market is securing enterprises, governments and consumers from advanced attacks, securing our customers as they adopt cloud. When it comes to staying ahead of advanced threats, a key differentiator is the speed at which one can identify and mitigate malicious activity across a functionally rich set of products. Together, Symantec and Blue Coat have the broadest and deepest set of threat intelligence data in the industry, combined with the fastest threat propagation time. Symantec for years has been focused on identifying malicious. Content, and Blue Coat has been categorizing, mapping and fingerprinting the Internet with purview to the darkest parts of the web and malware tradecraft. Together, Symantec with Blue Coat will have the most powerful combination of threat intelligence as well as an open platform in which to deliver enhanced cyber defense and anchored in threat intelligence. 
Within the coming months, we will have integrated many aspects of the threat intelligence, including Symantec's endpoint and email solutions ecosystem with Blue Coat's intelligence network. This combined intelligence database and detection engines will allow our current products to become more robust and outperform the competition. The capabilities of the combined portfolio work towards a world of automated discovery with an integrated advanced threat protection dashboard that identifies, correlates and remediates threats beyond what any solution is capable of today. 
While we will lead within integrated solution on a stand-alone basis, we will continue to deliver best-of-breed security at the enforcement points, including the web gateway, [indiscernible] a email and endpoint, and are committed to an open platform for customers' ISVs. For enterprises that are adopting the cloud, our combined solutions provide the best defense in depth for the cloud generation. 
We remain very optimistic about the progress we're making with our managed security service. This is an important offer for customers that have difficulty hiring and retaining experienced security professionals. We're also committed to empowering our managed security service partners and committed to empowering this important sector as service providers and SIs are important players in the migration to the cloud.
The second major opportunity we see in the marketplace is protecting the mobile workforce. The traditional IT perimeter is expanding, as employees are doing more work outside the network firewall and are accessing cloud services and corporate data directly from a variety of devices. In addition, there has been a significant rise in nontraditional Internet-connected devices within the enterprise, such as medical devices and industrial equipment, automobiles, office equipment and other next generation endpoints and IoT devices. many of these nontraditional devices are unprotected from modern threats. Proxies are essential in protecting these technologies in the cloud generation.
This evolution in workforce computing creates gaps in the traditional security architecture, which lead to infiltration of bad actors and insider threats. And we're bringing in more secure and scalable architectural solution that combines the Symantec endpoint with the cloud generation security from Blue Coat. As a result, the Symantec endpoint will have a continuous coverage inside perimeter or while roaming, protecting users and data. We have already begun integration of the SEP endpoint security with the cloud security proxy, email, DLP and CASB, which provides complete security coverage no matter where and enterprise devices travel. In addition to this, our managed security service can assist our customers and partners in reducing costs related to incident response.
For example, the SEP agent will direct all outbound traffic to the Blue Coat security fund for inspection. If a defect is found, our cloud security proxy from Blue Coat can quickly quarantine the user and remediate. We will autoremediate via the SEP endpoint removing substantial cost from incident response. This remediation also includes forensic recordings for the breach and can isolate the endpoint device as well as the users' cloud-based application identities by our web gateway and CASB. This sets a new bar for next generation endpoints.  This is where many next-gen endpoint vendors come up short as they only focus on traditional means of protecting laptops, desktops and servers. 
The Blue Coat acquisition allows us to bring many crucial aspects of the endpoint inspection into the cloud and open the aperture to protect any type of enterprise device, its users and the users' cloud applications. We further augment our ability to protect customers by our security analytics technology. This technology keeps a recording of activity from an endpoint, enables advanced machine learning techniques such as behavioral analysis to identify previously undetected malware. This also allows us to improve our threat detection by true root cause analysis of the vulnerability and malware tradecraft.
This is a large market, and our solution will be disruptive to alternatives. For our customers, our solutions improve cyber defense and reduce costs for remediation. No other security provider in the market today has our unique capability of deep functionality on endpoint, combined with visibility and time to remediation capabilities inherent in our cloud security platform. We believe the work we're doing is important enough to redefine cyber defense.
The third major opportunity is helping customers securely embrace the cloud as they increase the use of cloud-based applications and services. As customers access more cloud applications and leverage the cloud for their IT infrastructure, they are still responsible for securing their users and enterprise data. We believe our Cloud Generation Security platform uniquely delivers the ability to achieve this and enables a defense in depth by our open platform and the many security vendors and technologies that can be incorporate. This defense in depth future proofs an organization against attack vectors in years to come. 
A portion of the functionality needed to protect cloud services are referred to by the industry analyst as cloud security access brokers. We believe the market opportunity that goes beyond the CASB functionality to what we consider a Cloud Generation Security stack, which includes CASB, data protection, encryption, cloud incident response and elements of web security. Developing a Cloud Generation Security stack requires 3 major components. First, enterprises must deliver, categorize and instrument policies for cloud applications. Blue Coat's solution combined with the policies in force of the Blue Coat proxy is a clear leader in discovering and defining these policies. Next, enterprises must monitor and reinforce how data can be moved and accessed as it migrates around the cloud. Blue Coat's web gateway and Symantec's data protection are the market leaders controlling the access and movement of data and are already integrated into many customer environments today. Finally, enterprises will, decide based on their data policy, whether to encrypt or tokenize information. Together, we will have the leading encryption and tokenizing technology. In the market today, Symantec is the only provider that can deliver this end-to-end solution. To assemble the same level of protection through multiple vendors will result in costly, loosely integrated security architecture and a dependence on retaining the people that built it. Our customers are telling us that these sustainment costs and risks are a substantial problem.
In conclusion, let me reiterate the following points. We have a seasoned executive team with deep cybersecurity experience as well as the operational expertise for turning around, operating and growing technology businesses at scale. The product portfolios from Symantec and Blue Coat are highly complementary and positioned well for where the market is moving. Our solutions are defining the future of cybersecurity by securing consumers, enterprises and governments from advanced attacks, protecting the workforce of the future and helping customers embrace the file generation.
And I will end with that we are confident hitting the guidance Thomas outlined earlier in his remarks and the ability to deliver our commitments for fiscal 2018. Thank you for your time. Operator, we'll now open the call for Q&A."

That product is really proving to be very effective in advanced malware detection. And we have -- the customers as Thomas mentioned, we closed a good clip of customers in Q1 with that technology. And the point that he mentioned in his remarks I think is really important is 2/3 of those customers were not at an endpoint renewal. They bought it in advanced threat needs they had and added it to the environment that was already there. I think that's a really good show of faith. The road map on that product is excellent. The threat database that it's sitting on is phenomenal. And we are really excited about our ability to also integrate that in the network by the web gateways both in the cloud and on-premise. We already have, through our content analysis system, the ability to execute the advanced threat platform as one of the choices that we give customers for how to [indiscernible] those same address threats as they manifest in the network. Again, the telemetry that that platform is sitting on is we believe the deepest in the industry, taking everything from the consumer world at Norton and everything from the enterprise endpoints, and very shortly, everything from the Blue Coat world.

And we feel very good about the ability to upsell that both on from the endpoint route to market and also from our network point of presence and also [indiscernible] threat."

If you take an endpoint and you have one that's dealing with the sort of essential needs of keeping up with the antivirus. And you put some of the next generation things on it we have in 14. And then you go and put in the integration of that to any of these SOCs. And you stitch that up with any of the remediation technologies. You create a very expensive and fragile world that customers have said, ""If you can just put that together for us, we won't have to build ahead of ourselves. It's expensive for us to own it, to life [ph] sustain it. And that has been something we do believe you have an open platform. We can integrate other vendors in here, Symantec. That's great. If you put these pieces together for us, it really delivers value that is very helpful to keep that stuff going through all the releases and all of the folks you have to employ and retain to make it continue to work."" So that's been consistent feedback. We've got a great story there that's doing well. The other piece is really in the integration of the endpoint to cloud. Everyone wants to adopt the cloud. We still have to protect the endpoint. we were very bullish about solving problems desktops are old model these days. Everyone has laptops, and they carry in and out of the office. That's all are connected to the cloud, always connected to the cloud across messaging, web use, anything in your internal data centers, also all of the cloud applications, cloud infrastructure. That's the -- that resonates consistent the through customers, I think. So 2 things: complexity in building a really advanced cyber defense and a true life sustainment of that. And the second thing is really the adoption of the cloud generation really making the endpoint to the cloud security platform [indiscernible] are the 2 major things."

So we were, on the Blue Coat side, looking for a bunch of capacity expansion anyway. So we had really strong demand. And we have enough of that demand that as we look towards 2018, we do not need to make any reductions in that sales capacity. And also so in between now and us assigning all of those territories, we came up with a compensation model. And we have really invested in making sure that we can compensate both account reps that are calling on the same account in a way that ensures their interests are aligned. And if there is a Blue Coat sales, someone at Symantec gets [indiscernible] Blue Coat sale. Someone at Blue Coat gets someone if there was a new sale of a new thing that wasn't there before, everyone wins in a bigger way.

So net-net, we are -- I think we're pretty good at this topic on both the Symantec and Blue Coat side. How to think about it is we just increased our sales capacity. And we have enough demand that we do believe we have makeable plans for all of the selling teams across the territories. And we feel really good about that. The cross-sell and upsell I think once that sales force is ramped and both sides can sell a lot of the other's products, so we should see nice tailwinds in '18 as that becomes productive. So we feel really good about the top line 6 to 9 months from now as that really starts to fire. And the other piece, I think, is also really key is that many of the Blue Coat sales force, which we grew substantially over the last couple of years, has sold endpoint and has sold the other like solutions that Symantec has, such as DLP and things like that. And the Blue Coat sales forces selling DLP because [indiscernible] orchestrates most of the deal in market anyway. So we feel really good about the 2, big market-leading Symantec endpoint and DLP products [indiscernible] to be able to be executed by the named account reps on the Blue Coat side. So we're optimistic about having some good calls with you throughout '18."

So in our comments before, we really extending what we're doing in the consumer brands to get more value than just on the endpoint, an early start to look at the network and the use of the Internet by the consumer. And we are already we're working on a bunch of things that are really going out to really excite consumers more about wanting to make the decision around Norton their consumer security needs. Because it's more than just the PC. So getting off that PC platform that's important. We actually know a lot about it because we've been working with telecom provides for many years at Blue Coat. And we know technologies we have and our quality of service and be able to do things like measure screen time. And we've already been in contact control for a long time. So we actually really want to extend the value of Norton off PC platform, the other kind of just technical endpoints, more into what that users doing and helping them with some of the new challenges that they have on the Internet. So you'll be hearing more from us over time, but we definitely have technology in this space. And we have the networking cred to get in and help out from that part of the store you for consumers. What we're doing in WiFi and some of the home IoT is also impressive. And so John, we don't want to sit around and kind of watch that getting tied on the PC platform really. We want to address that part of the business also."

So first of all when we talk about next-gen endpoints and we actually think about what's going on in the platform, we're seriously competitive against all of the other folks that are there right now, things like flight recorders, things like being able to have behavioral analysis, machine learning. They all exist and serious tech and in terms of very experienced people that are working on them here at Symantec. I'd say if I was going to give us a ding on something, I'd say we don't talk about it enough. But we have a very powerful platform and the latest releases of SEP. has very competitive against the next gen endpoints we've been able to win with that next gen integrated with the ATP stuff we were talking about. We've been taking on some of the guys who are not [indiscernible] into this next-gen endpoints something had contact with competitors. But I tell you we have a very good competitive offering just head-to-head on modern techniques that they call modern techniques, which means the old techniques, I can tell you, old techniques are also seriously still needed. The modern techniques are also useful. And they were always be the next modern techniques because the bad guys are smart and they change the way they do things. But being able to defend against what are the most advanced threats today, we do well in that space. We do have a good platform there. we don't market it as well as we should. We will change that. And then in addition to that, the number of technologists that are very good at what they do, that we are investing in this space, is substantial. And we will continue to do that. We will grow that. And we are after the best and brightest all the time in the industry. one of the things my reputation in every company I've been involved, I've gone after best experts and retaining best ones we have and getting more. And we are setting our crosshairs on this ownership of this next-gen endpoint. So then we move to what are we doing for the other guys aren't doing and that the other guys will have a big problem doing? It's very difficult to think about protection of users when you don't think about protection of those users in the SaaS applications that they are using when the application used to be all inside a data center, you can isolate an endpoint and protect that identity and associated data. Half of those applications left the building. If you can't isolate the user's identity in the cloud applications and to do that, you need logic like a CASB. It's difficult to really go to company and say have isolated Greg, really get Greg as related salesforce.com, ServiceNow? Did I get Netsuite stuff locked up? what about other database so the now whatever happens. So we are right now the only next-gen endpoints that can adjust isolation of the user. In that if you really want to get into the bowels of it, if we start talking about multiphased attacks, the network assist to given our endpoint and multiphased attacks, then being able to vaccinate those from the messaging layer from the web. We feel really good about competing against the endpoint vendor. And then a final point I'd like to make is when you move to the cloud, you don't get to picture your next gen firewall. When you're not taking your next gen firewall, the [indiscernible] between next gen firewall and the advanced endpoint breaks. So we feel really good about our cloud platform connected to the Symantec next-gen endpoints and our ability to really change the game over the next-gen endpoints. So we will really work hard to make sure the industry understands what I was just talking about. There was a lot there and that, that architecture in our ability to executed and delivered as well understood. And I feel pretty good about our ability to stem the tide of what I'd say had been may be a better execution from cemented that would have taken some of the tail out of some of the next-gen endpoints folks. one more point, one of the most important points, we have a very strong balance sheet. And this next-gen endpoint is going to go on for a long time. And we are going to be there. And we're going to be there with a strong investment all the way through it. And I'm not so sure that's the case in many others. So that's hopefully helpful. 
I think that's it. I think we running out of time. But I just like to thank all of you for taking some time to talk to us today and your support of Symantec. Thank you very much. Thank you."

It's an exciting time for the new Symantec, and I'm proud to be lead the company that will define the future of cybersecurity. 
We are already off to a great start by closing the Blue Coat acquisition earlier than expected in under 2 months since announcement. This has allowed us to move rapidly into the execution of our innovation strategy.  Since the announcement of the acquisition, we have pressure tested our financial assumptions and continue to remain confident in achieving fiscal 2018 EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.80, which we disclosed when we announced the acquisition in June. Our combined product portfolio separates us as the most strategic security player in the industry, with a portfolio solutions that addresses over 50% of the enterprise security budgets or an approximate $40 billion of total available market. 
Furthermore, we are the only security company that has the scale and vision to be considered by the CIO as one of the most strategic technology partners. As you saw from dimension data's quote in our closing press release earlier this week, partners are extremely optimistic about the technology that the combined company can bring to market. In addition to great support from our partners, we have had an outstanding feedback from the customer base. I'll provide more customer feedback later in my remarks.

Nearly 2 years ago, we announced our intention to become the leading pure play cybersecurity company. With the close of the Blue Coat acquisition, we've accelerated that strategy and now are positioned to execute on our integration road map while we define the future of cybersecurity. 
Today, I will provide an overview of our first quarter results, update you on our $550 million cost efficiencies and Blue Coat integration synergies and conclude with our combined financial outlook. Additional details are provided in our CFO commentary, which is available on our Investor Relations website.
Our first quarter total revenue was $884 million, above the midpoint of our guided range, driven by improved performance within Enterprise Security and continued in line results from Consumer Security. From a macro and security spending standpoint, we did not see any incremental weakness in Europe related to Brexit. However, we continue to monitor our European pipeline very closely.  Deferred revenue was $2.4 billion, which includes $243 million of deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied billings excluding Veritas were $788 million declined 1.6% on a reported basis. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 28.6% and 210 basis points above the high end of our guided range of 24.5% to 26.5%. And the upside was evenly split by an early start to our cost efficiency savings and some onetime expense benefits. 
Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.29 and above our guidance of $0.24 to $0.26. Our non-GAAP tax rate and share count were in line with guidance. 
Cash flow from continuing operations during the quarter was a negative $742 million, which included a tax payment of $887 million related to the gain from the sale of Veritas and $39 million in cash outflows related to restructuring and the Veritas separation. 
Let me now provide further detail on our performance by segment.  Enterprise Security revenue was $481 million and declined 1% year-over-year, which was at the high end of our guidance of down 4% to down 1%, driven by strength in both information protection and cybersecurity services. 
Now I will review the product areas within our Enterprise Security segment.  Threat protection revenue was down 5%. However, endpoint security including ATP grew low single digits year-over-year. Our newly launched ATP solutions showed continued momentum in what is a seasonally slower quarter. During Q1, we sold ATP subscriptions to 115 customers. And importantly, 2/3 of the Q1 ATP deals were sold independent of a renewal. Overall, we continue to maintain the value of our SEP and .cloud recurring revenue and in some cases, expand our footprint within the account. Since its launch in December, we have sold ATP to 270 customers. Within the install base, there remains significant opportunity for additional ATP module cross-sell or seat expansion.
Information protection revenue grew 4%. DLP revenue grew 18% and is benefiting from a tailwind of strong prior quarter deferred revenue growth and a favorable prior year compare. Looking forward, we have a solid pipeline for DLP, driven by data protection requirements as our customers adopt cloud-based applications. In addition, we are excited about the future of our data protection growth as we package DLP with our market-leading secure web gateway.
Cybersecurity services and other services grew 9%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth with solid performance across Managed security Services, incident response, threat intelligence and other security-focused professional services. Underlying these results, we continue to see strong demand for actionable cyber threat intelligence. 
Website security revenue grew 1% and performed in line with our expectations. We continue to see good performance from the higher end of our website security portfolio where our complete Website Security offering is gaining traction. On the lower end of the market, we expect our Encryption Everywhere solution to provide a tailwind to results in fiscal 2018 as we begin to benefit from the conversion of this offering.
Now on to the Norton Consumer Security segment. Consumer Security revenue was down slightly less than 8%, which was at the lower end of our guidance of down 8% to down 5%. The underlying fundamentals of our consumer business continue to improve, driven by the move to subscription and online customer acquisition. We are also seeing early pipeline building for new solutions such as WiFi privacy and home IoT offerings. 
Let me now review some additional performance metrics for the Norton business. During Q1, retention rates continued to increase on a year-over-year basis following the anniversary of our transition to subscription model in the U.S. we will reach the 1-year anniversary internationally at the end of the fiscal Q2. We continue to grow our online acquisition of customers, which grew new subscriptions 4% during the first quarter.
Finally, earlier this summer, we launched our WiFi privacy offering. This solution provides a secure connection while connected to an unsecured network. We are targeting the solution as both an upsell into our current install base and as a stand-alone solution to attract new Norton subscribers.
Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. On August 1, we added $2.8 billion of new debt and $1.25 billion of convertible notes. We have $5.6 billion in cash and $7.3 billion in total debt, including the $1.75 billion of convertible notes. As we previously said, we expect to delever our balance sheet over the medium term. 
As of last Friday, our current ASR is 58% complete, and we expect this it to finish in the fall of this year. We remain committed to maintaining our quarterly dividend.
Shifting gears to our $550 million of cost savings initiatives and the Blue Coat integration synergies. We've already made progress achieving savings across the areas of procurement, organizational effectiveness and, to a lesser extent, real estate. On an annualized basis, we have realized approximately $50 million of a run rate net cost efficiencies. In addition to efficiency savings, we expect to achieve synergies from the Blue Coat acquisition by the end of fiscal 2018. The earlier close provides us a head start achieving these.
Before providing our guidance, let me walk through the underlying mechanics. We will be referring to the non-GAAP performance of the business, and please see the CFO commentary for more detailed description. 
Going forward, Blue Coat will be reported as part of our Enterprise Security segment, given our plans to integrate multiple product solutions. It is important to note that historically, Blue Coat's fiscal second quarter has ended on October 31. Therefore, our fiscal second quarter guidance will include 2 months of contribution from Blue Coat from August 1 to September 30.  It is also important to note that Blue Coat's revenue linearity is heavily weighted to the last month of the quarter. Therefore, embedded in our Q2 guidance is up to 50% of Blue Coat's prior Q2 non-GAAP revenue forecast. However, from a cost standpoint, won't be burdened by approximately 2/3 of Blue Coat's second quarter spending, with only half the revenue. From a reporting standpoint, this linearity difference puts an abnormal burden on our operating margin in Q2.
We are focused on maintaining strong sales execution during our integration. However, we believe that it is prudent to set conservative top line guidance for Q2 and fiscal 2017 as we combine the 2 companies. 
We expect second quarter non-GAAP revenue to be up 4% to 8% to $960 million to $990 million. We expect consumer revenue to be down approximately 7% to $395 million to $400 million. We expect Enterprise Security, which includes a 2-month contribution from Blue Coat, to be up 14% to 20% to $565 million to $590 million. 
We expect an operating margin of 21% to 24%. To reiterate, a portion of the incremental margins is due to our burden from 2/3 of the spend, but only 50% of revenue benefits from Blue Coat. And we expect approximately $13 million of the headwind to non-GAAP operating margin related to retention payments and sales force incentives put in place to ensure stability during our integration.  
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.21, with a tax rate of 29% and a fully diluted average share count of 640 million.
Now on to fiscal 2017 guidance. As a reminder, our fiscal 2017 outlook only includes 8 months of revenue contribution from Blue Coat. 
We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be up 11% to 13% to $4,040 million to $4,120 million. Fiscal 2017 operating margin is expected to be in the range of 26% to 28%. We expect approximately $45 million of onetime expense related to retention payments and sales force incentives put in place to ensure stability during our integration. We expect EPS of $1.08 to $1.14, with a tax rate of 29% and a fully diluted average share count of 616 million. 
our fiscal 2018 outlook, we plan to enter fiscal 2018 with an operating margin of 30%. For fiscal 2018, we continue to expect EPS in the range of $1.70 to $1.80. 
Now let me turn the call back to Greg"

When I joined Blue Coat in 2011, the company had multiple quarters of revenue declines with below-average profitability. While at Blue Coat, we delivered substantial improvements in operating effectiveness, acquisitions were fully integrated and the company returned to growth. This experience is highly relevant to delivering process efficiencies at Symantec. We focused the product strategy to cybersecurity, rebuild the go-to-market engine and improved profitability and thoughtfully leveraged our balance sheet to successfully acquire market-leading technologies. Blue Coat today is a clear leader in cloud security with the #1 market share of the secure web gateway. Organic revenue growth is now in the mid-teens with operating margins in the high 20s.  When we combined Blue Coat leadership team with the many talented executives from Symantec, the outcome is a deep bench across all functions, with a technology portfolio that is market-leading back by substantial development talent totaling over 4,000 engineers.
Let me turn to some early feedback from customers and our channel. I was recently visiting the CIO of a global financial institution that said the combination of Symantec and Blue Coat not only makes us their most strategic security partner, but we are now considered one of the top overall strategic technology partners. This type of recognition is not taken for granted and offers a clear advantage versus our competition. Many other large enterprise customers have proactively reached out to us not only to express excitement about the further integration of our product lines, but are even more enthusiastic about our longer-term vision and our relevance in their migration and adoption to cloud solutions. 
Furthermore, our channel provides that service to mid-market have expressed excitement around the power of our endpoint solution integrated into our cloud security platform. It is in the mid-market where securely adopting cloud applications is essential. 
Now I will comment on how we plan to maintain strong sales execution while we realize the $550 million in cost efficiencies and Blue Coat synergies. As previously announced, Mike Fey has been appointed as COO and President. Mike's organization was instrumental in leading the Blue Coat sales force and channel in consistently meeting or beating our sales plans and taking market share. 
We plan to maintain our combined sales capacity. Together, we have the largest dedicated security sales force with deep technical strength to bring our products to market. Combined sales capacity is substantially increased in the enterprise market. 
As we outlined on the acquisition announcement, we find less-than-expected customer overlap during our due diligence, which over the medium term offers us a meaningful cross-sell opportunity and provides tailwinds for fiscal 2018. We are also excited about working with our many channel partners across the globe and bringing differentiated value to our joint customers.
Let me touch on our plans beyond sales. The Consumer Security team will remain a stand-alone unit from an operational standpoint and report directly to me. The management team in this business unit is excellent. We are pleased with the stability of the business encouraged by the product road map. We will continue to make investments that extend the Norton value beyond the traditional PC to return the segment to growth. These include new products such as WiFi privacy and home IoT. 
From an enterprise security standpoint, during the planning process, we jointly reviewed product road maps with respective teams. I am truly impressed by the level of game-changing product leadership our development teams are pursuing. We'll be sharing many of these in the upcoming quarters. 
With regards to operational integration, we have worked diligently to put integration plan in place that is led by seasoned executives, and we are on track to achieve our targets. We expect to be substantially operationally integrated by the end of our fiscal year, March 2017. 
Turning to Blue Coat's fiscal Q1 performance. As many of you know, Blue Coat historically has been a July month-ending first quarter. While we are still closing our books, we do not yet have official results, I'm pleased to share that from an overall performance standpoint that our Q1 results were ahead of expectations and we saw strong momentum across all products. 
Now let's switch gears to address how our combined portfolio can help solve the biggest security problems that our customers are facing.  First, the largest opportunity we see in the market is securing enterprises, governments and consumers from advanced attacks, securing our customers as they adopt cloud. When it comes to staying ahead of advanced threats, a key differentiator is the speed at which one can identify and mitigate malicious activity across a functionally rich set of products. Together, Symantec and Blue Coat have the broadest and deepest set of threat intelligence data in the industry, combined with the fastest threat propagation time. Symantec for years has been focused on identifying malicious. Content, and Blue Coat has been categorizing, mapping and fingerprinting the Internet with purview to the darkest parts of the web and malware tradecraft. Together, Symantec with Blue Coat will have the most powerful combination of threat intelligence as well as an open platform in which to deliver enhanced cyber defense and anchored in threat intelligence. 
Within the coming months, we will have integrated many aspects of the threat intelligence, including Symantec's endpoint and email solutions ecosystem with Blue Coat's intelligence network. This combined intelligence database and detection engines will allow our current products to become more robust and outperform the competition. The capabilities of the combined portfolio work towards a world of automated discovery with an integrated advanced threat protection dashboard that identifies, correlates and remediates threats beyond what any solution is capable of today. 
While we will lead within integrated solution on a stand-alone basis, we will continue to deliver best-of-breed security at the enforcement points, including the web gateway, [indiscernible] a email and endpoint, and are committed to an open platform for customers' ISVs. For enterprises that are adopting the cloud, our combined solutions provide the best defense and depth for the cloud generation. 
We remain very optimistic about the progress we're making with our managed security service. This is an important offer for customers that have difficulty hiring and retaining experienced security professionals. We're also committed to empowering our managed security service partners and committed to empowering this important sector as service providers and SIs are important players in the migration to the cloud.
The second major opportunity we see in the marketplace is protecting the mobile workforce. The traditional IT perimeter is expanding, as employees are doing more work outside the network firewall and are accessing cloud services and corporate data directly from a variety of devices. In addition, there has been a significant rise in nontraditional Internet-connected devices within the enterprise, such as medical devices and industrial equipment, automobiles, office equipment and other next generation endpoints and IoT devices. many of these nontraditional devices are unprotected from modern threats. Proxies are essential in protecting these technologies in the cloud generation.
This evolution in workforce computing creates gaps in the traditional security architecture, which lead to infiltration of bad actors and insider threats. And we're bringing in more secure and scalable architectural solution that combines the Symantec endpoint with the cloud generation security from Blue Coat. As a result, the Symantec endpoint will have a continuous coverage inside perimeter or while roaming, protecting users and data. We have already begun integration of the SEP endpoint security with the cloud security proxy, email, DLP and CASB, which provides complete security coverage no matter where and enterprise devices travel. In addition to this, our managed security service can assist our customers and partners in reducing costs related to incident response.
For example, the SEP agent will direct all outbound traffic to the Blue Coat security fund for inspection. If a defect is found, our cloud security proxy from Blue Coat can quickly quarantine the user and remediate. We will autoremediate via the SEP endpoint removing substantial cost from incident response. This remediation also includes forensic recordings for the breach and can isolate the endpoint device as well as the users' cloud-based application identities by our web gateway and CASB. This sets a new bar for next generation endpoints.  This is where many next-gen endpoint vendors come up short as they only focus on traditional means of protecting laptops, desktops and servers. 
The Blue Coat acquisition allows us to bring many crucial aspects of the endpoint inspection into the cloud and open the aperture to protect any type of enterprise device, its users and the users' cloud applications. We further augment our ability to protect customers by our security analytics technology. This technology keeps a recording of activity from an endpoint, enables advanced machine learning techniques such as behavioral analysis to identify previously undetected malware. This also allows us to improve our threat detection by true root cause analysis of the vulnerability and malware tradecraft.
This is a large market, and our solution will be disruptive to alternatives. For our customers, our solutions improve cyber defense and reduce costs for remediation. No other security provider in the market today has our unique capability of deep functionality on endpoint, combined with visibility and time to remediation capabilities inherent in our cloud security platform. We believe the work we're doing is important enough to redefine cyber defense.
The third major opportunity is helping customers securely embrace the cloud as they increase the use of cloud-based applications and services. As customers access more cloud applications and leverage the cloud for their IT infrastructure, they are still responsible for securing their users and enterprise data. We believe our Cloud Generation Security platform uniquely delivers the ability to achieve this and enables a defense and depth by our open platform and the many security vendors and technologies that can be incorporate. This defense and depth future proofs an organization against attack vectors in years to come. 
A portion of the functionality needed to protect cloud services are referred to by the industry analyst as cloud security access brokers. We believe the market opportunity that goes beyond the CASB functionality to what we consider a Cloud Generation Security stack, which includes CASB, data protection, encryption, cloud incident response and elements of web security. Developing a Cloud Generation Security stack requires 3 major components. First, enterprises must deliver, categorize and instrument policies for cloud applications. Blue Coat's solution combined with the policies in force of the Blue Coat proxy is a clear leader in discovering and defining these policies. Next, enterprises must monitor and reinforce how data can be moved and accessed as it migrates around the cloud. Blue Coat's web gateway and Symantec's data protection are the market leaders controlling the access and movement of data and are already integrated into many customer environments today. Finally, enterprises will, decide based on their data policy, whether to encrypt or tokenize information. Together, we will have the leading encryption and tokenizing technology. In the market today, Symantec is the only provider that can deliver this end-to-end solution. To assemble the same level of protection through multiple vendors will result in costly, loosely integrated security architecture and a dependence on retaining the people that built it. Our customers are telling us that these sustainment costs and risks are a substantial problem.
In conclusion, let me reiterate the following points. We have a seasoned executive team with deep cybersecurity experience as well as the operational expertise for turning around, operating and growing technology businesses at scale. The product portfolios from Symantec and Blue Coat are highly complementary and positioned well for where the market is moving. Our solutions are defining the future of cybersecurity by securing consumers, enterprises and governments from advanced attacks, protecting the workforce of the future and helping customers embrace the file generation.
And I will end with that we are confident hitting the guidance Thomas outlined earlier in his remarks and the ability to deliver our commitments for fiscal 2018. Thank you for your time. Operator, we'll now open the call for Q&A."

That product is really proving to be very effective in advanced malware detection. And we have -- the customers as Thomas mentioned, we closed a good clip of customers in Q1 with that technology. And the point that he mentioned in his remarks I think is really important is 2/3 of those customers were not at an endpoint renewal. They bought it in advanced threat needs they had and added it to the environment that was already there. I think that's a really good show of faith. The road map on that product is excellent. The threat database that it's sitting on is phenomenal. And we are really excited about our ability to also integrate that in the network by the web gateways both in the cloud and on-premise. We already have, through our content analysis system, the ability to execute the advanced threat platform as one of the choices that we give customers for how to [indiscernible] those same address threats as they manifest in the network. Again, the telemetry that that platform is sitting on is we believe the deepest in the industry, taking everything from the consumer world at Norton and everything from the enterprise endpoints, and very shortly, everything from the Blue Coat world.

And we feel very good about the ability to upsell that both on from the endpoint route to market and also from our network point of presence and also [indiscernible] threat."

If you take an endpoint and you have one that's dealing with the sort of essential needs of keeping up with the antivirus. And you put some of the next generation things on it we have in 14. And then you go and put in the integration of that to any of these SOCs. And you stitch that up with any of the remediation technologies. You create a very expensive and fragile world that customers have said, ""If you can just put that together for us, we won't have to build ahead of ourselves. It's expensive for us to own it, to life [ph] sustain it. And that has been something we do believe you have an open platform. We can integrate other vendors in here, Symantec. That's great. If you put these pieces together for us, it really delivers value that is very helpful to keep that stuff going through all the releases and all of the folks you have to employ and retain to make it continue to work."" So that's been consistent feedback. We've got a great story there that's doing well. The other piece is really in the integration of the endpoint to cloud. Everyone wants to adopt the cloud. We still have to protect the endpoint. we were very bullish about solving problems desktops are old model these days. Everyone has laptops, and they carry in and out of the office. That's all are connected to the cloud, always connected to the cloud across messaging, web use, anything in your internal data centers, also all of the cloud applications, cloud infrastructure. That's the -- that resonates consistent the through customers, I think. So 2 things: complexity in building a really advanced cyber defense and a true life sustainment of that. And the second thing is really the adoption of the cloud generation really making the endpoint to the cloud security platform [indiscernible] are the 2 major things."

And we feel really good about how that's going to go. In the mid-market, Symantec already had strong presence, and we didn't at Blue Coat. And so that's an easy one. That's a great piece of the puzzle. is just getting a better solution to get into those partners and customers in the market. So net-net, we are -- I think we're pretty good at this topic on both the Symantec and Blue Coat side. How to think about it is we just increased our sales capacity. And we have enough demand that we do believe we have makeable plans for all of the selling teams across the territories. And we feel really good about that. The cross-sell and upsell I think once that sales force is ramped and both sides can sell a lot of the other's products, so we should see nice tailwinds in '18 as that becomes productive. So we feel really good about the top line 6 to 9 months from now as that really starts to fire. And the other piece, I think, is also really key is that many of the Blue Coat sales force, which we grew substantially over the last couple of years, has sold endpoint and has sold the other like solutions that Symantec has, such as DLP and things like that. And the Blue Coat sales forces selling DLP because [indiscernible] orchestrates most of the deal in market anyway. So we feel really good about the 2, big market-leading Symantec endpoint and DLP products [indiscernible] to be able to be executed by the named account reps on the Blue Coat side. So we're optimistic about having some good calls with you throughout '18."

So in our comments before, we really extending what we're doing in the consumer brands to get more value than just on the endpoint, an early start to look at the network and the use of the Internet by the consumer. And we are already we're working on a bunch of things that are really going out to really excite consumers more about wanting to make the decision around Norton their consumer security needs. Because it's more than just the PC. So getting off that PC platform that's important. We actually know a lot about it because we've been working with telecom provides for many years at Blue Coat. And we know technologies we have and our quality of service and be able to do things like measure screen time. And we've already been in contact control for a long time. So we actually really want to extend the value of Norton off PC platform, the other kind of just technical endpoints, more into what that users doing and helping them with some of the new challenges that they have on the Internet. So you'll be hearing more from us over time, but we definitely have technology in this space. And we have the networking cred to get in and help out from that part of the store you for consumers. What we're doing in WiFi and some of the home IoT is also impressive. And so John, we don't want to sit around and kind of watch that getting tied on the PC platform really. We want to address that part of the business also."

So first of all when we talk about next-gen endpoints and we actually think about what's going on in the platform, we're seriously competitive against all of the other folks that are there right now, things like flight recorders, things like being able to have behavioral analysis, machine learning. They all exist and serious tech and in terms of very experienced people that are working on them here at Symantec. I'd say if I was going to give us a ding on something, I'd say we don't talk about it enough. But we have a very powerful platform and the latest releases of SEP. has very competitive against the next gen endpoints we've been able to win with that next gen integrated with the ATP stuff we were talking about. We've been taking on some of the guys who are not [indiscernible] into this next-gen endpoints something had contact with competitors. But I tell you we have a very good competitive offering just head-to-head on modern techniques that they call modern techniques, which means the old techniques, I can tell you, old techniques are also seriously still needed. The modern techniques are also useful. And they were always be the next modern techniques because the bad guys are smart and they change the way they do things. But being able to defend against what are the most advanced threats today, we do well in that space. We do have a good platform there. we don't market it as well as we should. We will change that. And then in addition to that, the number of technologists that are very good at what they do, that we are investing in this space, is substantial. And we will continue to do that. We will grow that. And we are after the best and brightest all the time in the industry. one of the things my reputation in every company I've been involved, I've gone after best experts and retaining best ones we have and getting more. And we are setting our crosshairs on this ownership of this next-gen endpoint. So then we move to what are we doing for the other guys aren't doing and that the other guys will have a big problem doing? It's very difficult to think about protection of users when you don't think about protection of those users in the SaaS applications that they are using when the application used to be all inside a data center, you can isolate an endpoint and protect that identity and associated data. Half of those applications left the building. If you can't isolate the user's identity in the cloud applications and to do that, you need logic like a CASB. It's difficult to really go to company and say have isolated Greg, really get Greg as related salesforce.com, ServiceNow? Did I get Netsuite stuff locked up? what about other database so the now whatever happens. So we are right now the only next-gen endpoints that can adjust isolation of the user. In that if you really want to get into the bowels of it, if we start talking about multiphased attacks, the network assist to given our endpoint and multiphased attacks, then being able to vaccinate those from the messaging layer from the web. We feel really good about competing against the endpoint vendor. And then a final point I'd like to make is when you move to the cloud, you don't get to picture your next gen firewall. When you're not taking your next gen firewall, the [indiscernible] between next gen firewall and the advanced endpoint breaks. So we feel really good about our cloud platform connected to the Symantec next-gen endpoints and our ability to really change the game over the next-gen endpoints. So we will really work hard to make sure the industry understands what I was just talking about. There was a lot there and that, that architecture in our ability to executed and delivered as well understood. And I feel pretty good about our ability to stem the tide of what I'd say had been may be a better execution from cemented that would have taken some of the tail out of some of the next-gen endpoints folks. one more point, one of the most important points, we have a very strong balance sheet. And this next-gen endpoint is going to go on for a long time. And we are going to be there. And we're going to be there with a strong investment all the way through it. And I'm not so sure that's the case in many others. So that's hopefully helpful. 
I think that's it. I think we running out of time. But I just like to thank all of you for taking some time to talk to us today and your support of Symantec. Thank you very much. Thank you."

I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. We provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, except for statements about net income and EPS. All non-GAAP revenue and expenses exclude the impact of Veritas. However, the continuing operations deferred revenue on the balance sheet includes a portion of Veritas deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered into prior to operational separation. The Veritas deferred revenue from those contracts will amortize into discontinued operations. As a result, implied billings growth calculated from the change in deferred revenue on the balance sheet will not be representative of stand-alone Symantec's performance, as it will include an impact from Veritas. Implied billings referred to in our prepared remarks and provided in the supplemental materials reflect revenue plus the change in sequential deferred revenue, excluding the portion of deferred Veritas revenue.

It's an exciting time for the new Symantec, and I'm proud to be lead the company that will define the future of cybersecurity. 
We are already off to a great start by closing the Blue Coat acquisition earlier than expected in under 2 months since announcement. This has allowed us to move rapidly into the execution of our integration strategy. Since the announcement of the acquisition, we have pressure tested our financial assumptions and continue to remain confident in achieving fiscal 2018 EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.80, which we disclosed when we announced the acquisition in June. Our combined product portfolio separates us as the most strategic security player in the industry, with a portfolio of solutions that addresses over 50% of the enterprise security budgets or an approximate $40 billion of total available market. 
Furthermore, we are the only security company that has the scale and vision to be considered by the CIO as one of the most strategic technology partners. As you saw from Dimension Data's quote in our closing press release earlier this week, partners are extremely optimistic about the technology that the combined company can bring to market. In addition to great support from our partners, we have had an outstanding feedback from the customer base. I'll provide more customer feedback later in my remarks. 
First, Thomas will begin by providing an overview of the Symantec Q1 results and our financial outlook. Then I will address why we are confident that we have the deep leadership expertise in place to integrate the 2 companies and deliver upon our financial targets. I will wrap up by describing major cybersecurity challenges enterprises are facing, and how Symantec is best positioned to usher in a new era of cybersecurity solutions to solve these multibillion-dollar opportunities."

Nearly 2 years ago, we announced our intention to become the leading pure play cybersecurity company. With the close of the Blue Coat acquisition, we've accelerated that strategy and now are positioned to execute on our integration road map while we define the future of cybersecurity. 
Today, I will provide an overview of our first quarter results, update you on our $550 million cost efficiencies and Blue Coat integration synergies and conclude with our combined financial outlook. Additional details are provided in our CFO commentary, which is available on our Investor Relations website.
Our first quarter total revenue was $884 million, above the midpoint of our guided range, driven by improved performance within Enterprise Security and continued in line results from Consumer Security. 
From a macro and security spending standpoint, we did not see any incremental weakness in Europe related to Brexit. However, we continue to monitor our European pipeline very closely. 
Deferred revenue was $2.4 billion, which includes $243 million of deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied billings, excluding Veritas, were $788 million and declined 1.6% on a reported basis. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 28.6% and 210 basis points above the high end of our guided range of 24.5% to 26.5%. And the upside was evenly split by an early start to our cost efficiency savings and some onetime expense benefits. 
Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.29 and above our guidance of $0.24 to $0.26. Our non-GAAP tax rate and share count were in line with guidance. 
Cash flow from continuing operations during the quarter was a negative $742 million, which included a tax payment of $887 million related to the gain from the sale of Veritas and the $39 million in cash outflows related to restructuring and the Veritas separation. 
Let me now provide further detail on our performance by segment. 
Enterprise Security revenue was $481 million and declined 1% year-over-year, which was at the high end of our guidance of down 4% to down 1%, driven by strength in both information protection and cybersecurity services. 
Now I will review the product areas within our Enterprise Security segment. Threat protection revenue was down 5%. However, endpoint security including ATP grew low single digits year-over-year. Our newly launched ATP solutions showed continued momentum in what is a seasonally slower quarter. During Q1, we sold ATP subscriptions to 115 customers. And importantly, 2/3 of the Q1 ATP deals were sold independent of a renewal. Overall, we continue to maintain the value of our SEP and .cloud recurring revenue and, in some cases, expand our footprint within the account. Since its launch in December, we have sold ATP to 270 customers. Within the install base, there remains significant opportunity for additional ATP module cross-sell or seat expansion.
Information Protection revenue grew 4%. DLP revenue grew 18% and is benefiting from a tailwind of strong prior quarter deferred revenue growth and a favorable prior year compare. Looking forward, we have a solid pipeline for DLP, driven by data protection requirements as our customers adopt cloud-based applications. In addition, we are excited about the future of our data protection growth as we package DLP with our market-leading secure web gateway.
Cyber Security Services and other services grew 9%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth with solid performance across managed security services, incident response, threat intelligence and other security-focused professional services. Underlying these results, we continue to see strong demand for actionable cyber threat intelligence. 
Website security revenue grew 1% and performed in line with our expectations. We continue to see good performance from the higher end of our website security portfolio where our Complete Website Security offering is gaining traction. On the lower end of the market, we expect our Encryption Everywhere solution to provide a tailwind to results in fiscal 2018 as we begin to benefit from the conversion of this freemium offering.
Now on to the Norton Consumer Security segment. Consumer Security revenue was down slightly less than 8%, which was at the lower end of our guidance of down 8% to down 5%. The underlying fundamentals of our consumer business continue to improve, driven by the move to subscription and online customer acquisition. We are also seeing early pipeline building for the new solutions such as Wi-Fi privacy and home IoT offerings. 
Let me now review some additional performance metrics for the Norton business. During Q1, retention rates continued to increase on a year-over-year basis following the anniversary of our transition to subscription model in the U.S. We will reach the 1-year anniversary internationally at the end of the fiscal Q2. We continue to grow our online acquisition of customers, which grew new subscriptions 4% during the first quarter.
Finally, earlier this summer, we launched our Wi-Fi privacy offering. This solution provides a secure connection while connected to an unsecured network. We are targeting the solution as both an upsell into our current install base and as a stand-alone solution to attract new Norton subscribers.
Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. On August 1, we added $2.8 billion of new debt and $1.25 billion of convertible notes. We have $5.6 billion in cash and $7.3 billion in total debt, including the $1.75 billion of convertible notes. As we previously said, we expect to delever our balance sheet over the medium term. 
As of last Friday, our current ASR is 58% complete, and we expect this it to finish in the fall of this year. We remain committed to maintaining our quarterly dividend.
Shifting gears to our $550 million of cost savings initiatives and the Blue Coat integration synergies. We've already made progress achieving savings across the areas of procurement, organizational effectiveness and, to a lesser extent, real estate. On an annualized basis, we have realized approximately $50 million of run rate net cost efficiencies. In addition to efficiency savings, we expect to achieve synergies from the Blue Coat acquisition by the end of fiscal 2018. The earlier close provides us a head start achieving these.
Before providing our guidance, let me walk through the underlying mechanics. We will be referring to the non-GAAP performance of the business, and please see the CFO commentary for more detailed description. 
Going forward, Blue Coat will be reported as part of our Enterprise Security segment, given our plans to integrate multiple product solutions. It is important to note that historically, Blue Coat's fiscal second quarter has ended on October 31. Therefore, our fiscal second quarter guidance will include 2 months of contribution from Blue Coat from August 1 to September 30. It is also important to note that Blue Coat's revenue linearity is heavily weighted to the last month of the quarter. Therefore, embedded in our Q2 guidance is up to 50% of Blue Coat's prior Q2 non-GAAP revenue forecast. However, from a cost standpoint, we'll be burdened by approximately 2/3 of Blue Coat's second quarter spending, with only half the revenue. From a reporting standpoint, this linearity difference puts an abnormal burden on our operating margin in Q2.
We are focused on maintaining strong sales execution during our integration. However, we believe that it is prudent to set conservative top line guidance for Q2 and fiscal 2017 as we combine the 2 companies. 
We expect second quarter non-GAAP revenue to be up 4% to 8% to $960 million to $990 million. We expect consumer revenue to be down approximately 7% to $395 million to $400 million. We expect enterprise security, which includes a 2-month contribution from Blue Coat, to be up 14% to 20% to $565 million to $590 million. 
We expect an operating margin of 21% to 24%. To reiterate, a portion of the headwind to margins is due to a burden from 2/3 of the spend, but only 50% of revenue benefits from Blue Coat. And we expect approximately $13 million of the headwind to non-GAAP operating margin related to retention payments and sales force incentives put in place to ensure stability during our integration. 
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.21, with a tax rate of 29% and a fully diluted average share count of 640 million.
Now on to fiscal 2017 guidance. As a reminder, our fiscal 2017 outlook only includes 8 months of revenue contribution from Blue Coat. 
We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be up 11% to 13% to $4,040 million to $4,120 million. Fiscal 2017 operating margin is expected to be in the range of 26% to 28%. We expect approximately $45 million of onetime expense related to retention payments and sales force incentives put in place to ensure stability during our integration. We expect EPS of $1.08 to $1.14, with a tax rate of 29% and a fully diluted average share count of 616 million. 
Our fiscal 2018 outlook, we plan to enter fiscal 2018 with an operating margin of 30%. For fiscal 2018, we continue to expect EPS in the range of $1.70 to $1.80.

Let's begin with why I am confident we have the leadership team in place to deliver the leading cyber defense portfolio while integrating our 2 companies and achieving our financial targets. With the Veritas divestiture behind us, we are focused on removing the remaining stranded costs and further improving our operating efficiency. This is an important step to deliver our commitment to the $550 million in savings and synergies. 
When I joined Blue Coat in 2011, the company had multiple quarters of revenue declines with below-average profitability. While at Blue Coat, we delivered substantial improvement in operating effectiveness, acquisitions were fully integrated and the company returned to growth. This experience is highly relevant to delivering process efficiencies at Symantec. We focused the product strategy to cybersecurity, rebuilt the go-to-market engine and improved profitability and thoughtfully leveraged our balance sheet to successfully acquire market-leading technologies. Blue Coat today is a clear leader in cloud security with the #1 market share of the secure web gateway. Organic revenue growth is now in the mid-teens with operating margins in the high 20s. 
When we combined Blue Coat leadership team with the many talented executives from Symantec, the outcome is a deep bench across all functions, with a technology portfolio that is market-leading backed by substantial development talent totaling over 4,000 engineers.
Let me turn to some early feedback from customers and our channel. I was recently visiting the CIO of a global financial institution that said the combination of Symantec and Blue Coat not only makes us their most strategic security partner, but we are now considered one of the top overall strategic technology partners. This type of recognition is not taken for granted and offers a clear advantage versus our competition. 
Many other large enterprise customers have proactively reached out to us not only to express excitement about the further integration of our product lines, but are even more enthusiastic about our longer-term vision and our relevance in their migration and adoption to cloud solutions. 
Furthermore, our channel providers that service the mid-market have expressed excitement around the power of our endpoint solution integrated into our cloud security platform. It is in the mid-market where securely adopting cloud applications is essential. 
Now I will comment on how we plan to maintain strong sales execution while we realize the $550 million in cost efficiencies and Blue Coat synergies. As previously announced, Mike Fey has been appointed as COO and President. Mike's organization was instrumental in leading the Blue Coat sales force and channel and consistently meeting or beating our sales plans and taking market share. 
We plan to maintain our combined quota-carrying sales capacity. Together, we have the largest dedicated security sales force with deep technical strength to bring our products to market. Combined sales capacity is substantially increased in the enterprise market. 
As we outlined at the acquisition announcement, we found less-than-expected customer overlap during our due diligence, which over the medium term offers us a meaningful cross-sale opportunity and provides tailwinds for fiscal 2018. We are also excited about working with our many channel partners across the globe and bringing differentiated value to our joint customers.
Let me touch on our plans beyond sales. The Consumer Security team will remain a stand-alone unit from an operational standpoint and report directly to me. The management team in this business unit is excellent. We are pleased with the stability of the business, encouraged by the product road map. We will continue to make investments that extend the Norton value beyond the traditional PC to return the segment to growth. These include new products such as Wi-Fi privacy and home IoT. 
From an enterprise security standpoint, during the planning process, we jointly reviewed product road maps with respective teams. I am truly impressed by the level of game-changing product leadership our development teams are pursuing. We'll be sharing many of these in the upcoming quarters. 
With regards to operational integration, we have worked diligently to put an integration plan in place that is led by seasoned executives, and we are on track to achieve our targets. We expect to be substantially operationally integrated by the end of our fiscal year, March 2017. 
Turning to Blue Coat's fiscal Q1 performance. As many of you know, Blue Coat historically has been on a July month ending first quarter. While we are still closing our books, we do not yet have official results, I'm pleased to share that from an overall performance standpoint that our Q1 results were ahead of expectations and we saw strong momentum across all products. 
Now let's switch gears to address how our combined portfolio can help solve the biggest security problems that our customers are facing. First, the largest opportunity we see in the market is securing enterprises, governments and consumers from advanced attacks, and securing our customers as they adopt cloud. When it comes to staying ahead of advanced threats, a key differentiator is the speed at which one can identify and mitigate malicious activity across a functionally rich set of products. 
Together, Symantec and Blue Coat have the broadest and deepest set of threat intelligence data in the industry, combined with the fastest threat propagation time. Symantec for years has been focused on identifying malicious content and Blue Coat has been categorizing, mapping and fingerprinting the Internet with purview to the darkest parts of the web and malware tradecraft. Together, Symantec with Blue Coat will have the most powerful combination of threat intelligence as well as an open platform in which to deliver enhanced cyber defense and anchored in threat intelligence. 
Within the coming months, we will have integrated many aspects of the threat intelligence, including Symantec's endpoint and email solutions ecosystem with Blue Coat's intelligence network. This combined intelligence database and detection engines will allow our current products to become more robust and outperform the competition. The capabilities of the combined portfolio work towards a world of automated discovery with an integrated advanced threat protection dashboard that identifies, correlates and remediates threats beyond what any solution is capable of today. 
While we will lead within an integrated solution, on a stand-alone basis, we will continue to deliver best-of-breed security at the enforcement points, including the web gateway, CASB, email and endpoint, and are committed to our open platform for customers and ISVs. For enterprises that are adopting the cloud, our combined solutions provide the best defense in depth for the cloud generation. 
We remain very optimistic about the progress we're making with our managed security service. This is an important offering for customers that have difficulty hiring and retaining experienced security professionals. We're also committed to empowering our managed security service partners and committed to empowering this important sector as service providers and SIs are important players in the migration to the cloud.
The second major opportunity we see in the marketplace is protecting the mobile workforce. The traditional IT perimeter is expanding, as employees are doing more work outside the network firewall and are accessing cloud services and corporate data directly from a variety of devices. In addition, there has been a significant rise in nontraditional Internet-connected devices within the enterprise, such as medical devices and industrial equipment, automobiles, office equipment and other next generation endpoints and IoT devices. Many of these nontraditional devices are unprotected from modern threats. Proxies are essential in protecting these technologies in the cloud generation.
This evolution in workforce computing creates gaps in the traditional security architecture, which lead to infiltration of bad actors and insider threats. And we're bringing in more secure and scalable architectural solution that combines the Symantec endpoint with the cloud generation security from Blue Coat. As a result, the Symantec endpoint will have a continuous coverage inside the perimeter or while roaming, protecting users and data. We have already begun integration of the SEP endpoint security client with the cloud security proxy, email, DLP and CASB, which provides complete security coverage no matter where enterprise devices travel. In addition to this, our managed security service can assist our customers and partners in reducing costs related to incident response.
For example, the SEP agent will direct all outbound traffic through the Blue Coat security cloud for inspection. If a threat is found, our cloud security proxy from Blue Coat can quickly quarantine the user and remediate. We will auto remediate via the SEP endpoint, removing substantial cost from incident response. This remediation also includes forensic recordings for the breach and can isolate the endpoint device as well as the users' cloud-based application identities by our web gateway and CASB.
This sets a new bar for next generation endpoints. This is where many next-gen endpoint vendors come up short as they only focus on traditional means of protecting laptops, desktops and servers. The Blue Coat acquisition allows us to bring many crucial aspects of the endpoint inspection into the cloud and open the aperture to protect any type of enterprise device, its users and the users' cloud applications. 
We further augment our ability to protect customers by our security analytics technology. This technology keeps a recording of activity from an endpoint, enables advanced machine learning techniques such as behavioral analysis to identify previously undetected malware. This also allows us to improve our threat detection by true root cause analysis of the vulnerability and malware tradecraft.
This is a large market, and our solution will be disruptive to alternatives. For our customers, our solutions improve cyber defense and reduce costs of remediation. No other security provider in the market today has our unique capability of deep functionality on endpoint, combined with visibility and time to remediation capabilities inherent in our cloud security platform. We believe the work we're doing is important enough to redefine cyber defense.
The third major opportunity is helping customers securely embrace the cloud as they increase the use of cloud-based applications and services. As customers access more cloud applications and leverage the cloud for their IT infrastructure, they are still responsible for securing their users' and enterprise data. We believe our Cloud Generation Security platform uniquely delivers the ability to achieve this and enables a defense-in-depth via our open platform and the many security vendors and technologies that can be incorporated. This defense-in-depth future proofs an organization against attack vectors in years to come. 
A portion of the functionality needed to protect cloud services are referred to by the industry analysts as cloud security access brokers. We believe the market opportunity that goes beyond the CASB functionality to what we consider a Cloud Generation Security Stack, which includes CASB, data protection, encryption, cloud incident response and elements of web security. 
Developing a Cloud Generation Security Stack requires 3 major components. First, enterprises must deliver, categorize and instrument policies for cloud applications. Blue Coat's Elastica solution combined with the policies enforced at the Blue Coat proxy is a clear leader in discovering and defining these policies. Next, enterprises must monitor and enforce how data can be moved and accessed as it migrates around the cloud. Blue Coat's web gateway and Symantec's data protection are the market leaders controlling the access and movement of data and are already integrated into many customer environments today.
Finally, enterprises will decide based on their data policy whether to encrypt or tokenize critical information. Together, we have the leading encryption and tokenizing technology.
In the market today, Symantec is the only provider that can deliver this end-to-end solution. To assemble the same level of protection through multiple vendors will result in costly, loosely integrated security architecture and a dependence on retaining the people that built it. Our customers are telling us that these sustainment costs and risks are a substantial problem.
In conclusion, let me reiterate the following points. We have a seasoned executive team with deep cybersecurity experience as well as the operational expertise for turning around, operating and growing technology businesses at scale. The product portfolios from Symantec and Blue Coat are highly complementary and positioned well for where the market is moving. Our solutions are defining the future of cybersecurity by securing consumers, enterprises and governments from advanced attacks, protecting the workforce of the future and helping customers embrace the cloud generation.
And I will end with that we are confident hitting the guidance Thomas outlined earlier in his remarks and the ability to deliver our commitments for fiscal 2018. Thank you for your time. Operator, we'll now open up the call for Q&A."

So I think -- first of all, I'd just like to give the team at Symantec excellent marks for the delivering the ATP solutions integrator with the endpoint. That is in the market right now. That product is really proving to be very effective in advanced malware detection. And we have -- the customers, as Thomas mentioned, we closed a good clip of customers in Q1 with that technology. And the point that he mentioned in his remarks I think is really important, is 2/3 of those customers were not at an endpoint renewal. They bought it in advanced threat needs they had and added it to the environment that was already there. I think that's a really good show of faith. The road map on that product is excellent. The threat database that it's sitting on is phenomenal. And we are really excited about our ability to also integrate that in the network via the web gateways both in the cloud and on-premise. We already have, through our content analysis system, the ability to execute that advanced threat platform as one of the choices that we give customers for how to fight those same threats as they manifest in the network. Again, the telemetry that, that platform is sitting on is we believe the deepest in the industry, taking everything from the consumer world at Norton and everything from the enterprise endpoints, and very shortly, everything from the Blue Coat world. And it's applying that against all the various threat protection engines. And we feel very good about the ability to upsell that both on -- from the endpoint route-to-market and also from our network point of presence, it also provides advanced threat."

If you take an endpoint and you have one that's dealing with the sort of essential needs of keeping up with antivirus. And you put some of the next generation things on it that we have in SEP 14. And then you go and put in the integration of that to any of these SOCs. And you stitch that up with any of the remediation technologies. You create a very expensive and fragile world that customers have said, ""If you can just put that together for us -- we've all had to build that ourselves. It's very expensive for us to own it, through life sustain it. And that has been something we do believe you have an open platform. We can integrate other vendors in here, Symantec. That's great. If you could put these pieces together for us, it really delivers value that is very helpful -- difficult to keep that stuff going through all the releases and all of the folks you have to employ and retain to make it continue to work."" So that's been consistent feedback. We've got a great story there that's doing well. The other piece is really in the integration of the endpoint to cloud. Everyone wants to adopt the cloud. We still have to protect the endpoint. People [ph] are very bullish about solving problems when desktops are all mobile these days. Everyone has laptops, and they want to carry them in and out of the office and that's auto connected to the cloud, always connected to the cloud across messaging, web use, anything in your internal data centers, also all of the cloud applications, cloud infrastructure. That's the -- that resonates consistently through customers, I think. So 2 things: complexity of building a really advanced cyber defense and a through-life sustainment of that. And the second thing is really the adoption of the cloud generation really making the endpoint work with the cloud security platform we've developed have been the 2 major things."

So we're seeing a lot of that. People that are embarking on this mission in the POCs picks something like that or like an Office 365, we see those pilots go very well. And then we have a bunch of modules that then come on to the sales over time. So as we land in an account with cloud generation security stack, we do see the other modules quickly get tested and get deployed.

So we were, on the Blue Coat side, looking for a bunch of capacity expansion anyway because we had really strong demand. And we have enough of that demand that as we look towards 2018, we do not need to make any reductions in that sales capacity. And also, so in between now and us assigning all of those territories, we came up with a compensation model. And we have really invested in making sure that we can compensate both account reps that are calling on the same account in a way that is -- keeps their interests aligned. And if there was a Blue Coat sale, someone at Symantec gets some. If there was a Blue Coat sale, someone at Blue Coat gets some. And if there was a new sale, of a new thing that wasn't in there before, everyone wins in a bigger way. So we put a ton of work in the last number of months in how we would do that and really taken that all the way down and pressure testing that in the big territories that matter, like around the eastern seaboard of the U.S., where you can have a large bank that's carrying a big chunk of commission and making sure that that's going to work with those folks. And even getting right through talking to them all about it so we are way down range on that discussion and have made those things clear in our organization. And we feel really good about how that's going to go. In the mid-market, Symantec already had strong presence, and we didn't at Blue Coat. And so that's an easy one. That's a great piece of the puzzle. That's just getting a better solution to go into those partners and customers in mid-market. So net-net, I think we're pretty good at this topic on both the Symantec and Blue Coat side. How to think about it is we just increased our sales capacity. And we'd have enough demand that we do believe we have makeable plans for all of the selling teams across the territories. And we feel really good about that. The cross-sell and upsell opportunity -- I think once that sales force is ramped and both sides can sell a lot of the other's products, so we should see nice tailwinds in '18 as that becomes productive. So we feel really good about the top line, 6 to 9 months from now, as that really starts to fire. And the other piece, I think, is also really key is that many of the Blue Coat sales force, which we grew substantially over the last couple of years, has sold endpoint and has sold the other like solutions that Symantec has, such as DLP and things like that. And the Blue Coat sales force is excellent at selling DLP because their ProxySG orchestrates most of the enterprise DLP in market anyway. So we feel really good about the 2 really big market-leading Symantec endpoint and DLP products and those being able to be executed by the named account reps on the Blue Coat side. So we're optimistic about having some good calls with you throughout '18."

And I really like the differentiation we get from other enterprise security vendors in that are actually getting threat telemetry from a completely consumer and a completely sort of private web experience, which really shows up a lot of shady parts of the Internet. So I would sort of say that's really goodness, that really helps us out. And the reason why some of our enterprise endpoints and why we're much better at effectiveness tests as we know a lot about what the bad guys are doing and a lot of that information comes from people that [indiscernible] at home. So we like that. So -- And then we say okay, this a big piece of our business and we would like it to grow, just like you would imagine we would like it to grow. So in our comments before, we're really extending what we're doing in the consumer brands to get more value than just on the endpoint, and really start to look at the network and the use of the Internet by the consumer. And we are already we're working on a bunch of things that are really going out to really excite consumers more about wanting to make a decision around Norton for their consumer security needs. Because it's more than just the PC. So getting off that PC platform is important. We actually know a lot about it because we've been working with telecom providers for many years at Blue Coat. And we know technologies we have and our quality of service and being able to do things like measure screen time. And we've already been in contact control for a long time. So we actually really want to extend the value of Norton off the PC platform, off the other kind of just sort of technical endpoints, more into what that user is doing and helping them with some of the new challenges that they have in the Internet. So you'll be hearing more from us over time, but we definitely have technology in this space. And we have the networking cred to get in and help out from that part of the story for consumers. What we're doing in Wi-Fi and some of the home IoT is also impressive. And so John, we don't want to sit around and kind of watch an outgoing tide on the PC platform really. We want to address that part of the business also."

So first of all when we talk about next-gen endpoint and we actually think about what's going on in the platform, we're seriously competitive against all of the other folks that are there right now, things like flight recorders, things like being able to have behavioral analysis, machine learning algorithms. They all exist and serious tech in terms of very experienced people that are working on them here at Symantec. I'd say if I was going to give us a ding on something, I'd say we don't talk about it enough. But we have a very powerful platform and the latest release of SEP is competitive against the next gen endpoints we've been able to win with that next gen integrated with the ATP stuff we were talking about. We've been taking out some of the guys who market well into that next-gen endpoints. Some of them have good tech and they're good competitors. But I tell you we have a very good competitive offering just head-to-head on modern techniques, that they call modern techniques, which means the old techniques, I can tell you, the old techniques are also seriously still needed. The modern techniques are also useful. And there will always be the next modern techniques because the bad guys are smart and they change the way they do things. But being able to defend against what are the most advanced threats today, we do well in that space. We do have a good platform there. We don't market it as well as we should. We will change that. And in addition to that, the number of technologists that are very good at what they do, that we are investing in this space, is substantial. And we will continue to do that. We will grow that. And we are after the best and brightest all the time in the industry to do that. One of the things -- my reputation in every company I've ever been involved with, I've gone after best experts and retaining best ones we have and getting more. And we are setting our crosshairs on this ownership of this next-gen endpoint. So then we move to what are we doing that the other guys aren't doing and that the other guys will have a big problem doing? It's very difficult to think about protection of users when you don't think about protection of those users in the SaaS applications that they are using. When the applications used to be all inside a data center, you can isolate an endpoint and protect that identity and associated data. Half of those applications left the building. If you can't isolate the user's identity in the cloud applications and to do that, you need logic like a CASB. It's difficult to really go into company and say I've isolated Greg. Did I really get Greg isolated at Salesforce.com, at ServiceNow? Did I get his NetSuite stuff locked out? What about all that renewal database over there -- ServiceNow, whatever it happens. So we are right now the only next-gen endpoint vendor that can address isolation of the user. And then, if you really want to get into the bowels of it, if we start talking about multi-phased attacks, the network assist to give our endpoint in multi-phased attacks, then being able to vaccinate those from the messaging layer, from the web, dial tone. We feel really good about competing against the endpoint vendor. And then a final point I'd like to make is when you move to the cloud, you don't get to pick your next gen firewall. When you're not picking your next gen firewall, the tie-out between the next gen firewall and the advanced endpoint, breaks. So we feel really good about our cloud platform connected to the Symantec next-gen endpoint and our ability to really change the game over the next-gen endpoint. So we will really work hard to make sure the industry understands what I was just talking about. There's a lot there and that, that architecture and our ability to execute it deliver it is well understood. And I feel pretty good about our ability to stem the tide of what I'd say had been maybe a better execution from Symantec that would have taken some of the tailwind out of some of the next-gen endpoints folks. One more point, one of the most important points, we have a very strong balance sheet. And this next-gen endpoint party is going to go on for a long time. And we are going to be there. And we're going to be there with a strong investment all the way through it. And I'm not so sure that's the case in many of the others. So that's hopefully helpful. 
I think that's it. I think we're running out of time. But I'd just like to thank all of you for taking some time to talk to us today and your support of Symantec. Thank you very much. Thank you."

We are already off to a great start by closing the Blue Coat acquisition earlier than expected in under 2 months since announcement. This has allowed us to move rapidly into the execution of our integration strategy. Since the announcement of the acquisition, we have pressure tested our financial assumptions and continue to remain confident in achieving fiscal 2018 EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.80, which we disclosed when we announced the acquisition in June. Our combined product portfolio separates us as the most strategic security player in the industry, with a portfolio of solutions that addresses over 50% of the enterprise security budgets or an approximate $40 billion of total available market. 
Furthermore, we are the only security company that has the scale and vision to be considered by the CIO as one of the most strategic technology partners. As you saw from Dimension Data's quote in our closing press release earlier this week, the partners are extremely optimistic about the technology that the combined company can bring to market. In addition to great support from our partners, we have had an outstanding feedback from the customer base. I'll provide more customer feedback later in my remarks.

Nearly 2 years ago, we announced our intention to become the leading pure play cybersecurity company. With the close of the Blue Coat acquisition, we've accelerated that strategy and now are positioned to execute on our integration road map while we define the future of cybersecurity. 
Today, I will provide an overview of our first quarter results, update you on our $550 million cost efficiencies and Blue Coat integration synergies and conclude with our combined financial outlook. Additional details are provided in our CFO commentary, which is available on our Investor Relations website.
Our first quarter total revenue was $884 million, above the midpoint of our guided range, driven by improved performance within Enterprise Security and continued in line results from Consumer Security. 
From a macro and security spending standpoint, we did not see any incremental weakness in Europe related to Brexit. However, we continue to monitor our European pipeline very closely. 
Deferred revenue was $2.4 billion, which includes $243 million of deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied billings, excluding Veritas, were $788 million and declined 1.6% on a reported basis. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 28.6% and 210 basis points above the high end of our guided range of 24.5% to 26.5%. And the upside was evenly split by an early start to our cost efficiency savings and some onetime expense benefits. 
Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.29 and above our guidance of $0.24 to $0.26. Our non-GAAP tax rate and share count were in line with guidance. 
Cash flow from continuing operations during the quarter was a negative $742 million, which included a tax payment of $887 million related to the gain from the sale of Veritas and the $39 million in cash outflows related to restructuring and the Veritas separation. 
Let me now provide further detail on our performance by segment. 
Enterprise Security revenue was $481 million and declined 1% year-over-year, which was at the high end of our guidance of down 4% to down 1%, driven by strength in both information protection and cybersecurity services. 
Now I will review the product areas within our Enterprise Security segment. Threat protection revenue was down 5%. However, endpoint security including ATP grew low single digits year-over-year. Our newly launched ATP solutions showed continued momentum in what is a seasonally slower quarter. During Q1, we sold ATP subscriptions to 115 customers. And importantly, 2/3 of the Q1 ATP deals were sold independent of a renewal. Overall, we continue to maintain the value of our SEP and .cloud recurring revenue and, in some cases, expand our footprint within the account. Since its launch in December, we have sold ATP to 270 customers. Within the install base, there remains significant opportunity for additional ATP module cross-sell or seat expansion.
Information Protection revenue grew 4%. DLP revenue grew 18% and is benefiting from a tailwind of strong prior quarter deferred revenue growth and a favorable prior year compare. Looking forward, we have a solid pipeline for DLP, driven by data protection requirements as our customers adopt cloud-based applications. In addition, we are excited about the future of our data protection growth as we package DLP with our market-leading secure web gateway.
Cyber Security Services and other services grew 9%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth with solid performance across managed security services, incident response, threat intelligence and other security-focused professional services. Underlying these results, we continue to see strong demand for actionable cyber threat intelligence. 
Website security revenue grew 1% and performed in line with our expectations. We continue to see good performance from the higher end of our website security portfolio where our Complete Website Security offering is gaining traction. At the low end of the market, we expect our Encryption Everywhere solution to provide a tailwind to results in fiscal 2018 as we begin to benefit from the conversion of this freemium offering.
Now on to the Norton Consumer Security segment. Consumer Security revenue was down slightly less than 8%, which was at the lower end of our guidance of down 8% to down 5%. The underlying fundamentals of our consumer business continue to improve, driven by the move to subscription and online customer acquisition. We are also seeing early pipeline building for the new solutions such as Wi-Fi privacy and home IoT offerings. 
Let me now review some additional performance metrics for the Norton business. During Q1, retention rates continued to increase on a year-over-year basis following the anniversary of our transition to subscription model in the U.S. We will reach the 1-year anniversary internationally at the end of the fiscal Q2. We continue to grow our online acquisition of customers, which grew new subscriptions 4% during the first quarter.
Finally, earlier this summer, we launched our Wi-Fi privacy offering. This solution provides a secure connection while connected to an unsecured network. We are targeting the solution as both an upsell into our current install base and as a stand-alone solution to attract new Norton subscribers.
Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. On August 1, we added $2.8 billion of new debt and $1.25 billion of convertible notes. We have $5.6 billion in cash and $7.3 billion in total debt, including the $1.75 billion of convertible notes. As we previously said, we expect to delever our balance sheet over the medium term. 
As of last Friday, our current ASR is 58% complete, and we expect this it to finish in the fall of this year. We remain committed to maintaining our quarterly dividend.
Shifting gears to our $550 million of cost savings initiatives and the Blue Coat integration synergies. We've already made progress achieving savings across the areas of procurement, organizational effectiveness and, to a lesser extent, real estate. On an annualized basis, we have realized approximately $50 million of run rate net cost efficiencies. In addition to efficiency savings, we expect to achieve synergies from the Blue Coat acquisition by the end of fiscal 2018. The earlier close provides us a head start achieving these.
Before providing our guidance, let me walk through the underlying mechanics. We will be referring to the non-GAAP performance of the business, and please see the CFO commentary for a more detailed description. 
Going forward, Blue Coat will be reported as part of our Enterprise Security segment, given our plans to integrate multiple product solutions. It is important to note that historically, Blue Coat's fiscal second quarter has ended on October 31. Therefore, our fiscal second quarter guidance will include 2 months of contribution from Blue Coat from August 1 to September 30. It is also important to note that Blue Coat's revenue linearity is heavily weighted to the last month of the quarter. Therefore, embedded in our Q2 guidance is up to 50% of Blue Coat's prior Q2 non-GAAP revenue forecast. However, from a cost standpoint, we'll be burdened by approximately 2/3 of Blue Coat's second quarter spending, with only half the revenue. From a reporting standpoint, this linearity difference puts an abnormal burden on our operating margin in Q2.
We are focused on maintaining strong sales execution during our integration. However, we believe that it is prudent to set conservative top line guidance for Q2 and fiscal 2017 as we combine the 2 companies. 
We expect second quarter non-GAAP revenue to be up 4% to 8% from $960 million to $990 million. We expect consumer revenue to be down approximately 7% to $395 million to $400 million. We expect enterprise security, which includes a 2-month contribution from Blue Coat, to be up 14% to 20% to $565 million to $590 million. 
We expect an operating margin of 21% to 24%. To reiterate, a portion of the headwind to margins is due to a burden from 2/3 of the spend, but only 50% of revenue benefits from Blue Coat. And we expect approximately $30 million of the headwind to non-GAAP operating margin related to retention payments and sales force incentives put in place to ensure stability during our integration. 
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.21, with a tax rate of 29% and a fully diluted average share count of 640 million.
Now on to fiscal 2017 guidance. As a reminder, our fiscal 2017 outlook only includes 8 months of revenue contribution from Blue Coat. 
We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be up 11% to 13% to $4,040 million to $4,120 million. Fiscal 2017 operating margin is expected to be in the range of 26% to 28%. We expect approximately $45 million of onetime expense related to retention payments and sales force incentives put in place to ensure stability during our integration. We expect EPS of $1.08 to $1.14, with a tax rate of 29% and a fully diluted average share count of 616 million. 
Our fiscal 2018 outlook, we plan to enter fiscal 2018 with an operating margin of 30%. For fiscal 2018, we continue to expect EPS in the range of $1.70 to $1.80.

Let's begin with why I am confident we have the leadership team in place to deliver the leading cyber defense portfolio while integrating our 2 companies and achieving our financial targets.

Let's begin with why I am confident we have the leadership team in place to deliver the leading cyber defense portfolio while integrating our 2 companies and achieving our financial targets. With the Veritas divestiture behind us, we are focused on removing the remaining stranded costs and further improving our operating efficiency. This is an important step to deliver our commitment to the $550 million in savings and synergies. 
When I joined Blue Coat in 2011, the company had multiple quarters of revenue declines with below-average profitability. While at Blue Coat, we delivered a substantial improvement in operating effectiveness, acquisitions were fully integrated and the company returned to growth. This experience is highly relevant to delivering process efficiencies at Symantec. We focused the product strategy on cybersecurity, rebuilt the go-to-market engine and improved profitability and thoughtfully leveraged our balance sheet to successfully acquire market-leading technologies. Blue Coat today is a clear leader in cloud security with the #1 market share of the secure web gateway. Organic revenue growth is now in the mid-teens with operating margins in the high 20s. 
When we combined the Blue Coat leadership team with the many talented executives from Symantec, the outcome is a deep bench across all functions, with a technology portfolio that is market-leading backed by substantial development talent totaling over 4,000 engineers.
Let me turn to some early feedback from customers and our channel. I was recently visiting the CIO of a global financial institution who said the combination of Symantec and Blue Coat not only makes us their most strategic security partner, but we are now considered one of the top overall strategic technology partners. This type of recognition is not taken for granted and offers a clear advantage versus our competition. 
Many other large enterprise customers have proactively reached out to us not only to express excitement about the further integration of our product lines, but are even more enthusiastic about our longer-term vision and our relevance in their migration and adoption to cloud solutions. 
Furthermore, our channel providers that service the mid-market have expressed excitement around the power of our endpoint solution integrated into our cloud security platform. It is in the mid-market where securely adopting cloud applications is essential. 
Now I will comment on how we plan to maintain strong sales execution while we realize the $550 million in cost efficiencies and Blue Coat synergies. As previously announced, Mike Fey has been appointed as COO and President. Mike's organization was instrumental in leading the Blue Coat sales force and channel and consistently meeting or beating our sales plans and taking market share. 
We plan to maintain our combined quota-carrying sales capacity. Together, we have the largest dedicated security sales force with deep technical strength to bring our products to market. Combined sales capacity is substantially increased in the enterprise market. 
As we outlined at the acquisition announcement, we found less-than-expected customer overlap during our due diligence, which over the medium term offers us a meaningful cross-sale opportunity and provides tailwinds for fiscal 2018. We are also excited about working with our many channel partners across the globe and bringing differentiated value to our joint customers.
Let me touch on our plans beyond sales. The Consumer Security team will remain a stand-alone unit from an operational standpoint and report directly to me. The management team in this business unit is excellent. We are pleased with the stability of the business and encouraged by the product road map. We will continue to make investments that extend the Norton value beyond the traditional PC to return the segment to growth. These include new products such as Wi-Fi privacy and home IoT. 
From an enterprise security standpoint, during the planning process, we jointly reviewed product road maps with respective teams. I am truly impressed by the level of game-changing product leadership our development teams are pursuing. We'll be sharing many of these in the upcoming quarters. 
With regards to operational integration, we have worked diligently to put an integration plan in place that is led by seasoned executives, and we are on track to achieve our targets. We expect to be substantially operationally integrated by the end of our fiscal year, March 2017. 
Turning to Blue Coat's fiscal Q1 performance. As many of you know, Blue Coat historically has been on a July month ending first quarter. While we are still closing our books, we do not yet have official results, I'm pleased to share that from an overall performance standpoint that our Q1 results were ahead of expectations and we saw strong momentum across all products. 
Now let's switch gears to address how our combined portfolio can help solve the biggest security problems that our customers are facing. First, the largest opportunity we see in the market is securing enterprises, governments and consumers from advanced attacks, and securing our customers as they adopt cloud. When it comes to staying ahead of advanced threats, a key differentiator is the speed at which one can identify and mitigate malicious activity across a functionally rich set of products. 
Together, Symantec and Blue Coat have the broadest and deepest set of threat intelligence data in the industry, combined with the fastest threat propagation time. Symantec for years has been focused on identifying malicious content and Blue Coat has been categorizing, mapping and fingerprinting the Internet with a purview to the darkest parts of the web and malware tradecraft. Together, Symantec with Blue Coat will have the most powerful combination of threat intelligence as well as an open platform in which to deliver enhanced cyber defense, anchored in threat intelligence. 
Within the coming months, we will have integrated many aspects of the threat intelligence, including Symantec's endpoint and email solutions ecosystem with Blue Coat's intelligence network. This combined intelligence database and detection engines will allow our current products to become more robust and outperform the competition. The capabilities of the combined portfolio work towards a world of automated discovery with an integrated advanced threat protection dashboard that identifies, correlates and remediates threats beyond what any solution is capable of today. 
While we will lead with an integrated solution, on a stand-alone basis, we will continue to deliver best-of-breed security at the enforcement points, including the web gateway, CASB, email and endpoint, and are committed to our open platform for customers and ISVs. For enterprises that are adopting the cloud, our combined solutions provide the best defense in depth for the cloud generation. 
We remain very optimistic about the progress we're making with our managed security service. This is an important offering for customers that have difficulty hiring and retaining experienced security professionals. We're also committed to empowering our managed security service partners and committed to empowering this important sector as service providers and SIs are important players in the migration to the cloud.
The second major opportunity we see in the marketplace is protecting the mobile workforce. The traditional IT perimeter is expanding, as employees are doing more work outside the network firewall and are accessing cloud services and corporate data directly from a variety of devices. In addition, there has been a significant rise in nontraditional Internet-connected devices within the enterprise, such as medical devices and industrial equipment, automobiles, office equipment and other next generation endpoints and IoT devices. Now, many of these nontraditional devices are unprotected from modern threats. Proxies are essential in protecting these technologies in the cloud generation.
This evolution in workforce computing creates gaps in the traditional security architecture, which lead to infiltration of bad actors and insider threats. And we're bringing in more secure and scalable architectural solution that combines the Symantec endpoint with the cloud generation security from Blue Coat. As a result, the Symantec endpoint will have a continuous coverage inside the perimeter or while roaming, protecting users and data. We have already begun integration of the SEP endpoint security client with the cloud security proxy, email, DLP and CASB, which provides complete security coverage no matter where enterprise devices travel. In addition to this, our managed security service can assist our customers and partners in reducing costs related to incident response.
For example, the SEP agent will direct all outbound traffic through the Blue Coat security cloud for inspection. If a threat is found, our cloud security proxy from Blue Coat can quickly quarantine the user and remediate. We will auto remediate via the SEP endpoint, removing substantial cost from incident response. This remediation also includes forensic recordings for the breach and can isolate the endpoint device as well as the users' cloud-based application identities via our web gateway and CASB.
This sets a new bar for next generation endpoints. This is where many next-gen endpoint vendors come up short as they only focus on traditional means of protecting laptops, desktops and servers. The Blue Coat acquisition allows us to bring many crucial aspects of the endpoint inspection into the cloud and open the aperture to protect any type of enterprise device, its users and the users' cloud applications. 
We further augment our ability to protect customers by our security analytics technology. This technology keeps a recording of activity from an endpoint, and enables advanced machine learning techniques such as behavioral analysis to identify previously undetected malware. This also allows us to improve our threat detection by true root cause analysis of the vulnerability and malware tradecraft.
This is a large market, and our solution will be disruptive to alternatives. For our customers, our solutions improve cyber defense and reduce costs of remediation. No other security provider in the market today has our unique capability of deep functionality on endpoint, combined with visibility and time to remediation capabilities inherent in our cloud security platform. We believe the work we're doing is important enough to redefine cyber defense.
The third major opportunity is helping customers securely embrace the cloud as they increase the use of cloud-based applications and services. As customers access more cloud applications and leverage the cloud for their IT infrastructure, they are still responsible for securing their users' and enterprise data. We believe our Cloud Generation Security platform uniquely delivers the ability to achieve this and enables a defense-in-depth via our open platform and the many security vendors and technologies that can be incorporated. This defense-in-depth future-proofs an organization against attack vectors in years to come. 
A portion of the functionality needed to protect cloud services are referred to by the industry analysts as cloud security access brokers. We believe the market opportunity that goes beyond the CASB functionality to what we consider a Cloud Generation Security Stack, which includes CASB, data protection, encryption, cloud incident response and elements of web security. 
Developing a Cloud Generation Security Stack requires 3 major components. First, enterprises must deliver, categorize and instrument policies for cloud applications. Blue Coat's Elastica solution combined with the policies enforced at the Blue Coat proxy is a clear leader in discovering and defining these policies. Next, enterprises must monitor and enforce how data can be moved and accessed as it migrates around the cloud. Blue Coat's web gateway and Symantec's data protection are the market leaders controlling the access and movement of data and are already integrated into many customer environments today.
Finally, enterprises will decide based on their data policy whether to encrypt or tokenize critical information. Together, we have the leading encryption and tokenizing technology.
In the market today, Symantec is the only provider that can deliver this end-to-end solution. To assemble the same level of protection through multiple vendors will result in costly, loosely integrated security architecture and a dependence on retaining the people that built it. Our customers are telling us that these sustainment costs and risks are a substantial problem.
In conclusion, let me reiterate the following points. We have a seasoned executive team with deep cybersecurity experience as well as the operational expertise for turning around, operating and growing technology businesses at scale. The product portfolios from Symantec and Blue Coat are highly complementary and positioned well for where the market is moving. Our solutions are defining the future of cybersecurity by securing consumers, enterprises and governments from advanced attacks, protecting the workforce of the future and helping customers embrace the cloud generation.
And I will end with that we are confident hitting the guidance Thomas outlined earlier in his remarks and the ability to deliver our commitments for fiscal 2018. Thank you for your time. Operator, we'll now open up the call for Q&A."

So I think -- first of all, I'd just like to give the team at Symantec excellent marks for delivering the ATP solutions integrator with the endpoint. That is in the market right now. That product is really proving to be very effective in advanced malware detection. And we have -- the customers, as Thomas mentioned, we closed a good clip of customers in Q1 with that technology. And the point that he mentioned in his remarks I think is really important, is 2/3 of those customers were not at an endpoint renewal. They bought it in advanced threat needs they had and added it to the environment that was already there. So I think that's a really good show of faith. The road map on that product is excellent. The threat database that it's sitting on is phenomenal. And we are really excited about our ability to also integrate that in the network via the web gateways both in the cloud and on-premise. We already have, through our content analysis system, the ability to execute that advanced threat platform as one of the choices that we give customers for how to fight those same threats as they manifest in the network. Again, the telemetry that, that platform is sitting on is we believe the deepest in the industry, taking everything from the consumer world at Norton and everything from the enterprise endpoints, and very shortly, everything from the Blue Coat world. And it's applying that against all the various threat protection engines. And we feel very good about the ability to upsell that both on -- from the endpoint route-to-market and also from our network point of presence, it also provides advanced threat."

If you take an endpoint and you have one that's dealing with the sort of essential needs of keeping up with antivirus. And you put some of the next generation things on it that we have in SEP 14. And then you go and put in the integration of that to any of these SOCs. And you stitch that up with any of the remediation technologies, you create a very expensive and fragile world that customers have said, ""If you can just put that together for us -- we've all had to build that ourselves. It's very expensive for us to own it, through life sustain it. And that has been something we do believe you have an open platform. We can integrate other vendors in here, Symantec. That's great. If you could put these pieces together for us, it really delivers value that is very helpful -- difficult to keep that stuff going through all the releases and all of the folks you have to employ and retain to make it continue to work."" So that's been consistent feedback. We've got a great story there that's doing well. The other piece is really in the integration of the endpoint to cloud. Everyone wants to adopt the cloud. We still have to protect the endpoint. People are very bullish about solving problems when desktops -- or all mobile these days. Everyone has laptops, and they want to carry them in and out of the office and that's auto connected to the cloud, always connected to the cloud across messaging, web use, anything in your internal data centers, also all of the cloud applications, cloud infrastructure. That's the -- that resonates consistently through customers, I think. So 2 things: complexity of building a really advanced cyber defense and a through-life sustainment of that. And the second thing is really the adoption of the cloud generation really making the endpoint work with the cloud security platform we've developed have been the 2 major things."

You talked about in terms of sales, keeping your raw sales capacity on the enterprise side from both Blue Coat and Symantec intact. What exactly will they be selling? Will it be one sales force selling across the portfolio for enterprise security products? Or will the guys be in their own lanes for a while? Can you help us understand how the sales capacity expands across the entire portfolio?"
35000,373871379,1026368,"Symantec Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Yes, I know exactly. So couple of things are really good tailwinds for us as we bring the 2 sales forces together. First of all, Symantec had a pretty strong presence in the mid-market. Blue Coat was primarily focused on the higher end of the enterprise.",613,"Yes, I know exactly. So couple of things are really good tailwinds for us as we bring the 2 sales forces together. First of all, Symantec had a pretty strong presence in the mid-market. Blue Coat was primarily focused on the higher end of the enterprise. So if we sort of take the sales force component that dealt with named account selling at the higher end of the enterprise, the combination of the 2 sales forces is actually very complementary. So we were, on the Blue Coat side, looking for a bunch of capacity expansion anyway because we had really strong demand. And we have enough of that demand that as we look towards 2018, we do not need to make any reductions in that sales capacity. And also -- so in between now and us assigning all of those territories, we came up with a compensation model. And we have really invested in making sure that we can compensate both account reps that are calling on the same account in a way that is -- keeps their interests aligned. And if there was a Blue Coat sale, someone at Symantec gets some. If there was a Symantec sale, someone at Blue Coat gets some. And if there was a new sale of a new thing that wasn't in there before, everyone wins in a bigger way. So we put a ton of work in the last number of months in how we would do that and really taken that all the way down and pressure testing that in the big territories that matter, like around the eastern seaboard of the U.S., where you can have a large bank that's carrying a big chunk of commission and making sure that that's going to work with those folks. And even getting right through talking to them all about it. So we are way down range on that discussion and have made those things clear in our organization. And we feel really good about how that's going to go. In the mid-market, Symantec already had strong presence, and we didn't at Blue Coat. And so that's an easy one. That's a great piece of the puzzle. That's just getting a better solution to go into those partners and customers in mid-market. So net-net, I think we're pretty good at this topic on both the Symantec and Blue Coat side. How to think about it is we just increased our sales capacity. And we'd have enough demand that we do believe we have makeable plans for all of the selling teams across the territories. And we feel really good about that. The cross-sell and upsell opportunity -- I think once that sales force is ramped and both sides can sell a lot of the other's products, so we should see nice tailwinds in '18 as that becomes productive. So we feel really good about the top line, 6 to 9 months from now, as that really starts to fire. And the other piece, I think, is also really key is that many of the Blue Coat sales force, which we grew substantially over the last couple of years, has sold endpoint and has sold the other like solutions that Symantec has, such as DLP and things like that. And the Blue Coat sales force is excellent at selling DLP because their ProxySG orchestrates most of the enterprise DLP in market anyway. So we feel really good about the 2 really big market-leading Symantec endpoint and DLP products and those being able to be executed by the named account reps on the Blue Coat side. So we're optimistic about having some good calls with you throughout '18."

And I really like the differentiation we get from other enterprise security vendors in that we're actually getting threat telemetry from a completely consumer and a completely sort of private web experience, which really shows up a lot of shady parts of the Internet. So I would sort of say that's really goodness, that really helps us out. And the reason why some of our enterprise endpoints and why we're much better at effectiveness tests as we know a lot about what the bad guys are doing and a lot of that information comes from people that browse things at home. So we like that. So -- And then we say okay, this a big piece of our business and we would like it to grow, just like you would imagine we would like it to grow. So in our comments before, we're really extending what we're doing in the consumer brands to get more value than just on the endpoint, and really start to look at the network and the use of the Internet by the consumer. And we are already working on a bunch of things that are really going out to really excite consumers more about wanting to make a decision around Norton for their consumer security needs. Because it's more than just the PC. So getting off that PC platform is important. We actually know a lot about it because we've been working with telecom providers for many years at Blue Coat. And we know the technologies we have and our quality of service and being able to do things like measure screen time. And we've already been in contact control for a long time. So we actually really want to extend the value of Norton off the PC platform, off the other kind of just sort of technical endpoints, more into what that user is doing and helping them with some of the new challenges that they have in the Internet. So you'll be hearing more from us over time, but we definitely have technology in this space. And we have the networking cred to get in and help out from that part of the story for consumers. What we're doing in Wi-Fi and some of the home IoT is also impressive. And so John, we don't want to sit around and kind of watch an outgoing tide on the PC platform really. We want to address that part of the business also."

So first of all when we talk about next-gen endpoint and we actually think about what's going on in the platform, we're seriously competitive against all of the other folks that are there right now, things like flight recorders, things like being able to have behavioral analysis, machine learning algorithms. They all exist and serious tech in terms of very experienced people that are working on them here at Symantec. I'd say if I was going to give us a ding on something, I'd say we don't talk about it enough. But we have a very powerful platform and the latest release of SEP is very competitive against the next gen endpoints. We've been able to win with that next gen integrated with the ATP stuff we were just talking about. We've been taking out some of the guys who market well into the next-gen endpoints. Some of them have good tech and they're good competitors. But I tell you we have a very good competitive offering just head-to-head on modern techniques, what they call modern techniques -- which means the old techniques, I can tell you, the old techniques are also seriously still needed. The modern techniques are also useful. And there will always be the next modern techniques because the bad guys are smart and they change the way they do things. But being able to defend against what are the most advanced threats today, we do well in that space. We do have a good platform there. We don't market it as well as we should. We will change that. And in addition to that, the number of technologists that are very good at what they do, that we are investing in this space, is substantial. And we will continue to do that. We will grow that. And we are after the best and brightest all the time in the industry to do that. One of the things -- my reputation in every company I've ever been involved with, I've gone after the best experts and retaining the best ones we have and getting more. And we are setting our crosshairs on this ownership of this next-gen endpoint. So then we move to what are we doing that the other guys aren't doing and that the other guys will have a big problem doing. It's very difficult to think about protection of users when you don't think about protection of those users in the SaaS applications that they are using. When the applications used to be all inside a data center, you can isolate an endpoint and protect that identity and associated data. Half of those applications left the building. If you can't isolate the user's identity in the cloud applications -- and to do that, you need logic like a CASB -- it's difficult to really go into a company and say I've isolated Greg. Did I really get Greg isolated at Salesforce.com, at ServiceNow? Did I get his NetSuite stuff locked out? What about all that renewal database over there -- ServiceNow, whatever it happens to be. So we are right now the only next-gen endpoint vendor that can address isolation of the user. And then, if you really want to get into the bowels of it, if we start talking about multi-phased attacks, the network assist that we give our endpoint in multi-phased attacks, and then being able to vaccinate those from the messaging layer, from the web dial tone. We feel really good about competing against the endpoint vendor. And then a final point I'd like to make is when you move to the cloud, you don't get to pick your next gen firewall. When you're not picking your next gen firewall, the tie-out between the next gen firewall and the advanced endpoint breaks. So we feel really good about our cloud platform connected to the Symantec next-gen endpoint and our ability to really change the game on the next-gen endpoint. So we will really work hard to make sure the industry understands what I was just talking about. There's a lot there and that, that architecture and our ability to execute and deliver it is well understood. And I feel pretty good about our ability to stem the tide of what I'd say had been maybe a better execution from Symantec that would have taken some of the tailwind out of some of the next-gen endpoints folks. One more point, one of the most important points, we have a very strong balance sheet. And this next-gen endpoint party is going to go on for a long time. And we are going to be there. And we're going to be there with a strong investment all the way through it. And I'm not so sure that's the case in many of the others. So that's hopefully helpful. 
I think that's it. I think we've run out of time. But I'd just like to thank all of you for taking some time to talk to us today and your support of Symantec. Thank you very much. Thank you."

We provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, except for statements about net income and EPS. All non-GAAP revenue and expenses exclude the impact of Veritas. However, the continuing operations deferred revenue on the balance sheet includes a portion of Veritas deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered into prior to operational separation.

It's an exciting time for the new Symantec, and I'm proud to be leading the company that will define the future of cybersecurity. 
We are already off to a great start by closing the Blue Coat acquisition earlier than expected in under 2 months since announcement. This has allowed us to move rapidly into the execution of our integration strategy. Since the announcement of the acquisition, we have pressure tested our financial assumptions and continue to remain confident in achieving fiscal 2018 EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.80, which we disclosed when we announced the acquisition in June. Our combined product portfolio separates us as the most strategic security player in the industry, with a portfolio of solutions that addresses over 50% of the enterprise security budgets or an approximate $40 billion of total available market. 
Furthermore, we are the only security company that has the scale and vision to be considered by the CIO as one of the most strategic technology partners. As you saw from Dimension Data's quote in our closing press release earlier this week, the partners are extremely optimistic about the technology that the combined company can bring to market. In addition to great support from our partners, we have had an outstanding feedback from the customer base. I'll provide more customer feedback later in my remarks. 
First, Thomas will begin by providing an overview of the Symantec Q1 results and our financial outlook. Then I will address why we are confident that we have the deep leadership expertise in place to integrate the 2 companies and deliver upon our financial targets. I will wrap up by describing major cybersecurity challenges enterprises are facing, and how Symantec is best positioned to usher in a new era of cybersecurity solutions to solve these multibillion-dollar opportunities."

Nearly 2 years ago, we announced our intention to become the leading pure play cybersecurity company. With the close of the Blue Coat acquisition, we've accelerated that strategy and now are positioned to execute on our integration road map while we define the future of cybersecurity. 
Today, I will provide an overview of our first quarter results, update you on our $550 million cost efficiencies and Blue Coat integration synergies and conclude with our combined financial outlook. Additional details are provided in our CFO commentary, which is available on our Investor Relations website.
Our first quarter total revenue was $884 million, above the midpoint of our guided range, driven by improved performance within Enterprise Security and continued in line results from Consumer Security. 
From a macro and security spending standpoint, we did not see any incremental weakness in Europe related to Brexit. However, we continue to monitor our European pipeline very closely. 
Deferred revenue was $2.4 billion, which includes $243 million of deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied billings, excluding Veritas, were $788 million and declined 1.6% on a reported basis. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 28.6% and 210 basis points above the high end of our guided range of 24.5% to 26.5%. And the upside was evenly split by an early start to our cost efficiency savings and some onetime expense benefits. 
Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.29 and above our guidance of $0.24 to $0.26. Our non-GAAP tax rate and share count were in line with guidance. 
Cash flow from continuing operations during the quarter was a negative $742 million, which included a tax payment of $887 million related to the gain from the sale of Veritas and the $39 million in cash outflows related to restructuring and the Veritas separation. 
Let me now provide further detail on our performance by segment. 
Enterprise Security revenue was $481 million and declined 1% year-over-year, which was at the high end of our guidance of down 4% to down 1%, driven by strength in both information protection and cybersecurity services. 
Now I will review the product areas within our Enterprise Security segment. Threat protection revenue was down 5%. However, endpoint security including ATP grew low single digits year-over-year. Our newly launched ATP solutions showed continued momentum in what is a seasonally slower quarter. During Q1, we sold ATP subscriptions to 115 customers. And importantly, 2/3 of the Q1 ATP deals were sold independent of a renewal. Overall, we continue to maintain the value of our SEP and .cloud recurring revenue and, in some cases, expand our footprint within the account. Since its launch in December, we have sold ATP to 270 customers. Within the install base, there remains significant opportunity for additional ATP module cross-sell or seat expansion.
Information Protection revenue grew 4%. DLP revenue grew 18% and is benefiting from a tailwind of strong prior quarter deferred revenue growth and a favorable prior year compare. Looking forward, we have a solid pipeline for DLP, driven by data protection requirements as our customers adopt cloud-based applications. In addition, we are excited about the future of our data protection growth as we package DLP with our market-leading secure web gateway.
Cyber Security Services and other services grew 9%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth with solid performance across managed security services, incident response, threat intelligence and other security-focused professional services. Underlying these results, we continue to see strong demand for actionable cyber threat intelligence. 
Website security revenue grew 1% and performed in line with our expectations. We continue to see good performance from the higher end of our website security portfolio where our Complete Website Security offering is gaining traction. At the low end of the market, we expect our Encryption Everywhere solution to provide a tailwind to results in fiscal 2018 as we begin to benefit from the conversion of this freemium offering.
Now on to the Norton Consumer Security segment. Consumer Security revenue was down slightly less than 8%, which was at the lower end of our guidance of down 8% to down 5%. The underlying fundamentals of our consumer business continue to improve, driven by the move to subscription and online customer acquisition. We are also seeing early pipeline building for the new solutions such as Wi-Fi privacy and home IoT offerings. 
Let me now review some additional performance metrics for the Norton business. During Q1, retention rates continued to increase on a year-over-year basis following the anniversary of our transition to subscription model in the U.S. We will reach the 1-year anniversary internationally at the end of the fiscal Q2. We continue to grow our online acquisition of customers, which grew new subscriptions 4% during the first quarter.
Finally, earlier this summer, we launched our Wi-Fi privacy offering. This solution provides a secure connection while connected to an unsecured network. We are targeting the solution as both an upsell into our current install base and as a stand-alone solution to attract new Norton subscribers.
Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. On August 1, we added $2.8 billion of new debt and $1.25 billion of convertible notes. We have $5.6 billion in cash and $7.3 billion in total debt, including the $1.75 billion of convertible notes. As we previously said, we expect to delever our balance sheet over the medium term. 
As of last Friday, our current ASR is 58% complete, and we expect this it to finish in the fall of this year. We remain committed to maintaining our quarterly dividend.
Shifting gears to our $550 million of cost savings initiatives and the Blue Coat integration synergies. We've already made progress achieving savings across the areas of procurement, organizational effectiveness and, to a lesser extent, real estate. On an annualized basis, we have realized approximately $50 million of run rate net cost efficiencies. In addition to efficiency savings, we expect to achieve synergies from the Blue Coat acquisition by the end of fiscal 2018. The earlier close provides us a head start achieving these.
Before providing our guidance, let me walk through the underlying mechanics. We will be referring to the non-GAAP performance of the business, and please see the CFO commentary for a more detailed description. 
Going forward, Blue Coat will be reported as part of our Enterprise Security segment, given our plans to integrate multiple product solutions. It is important to note that historically, Blue Coat's fiscal second quarter has ended on October 31. Therefore, our fiscal second quarter guidance will include 2 months of contribution from Blue Coat from August 1 to September 30. It is also important to note that Blue Coat's revenue linearity is heavily weighted to the last month of the quarter. Therefore, embedded in our Q2 guidance is up to 50% of Blue Coat's prior Q2 non-GAAP revenue forecast. However, from a cost standpoint, we'll be burdened by approximately 2/3 of Blue Coat's second quarter spending, with only half the revenue. From a reporting standpoint, this linearity difference puts an abnormal burden on our operating margin in Q2.
We are focused on maintaining strong sales execution during our integration. However, we believe that it is prudent to set conservative top line guidance for Q2 and fiscal 2017 as we combine the 2 companies. 
We expect second quarter non-GAAP revenue to be up 4% to 8% from $960 million to $990 million. We expect consumer revenue to be down approximately 7% to $395 million to $400 million. We expect enterprise security, which includes a 2-month contribution from Blue Coat, to be up 14% to 20% to $565 million to $590 million. 
We expect an operating margin of 21% to 24%. To reiterate, a portion of the headwind to margins is due to a burden from 2/3 of the spend, but only 50% of revenue benefits from Blue Coat. And we expect approximately $30 million of the headwind to non-GAAP operating margin related to retention payments and sales force incentives put in place to ensure stability during our integration. 
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.21, with a tax rate of 29% and a fully diluted average share count of 640 million.
Now on to fiscal 2017 guidance. As a reminder, our fiscal 2017 outlook only includes 8 months of revenue contribution from Blue Coat. 
We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be up 11% to 13% to $4,040 million to $4,120 million. Fiscal 2017 operating margin is expected to be in the range of 26% to 28%. We expect approximately $45 million of onetime expense related to retention payments and sales force incentives put in place to ensure stability during our integration. We expect EPS of $1.08 to $1.14, with a tax rate of 29% and a fully diluted average share count of 616 million. 
Our fiscal 2018 outlook, we plan to enter fiscal 2018 with an operating margin of 30%. For fiscal 2018, we continue to expect EPS in the range of $1.70 to $1.80. 
Now let me turn the call back to Greg"

Let's begin with why I am confident we have the leadership team in place to deliver the leading cyber defense portfolio while integrating our 2 companies and achieving our financial targets. With the Veritas divestiture behind us, we ar",2081,"Thank you, Thomas. Let's begin with why I am confident we have the leadership team in place to deliver the leading cyber defense portfolio while integrating our 2 companies and achieving our financial targets. With the Veritas divestiture behind us, we are focused on removing the remaining stranded costs and further improving our operating efficiency. This is an important step to deliver our commitment to the $550 million in savings and synergies. 
When I joined Blue Coat in 2011, the company had multiple quarters of revenue declines with below-average profitability. While at Blue Coat, we delivered a substantial improvement in operating effectiveness, acquisitions were fully integrated and the company returned to growth. This experience is highly relevant to delivering process efficiencies at Symantec. We focused the product strategy on cybersecurity, rebuilt the go-to-market engine and improved profitability and thoughtfully leveraged our balance sheet to successfully acquire market-leading technologies. Blue Coat today is a clear leader in cloud security with the #1 market share of the secure web gateway. Organic revenue growth is now in the mid-teens with operating margins in the high 20s. 
When we combined the Blue Coat leadership team with the many talented executives from Symantec, the outcome is a deep bench across all functions, with a technology portfolio that is market-leading backed by substantial development talent totaling over 4,000 engineers.
Let me turn to some early feedback from customers and our channel. I was recently visiting the CIO of a global financial institution who said the combination of Symantec and Blue Coat not only makes us their most strategic security partner, but we are now considered one of the top overall strategic technology partners. This type of recognition is not taken for granted and offers a clear advantage versus our competition. 
Many other large enterprise customers have proactively reached out to us not only to express excitement about the further integration of our product lines, but are even more enthusiastic about our longer-term vision and our relevance in their migration and adoption to cloud solutions. 
Furthermore, our channel providers that service the mid-market have expressed excitement around the power of our endpoint solution integrated into our cloud security platform. It is in the mid-market where securely adopting cloud applications is essential. 
Now I will comment on how we plan to maintain strong sales execution while we realize the $550 million in cost efficiencies and Blue Coat synergies. As previously announced, Mike Fey has been appointed as COO and President. Mike's organization was instrumental in leading the Blue Coat sales force and channel and consistently meeting or beating our sales plans and taking market share. 
We plan to maintain our combined quota-carrying sales capacity. Together, we have the largest dedicated security sales force with deep technical strength to bring our products to market. Combined sales capacity is substantially increased in the enterprise market. 
As we outlined at the acquisition announcement, we found less-than-expected customer overlap during our due diligence, which over the medium term offers us a meaningful cross-sale opportunity and provides tailwinds for fiscal 2018. We are also excited about working with our many channel partners across the globe and bringing differentiated value to our joint customers.
Let me touch on our plans beyond sales. The Consumer Security team will remain a stand-alone unit from an operational standpoint and report directly to me. The management team in this business unit is excellent. We are pleased with the stability of the business and encouraged by the product road map. We will continue to make investments that extend the Norton value beyond the traditional PC to return the segment to growth. These include new products such as Wi-Fi privacy and home IoT. 
From an enterprise security standpoint, during the planning process, we jointly reviewed product road maps with respective teams. I am truly impressed by the level of game-changing product leadership our development teams are pursuing. We'll be sharing many of these in the upcoming quarters. 
With regards to operational integration, we have worked diligently to put an integration plan in place that is led by seasoned executives, and we are on track to achieve our targets. We expect to be substantially operationally integrated by the end of our fiscal year, March 2017. 
Turning to Blue Coat's fiscal Q1 performance. As many of you know, Blue Coat historically has been on a July month ending first quarter. While we are still closing our books, we do not yet have official results, I'm pleased to share that from an overall performance standpoint that our Q1 results were ahead of expectations and we saw strong momentum across all products. 
Now let's switch gears to address how our combined portfolio can help solve the biggest security problems that our customers are facing. First, the largest opportunity we see in the market is securing enterprises, governments and consumers from advanced attacks, and securing our customers as they adopt cloud. When it comes to staying ahead of advanced threats, a key differentiator is the speed at which one can identify and mitigate malicious activity across a functionally rich set of products. 
Together, Symantec and Blue Coat have the broadest and deepest set of threat intelligence data in the industry, combined with the fastest threat propagation time. Symantec for years has been focused on identifying malicious content and Blue Coat has been categorizing, mapping and fingerprinting the Internet with a purview to the darkest parts of the web and malware tradecraft. Together, Symantec with Blue Coat will have the most powerful combination of threat intelligence as well as an open platform in which to deliver enhanced cyber defense, anchored in threat intelligence. 
Within the coming months, we will have integrated many aspects of the threat intelligence, including Symantec's endpoint and email solutions ecosystem with Blue Coat's intelligence network. This combined intelligence database and detection engines will allow our current products to become more robust and outperform the competition. The capabilities of the combined portfolio work towards a world of automated discovery with an integrated advanced threat protection dashboard that identifies, correlates and remediates threats beyond what any solution is capable of today. 
While we will lead with an integrated solution, on a stand-alone basis, we will continue to deliver best-of-breed security at the enforcement points, including the web gateway, CASB, email and endpoint, and are committed to our open platform for customers and ISVs. For enterprises that are adopting the cloud, our combined solutions provide the best defense in depth for the cloud generation. 
We remain very optimistic about the progress we're making with our managed security service. This is an important offering for customers that have difficulty hiring and retaining experienced security professionals. We're also committed to empowering our managed security service partners and committed to empowering this important sector as service providers and SIs are important players in the migration to the cloud.
The second major opportunity we see in the marketplace is protecting the mobile workforce. The traditional IT perimeter is expanding, as employees are doing more work outside the network firewall and are accessing cloud services and corporate data directly from a variety of devices. In addition, there has been a significant rise in nontraditional Internet-connected devices within the enterprise, such as medical devices and industrial equipment, automobiles, office equipment and other next generation endpoints and IoT devices. Now, many of these nontraditional devices are unprotected from modern threats. Proxies are essential in protecting these technologies in the cloud generation.
This evolution in workforce computing creates gaps in the traditional security architecture, which lead to infiltration of bad actors and insider threats. And we're bringing in more secure and scalable architectural solution that combines the Symantec endpoint with the cloud generation security from Blue Coat. As a result, the Symantec endpoint will have a continuous coverage inside the perimeter or while roaming, protecting users and data. We have already begun integration of the SEP endpoint security client with the cloud security proxy, email, DLP and CASB, which provides complete security coverage no matter where enterprise devices travel. In addition to this, our managed security service can assist our customers and partners in reducing costs related to incident response.
For example, the SEP agent will direct all outbound traffic through the Blue Coat security cloud for inspection. If a threat is found, our cloud security proxy from Blue Coat can quickly quarantine the user and remediate. We will auto remediate via the SEP endpoint, removing substantial cost from incident response. This remediation also includes forensic recordings for the breach and can isolate the endpoint device as well as the users' cloud-based application identities via our web gateway and CASB.
This sets a new bar for next generation endpoints. This is where many next-gen endpoint vendors come up short as they only focus on traditional means of protecting laptops, desktops and servers. The Blue Coat acquisition allows us to bring many crucial aspects of the endpoint inspection into the cloud and open the aperture to protect any type of enterprise device, its users and the users' cloud applications. 
We further augment our ability to protect customers by our security analytics technology. This technology keeps a recording of activity from an endpoint, and enables advanced machine learning techniques such as behavioral analysis to identify previously undetected malware. This also allows us to improve our threat detection by true root cause analysis of the vulnerability and malware tradecraft.
This is a large market, and our solution will be disruptive to alternatives. For our customers, our solutions improve cyber defense and reduce costs of remediation. No other security provider in the market today has our unique capability of deep functionality on endpoint, combined with visibility and time to remediation capabilities inherent in our cloud security platform. We believe the work we're doing is important enough to redefine cyber defense.
The third major opportunity is helping customers securely embrace the cloud as they increase the use of cloud-based applications and services. As customers access more cloud applications and leverage the cloud for their IT infrastructure, they are still responsible for securing their users' and enterprise data. We believe our Cloud Generation Security platform uniquely delivers the ability to achieve this and enables a defense-in-depth via our open platform and the many security vendors and technologies that can be incorporated. This defense-in-depth future-proofs an organization against attack vectors in years to come. 
A portion of the functionality needed to protect cloud services are referred to by the industry analysts as cloud security access brokers. We believe the market opportunity that goes beyond the CASB functionality to what we consider a Cloud Generation Security Stack, which includes CASB, data protection, encryption, cloud incident response and elements of web security. 
Developing a Cloud Generation Security Stack requires 3 major components. First, enterprises must deliver, categorize and instrument policies for cloud applications. Blue Coat's Elastica solution combined with the policies enforced at the Blue Coat proxy is a clear leader in discovering and defining these policies. Next, enterprises must monitor and enforce how data can be moved and accessed as it migrates around the cloud. Blue Coat's web gateway and Symantec's data protection are the market leaders controlling the access and movement of data and are already integrated into many customer environments today.
Finally, enterprises will decide based on their data policy whether to encrypt or tokenize critical information. Together, we have the leading encryption and tokenizing technology.
In the market today, Symantec is the only provider that can deliver this end-to-end solution. To assemble the same level of protection through multiple vendors will result in costly, loosely integrated security architecture and a dependence on retaining the people that built it. Our customers are telling us that these sustainment costs and risks are a substantial problem.
In conclusion, let me reiterate the following points. We have a seasoned executive team with deep cybersecurity experience as well as the operational expertise for turning around, operating and growing technology businesses at scale. The product portfolios from Symantec and Blue Coat are highly complementary and positioned well for where the market is moving. Our solutions are defining the future of cybersecurity by securing consumers, enterprises and governments from advanced attacks, protecting the workforce of the future and helping customers embrace the cloud generation.
And I will end with that we are confident hitting the guidance Thomas outlined earlier in his remarks and the ability to deliver our commitments for fiscal 2018. Thank you for your time. Operator, we'll now open up the call for Q&A."

That product is really proving to be very effective in advanced malware detection. And we have -- the customers, as Thomas mentioned, we closed a good clip of customers in Q1 with that technology. And the point that he mentioned in his remarks I think is really important, is 2/3 of those customers were not at an endpoint renewal. They bought it in advanced threat needs they had and added it to the environment that was already there. So I think that's a really good show of faith. The road map on that product is excellent. The threat database that it's sitting on is phenomenal. And we are really excited about our ability to also integrate that in the network via the web gateways both in the cloud and on-premise. We already have, through our content analysis system, the ability to execute that advanced threat platform as one of the choices that we give customers for how to fight those same threats as they manifest in the network. Again, the telemetry that, that platform is sitting on is we believe the deepest in the industry, taking everything from the consumer world at Norton and everything from the enterprise endpoints, and very shortly, everything from the Blue Coat world. And it's applying that against all the various threat protection engines. And we feel very good about the ability to upsell that both on -- from the endpoint route-to-market and also from our network point of presence, it also provides advanced threat."

If you take an endpoint and you have one that's dealing with the sort of essential needs of keeping up with antivirus. And you put some of the next generation things on it that we have in SEP 14. And then you go and put in the integration of that to any of these SOCs. And you stitch that up with any of the remediation technologies, you create a very expensive and fragile world that customers have said, ""If you can just put that together for us -- we've all had to build that ourselves. It's very expensive for us to own it, through life sustain it. And that has been something we do believe you have an open platform. We can integrate other vendors in here, Symantec. That's great. If you could put these pieces together for us, it really delivers value that is very helpful -- difficult to keep that stuff going through all the releases and all of the folks you have to employ and retain to make it continue to work."" So that's been consistent feedback. We've got a great story there that's doing well. The other piece is really in the integration of the endpoint to cloud. Everyone wants to adopt the cloud. We still have to protect the endpoint. People are very bullish about solving problems when desktops -- or all mobile these days. Everyone has laptops, and they want to carry them in and out of the office and that's auto connected to the cloud, always connected to the cloud across messaging, web use, anything in your internal data centers, also all of the cloud applications, cloud infrastructure. That's the -- that resonates consistently through customers, I think. So 2 things: complexity of building a really advanced cyber defense and a through-life sustainment of that. And the second thing is really the adoption of the cloud generation really making the endpoint work with the cloud security platform we've developed have been the 2 major things."

You talked about in terms of sales, keeping your raw sales capacity on the enterprise side from both Blue Coat and Symantec intact. What exactly will they be selling?

Can you help us understand how the sales capacity expands across the entire portfolio?"

So couple of things are really good tailwinds for us as we bring the 2 sales forces together. First of all, Symantec had a pretty strong presence in the mid-market.

First of all, Symantec had a pretty strong presence in the mid-market. Blue Coat was primarily focused on the higher end of the enterprise. So if we sort of take the sales force component that dealt with named account selling at the higher end of the enterprise, the combination of the 2 sales forces is actually very complementary. So we were, on the Blue Coat side, looking for a bunch of capacity expansion anyway because we had really strong demand. And we have enough of that demand that as we look towards 2018, we do not need to make any reductions in that sales capacity. And also -- so in between now and us assigning all of those territories, we came up with a compensation model. And we have really invested in making sure that we can compensate both account reps that are calling on the same account in a way that is -- keeps their interests aligned. And if there was a Blue Coat sale, someone at Symantec gets some. If there was a Symantec sale, someone at Blue Coat gets some. And if there was a new sale of a new thing that wasn't in there before, everyone wins in a bigger way. So we put a ton of work in the last number of months in how we would do that and really taken that all the way down and pressure testing that in the big territories that matter, like around the eastern seaboard of the U.S., where you can have a large bank that's carrying a big chunk of commission and making sure that that's going to work with those folks. And even getting right through talking to them all about it. So we are way down range on that discussion and have made those things clear in our organization. And we feel really good about how that's going to go. In the mid-market, Symantec already had strong presence, and we didn't at Blue Coat. And so that's an easy one. That's a great piece of the puzzle. That's just getting a better solution to go into those partners and customers in mid-market. So net-net, I think we're pretty good at this topic on both the Symantec and Blue Coat side. How to think about it is we just increased our sales capacity. And we'd have enough demand that we do believe we have makeable plans for all of the selling teams across the territories. And we feel really good about that. The cross-sell and upsell opportunity -- I think once that sales force is ramped and both sides can sell a lot of the other's products, so we should see nice tailwinds in '18 as that becomes productive. So we feel really good about the top line, 6 to 9 months from now, as that really starts to fire. And the other piece, I think, is also really key is that many of the Blue Coat sales force, which we grew substantially over the last couple of years, has sold endpoint and has sold the other like solutions that Symantec has, such as DLP and things like that. And the Blue Coat sales force is excellent at selling DLP because their ProxySG orchestrates most of the enterprise DLP in market anyway. So we feel really good about the 2 really big market-leading Symantec endpoint and DLP products and those being able to be executed by the named account reps on the Blue Coat side. So we're optimistic about having some good calls with you throughout '18."

And I really like the differentiation we get from other enterprise security vendors in that we're actually getting threat telemetry from a completely consumer and a completely sort of private web experience, which really shows up a lot of shady parts of the Internet. So I would sort of say that's really goodness, that really helps us out. And the reason why some of our enterprise endpoints and why we're much better at effectiveness tests as we know a lot about what the bad guys are doing and a lot of that information comes from people that browse things at home. So we like that. So -- And then we say okay, this a big piece of our business and we would like it to grow, just like you would imagine we would like it to grow. So in our comments before, we're really extending what we're doing in the consumer brands to get more value than just on the endpoint, and really start to look at the network and the use of the Internet by the consumer. And we are already working on a bunch of things that are really going out to really excite consumers more about wanting to make a decision around Norton for their consumer security needs. Because it's more than just the PC. So getting off that PC platform is important. We actually know a lot about it because we've been working with telecom providers for many years at Blue Coat. And we know the technologies we have and our quality of service and being able to do things like measure screen time. And we've already been in contact control for a long time. So we actually really want to extend the value of Norton off the PC platform, off the other kind of just sort of technical endpoints, more into what that user is doing and helping them with some of the new challenges that they have in the Internet. So you'll be hearing more from us over time, but we definitely have technology in this space. And we have the networking cred to get in and help out from that part of the story for consumers. What we're doing in Wi-Fi and some of the home IoT is also impressive. And so John, we don't want to sit around and kind of watch an outgoing tide on the PC platform really. We want to address that part of the business also."

So first of all when we talk about next-gen endpoint and we actually think about what's going on in the platform, we're seriously competitive against all of the other folks that are there right now, things like flight recorders, things like being able to have behavioral analysis, machine learning algorithms. They all exist and serious tech in terms of very experienced people that are working on them here at Symantec. I'd say if I was going to give us a ding on something, I'd say we don't talk about it enough. But we have a very powerful platform and the latest release of SEP is very competitive against the next gen endpoints. We've been able to win with that next gen integrated with the ATP stuff we were just talking about. We've been taking out some of the guys who market well into the next-gen endpoints. Some of them have good tech and they're good competitors. But I tell you we have a very good competitive offering just head-to-head on modern techniques, what they call modern techniques -- which means the old techniques, I can tell you, the old techniques are also seriously still needed. The modern techniques are also useful. And there will always be the next modern techniques because the bad guys are smart and they change the way they do things. But being able to defend against what are the most advanced threats today, we do well in that space. We do have a good platform there. We don't market it as well as we should. We will change that. And in addition to that, the number of technologists that are very good at what they do, that we are investing in this space, is substantial. And we will continue to do that. We will grow that. And we are after the best and brightest all the time in the industry to do that. One of the things -- my reputation in every company I've ever been involved with, I've gone after the best experts and retaining the best ones we have and getting more. And we are setting our crosshairs on this ownership of this next-gen endpoint. So then we move to what are we doing that the other guys aren't doing and that the other guys will have a big problem doing. It's very difficult to think about protection of users when you don't think about protection of those users in the SaaS applications that they are using. When the applications used to be all inside a data center, you can isolate an endpoint and protect that identity and associated data. Half of those applications left the building. If you can't isolate the user's identity in the cloud applications -- and to do that, you need logic like a CASB -- it's difficult to really go into a company and say I've isolated Greg. Did I really get Greg isolated at Salesforce.com, at ServiceNow? Did I get his NetSuite stuff locked out? What about all that renewal database over there -- ServiceNow, whatever it happens to be. So we are right now the only next-gen endpoint vendor that can address isolation of the user. And then, if you really want to get into the bowels of it, if we start talking about multi-phased attacks, the network assist that we give our endpoint in multi-phased attacks, and then being able to vaccinate those from the messaging layer, from the web dial tone. We feel really good about competing against the endpoint vendor. And then a final point I'd like to make is when you move to the cloud, you don't get to pick your next gen firewall. When you're not picking your next gen firewall, the tie-out between the next gen firewall and the advanced endpoint breaks. So we feel really good about our cloud platform connected to the Symantec next-gen endpoint and our ability to really change the game on the next-gen endpoint. So we will really work hard to make sure the industry understands what I was just talking about. There's a lot there and that, that architecture and our ability to execute and deliver it is well understood. And I feel pretty good about our ability to stem the tide of what I'd say had been maybe a better execution from Symantec that would have taken some of the tailwind out of some of the next-gen endpoints folks. One more point, one of the most important points, we have a very strong balance sheet. And this next-gen endpoint party is going to go on for a long time. And we are going to be there. And we're going to be there with a strong investment all the way through it. And I'm not so sure that's the case in many of the others. So that's hopefully helpful. 
I think that's it. I think we've run out of time. But I'd just like to thank all of you for taking some time to talk to us today and your support of Symantec. Thank you very much. Thank you."

We were pleased with our performance during the second quarter as the results exceeded our guidance across all metrics. Our cost savings and synergy initiatives are tracking ahead of schedule. Within the first 10 weeks of c",1419,"Thank you for joining us today. We were pleased with our performance during the second quarter as the results exceeded our guidance across all metrics. Our cost savings and synergy initiatives are tracking ahead of schedule. Within the first 10 weeks of closing Blue Coat, we've made multiple meaningful product improvements and integrations. The feedback on our product road map from customers, partners and third-party influencers has been overwhelmingly positive. Product integrations are already having a significant impact on our ability to better protect customers and further validates the rationale and power of our combination.
In my prepared remarks today, I will review some of the key product integrations, highlight the exciting innovation underway within Symantec, discuss some market validation in our enterprise segment and review our Consumer Security business.
Protecting customers in the cloud generation against a multi-faceted adversary requires an Integrated Cyber Defense Platform. Symantec is best positioned in the cloud generation as one of the only vendors to deliver cyber defense solutions across users, information, web and messaging. In support of that effort, I'd like to discuss significant advancements delivered since closing the Blue Coat acquisition on August 1.
First, I'm particularly proud of the value we are providing our existing customers by integrating artificial intelligence with 2 of the largest threat databases in the world. This integration has improved our existing products, which are now blocking an additional 500,000 attacks per day across the endpoint and network. In a press release last week, we provided the market with insight into 2 attack campaigns that, had we not innovated in this way, may have remained hidden. The first of the campaigns is a cyber espionage group called Buckeye, which targeted Hong Kong political organizations leading up to the elections; and second, we discovered a campaign impacting approximately 100 financial institutions worldwide, stealing millions of dollars across various methods, including the SWIFT wire transfer system. These examples of detections were made possible due to the power of integrating endpoint, email and network threat telemetry.
Moving on, we just completed a major integration of DLP and CASB, which combines the gold standard in data protection with the leading-edge CASB solution provided by the Blue Coat acquisition. This integration extends DLP's advanced artificial-intelligence-based content detection to cloud applications for shadow IT analysis, granular visibility, encryption and access controls.
Further innovation on the CASB solution occurred from integrating Symantec's authentication solution. This integration allows any sensitive transaction within cloud apps to call for a second factor authentication, eliminating key loggers and password-based hacks. For example, any company that places sensitive data inside of cloud applications can easily apply strong authentication to both users and data. This offering differentiates itself in that it requires no on-premise solution. It's a pure cloud security technology enabling our customers to securely adopt cloud technology without delay from internal IT.
Finally, 2 of our largest product lines, SEP and ProxySG, have been integrated to ensure advanced malware detection is coordinated between endpoint and network. This integration nearly eliminates the dwell time between detection and containment, thus limiting damaging propagation of 0-day infections.
Now turning to the market. Part of the industrial logic of combining Symantec and Blue Coat was the immense cross-sell and upsell opportunity. Let me provide 2 customer wins during the quarter that demonstrated our teams working together to close highly competitive cross-sell transactions for meaningful outcomes.
First, a large health care company and existing Symantec DLP customer had a multi-vendor environment in the network and was in search of a partner that could help them embrace the cloud and simplify their infrastructure. The value proposition of integration between the secure gateway and DLP along with our vision for an integrated cyber defense resulted in the customer making a multi-million-dollar purchase of Symantec's network and cloud solutions.
In another example, one of the world's largest departments of education, upon realizing the strategic nature of Symantec in its goal of delivering cloud-based learning, made a sizable commitment to the integrated stack, which included Symantec's network and endpoint technologies.
Shifting back to R&D and the product side of the business, let me now discuss the organic innovation that is thriving across Symantec. Just a few days ago, we launched SEP 14, which is the most complete next-generation endpoint security solution available in the market. From a single lightweight agent, SEP 14 combines traditional and next-generation functionality such as machine learning, 0-day exploit prevention and emulation. For the first time, these next-generation capabilities are available in one scalable enterprise platform. I'm also proud to share that based on recent third-party tests, SEP provides the best security in the industry, beating competitors in blocking real-world threats and minimizing false positives.
Along with SEP 14, last quarter, we launched SEP cloud, which is a fully cloud delivered version of Symantec Endpoint Protection. We now stand as the only company with endpoint, gateway, email, DLP, CASB and encryption solutions for the cloud.
Let me switch gears to our consumer business. Our Norton solutions deliver secure Internet safety for consumers and their families as they transact and communicate across the web, whether on a desktop, laptop or mobile device. Not only do our combined threat intelligence databases improve our enterprise security products, but they also significantly improve our consumer security solutions by adding Blue Coat's best-of-breed URL dataset into the Norton threat prevention engines. During the second quarter, the traditional Consumer Security business continued to stabilize with slower declines and improving retention rates both year-over-year and sequentially. We have now fully repositioned the solution to a subscription offering and are focused on acquiring new customers while improving renewal rates and cross selling new solutions in order to maximize customer lifetime value.
Accordingly, although in its early stages, we are very pleased with the growth in mobile and the strong interest from service providers. We are extending the Norton value proposition well beyond the PC platform and look forward to some exciting product launches in the near future. We believe the market opportunity for protecting consumers is larger than what our current consumer products address today. As we move to further penetrate these opportunities, we expect the Consumer Security business to improve its growth trajectory as we move beyond the PC.
In conclusion, we are very pleased with the second quarter results. The Blue Coat integration is going very well. The fiscal responsibility and cost savings commitment remains on track. Innovation is alive and prospering at Symantec.
We acknowledge the strong results in Q2. However, we believe it is prudent to maintain our fiscal 2017 top line guidance for the year. Given the overachievement in Q2, we are raising our full year fiscal 2017 operating margin and EPS expectations accordingly. In addition, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2018 EPS guidance from $1.70 to $1.80 despite a headwind of approximately $0.10 from a higher share count.
Finally, today, we announced that Thomas Seifert has decided to step down as CFO at the end of the month. Thomas has been a tremendous asset to Symantec and an integral part of establishing our solid financial foundation. As CFO, Thomas led a number of key strategic initiatives for the company, including the acquisition of Blue Coat, the $7 billion divestiture of Veritas and the implementation of Symantec's $5.5 billion capital return program and the execution of our $400 million cost efficiency initiative.
As we prepare for this transition, we're fortunate to have such an incredible finance leader as Nick Noviello, who will succeed Thomas as Symantec's CFO. I've had the pleasure of working with Nick both at Blue Coat and while he served as -- where he served as CFO and throughout the integration process here at Symantec and have been continually impressed by his leadership. In addition to his technology background and leadership experience, Nick brings an acute understanding and appreciation for Symantec's outstanding people and the critical threat protection we provide to our customers in today's increasingly complex security landscape. I'm confident he will be an excellent CFO for Symantec during the next phase of growth.
To ensure a smooth transition, Thomas will work closely with Nick on a transfer of responsibilities, which will occur on December 1. Thomas will remain with us in an advisory role until March 2017. While Thomas' departure is bittersweet, we all congratulate him on his many successes as Symantec CFO and wish him the very best in his next chapter.
I will now turn the call over to Thomas to provide additional financial details and outlook."

It's been an honor to serve as Symantec's CFO during such a pivotal time in the company's history. I joined Symantec in order to lay the groundwork for our strategic and financial transformation, and I'm proud of the incredible progress we have made over the past 2.5 years. Symantec is now the leading pure-play cyber security company and in a strong financial position, and this is the right time for me to take on my next challenge. I'm confident Nick will be a strong CFO for the company and echo Greg's sentiment. I look forward to continuing to work with him over the next month and in an advisory role for the company until March of next year.
Before I move to our second quarter results, I want to express my gratitude for the support of our board, our executive team and of course, my finance team. I look forward to maintaining our strong momentum throughout the transition process.
Now turning to our results. Today, I will provide an overview of our second quarter results, update on our $500 million (sic) [ $550 million ] cost efficiencies and Blue Coat integration synergies and conclude with our financial outlook. Additional details are provided in our CFO commentary, which is available on our Investor Relations website.
Our second quarter non-GAAP revenue was $1,015,000,000, $25 million above the high end of our guided range of $960 million to $990 million, driven across both Consumer and Enterprise Security. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 29.2% and 520 basis points above the high end of our guided range of 21% to 24%. The upside was driven by top line leverage and faster-than-expected realization of cost savings. Fully diluted earnings per share was $0.30 and above our guidance of $0.18 to $0.21. Our fully diluted share count of 644 million was above our expectation of 640 million due to higher-than-expected dilution from our convertible debt related to the increase in the share price. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $55 million and included $45 million in cash outflows related to restructuring and separation.
Let me now provide further detail on our performance by segment.  Enterprise Security revenue, which includes 2 months contribution from Blue Coat following the closing on August 1, was $610 million and increased 24% year-over-year, which exceeded the high end of our guidance of up 14% to 20%. Enterprise Security operating margin was 12%.
Within Enterprise Security, both organic revenue performance and revenue from Blue Coat exceeded our expectations. Endpoint security grew in low single digits, and user authentication grew double digits. Cyber security services had another solid quarter growing in the high single digits. Website security continues to grow in low single digits, and for the 2-month period, Blue Coat contributed $124 million compared to our estimate of $100 million. We were pleased with the sales execution from the Symantec salesforce given the shorter-than-normal close period for Blue Coat products.
Now onto the Norton Consumer Security segment. Consumer Security revenue was down 5%, an improvement from our guidance of down 7%, and consumer operating margin was 55%.
Let me now review some additional performance metrics for the business. Our renewal metrics continue to improve as we benefit from the shift to subscription and a focus on acquiring new customers. At the end of the September quarter, we reached the international 1-year anniversary of the shift to subscription.
In regards to mobile, we are seeing good momentum with total active mobile users up 56% year-over-year. This momentum is encouraging as it takes us beyond the PC form factor. We also had over 1 million downloads of our 30-day free trial of mobile WiFi privacy app and plan to launch a multi-device version next year. However, WiFi privacy is still not material to our consumer revenue.
Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We have $5.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $7.2 billion in total debt, including $1.75 billion of convertible notes. We continue to expect to delever our balance sheet over the medium term. Our previous $1 billion ASR completed today on November 3. And lastly, we remain committed to maintaining our regular quarterly dividend.
Turning to the $550 million cost savings initiatives and the Blue Coat integration synergies. As of the end of September, on a run-rate basis, we have recognized just over $100 million of cost savings and synergies mainly across the areas of procurement and organizational effectiveness while maintaining a strong investment in our products and our R&D. For example, the procurement work stream contributed more than $65 million total run rate by optimizing our supplier network. We are on track for more than $200 million of run rate net cost efficiencies exiting fiscal year '17 and continue to expect to meet our goal of $550 million of net cost efficiencies and integration synergies by the end of fiscal year 2018.
Now I'll provide our updated financial outlook. We are encouraged by our Q2 top line results. However, as Greg indicated, we believe it's prudent to maintain our full year 2017 revenue guidance at this time. The integration of our offerings is resulting in more cross-selling of permanent license products with subscription products, resulting in increased ratable revenue recognition. 
As a result, we continue to expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be up 11% to 13% to $4,040,000,000 to $4,120,000,000. From a cost perspective, we are tracking ahead of schedule in our cost efficiency and synergy initiatives. Due to lower expenses in Q2, we now expect our fiscal 2017 operating margin to be 27% to 29%, up from 26% to 28%. 
With respect to fiscal 2017 EPS guidance, we are benefiting from the $0.10 EPS upside from second quarter. However, that increase is partially offset by changes in our full year fully diluted share count between previous guidance and our current forecast. Our prior guidance for fully diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2017 was 616 million shares, and our current guidance is now 640 million shares. The difference in fully diluted shares outstanding is partially due to an additional 9 million shares of dilution from the convertible debt due to the increase in share price to approximately $25 from $21 at the time of previous guidance. You can find tables on the Investor Relations site related to the convertible debt dilution. The remaining difference is primarily related to the timing of share repurchases across the remainder of fiscal year 2017. We continue to evaluate the method and timing of future share repurchases.  Assuming our current forecast of a fully diluted average share count of 640 million, we are increasing our EPS guidance by $0.04 to $1.12 to $1.18. 
For the fiscal third quarter, we expect our non-GAAP revenue to be up 15% to 18% in constant currency to $1,070,000,000 to $1,090,000,000. We expect enterprise security to be up 34% to 37% in constant currency to $675 million to $690 million. We expect consumer revenue to be down approximately 6% to $395 million to $400 million. And we expect an operating margin of 27% to 28%. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.27 to $0.29, with a tax rate of 29% and fully diluted average share count of just over 650 million shares. As Greg stated, for fiscal 2018, we continue to expect $1.70 to $1.80 in EPS despite a headwind of $0.10 from a higher share count. We continue to expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 30% as we enter fiscal year 2018. Thank you."

It comes from well over 100 million endpoints are in production across the consumer threat telemetry as well as in the enterprise, in addition to 15,000 [indiscernible] coming in from the Blue Coat network points. That gives us telemetry and some of the examples that I mentioned earlier in the call, it gives us telemetry into things that we believe we are unique in our ability to detect cyber problems from that. In addition to that, I'd like to point out that for cloud generation, you can get the Symantec threat platform in a pure cloud instantiation, which means if you are a company that is using a bunch of cloud applications that are out there, whether it'd be Salesforce.com, SuccessFactors, all the things we know, that you can instantiate the cyber defense for the users that are using that data and get that without even purchasing appliance or running a wire. And that's really differentiated between what you could get from the vendors you mentioned. And so we really also have spent a ton of time in making sure that we keep that platform open. Our customers do rely on best-of-breed products. And being able to integrate those into the Symantec Integrated Cyber Defense Platform is a huge competitive advantage. And so that's something we are committed to with our ISP partners as well."

Our CASB has a piece of we call content IQ, which goes out into the cloud properties in an organization that is using shadow IT and using machine learning techniques and actually detect the data that is inside of the cloud applications that may have compliance problems. We then use the data protection technology from the Symantec side to go after those problems and cure them, so that that data can be allowed to still be in the cloud, but we protect it in a way we don't have risk of compliance problems or other data loss. In addition to that, we had integrated the CASB technology with the product called VIP, which allows us to add a second factor of authentication to the cloud properties. And what that means is if you're logging in Salesforce.com and you're worried about making sure that it's Greg logging into Salesforce.com, I have a second factor application on my phone or a file that I use and plug into my computer. And then it adds that factor authentication to all those cloud applications without the organization's IT having to do anything. It's extremely powerful as a lot of the password and keylogger breaches that happen across these technologies are solved by that problem. So we've integrated those 2 things, and it's I'd just like to point out that that and the threat telemetry integration that we've been talking about, we closed the acquisition on August 1. And our engineering teams are working together extremely well. We've got some rapid delivery there and real proof points in the market."

Our -- in the last 30 days, we brought out our WiFi production for mobile users. That has seen a substantial uptake and great feedback from that. In addition to that, our mobile platforms has, as Thomas mentioned in his remarks, have been growing at strong double-digit period compares on units. We've seen the service provider market really start to produce some fantastic deployments of the mobile side of what we're doing. So those are a couple of proof points where we're executing well in the PC space. Again, we won  editors' choice for the most effective malware protection on the PC again. And the order renewals is helping the move to subscription is helping. So we feel good about maintaining our position in there and moving to markets that are off the PC. We have some exciting pure mobile endpoint growth.

Nothing is going to change there. And we had an excellent partner conference earlier this month where we recommitted to the channel. I think we have a good trusted relationship there. And then right now, we're doing the same thing in APAC and also in EMEA this week. So we feel good about our relevance to the buyers and resellers out in the world, whether it'd be in the small medium-sized business, the mid-market or in the enterprise. And we continue to be a substantial element of the economics in the channel. We are the largest pure player security vendor. And the combination between Blue Coat and Symantec really, really does make us a very meaningful part of the channel economics, I think, in the -- With our very strong middle-market story, we released a product in the last quarter which was called SEP cloud. That is extremely powerful for that sort of middle market SMB part of the world. And we feel good about that. And we think we continue to deliver market relevance the part of the market where those buyers and resellers are essential and which we think will drive up interest in continuing to do business with them and more revenue for both them and us. Moving on to your next question, which was about the IoT situation, IoT is, as we saw couple of Fridays ago when some of the DNS in the Internet stopped working and had significant knock-on effects, it's a wake-up call for the power of bringing a bunch of unmanned devices to the Internet and don't protect them properly. That creates a weapon that can be quite difficult. We're coming after that from 2 points. One, we do have some solid technology that will be coming out through our Norton brand to help protect that from the actual consumer electronic devices in the home. And we're also working hard to be able to bring some network protection to this world also and be able to use some of our behavioral analysis technologies to realize some of these things are not doing what they're supposed to be doing. So this is an area that will be a long battle between the adversaries in the industry as people weaponize IoT and consumer electronics. We believe that we are an essential technology in the fight against that. And it will take governments and consumer electronics manufacturers and security vendors to sort it out. I'd also like to point out in terms of securing IoT and being able to build secure infrastructure. We are a market leader in the tools that you need to do that with our managed PKI technology and what we do in that part of the fabric of the Symantec portfolio. So in terms of relevant vendors to come after this IoT problem, we are definitely one of them.

And I think this is something that we work on a lot because we have a strategy that we believe can turn it around and return it to growth. And that strategy is really anchored in moving the value proposition that we have from PC malware to a larger superset of PC malware, which is really Internet safety. The consumer's really interested in safety while using the Internet safety for the family, a piece of which is the malware on the endpoint. So we're going after all endpoints, whether it'd be [indiscernible] endpoints, mobile, telephone devices, tablets and PCs. And we're also going after other value propositions that a consumer, when they're using the Internet, considers necessary. And we have some announcements coming out on that soon. I won't announce them on this call, but we are definitely working hard on PxQ [ph] based on real market data that can turn that business around and return it to growth. There are elements there of the PC declines which are kind of a natural force that's happening in the industry.

We were pleased with our performance during the second quarter as the results exceeded our guidance across all metrics. Our cost savings and synergy initiatives are tracking ahead of schedule. Within the first 10 weeks of c",1418,"Thank you for joining us today. We were pleased with our performance during the second quarter as the results exceeded our guidance across all metrics. Our cost savings and synergy initiatives are tracking ahead of schedule. Within the first 10 weeks of closing Blue Coat, we've made multiple meaningful product improvements and integrations. The feedback on our product road map from customers, partners and third-party influencers has been overwhelmingly positive. Product integrations are already having a significant impact on our ability to better protect customers and further validates the rationale and power of our combination.
In my prepared remarks today, I will review some of the key product integrations, highlight the exciting innovation underway within Symantec, discuss some market validation in our enterprise segment and review our Consumer Security business.
Protecting customers in the cloud generation against a multi-faceted adversary requires an Integrated Cyber Defense Platform. Symantec is best positioned in the cloud generation as one of the only vendors to deliver cyber defense solutions across users, information, web and messaging. In support of that effort, I'd like to discuss significant advancements delivered since closing the Blue Coat acquisition on August 1.
First, I'm particularly proud of the value we are providing our existing customers by integrating artificial intelligence with 2 of the largest threat databases in the world. This integration has improved our existing products, which are now blocking an additional 500,000 attacks per day across the endpoint and network. In a press release last week, we provided the market with insight into 2 attack campaigns that, had we not innovated in this way, may have remained hidden. The first of the campaigns is a cyber-espionage group called Buckeye, which targeted Hong Kong political organizations leading up to the elections; and second, we discovered a campaign impacting approximately 100 financial institutions worldwide, stealing millions of dollars across various methods, including the SWIFT wire transfer system. These examples of detections were made possible due to the power of integrating endpoint, email and network threat telemetry.
Moving on, we just completed a major integration of DLP and CASB, which combines the gold standard in data protection with the leading-edge CASB solution provided by the Blue Coat acquisition. This integration extends DLP's advanced artificial-intelligence-based content detection to cloud applications for shadow IT analysis, granular visibility, encryption and access controls.
Further innovation on the CASB solution occurred from integrating Symantec's authentication solution. This integration allows any sensitive transaction within cloud apps to call for a second factor authentication, eliminating key loggers and password-based hacks. For example, any company that places sensitive data inside of cloud applications can easily apply strong authentication to both users and data. This offering differentiates itself in that it requires no on-premise solution. It's a pure cloud security technology enabling our customers to securely adopt cloud technology without delay from internal IT.
Finally, 2 of our largest product lines, SEP and ProxySG, have been integrated to ensure advanced malware detection is coordinated between endpoint and network. This integration nearly eliminates the dwell time between detection and containment, thus limiting damaging propagation of 0-day infections.
Now turning to the market. Part of the industrial logic of combining Symantec and Blue Coat was the immense cross-sell and upsell opportunity. Let me provide 2 customer wins during the quarter that demonstrated our teams working together to close highly competitive cross-sell transactions for meaningful outcomes.
First, a large health care company and existing Symantec DLP customer had a multi-vendor environment in the network and was in search of a partner that could help them embrace the cloud and simplify their infrastructure. The value proposition of integration between the secure gateway and DLP along with our vision for an integrated cyber defense resulted in the customer making a multi-million-dollar purchase of Symantec's network and cloud solutions.
In another example, one of the world's largest departments of education, upon realizing the strategic nature of Symantec in its goal of delivering cloud-based learning, made a sizable commitment to the integrated stack, which included Symantec's network and endpoint technologies.
Shifting back to R&D and the product side of the business, let me now discuss the organic innovation that is thriving across Symantec. Just a few days ago, we launched SEP 14, which is the most complete next-generation endpoint security solution available in the market. From a single lightweight agent, SEP 14 combines traditional and next-generation functionality such as machine learning, 0-day exploit prevention and emulation. For the first time, these next-generation capabilities are available in one scalable enterprise platform. I'm also proud to share that based on recent third-party tests, SEP provides the best security in the industry, beating competitors in blocking real-world threats and minimizing false positives.
Along with SEP 14, last quarter, we launched SEP cloud, which is a fully cloud delivered version of Symantec Endpoint Protection. We now stand as the only company with endpoint, gateway, email, DLP, CASB and encryption solutions for the cloud.
Let me switch gears to our consumer business. Our Norton solutions deliver secure Internet safety for consumers and their families as they transact and communicate across the web, whether on a desktop, laptop or mobile device. Not only do our combined threat intelligence databases improve our enterprise security products, but they also significantly improve our consumer security solutions by adding Blue Coat's best-of-breed URL dataset into the Norton threat prevention engines. During the second quarter, the traditional Consumer Security business continued to stabilize with slower declines and improving retention rates both year-over-year and sequentially. We have now fully repositioned the solution to a subscription offering and are focused on acquiring new customers while improving renewal rates and cross selling new solutions in order to maximize customer lifetime value.
Accordingly, although in its early stages, we are very pleased with the growth in mobile and the strong interest from service providers. We are extending the Norton value proposition well beyond the PC platform and look forward to some exciting product launches in the near future. We believe the market opportunity for protecting consumers is larger than what our current consumer products address today. As we move to further penetrate these opportunities, we expect the Consumer Security business to improve its growth trajectory as we move beyond the PC.
In conclusion, we are very pleased with the second quarter results. The Blue Coat integration is going very well. The fiscal responsibility and cost savings commitment remains on track. Innovation is alive and prospering at Symantec.
We acknowledge the strong results in Q2. However, we believe it is prudent to maintain our fiscal 2017 top line guidance for the year. Given the overachievement in Q2, we are raising our full year fiscal 2017 operating margin and EPS expectations accordingly. In addition, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2018 EPS guidance from $1.70 to $1.80 despite a headwind of approximately $0.10 from a higher share count.
Finally, today, we announced that Thomas Seifert has decided to step down as CFO at the end of the month. Thomas has been a tremendous asset to Symantec and an integral part of establishing our solid financial foundation. As CFO, Thomas led a number of key strategic initiatives for the company, including the acquisition of Blue Coat, the $7 billion divestiture of Veritas and the implementation of Symantec's $5.5 billion capital return program and the execution of our $400 million cost efficiency initiative.
As we prepare for this transition, we're fortunate to have such an incredible finance leader as Nick Noviello, who will succeed Thomas as Symantec's CFO. I've had the pleasure of working with Nick both at Blue Coat and while he served as -- where he served as CFO and throughout the integration process here at Symantec and have been continually impressed by his leadership. In addition to his technology background and leadership experience, Nick brings an acute understanding and appreciation for Symantec's outstanding people and the critical threat protection we provide to our customers in today's increasingly complex security landscape. I'm confident he will be an excellent CFO for Symantec during the next phase of growth.
To ensure a smooth transition, Thomas will work closely with Nick on a transfer of responsibilities, which will occur on December 1. Thomas will remain with us in an advisory role until March 2017. While Thomas' departure is bittersweet, we all congratulate him on his many successes as Symantec CFO and wish him the very best in his next chapter.
I will now turn the call over to Thomas to provide additional financial details and outlook."

It's been an honor to serve as Symantec's CFO during such a pivotal time in the company's history. I joined Symantec in order to lay the groundwork for our strategic and financial transformation, and I'm proud of the incredible progress we have made over the past 2.5 years. Symantec is now the leading pure-play cyber security company and in a strong financial position, and this is the right time for me to take on my next challenge. I'm confident Nick will be a strong CFO for the company and echo Greg's sentiment. I look forward to continuing to work with him over the next month and in an advisory role for the company until March of next year.
Before I move to our second quarter results, I want to express my gratitude for the support of our board, our executive team and of course, my finance team. I look forward to maintaining our strong momentum throughout the transition process.
Now turning to our results. Today, I will provide an overview of our second quarter results, update on our $500 million (sic) [ $550 million ] cost efficiencies and Blue Coat integration synergies and conclude with our financial outlook. Additional details are provided in our CFO commentary, which is available on our Investor Relations website.
Our second quarter non-GAAP revenue was $1,015,000,000, $25 million above the high end of our guided range of $960 million to $990 million, driven across both Consumer and Enterprise Security. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 29.2% and 520 basis points above the high end of our guided range of 21% to 24%. The upside was driven by top line leverage and faster-than-expected realization of cost savings. Fully diluted earnings per share was $0.30 and above our guidance of $0.18 to $0.21. Our fully diluted share count of 644 million was above our expectation of 640 million due to higher-than-expected dilution from our convertible debt related to the increase in the share price. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $55 million and included $45 million in cash outflows related to restructuring and separation.
Let me now provide further detail on our performance by segment.  Enterprise Security revenue, which includes 2 months contribution from Blue Coat following the closing on August 1, was $610 million and increased 24% year-over-year, which exceeded the high end of our guidance of up 14% to 20%. Enterprise Security operating margin was 12%.
Within Enterprise Security, both organic revenue performance and revenue from Blue Coat exceeded our expectations. Endpoint security grew in low single digits, and user authentication grew double digits. Cyber security services had another solid quarter growing in the high single digits. Website security continues to grow in low single digits, and for the 2-month period, Blue Coat contributed $124 million compared to our estimate of $100 million. We were pleased with the sales execution from the Symantec salesforce given the shorter-than-normal close period for Blue Coat products.
Now onto the Norton Consumer Security segment. Consumer Security revenue was down 5%, an improvement from our guidance of down 7%, and consumer operating margin was 55%.
Let me now review some additional performance metrics for the business. Our renewal metrics continue to improve as we benefit from the shift to subscription and a focus on acquiring new customers. At the end of the September quarter, we reached the international 1-year anniversary of the shift to subscription.
In regards to mobile, we are seeing good momentum with total active mobile users up 56% year-over-year. This momentum is encouraging as it takes us beyond the PC form factor. We also had over 1 million downloads of our 30-day free trial of mobile WiFi privacy app and plan to launch a multi-device version next year. However, WiFi privacy is still not material to our consumer revenue.
Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We have $5.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $7.2 billion in total debt, including $1.75 billion of convertible notes. We continue to expect to delever our balance sheet over the medium term. Our previous $1 billion ASR completed today on November 3. And lastly, we remain committed to maintaining our regular quarterly dividend.
Turning to the $550 million cost savings initiatives and the Blue Coat integration synergies. As of the end of September, on a run rate basis, we have recognized just over $100 million of cost savings and synergies mainly across the areas of procurement and organizational effectiveness while maintaining a strong investment in our products and our R&D. For example, the procurement work stream contributed more than $65 million total run rate by optimizing our supplier network. We are on track for more than $200 million of run rate net cost efficiencies exiting fiscal year '17 and continue to expect to meet our goal of $550 million of net cost efficiencies and integration synergies by the end of fiscal year 2018.
Now I'll provide our updated financial outlook. We are encouraged by our Q2 top line results. However, as Greg indicated, we believe it's prudent to maintain our full year 2017 revenue guidance at this time. The integration of our offerings is resulting in more cross selling of permanent license products with subscription products, resulting in increased ratable revenue recognition.
As a result, we continue to expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be up 11% to 13% to $4,040,000,000 to $4,120,000,000. From a cost perspective, we are tracking ahead of schedule on our cost efficiency and synergy initiatives. Due to lower expenses in Q2, we now expect our fiscal 2017 operating margin to be 27% to 29%, up from 26% to 28%.
With respect to fiscal 2017 EPS guidance, we are benefiting from the $0.10 EPS upside from second quarter. However, that increase is partially offset by changes in our full year fully diluted share count between previous guidance and our current forecast. Our prior guidance for fully diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2017 was 616 million shares, and our current guidance is now 640 million shares. The difference in fully diluted shares outstanding is partially due to an additional 9 million shares of dilution from the convertible debt due to the increase in share price to approximately $25 from $21 at the time of previous guidance. You can find tables on the Investor Relations site related to the convertible debt dilution. The remaining difference is primarily related to the timing of share repurchases across the remainder of fiscal year 2017. We continue to evaluate the method and timing of future share repurchases.  Assuming our current forecast of a fully diluted average share count of 640 million, we are increasing our EPS guidance by $0.04 to $1.12 to $1.18.
For the fiscal third quarter, we expect our non-GAAP revenue to be up 15% to 18% in constant currency to $1,070,000,000 to $1,090,000,000. We expect enterprise security to be up 34% to 37% in constant currency to $675 million to $690 million. We expect consumer revenue to be down approximately 6% to $395 million to $400 million, and we expect an operating margin of 27% to 28%. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.27 to $0.29 with a tax rate of 29% and fully diluted average share count of just over 650 million shares.
As Greg stated, for fiscal 2018, we continue to expect $1.70 to $1.80 in EPS despite a headwind of $0.10 from a higher share count. We continue to expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 30% as we enter fiscal year 2018. Thank you."

One is that the threat telemetry that's sitting behind the Symantec threat platform is gargantuan. It comes from well over 100 million endpoints that are in production across the consumer threat telemetry as well as in the enterprise in addition to 15,000 Internet integrations [ph] coming in from the Blue Coat network points. That gives us telemetry and some of the examples that I mentioned earlier in the call. It gives us telemetry into things that we believe we are unique in our ability to detect cyber problems from that. In addition to that, I'd like to point out that for cloud generation, you can get the Symantec threat platform in a pure cloud instantiation, which means if you are a company that is using a bunch of cloud applications that are out there, whether it'd be Salesforce.com, SuccessFactors, all the things we know, that you can instantiate the cyber defense for the users that are using that, the data that's in it and get that without even purchasing appliance or running a wire. And that's really differentiated between what you could get from the vendors that you mentioned. And so we really also have spent a ton of time in making sure that we keep our platform open. Our customers do rely on best-of-breed products, and being able to integrate those into the Symantec Integrated Cyber Defense Platform is a huge competitive advantage. And so that's something we're committed to with our ISP partners as well."

That's a good question. Our CASB has a piece that we call content IQ, which goes out into the cloud properties that an organization is using in shadow IT and using machine learning techniques and actually detect the data that is inside of the cloud applications that may have compliance problems. We then use the data protection technology from the Symantec side to go after those problems and cure them so that, that data can be allowed to still be in the cloud, but we protect it in a way we don't have risk of compliance problems or other data loss. In addition to that, we have integrated the CASB technology with the product called VIP, which allows us to add a second factor of authentication to the cloud properties. And what that means is, if you're logging in Salesforce.com and you're worried about making sure that it's Greg logging into Salesforce.com, I have a second factor application on my phone or like a fob that I use and plugged into my computer. And then it adds that factor authentication to all of those cloud applications without the organization's IT having to do anything. It's extremely powerful as a lot of the password and key logger breaches that happen across these technologies are solved by that problem. So we've integrated those 2 things, and it's -- I'd just like to point out that, that and the threat telemetry integration that we've been talking about, we closed the acquisition on August 1. And our engineering teams are working together extremely well. We've got some rapid delivery there and real proof points in the market."

So we have definitely delivered all of the defenses that work on 0-day attacks and signature-less things, the machine learning behavior analysis reputational detection technologies. So we believe that we have now leapfrogged the current advanced endpoint competition, and one of the major advantages of ours is ours has a very low false positive rate in the space. And it is -- think of it as converged endpoint that includes all of the stuff that you need from traditional endpoints with the next-generation capabilities. And we really have dramatically reduced the footprint size, bandwidth usage. And we're very optimistic. Feedback on the initial use of SEP 14 is extremely positive.

Our -- in the last 30 days, we brought out our WiFi protection for mobile users. That has seen a substantial uptake and great feedback from that. In addition to that, our mobile platforms, as Thomas mentioned in his remarks, have been growing at strong double-digit period compares on units. We've seen the service provider market really start to produce some fantastic deployments of the mobile side of what we're doing. So those are a couple of proof points where we're executing well in the PC space. Again, we won the editor's choice for the most effective malware protection on the PC again. And the auto renewals is helping. The move to subscription is helping. So we feel good about maintaining our position in there and then moving to markets that are off the PC.

We are very focused on maintaining a strong relationship with the channel. I think myself and Mike Fey have great reputations as taking care of what is a very large extended sales force we have around the world at the Tier 2 VAR and also in the excellent Tier 1 value-added distributors that we use. Nothing is going to change there. And we had an excellent partner conference earlier this month, where we recommitted to the channel. I think we have a good, trusted relationship there, and then right now we're doing the same thing in APAC and also in EMEA this week. So we feel good about our relevance to the VARs and resellers out in the world, whether it'd be in the small-, medium-sized business, the mid-market or in the enterprise. And we continue to be a substantial element of the economics in the channel. We are the largest pure-play security vendor, and the combination between Blue Coat and Symantec really, really does make us a very meaningful part of the channel economics, I think, in the -- with our very strong middle-market story. We released a product in the last quarter, which was called SEP cloud. That is extremely powerful for that sort of middle-market SMB part of the world, and we feel good about that. And we think we continue to deliver market relevance to the part of the market where those VARs and resellers are essential and which we think will drive up interest in continuing to do business with them and more revenue for both them and us. Moving on to your next question, which was about the IoT situation. IoT is, as we saw a couple of Fridays ago when some of the DNS in the Internet stopped working and had significant knock-on effects, it's a wake-up call for the power of -- we bring a bunch of unmanned devices to the Internet and don't protect them properly. That creates a weapon that can be quite difficult. We are coming after that from 2 points: One, we do have some solid technology that will be coming out through our Norton brand to help protect that from the actual consumer electronic devices in the home; and we're also working hard to be able to bring some network protection to this world also and be able to use some of our behavioral analysis technologies to realize some of these things are not doing what they're supposed to be doing. So this is an area that will be a long battle between the adversaries in the industry as people weaponize IoT and consumer electronics. We believe we are an essential technology in the fight against that, and it will take governments and consumer electronics manufacturers and security vendors to sort it out. I'd also like to point out, in terms of securing IoT and being able to build secure infrastructure, we are a market leader in the tools that you need to do that with our Managed PKI, our code signing technologies and what we do in that part of the fabric of the Symantec portfolio. So in terms of relevant vendors to come after this IoT problem, we are definitely one of them. And we think that, that will lead to tailwinds for us as that becomes more of essential and potentially even policy mandates from governments about it. So good question, big problem, and we're definitely working on it."

Can we just sort of get a refresh on this, how you think about this strategically? On one hand, this is a really high-margin business, but on the other hand, we've seen this continual revenue decline for some time here. Is this something where you're going to focus on? I know you talked a little bit about trying to turn that business in some way. But is there a -- if you do that, are you going to -- is it going to have a material effect on profitability if you really start to invest there?"

So it's a really good question, John, and I think this is something that we work on a lot because we have a strategy that we believe can turn it around and return it to growth. And that strategy is really anchored in moving the value proposition that we have from PC malware to a larger superset of PC malware, which is really Internet safety. The consumer's really interested in safety while using the Internet safety for the family, a piece of which is the malware on the endpoint. So we're going after all endpoints, whether it'd be Apple endpoints, mobile, telephone devices, tablets and PCs, and we're also going after other value propositions that a consumer, when they're using the Internet, considers necessary. And we have some announcements coming out on that soon. I won't announce them on this call, but we are definitely working hard on real P times Q based on real market data that can turn that business around and return it to growth. There are elements that are off the PC declines, which are kind of a natural force that's happening in the industry. So everybody who wants to mark us down because consumer's going to melt, we're working really hard to make sure that we turn that around so it doesn't melt and that we can -- we have very strong brand recognition in Norton. People trust us, and we think we can deliver substantial value to the consumer through that brand, the things that are adjacencies to the PC malware decision. So hang on. that's going to get better. Our guidance is conservative. John, our guidance is conservative on the consumer guide, okay?"

We were pleased with our performance during the second quarter as the results exceeded our guidance across all metrics. Our cost savings and synergy initiatives are tracking ahead of schedule. Within the first 10 weeks of c",1416,"Thank you for joining us today. We were pleased with our performance during the second quarter as the results exceeded our guidance across all metrics. Our cost savings and synergy initiatives are tracking ahead of schedule. Within the first 10 weeks of closing Blue Coat, we've made multiple meaningful product improvements and integrations. The feedback on our product road map from customers, partners and third-party influencers has been overwhelmingly positive. Product integrations are already having a significant impact on our ability to better protect customers and further validates the rationale and power of our combination.
In my prepared remarks today, I will review some of the key product integrations, highlight the exciting innovation underway within Symantec, discuss some market validation in our enterprise segment and review our Consumer Security business.
Protecting customers in the cloud generation against a multi-faceted adversary requires an integrated cyber defense platform. Symantec is best positioned in the cloud generation as one of the only vendors to deliver cyber defense solutions across users, information, web and messaging. In support of that effort, I'd like to discuss significant advancements delivered since closing the Blue Coat acquisition on August 1.
First, I'm particularly proud of the value we are providing our existing customers by integrating artificial intelligence with 2 of the largest threat databases in the world. This integration has improved our existing products, which are now blocking an additional 500,000 attacks per day across the endpoint and network. 
In a press release last week, we provided the market with insight into 2 attack campaigns that had we not innovated in this way, may have remained hidden. The first of the campaigns is a cyber-espionage group called Buckeye, which targeted Hong Kong political organizations leading up to the elections; and second, we discovered a campaign impacting approximately 100 financial institutions worldwide, stealing millions of dollars across various methods, including the SWIFT wire transfer system. These examples of detections were made possible due to the power of integrating endpoint, email and network threat telemetry.
Moving on, we just completed a major integration of DLP and CASB, which combines the gold standard in data protection with the leading-edge CASB solution provided by the Blue Coat acquisition. This integration extends DLP's advanced artificial intelligence-based content detection to cloud applications for shadow IT analysis, granular visibility, encryption and access controls.
Further innovation on the CASB solution occurred from integrating Symantec's authentication solution. This integration allows any sensitive transaction within cloud apps to call for a second factor authentication, eliminating key loggers and password-based hacks. For example, any company that places sensitive data inside of cloud applications can easily apply strong authentication to both users and data. This offering differentiates itself in that it requires no on-premise solution. It's a pure cloud security technology enabling our customers to securely adopt cloud technology without delay from internal IT.
Finally, 2 of our largest product lines, SEP and ProxySG, have been integrated to ensure advanced malware detection is coordinated between endpoint and network. This integration nearly eliminates the dwell time between detection and containment, thus limiting damaging propagation of 0-day infections.
Now turning to the market. Part of the industrial logic of combining Symantec and Blue Coat was the immense cross-sell and upsell opportunity. Let me provide 2 customer wins during the quarter that demonstrated our teams working together to close highly competitive cross-sell transactions for meaningful outcomes.
First, a large health care company and existing Symantec DLP customer had a multi-vendor environment in the network and was in search of a partner that could help them embrace the cloud and simplify their infrastructure. The value proposition of integration between the secure web gateway and DLP, along with our vision for an integrated cyber defense, resulted in the customer making a multimillion-dollar purchase of Symantec's network and cloud solutions.
In another example, one of the world's largest departments of education, upon realizing the strategic nature of Symantec in its goal of delivering cloud-based learning, made a sizable commitment to the integrated stack, which included Symantec's network and endpoint technologies.
Shifting back to R&D and the product side of the business, let me now discuss the organic innovation that is thriving across Symantec. Just a few days ago, we launched SEP 14, which is the most complete next-generation endpoint security solution available in the market. From a single lightweight agent, SEP 14 combines traditional and next-generation functionality such as machine learning, 0-day exploit prevention and emulation. For the first time, these next-generation capabilities are available in one scalable enterprise platform. I'm also proud to share that based on recent third-party tests, SEP provides the best security in the industry, beating competitors in blocking real-world threats and minimizing false positives.
Along with SEP 14, last quarter, we launched SEP cloud, which is a fully cloud-delivered version of Symantec Endpoint Protection. We now stand as the only company with endpoint, gateway, email, DLP, CASB and encryption solutions for the cloud.
Let me switch gears to our consumer business. Our Norton solutions deliver secure Internet safety for consumers and their families as they transact and communicate across the web, whether on a desktop, laptop or mobile device. Not only do our combined threat intelligence databases improve our enterprise security products, but they also significantly improve our consumer security solutions by adding Blue Coat's best-of-breed URL dataset into the Norton threat prevention engines. During the second quarter, the traditional Consumer Security business continued to stabilize with slower declines and improving retention rates both year-over-year and sequentially. We have now fully repositioned the solution to a subscription offering and are focused on acquiring new customers while improving renewal rates and cross selling new solutions in order to maximize customer lifetime value.
Accordingly, although in its early stages, we are very pleased with the growth in mobile and the strong interest from service providers. We are extending the Norton value proposition well beyond the PC platform and look forward to some exciting product launches in the near future. We believe the market opportunity for protecting consumers is larger than what our current consumer products address today. As we move to further penetrate these opportunities, we expect the Consumer Security business to improve its growth trajectory as we move beyond the PC.
In conclusion, we are very pleased with the second quarter results. The Blue Coat integration is going very well. The fiscal responsibility and cost-savings commitment remains on track. Innovation is alive and prospering at Symantec.
We acknowledge the strong results in Q2. However, we believe it is prudent to maintain our fiscal 2017 top line guidance for the year. Given the overachievement in Q2, we are raising our full year fiscal 2017 operating margin and EPS expectations accordingly. In addition, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2018 EPS guidance from $1.70 to $1.80 despite a headwind of approximately $0.10 from a higher share count.
Finally, today, we announced that Thomas Seifert has decided to step down as CFO at the end of the month. Thomas has been a tremendous asset to Symantec and an integral part of establishing our solid financial foundation. As CFO, Thomas led a number of key strategic initiatives for the company, including the acquisition of Blue Coat, the $7 billion divestiture of Veritas and the implementation of Symantec's $5.5 billion capital return program and the execution of our $400 million cost-efficiency initiative.
As we prepare for this transition, we're fortunate to have such an incredible finance leader as Nick Noviello, who will succeed Thomas as Symantec's CFO. I've had the pleasure of working with Nick both at Blue Coat and while he served as -- where he served as CFO and throughout the integration process here at Symantec and have been continually impressed by his leadership. In addition to his technology background and leadership experience, Nick brings an acute understanding and appreciation for Symantec's outstanding people and the critical threat protection we provide to our customers in today's increasingly complex security landscape. I'm confident he'll be an excellent CFO for Symantec during the next phase of growth.
To ensure a smooth transition, Thomas will work closely with Nick on the transfer of responsibilities, which will occur on December 1. Thomas will remain with us in an advisory role until March 2017. While Thomas' departure is bittersweet, we all congratulate him on his many successes as Symantec CFO and wish him the very best in his next chapter.
I will now turn the call over to Thomas to provide additional financial details and outlook."

It's been an honor to serve as Symantec's CFO during such a pivotal time in the company's history. I joined Symantec in order to lay the groundwork for our strategic and financial transformation, and I'm proud of the incredible progress we have made over the past 2.5 years. 
Symantec is now the leading pure-play cyber security company and in a strong financial position, and this is the right time for me to take on my next challenge. I'm confident Nick will be a strong CFO for the company and echo Greg's sentiment. I look forward to continuing to work with him over the next month and in an advisory role for the company until March of next year.
Before I move to our second quarter results, I want to express my gratitude for the support of our board, our executive team and, of course, my finance team. I look forward to maintaining our strong momentum throughout the transition process.
Now turning to our results. Today, I will provide an overview of our second quarter results, update on our $500 million (sic) [$550 million] cost efficiencies and Blue Coat integration synergies and conclude with our financial outlook. Additional details are provided in our CFO commentary, which is available on our Investor Relations website.
Our second quarter non-GAAP revenue was $1,015,000,000, $25 million above the high end of our guided range of $960 million to $990 million, driven across both Consumer and Enterprise Security. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 29.2% and 520 basis points above the high end of our guided range of 21% to 24%. The upside was driven by top line leverage and faster-than-expected realization of cost savings. 
Fully diluted earnings per share was $0.30 and above our guidance of $0.18 to $0.21. Our fully diluted share count of 644 million was above our expectation of 640 million due to higher-than-expected dilution from our convertible debt related to the increase in the share price. 
Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $55 million and included $45 million in cash outflows related to restructuring and separation.
Let me now provide further detail on our performance by segment.  Enterprise Security revenue, which includes 2 months contribution from Blue Coat following the closing on August 1, was $610 million and increased 24% year-over-year, which exceeded the high end of our guidance of up 14% to 20%. Enterprise Security operating margin was 12%.
Within Enterprise Security, both organic revenue performance and revenue from Blue Coat exceeded our expectations. Endpoint security grew in low single digits, and user authentication grew double digits. Cyber security services had another solid quarter growing in the high single digits. Website security continues to grow in low single digits, and for the 2-month period, Blue Coat contributed $124 million compared to our estimate of $100 million. We were pleased with the sales execution from the Symantec sales force given the shorter-than-normal close period for Blue Coat products.
Now onto the Norton Consumer Security segment. Consumer Security revenue was down 5%, an improvement from our guidance of down 7%, and consumer operating margin was 55%.
Let me now review some additional performance metrics for the business. Our renewal metrics continue to improve as we benefit from the shift to subscription and a focus on acquiring new customers. At the end of the September quarter, we reached the international 1-year anniversary of the shift to subscription.
In regards to mobile, we are seeing good momentum, with total active mobile users up 56% year-over-year. This momentum is encouraging as it takes us beyond the PC form factor. We also had over 1 million downloads of our 30-day free trial of mobile WiFi privacy app and plan to launch a multi-device version next year. However, WiFi privacy is still not material to our consumer revenue.
Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We have $5.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $7.2 billion in total debt, including $1.75 billion of convertible notes. We continue to expect to delever our balance sheet over the medium term. Our previous $1 billion ASR completed today on November 3. And lastly, we remain committed to maintaining our regular quarterly dividend.
Turning to the $550 million cost-savings initiatives and the Blue Coat integration synergies. As of the end of September, on a run rate basis, we have recognized just over $100 million of cost savings and synergies mainly across the areas of procurement and organizational effectiveness, while maintaining a strong investment in our products and our R&D. For example, the procurement work stream contributed more than $65 million total run rate by optimizing our supplier network. We are on track for more than $200 million of run rate net cost efficiencies exiting fiscal year '17 and continue to expect to meet our goal of $550 million of net cost efficiencies and integration synergies by the end of fiscal year 2018.
Now I will provide our updated financial outlook. We are encouraged by our Q2 top line results. However, as Greg indicated, we believe it's prudent to maintain our full year 2017 revenue guidance at this time. The integration of our offerings is resulting in more cross selling of permanent license products with subscription products, resulting in increased ratable revenue recognition.
As a result, we continue to expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be up 11% to 13% to $4,040,000,000 to $4,120,000,000. From a cost perspective, we are tracking ahead of schedule on our cost efficiency and synergy initiatives. Due to lower expenses in Q2, we now expect our fiscal 2017 operating margin to be 27% to 29%, up from 26% to 28%.
With respect to fiscal 2017 EPS guidance, we are benefiting from the $0.10 EPS upside from second quarter. However, that increase is partially offset by changes in our full year fully diluted share count between previous guidance and our current forecast. Our prior guidance for fully diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2017 was 616 million shares, and our current guidance is now 640 million shares. The difference in fully diluted shares outstanding is partially due to an additional 9 million shares of dilution from the convertible debt due to the increase in share price to approximately $25 from $21 at the time of previous guidance. You can find tables on the Investor Relations site related to the convertible debt dilution. The remaining difference is primarily related to the timing of share repurchases across the remainder of fiscal year 2017. We continue to evaluate the method and timing of future share repurchases.  Assuming our current forecast of a fully diluted average share count of 640 million, we are increasing our EPS guidance by $0.04 to $1.12 to $1.18.
For the fiscal third quarter, we expect our non-GAAP revenue to be up 15% to 18% in constant currency to $1,070,000,000 to $1,090,000,000. We expect enterprise security to be up 34% to 37% in constant currency to $675 million to $690 million. We expect consumer revenue to be down approximately 6% to $395 million to $400 million, and we expect an operating margin of 27% to 28%. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.27 to $0.29, with a tax rate of 29% and fully diluted average share count of just over 650 million shares.
As Greg stated, for fiscal 2018, we continue to expect $1.70 to $1.80 in EPS, despite a headwind of $0.10 from a higher share count. We continue to expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 30% as we enter fiscal year 2018. 
Thank you."

One is that the threat telemetry that's sitting behind the Symantec threat platform is gargantuan. It comes from well over 100 million endpoints that are in production across the consumer threat telemetry as well as in the enterprise in addition to 15,000 Internet egressers coming in from the Blue Coat network points. That gives us telemetry and some of the examples that I mentioned earlier in the call. It gives us telemetry into things that we believe we are unique in our ability to detect cyber problems from that. In addition to that, I'd like to point out that for cloud generation, you can get the Symantec threat platform in a pure cloud instantiation, which means if you are a company that is using a bunch of cloud applications that are out there, whether it'd be Salesforce.com, SuccessFactors, all the things we know, that you can instantiate the cyber defense for the users that are using that, the data that's in it and get that without even purchasing appliance or running a wire. And that's really differentiated between what you could get from the vendors that you mentioned. And so we really also have spent a ton of time in making sure that we keep that platform open. Our customers do rely on best-of-breed products, and being able to integrate those into the Symantec Integrated Cyber Defense Platform is a huge competitive advantage. And so that's something we're committed to with our ISV partners as well."

Our CASB has a piece of it called content IQ, which goes out into the cloud properties at an organization that's using in shadow IT. And using machine learning techniques, you can actually detect the data that is inside of the cloud applications that may have compliance problems. We then use the data protection technology from the Symantec side to go after those problems and cure them so that, that data can be allowed to still be in the cloud, but we protect it in a way where you don't have risk of compliance problems or other data loss. In addition to that, we have integrated the CASB technology with the product called VIP, which allows us to add a second factor of authentication to the cloud properties. And what that means is, if you're logging into Salesforce.com and you're worried about making sure that it's Greg logging into Salesforce.com, I have a second factor application on my phone or like a fob that I use and plugged into my computer. And then it adds that factor authentication to all of those cloud applications without the organization's IT having to do anything. It's extremely powerful as a lot of the password and key logger breaches that happen across these technologies are solved by that problem. So we've integrated those 2 things, and it's -- I'd just like to point out that, that and the threat telemetry integration that we've been talking about, we closed the acquisition on August 1 and our engineering teams are working together extremely well. We've got some rapid delivery there and real proof points in the market."

So we have definitely delivered all of the defenses that work on 0-day attacks and signature-less things, the machine learning behavior analysis reputational detection technologies. So we believe that we have now leapfrogged the current advanced endpoint competition, and one of the major advantages of ours is ours has a very low false positive rate in the space. And it is -- think of it as converged endpoint that includes all of the stuff that you need from traditional endpoints with the next-generation capabilities. And we really have dramatically reduced the footprint size, bandwidth usage. And we're very optimistic. Feedback on the initial use of SEP 14 is extremely positive.

Our -- in the last 30 days, we brought out our WiFi protection for mobile users. That has seen a substantial uptake and great feedback from that. In addition to that, our mobile platforms, as Thomas mentioned in his remarks, have been growing at strong double-digit period compares on units. We've seen the service provider market really start to produce some fantastic deployments of the mobile side of what we're doing. So those are a couple of proof points where we're executing well in the PC space. Again, we won the Editors' Choice for the most effective malware protection on the PC again. And the auto renewals is helping. The move to subscription is helping. So we feel good about maintaining our position in there and then moving to markets that are off the PC. We have some exciting pure mobile endpoint growth, and also, we have some things that we'll be launching in the future that will continue to move us into addressable markets that are off the PC value proposition. So we feel good about our future prospects in the consumer side and the value that we're bringing. As many of us are aware, there is plenty of malware on mobile, and there's plenty of malware on Apple platforms. And so we feel good about the future of our consumer business."

Yes, we are very focused on maintaining a strong relationship with the channel. I think myself and Mike Fey have great reputations as taking care of what is a very large extended sales force we have around the world at the Tier 2 VAR and also in the excellent Tier 1 value-added distributors that we use. Nothing is going to change there. And we had an excellent partner conference earlier this month, where we recommitted to the channel. I think we have a good, trusted relationship there, and then right now, we're doing the same thing in APAC and also in EMEA this week. So we feel good about our relevance to the VARs and resellers out in the world, whether it be in the small-, medium-sized business, the mid-market or in the enterprise. And we continue to be a substantial element of the economics in the channel. We are the largest pure-play security vendor, and the combination between Blue Coat and Symantec really, really does make us a very meaningful part of the channel economics and I think in the -- with our very strong middle-market story. We released a product in the last quarter, which was called SEP cloud. That is extremely powerful for that sort of middle-market SMB part of the world, and we feel good about that. And we think we continue to deliver market relevance to the part of the market where those VARs and resellers are essential and which we think will drive up interest in continuing to do business with them and more revenue for both them and us. Moving on to your next question, which was about the IoT situation. IoT is a -- as we saw a couple of Fridays ago when some of the DNS in the Internet stopped working and had significant knock-on effects, it's a wake-up call for the power of when you bring a bunch of unmanned devices to the Internet and don't protect them properly, that creates a weapon that can be quite difficult. We are coming after that from 2 points: One, we do have some solid technology that will be coming out through our Norton brand to help protect that from the actual consumer electronic devices in the home; and we're also working hard to be able to bring some network protection to this world also and be able to use some of our behavioral analysis technologies to realize some of these things are not doing what they're supposed to be doing. So this is an area that will be a long battle between the adversaries in the industry as people weaponize IoT and consumer electronics. We believe we are an essential technology in the fight against that, and it will take governments and consumer electronics manufacturers and security vendors to sort it out. I'd also like to point out, in terms of securing IoT and being able to build secure infrastructure, we are a market leader in the tools that you need to do that with our Managed PKI, our code signing technologies and what we do in that part of the fabric of the Symantec portfolio. So in terms of relevant vendors to come after this IoT problem, we are definitely one of them. And we think that, that will lead to tailwinds for us as that becomes more of essential and potentially even policy mandates from governments about it. So good question, big problem, and we're definitely working on it."

So it's a really good question, John, and I think this is something that we work on a lot because we have a strategy that we believe can turn it around and return it to growth. And that strategy is really anchored in moving the value proposition that we have from PC malware to a larger superset of PC malware, which is really Internet safety. The consumer's really interested in safety while using the Internet safety for the family, a piece of which is the malware on the endpoint. So we're going after all endpoints, whether it be Apple endpoints, mobile, telephone devices, tablets and PCs, and we're also going after other value propositions that a consumer, when they're using the Internet, considers necessary. And we have some announcements coming out on that soon. I won't announce them on this call, but we are definitely working hard on real P times Q based on real market data that can turn that business around and return it to growth that are elements that are off the PC declines, which are kind of a natural force that's happening in the industry. So everybody who wants to mark us down because consumer's going to melt, we're working really hard to make sure that we turn that around so it doesn't melt and that we can -- we have very strong brand recognition in Norton. People trust us, and we think we can deliver substantial value to the consumer through that brand, the things that are adjacencies to the PC malware decision. So hang on. that's going to get better.

We were pleased with our performance during the second quarter as the results exceeded our guidance across all metrics. Our cost savings and synergy initiatives are tracking ahead of schedule. Within the first 10 weeks of c",1416,"Thank you for joining us today. We were pleased with our performance during the second quarter as the results exceeded our guidance across all metrics. Our cost savings and synergy initiatives are tracking ahead of schedule. Within the first 10 weeks of closing Blue Coat, we've made multiple meaningful product improvements and integrations. The feedback on our product road map from customers, partners and third-party influencers has been overwhelmingly positive. Product integrations are already having a significant impact on our ability to better protect customers and further validates the rationale and power of our combination.
In my prepared remarks today, I will review some of the key product integrations, highlight the exciting innovation underway within Symantec, discuss some market validation in our enterprise segment and review our Consumer Security business.
Protecting customers in the cloud generation against a multi-faceted adversary requires an integrated cyber defense platform. Symantec is best positioned in the cloud generation as one of the only vendors to deliver cyber defense solutions across users, information, web and messaging. In support of that effort, I'd like to discuss significant advancements delivered since closing the Blue Coat acquisition on August 1.
First, I'm particularly proud of the value we are providing our existing customers by integrating artificial intelligence with 2 of the largest threat databases in the world. This integration has improved our existing products, which are now blocking an additional 500,000 attacks per day across the endpoint and network. 
In a press release last week, we provided the market with insight into 2 attack campaigns that had we not innovated in this way, may have remained hidden. The first of the campaigns is a cyber-espionage group called Buckeye, which targeted Hong Kong political organizations leading up to the elections; and second, we discovered a campaign impacting approximately 100 financial institutions worldwide, stealing millions of dollars across various methods, including the SWIFT wire transfer system. These examples of detections were made possible due to the power of integrating endpoint, email and network threat telemetry.
Moving on, we just completed a major integration of DLP and CASB, which combines the gold standard in data protection with the leading-edge CASB solution provided by the Blue Coat acquisition. This integration extends DLP's advanced artificial intelligence-based content detection to cloud applications for shadow IT analysis, granular visibility, encryption and access controls.
Further innovation on the CASB solution occurred from integrating Symantec's authentication solution. This integration allows any sensitive transaction within cloud apps to call for a second factor authentication, eliminating key loggers and password-based hacks. For example, any company that places sensitive data inside of cloud applications can easily apply strong authentication to both users and data. This offering differentiates itself in that it requires no on-premise solution. It's a pure cloud security technology enabling our customers to securely adopt cloud technology without delay from internal IT.
Finally, 2 of our largest product lines, SEP and ProxySG, have been integrated to ensure advanced malware detection is coordinated between endpoint and network. This integration nearly eliminates the dwell time between detection and containment, thus limiting damaging propagation of 0-day infections.
Now turning to the market. Part of the industrial logic of combining Symantec and Blue Coat was the immense cross-sell and upsell opportunity. Let me provide 2 customer wins during the quarter that demonstrated our teams working together to close highly competitive cross-sell transactions for meaningful outcomes.
First, a large health care company and existing Symantec DLP customer had a multi-vendor environment in the network and was in search of a partner that could help them embrace the cloud and simplify their infrastructure. The value proposition of integration between the secure web gateway and DLP, along with our vision for an integrated cyber defense, resulted in the customer making a multimillion-dollar purchase of Symantec's network and cloud solutions.
In another example, one of the world's largest departments of education, upon realizing the strategic nature of Symantec in its goal of delivering cloud-based learning, made a sizable commitment to the integrated stack, which included Symantec's network and endpoint technologies.
Shifting back to R&D and the product side of the business, let me now discuss the organic innovation that is thriving across Symantec. Just a few days ago, we launched SEP 14, which is the most complete next-generation endpoint security solution available in the market. From a single lightweight agent, SEP 14 combines traditional and next-generation functionality such as machine learning, 0-day exploit prevention and emulation. For the first time, these next-generation capabilities are available in one scalable enterprise platform. I'm also proud to share that based on recent third-party tests, SEP provides the best security in the industry, beating competitors in blocking real-world threats and minimizing false positives.
Along with SEP 14, last quarter, we launched SEP cloud, which is a fully cloud-delivered version of Symantec Endpoint Protection. We now stand as the only company with endpoint, gateway, email, DLP, CASB and encryption solutions for the cloud.
Let me switch gears to our consumer business. Our Norton solutions deliver secure Internet safety for consumers and their families as they transact and communicate across the web, whether on a desktop, laptop or mobile device. Not only do our combined threat intelligence databases improve our enterprise security products, but they also significantly improve our consumer security solutions by adding Blue Coat's best-of-breed URL dataset into the Norton threat prevention engines. During the second quarter, the traditional Consumer Security business continued to stabilize with slower declines and improving retention rates both year-over-year and sequentially. We have now fully repositioned the solution to a subscription offering and are focused on acquiring new customers while improving renewal rates and cross selling new solutions in order to maximize customer lifetime value.
Accordingly, although in its early stages, we are very pleased with the growth in mobile and the strong interest from service providers. We are extending the Norton value proposition well beyond the PC platform and look forward to some exciting product launches in the near future. We believe the market opportunity for protecting consumers is larger than what our current consumer products address today. As we move to further penetrate these opportunities, we expect the Consumer Security business to improve its growth trajectory as we move beyond the PC.
In conclusion, we are very pleased with the second quarter results. The Blue Coat integration is going very well. The fiscal responsibility and cost-savings commitment remains on track. Innovation is alive and prospering at Symantec.
We acknowledge the strong results in Q2. However, we believe it is prudent to maintain our fiscal 2017 top line guidance for the year. Given the overachievement in Q2, we are raising our full year fiscal 2017 operating margin and EPS expectations accordingly. In addition, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2018 EPS guidance from $1.70 to $1.80 despite a headwind of approximately $0.10 from a higher share count.
Finally, today, we announced that Thomas Seifert has decided to step down as CFO at the end of the month. Thomas has been a tremendous asset to Symantec and an integral part of establishing our solid financial foundation. As CFO, Thomas led a number of key strategic initiatives for the company, including the acquisition of Blue Coat, the $7 billion divestiture of Veritas and the implementation of Symantec's $5.5 billion capital return program and the execution of our $400 million cost-efficiency initiative.
As we prepare for this transition, we're fortunate to have such an incredible finance leader as Nick Noviello, who will succeed Thomas as Symantec's CFO. I've had the pleasure of working with Nick both at Blue Coat and while he served as -- where he served as CFO and throughout the integration process here at Symantec and have been continually impressed by his leadership. In addition to his technology background and leadership experience, Nick brings an acute understanding and appreciation for Symantec's outstanding people and the critical threat protection we provide to our customers in today's increasingly complex security landscape. I'm confident he'll be an excellent CFO for Symantec during the next phase of growth.
To ensure a smooth transition, Thomas will work closely with Nick on the transfer of responsibilities, which will occur on December 1. Thomas will remain with us in an advisory role until March 2017. While Thomas' departure is bittersweet, we all congratulate him on his many successes as Symantec CFO and wish him the very best in his next chapter.
I will now turn the call over to Thomas to provide additional financial details and outlook."

It's been an honor to serve as Symantec's CFO during such a pivotal time in the company's history. I joined Symantec in order to lay the groundwork for our strategic and financial transformation, and I'm proud of the incredible progress we have made over the past 2.5 years. 
Symantec is now the leading pure-play cyber security company and in a strong financial position, and this is the right time for me to take on my next challenge. I'm confident Nick will be a strong CFO for the company and echo Greg's sentiment. I look forward to continuing to work with him over the next month and in an advisory role for the company until March of next year.
Before I move to our second quarter results, I want to express my gratitude for the support of our board, our executive team and, of course, my finance team. I look forward to maintaining our strong momentum throughout the transition process.
Now turning to our results. Today, I will provide an overview of our second quarter results, update on our $500 million (sic) [$550 million] cost efficiencies and Blue Coat integration synergies and conclude with our financial outlook. Additional details are provided in our CFO commentary, which is available on our Investor Relations website.
Our second quarter non-GAAP revenue was $1,015,000,000, $25 million above the high end of our guided range of $960 million to $990 million, driven across both Consumer and Enterprise Security. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 29.2% and 520 basis points above the high end of our guided range of 21% to 24%. The upside was driven by top line leverage and faster-than-expected realization of cost savings. 
Fully diluted earnings per share was $0.30 and above our guidance of $0.18 to $0.21. Our fully diluted share count of 644 million was above our expectation of 640 million due to higher-than-expected dilution from our convertible debt related to the increase in the share price. 
Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $55 million and included $45 million in cash outflows related to restructuring and separation.
Let me now provide further detail on our performance by segment.  Enterprise Security revenue, which includes 2 months contribution from Blue Coat following the closing on August 1, was $610 million and increased 24% year-over-year, which exceeded the high end of our guidance of up 14% to 20%. Enterprise Security operating margin was 12%.
Within Enterprise Security, both organic revenue performance and revenue from Blue Coat exceeded our expectations. Endpoint security grew in low single digits, and user authentication grew double digits. Cyber security services had another solid quarter growing in the high single digits. Website security continues to grow in low single digits, and for the 2-month period, Blue Coat contributed $124 million compared to our estimate of $100 million. We were pleased with the sales execution from the Symantec sales force given the shorter-than-normal close period for Blue Coat products.
Now onto the Norton Consumer Security segment. Consumer Security revenue was down 5%, an improvement from our guidance of down 7%, and consumer operating margin was 55%.
Let me now review some additional performance metrics for the business. Our renewal metrics continue to improve as we benefit from the shift to subscription and a focus on acquiring new customers. At the end of the September quarter, we reached the international 1-year anniversary of the shift to subscription.
In regards to mobile, we are seeing good momentum, with total active mobile users up 56% year-over-year. This momentum is encouraging as it takes us beyond the PC form factor. We also had over 1 million downloads of our 30-day free trial of mobile WiFi privacy app and plan to launch a multi-device version next year. However, WiFi privacy is still not material to our consumer revenue.
Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We have $5.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $7.2 billion in total debt, including $1.75 billion of convertible notes. We continue to expect to delever our balance sheet over the medium term. Our previous $1 billion ASR completed today on November 3. And lastly, we remain committed to maintaining our regular quarterly dividend.
Turning to the $550 million cost-savings initiatives and the Blue Coat integration synergies. As of the end of September, on a run rate basis, we have recognized just over $100 million of cost savings and synergies mainly across the areas of procurement and organizational effectiveness, while maintaining a strong investment in our products and our R&D. For example, the procurement work stream contributed more than $65 million total run rate by optimizing our supplier network. We are on track for more than $200 million of run rate net cost efficiencies exiting fiscal year '17 and continue to expect to meet our goal of $550 million of net cost efficiencies and integration synergies by the end of fiscal year 2018.
Now I will provide our updated financial outlook. We are encouraged by our Q2 top line results. However, as Greg indicated, we believe it's prudent to maintain our full year 2017 revenue guidance at this time. The integration of our offerings is resulting in more cross selling of permanent license products with subscription products, resulting in increased ratable revenue recognition.
As a result, we continue to expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be up 11% to 13% to $4,040,000,000 to $4,120,000,000. From a cost perspective, we are tracking ahead of schedule on our cost efficiency and synergy initiatives. Due to lower expenses in Q2, we now expect our fiscal 2017 operating margin to be 27% to 29%, up from 26% to 28%.
With respect to fiscal 2017 EPS guidance, we are benefiting from the $0.10 EPS upside from second quarter. However, that increase is partially offset by changes in our full year fully diluted share count between previous guidance and our current forecast. Our prior guidance for fully diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2017 was 616 million shares, and our current guidance is now 640 million shares. The difference in fully diluted shares outstanding is partially due to an additional 9 million shares of dilution from the convertible debt due to the increase in share price to approximately $25 from $21 at the time of previous guidance. You can find tables on the Investor Relations site related to the convertible debt dilution. The remaining difference is primarily related to the timing of share repurchases across the remainder of fiscal year 2017. We continue to evaluate the method and timing of future share repurchases.  Assuming our current forecast of a fully diluted average share count of 640 million, we are increasing our EPS guidance by $0.04 to $1.12 to $1.18.
For the fiscal third quarter, we expect our non-GAAP revenue to be up 15% to 18% in constant currency to $1,070,000,000 to $1,090,000,000. We expect enterprise security to be up 34% to 37% in constant currency to $675 million to $690 million. We expect consumer revenue to be down approximately 6% to $395 million to $400 million, and we expect an operating margin of 27% to 28%. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.27 to $0.29, with a tax rate of 29% and fully diluted average share count of just over 650 million shares.
As Greg stated, for fiscal 2018, we continue to expect $1.70 to $1.80 in EPS, despite a headwind of $0.10 from a higher share count. We continue to expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 30% as we enter fiscal year 2018. 
Thank you."

One is that the threat telemetry that's sitting behind the Symantec threat platform is gargantuan. It comes from well over 100 million endpoints that are in production across the consumer threat telemetry as well as in the enterprise in addition to 15,000 Internet egressers coming in from the Blue Coat network points. That gives us telemetry and some of the examples that I mentioned earlier in the call. It gives us telemetry into things that we believe we are unique in our ability to detect cyber problems from that. In addition to that, I'd like to point out that for cloud generation, you can get the Symantec threat platform in a pure cloud instantiation, which means if you are a company that is using a bunch of cloud applications that are out there, whether it'd be Salesforce.com, SuccessFactors, all the things we know, that you can instantiate the cyber defense for the users that are using that, the data that's in it and get that without even purchasing appliance or running a wire. And that's really differentiated between what you could get from the vendors that you mentioned. And so we really also have spent a ton of time in making sure that we keep that platform open. Our customers do rely on best-of-breed products, and being able to integrate those into the Symantec Integrated Cyber Defense Platform is a huge competitive advantage. And so that's something we're committed to with our ISV partners as well."

Our CASB has a piece of it called content IQ, which goes out into the cloud properties at an organization that's using in shadow IT. And using machine learning techniques, you can actually detect the data that is inside of the cloud applications that may have compliance problems. We then use the data protection technology from the Symantec side to go after those problems and cure them so that, that data can be allowed to still be in the cloud, but we protect it in a way where you don't have risk of compliance problems or other data loss. In addition to that, we have integrated the CASB technology with the product called VIP, which allows us to add a second factor of authentication to the cloud properties. And what that means is, if you're logging into Salesforce.com and you're worried about making sure that it's Greg logging into Salesforce.com, I have a second factor application on my phone or like a fob that I use and plugged into my computer. And then it adds that factor authentication to all of those cloud applications without the organization's IT having to do anything. It's extremely powerful as a lot of the password and key logger breaches that happen across these technologies are solved by that problem. So we've integrated those 2 things, and it's -- I'd just like to point out that, that and the threat telemetry integration that we've been talking about, we closed the acquisition on August 1 and our engineering teams are working together extremely well. We've got some rapid delivery there and real proof points in the market."

So we have definitely delivered all of the defenses that work on 0-day attacks and signature-less things, the machine learning behavior analysis reputational detection technologies. So we believe that we have now leapfrogged the current advanced endpoint competition, and one of the major advantages of ours is ours has a very low false positive rate in the space. And it is -- think of it as converged endpoint that includes all of the stuff that you need from traditional endpoints with the next-generation capabilities.

Our -- in the last 30 days, we brought out our WiFi protection for mobile users. That has seen a substantial uptake and great feedback from that. In addition to that, our mobile platforms, as Thomas mentioned in his remarks, have been growing at strong double-digit period compares on units. We've seen the service provider market really start to produce some fantastic deployments of the mobile side of what we're doing. So those are a couple of proof points where we're executing well in the PC space. Again, we won the Editors' Choice for the most effective malware protection on the PC again. And the auto renewals is helping. The move to subscription is helping. So we feel good about maintaining our position in there and then moving to markets that are off the PC. We have some exciting pure mobile endpoint growth, and also, we have some things that we'll be launching in the future that will continue to move us into addressable markets that are off the PC value proposition. So we feel good about our future prospects in the consumer side and the value that we're bringing. As many of us are aware, there is plenty of malware on mobile, and there's plenty of malware on Apple platforms. And so we feel good about the future of our consumer business."

Yes, we are very focused on maintaining a strong relationship with the channel. I think myself and Mike Fey have great reputations as taking care of what is a very large extended sales force we have around the world at the Tier 2 VAR and also in the excellent Tier 1 value-added distributors that we use. Nothing is going to change there. And we had an excellent partner conference earlier this month, where we recommitted to the channel. I think we have a good, trusted relationship there, and then right now, we're doing the same thing in APAC and also in EMEA this week. So we feel good about our relevance to the VARs and resellers out in the world, whether it be in the small-, medium-sized business, the mid-market or in the enterprise. And we continue to be a substantial element of the economics in the channel. We are the largest pure-play security vendor, and the combination between Blue Coat and Symantec really, really does make us a very meaningful part of the channel economics and I think in the -- with our very strong middle-market story. We released a product in the last quarter, which was called SEP cloud. That is extremely powerful for that sort of middle-market SMB part of the world, and we feel good about that. And we think we continue to deliver market relevance to the part of the market where those VARs and resellers are essential and which we think will drive up interest in continuing to do business with them and more revenue for both them and us. Moving on to your next question, which was about the IoT situation. IoT is a -- as we saw a couple of Fridays ago when some of the DNS in the Internet stopped working and had significant knock-on effects, it's a wake-up call for the power of when you bring a bunch of unmanned devices to the Internet and don't protect them properly, that creates a weapon that can be quite difficult. We are coming after that from 2 points: One, we do have some solid technology that will be coming out through our Norton brand to help protect that from the actual consumer electronic devices in the home; and we're also working hard to be able to bring some network protection to this world also and be able to use some of our behavioral analysis technologies to realize some of these things are not doing what they're supposed to be doing. So this is an area that will be a long battle between the adversaries in the industry as people weaponize IoT and consumer electronics. We believe we are an essential technology in the fight against that, and it will take governments and consumer electronics manufacturers and security vendors to sort it out. I'd also like to point out, in terms of securing IoT and being able to build secure infrastructure, we are a market leader in the tools that you need to do that with our Managed PKI, our code signing technologies and what we do in that part of the fabric of the Symantec portfolio. So in terms of relevant vendors to come after this IoT problem, we are definitely one of them. And we think that, that will lead to tailwinds for us as that becomes more of essential and potentially even policy mandates from governments about it. So good question, big problem, and we're definitely working on it."

Can we just sort of get a refresh on this, how you think about this strategically?

So it's a really good question, John, and I think this is something that we work on a lot because we have a strategy that we believe can turn it around and return it to growth. And that strategy is really anchored in moving the value proposition that we have from PC malware to a larger superset of PC malware, which is really Internet safety. The consumer's really interested in safety while using the Internet safety for the family, a piece of which is the malware on the endpoint. So we're going after all endpoints, whether it be Apple endpoints, mobile, telephone devices, tablets and PCs, and we're also going after other value propositions that a consumer, when they're using the Internet, considers necessary. And we have some announcements coming out on that soon. I won't announce them on this call, but we are definitely working hard on real P times Q based on real market data that can turn that business around and return it to growth that are elements that are off the PC declines, which are kind of a natural force that's happening in the industry. So everybody who wants to mark us down because consumer's going to melt, we're working really hard to make sure that we turn that around so it doesn't melt and that we can -- we have very strong brand recognition in Norton. People trust us, and we think we can deliver substantial value to the consumer through that brand, the things that are adjacencies to the PC malware decision. So hang on. that's going to get better. Our guidance is conservative. John, our guidance is conservative on the consumer guide, okay."

Where they live is we do believe that in the network area where we're selling the gateway technologies that are highly adjacent to email and to DLP, we have a great opportunity for cross selling the combined solutions there. Also, the power that you get when you hook up networks with endpoint results in substantial enhanced cyber defense and we do think that there are a bunch of cross-sell and upsell opportunities. We mentioned on the prior remarks a couple of examples of DLP customers where we're strongly advantaged with the network technologies; and endpoint technologies, that we're strongly advantaged from the network technologies. We feel good about what we can put together in terms of product bundles that the market's going to like, customers are going to like. And in the outlying years, I think we'll be able to lead the market with the enterprise solution set for cyber defense. Margin-wise, I think at this point in time, we are committed to taking out the $550 million of sustainable run rate expenses.
