We grew revenue 8%, operating profit 13% and earnings per share 17%, once again magnifying our growth rate as you walk down the P&L and we intend to do it again in 2016. While these are great results, make no mistake, they are not up to the high standards to which we hold ourselves at HanesBrands. We did not fully deliver on our Q4 commitments. 
While Q4 was impacted by the well-publicized retail traffic declines, frankly, we struggled a bit on the sales line all last year. So it's time to refine our approach and regain our sales momentum. We have a variety of focused initiatives designed to re-energize sales. These initiatives, which Geral will highlight, gives us confidence in our ability to firmly deliver our 2016 revenue target. 
We also expect another year of double-digit earnings growth, growing EPS 11% to 15%. Importantly, we can achieve the low end of this range just with our expected acquisition synergies, our historical level of SG&A leverage and our projected contributions from share repurchases. 
In terms of cash flow, we have several action plans in place that put us all on track to generate up to $850 million this year, which would be the highest level on our history. To put this in perspective, this is the amount of cumulative cash flow we generated in the first 3 years as a public company. 
Turning to acquisitions. Both DBA, now renamed Hanes Europe, and Knights Apparel, continued to perform extremely well. Operating results were above plan, the integrations are progressing on schedule and we are on target to deliver $40 million in synergies this year. And as I've mentioned last quarter, we have turned our attention to 2016 acquisitions. 
A number of variables obviously need to fall into place. With the integration of Knights Apparel and Hanes Europe now in full swing, we have the bandwidth to take on additional acquisitions. 
So in closing, we are refocusing on driving our top line and we are well positioned for another year of double-digit EPS growth with upside provided by potential future acquisitions. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."

We have a lot of things working very well in our business, such as our innovations, our supply chain efficiencies, our margin enhancement strategies and our acquisitions. And this is evidenced by 3 consecutive years of double-digit growth in both operating profit and earnings per share. However, the fourth quarter did not turn out as we had expected. Retail traffic declined at high-single digit rates in November and the first 3 weeks of December, driven by one of the warmest holidays on record. The prolonged traffic declines weighed on point-of-sale trends, even in our Innerwear products as there were fewer people in the stores. This caused retailers to pull back on their orders, which in turn impacted our shipments for the quarter. The impact was across all channels and relative to our expectations, it was split between our Innerwear and Activewear segments. 
Relative to last year, the lion share of the decline was in Activewear as Innerwear sales were down only 2% in the quarter. As retail traffic improved in the last 2 weeks of December and into January, so did our point-of-sale trends. Looking at January, our basics POS is up low-single digits month-to-date, while Champion and the sporting goods midtier and department channels is up low-double digits. 
While weather affected Q4 and our POS is rebounding from that, our core business in 2015 was essentially flat for the year and I'm not at all satisfied with that level of performance. So we're being proactive by putting in place several focused initiative to drive into revenue growth in 2016 and beyond. And this is something I am committed to deliver. 
Let me take you through why I'm so confident we can achieve our sales guidance for 2016, which calls for growth of 1% on the low end of the range and 3% on the high end. To reach a low end of our range, we only need about $70 million of incremental sales, which we should be able to hit with the $50 million from acquisition contributions and the absence of last year's $50 million to $60 million of Innerwear headwinds from the retail inventory destocking and our intimates brand transition, partially offset by approximately $40 million in currency headwinds. From there, the execution of our various sales initiatives as well as a more normalized Q4 represents another $100 million to $150 million in revenue opportunity that could put us at/or above the high end of our range. 
There are sports-specific sales initiatives that I have the organization focused on delivering. One, continue to drive Innovate-to-Elevate by expanding space of our successful innovation platform such as X-Temp. 2, apply Innovate-to-Elevate to our core products by driving innovation and making the right investments to deliver better volume growth. 3, continue to accelerate growth online and build upon our leading market share positions across all of our brands. And 4, deliver product enhancements in Champion across all channels. 
With my focus on reenergizing sales growth, I want to emphasize that these efforts and investments will to come with the same focus on profitability and cash flow generation. And you can see that in our guidance, which calls for roughly 100 basis points of operating margin expansion driven by our acquisition synergies as well as our continued focus on effectively managing our SG&A. 
We also intend to deliver a record level of cash flow this year. Rick will walk you through the various drivers of our cash flow, but let me talk to the largest contributor, inventory. 
To bring our inventory levels down in a cost-efficient manner, we will need to make small adjustments our manufacturing production schedule, which will do by taking a little time out, internalizing additional production and by drawing down our raw materials a work in process. 
So in closing, our brand is strong, our innovation is working, we're expanding our margins and we're generating significant synergies from acquisitions. Add to this a heavy focus on how exiting our sales initiatives and I feel really good about our ability to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

Last quarter, I spoke about how we create strong shareholder returns through the combination of our core business strategies or acquisition strategies and our cash deployment strategies. This is the underlying formula that drives the magnification of our growth rate from sales to operating profit and, again, to earnings per share. 
2015 was the third year in a row we've delivered on magnifying our growth rate down the P&L and we believe we're able to -- we believe we're well positioned to do it again in 2016. 
Before I turn to the results, I'd like to point everyone to our FAQ document, which provides additional details on our 2015 results as well as our 2016 guidance. 
For 2015, the 8% increase in revenue was driven by acquisitions as our core business ended flat with the sales decline in Q4. Operating profit increased 13% or nearly $100 million due to the addition of roughly $15 million from acquisitions and a 150 basis point increase in our core operating margin as we benefited from efficiency gains in our supply chain, synergies from acquisitions and ongoing cost controls. 
Earnings per share grew 17%, driven by the growth in operating profit and slightly lower tax rate and the contribution from share repurchases. And cash flow from operations was $227 million. The weaker than expected cash flow was the result of an inventory buildup due to the sales shortfall coming very late in the year. With no markdown risk and specific action plans to reduce inventory, we believe the impact was temporary. 
Turning to our 2016 guidance. We expect full-year sales to be $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, which represents a 1% to 3% increase over last year. And as Gerald highlighted, we have a variety of focused initiatives that give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our revenue target. We expect operating profit to be $920 million to $950 million, which implies 90 to 110 basis point increase in our operating profit margin and includes roughly $40 million of acquisition synergies. 
Our EPS guidance of $1.85 to $1.91 represents 11% to 15% growth over last year and includes the following assumptions. Interest and other expense is expected to be $115 million to $120 million. Our tax rate is expected to be 10% to 11%. And in terms of share repurchases, we expect to spend a similar amount to last year. 
Finally, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $750 million to $850 million. Using the midpoint of our guidance ranges, this represents an increase of roughly $575 million from last year, which is being driven by 4 main factors. First, more than $300 million from improved working capital driven by reduced inventory. Second, roughly $140 million from the lower expected cash charges absent any new acquisitions. Third, roughly $60 million from expected growth and adjusted net income. And fourth, a $60 million reduction in our pension contribution. 
With over $300 million of cash in our balance sheet at year end, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2.3x as well as our expected cash generation in 2016, we are extremely well positioned to continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy. And our strategy is simple: Use our cash flow to fund capital investments in our dividend, use debt for acquisitions and use excess free cash flow to buy back stock. 
So in summary, we generated significant shareholder value over the past several years and with our focus on driving sales growth along with our continued execution on expanding our margins, we are well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit EPS growth. Add to that about $800 million in expected cash flow as well as upside from potential acquisitions and we feel really good about 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

And you could actually see the correlation as temperature got above normal, retail traffic was dropped and then we saw an impact in our POS. So I think a lot of it was clearly impacted by that. How much is overall consumer spending, you can't really tell. But clearly, I think it was a very unusual holiday period. That said, you expect it to be in our cold-weather activewear areas. It was. That was down about 12% in the quarter, but it was so strong and actually impacted Innerwear, which when you take out the 53rd week, was actually down 2% in the quarter.

And really, it focuses in 2 areas. First, we're going to keep doing what's working and that, clearly, is Innovate-to-Elevate is working. Our innovation platforms like X-Temp and our elevated product in Champion are all driving sales increases and we're gaining additional space that we have going in place for 2016. There are 2 areas where we refine our strategy a bit. 1 is in the area of accelerating our growth online. The online channel continues to grow very rapidly and apparel now, 18% of apparel sales are online. We're well-positioned there. Our brand sold leading shares already and our sales, while there are 7% of our sales are down online today, they're also calling in a double-digit rate. So we actually one of our largest customers now are it like a customer at a large peer player that sales online is going 70% -- approximately 70% rate. So we're going to invest more resources to grow this business faster, both people, we're dedicating more people and resources as well as marketing investments to maximize our position in this channel. Secondly, we're rebalancing our focus a bit on driving our core volume. And really in 2 areas. If you look at our core business, we've stayed behind our core innovation such as TAGLESS for a number of years and our underwear business for example. And it's time to drive new innovation there. So you'll see innovation coming across our core basics business late in '16 and into '17. And secondly, you'll see us rebalancing our media to focus more balanced approach both the core and our innovation platforms over time. We think these are good strategies that take the best of what we're doing and moderately refines our strategy against basics and gives us confidence that we're well positioned to deliver on our guidance for 2016."

And finally, we will draw down our work in process and raw materials and Rick referred to some of that.

We've seen our basics POS, for example, rise into low single digits. But I would say that as you look through the day that we can see that in the broad business, for example, we came up a strong third quarter. Our fourth quarter, when you back out the 53rd week, that business was actually flat in the quarter in spite of the traffic. So it gives us very strong confidence in our brand consolidation strategy and certainly, optimistic it will drive that forward. And Omar, let me talk about channel a little bit because this was really -- broad-based. We saw across all channels of trade. I will say, however, it was probably a little bit more concentrated in midtier and department stores, which if you just think of what they're offering is, is probably going to be a little bit more weather driven than some of the math.

I'd also remind you that in any given quarter, we have a lot of volatility as you've now seen. But in places like Innerwear, over the period of a year or so, those types of things will start to work themselves out. In fact, in both 2008 and 2009, men's underwear had a lot of quarter ended up slightly up in both of those years. But over a period of 1 year or more, our ability to react is pretty high. Right thing about our business is we've got a lot of things that drive profitability. We've got acquisition synergies, we're independent of the consumer environment, we've got strong cash flows that we can use. So we've talked about the pay dividends and buy back stock. We've got other acquisitions to do and I'm very comfortable as Gerld took you through the sales, what we need to just get to the low end of our sales range. A lot of it just acquisition.

We grew revenue, 8%; operating profit, 13%; and earnings per share, 17%, once again magnifying our growth rates as you walk down the P&L. And we intend to do it again in 2016. While these are great results, make no mistake, they are not up to the high standards to which we hold ourselves at HanesBrands. We did not fully deliver on our Q4 commitments. 
While Q4 was impacted by the well-publicized retail traffic declines, frankly, we struggled a bit on the sales line all last year. So it's time to refine our approach and regain our sales momentum. We have a variety of focused initiatives designed to reenergize sales. These initiatives, which Gerald will highlight, give us confidence in our ability to firmly deliver our 2016 revenue target. 
We also expect another year of double-digit earnings growth, growing EPS 11% to 15%. Importantly, we can achieve the low end of this range just with our expected acquisition synergies, our historical level of SG&A leverage and the projected contribution from share repurchases. 
In terms of cash flow, we have several action plans in place that put us on track to generate up to $850 million this year, which would be the highest level on our history. To put this in perspective, this is the amount of cumulative cash flow we generated in the first 3 years as a public company. 
Turning to acquisitions. Both DBA, now renamed Hanes Europe, and Knights Apparel continued to perform extremely well. Operating results were above plan, the integrations are progressing on schedule and we are on target to deliver $40 million in synergies this year. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have turned our attention to 2016 acquisitions. A number of variables obviously need to fall into place. But with the integration of Knights Apparel and Hanes Europe now in full swing, we have the bandwidth to take on additional acquisitions. 
So in closing, we are refocusing on driving our top line, and we are well positioned for another year of double-digit EPS growth with upside provided by potential future acquisitions. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."

We have a lot of things working very well in our business, such as our innovations, our supply chain efficiencies, our margin-enhancement strategies and our acquisitions. And this is evidenced by 3 consecutive years of double-digit growth in both operating profit and earnings per share. However, the fourth quarter did not turn out as we had expected. Retail traffic declined in high single-digit rates in November and the first 3 weeks of December, driven by one of the warmest holidays on record. The prolonged traffic decline weighed on point-of-sale trends, even in our Innerwear products as there were fewer people in the stores. This caused retailers to pull back on their orders, which in turn impacted our shipments for the quarter. The impact was across all channels, and relative to our expectations, it was split between our Innerwear and Activewear segments. Relative to last year, the lion share of the decline was in Activewear as Innerwear sales were down only 2% in the quarter. 
As retail traffic improved in the last 2 weeks of December and into January, so did our point-of-sale trends. Looking at January, our basics POS is up low single digits month-to-date, while Champion in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels is up low double digits. 
While weather affected Q4 and our POS is rebounding from that, our core business in 2015 was essentially flat for the year, and I am not at all satisfied with that level of performance. So we're being proactive by putting in place several focused initiatives to drive improved revenue growth in 2016 and beyond, and this is something I am committed to deliver. 
Let me take you through why I'm so confident that we can achieve our sales guidance for 2016, which calls for growth of 1% on the low end of the range and 3% on the high end. To reach the low end of our range, we only need about $70 million of incremental sales, which we should be able to hit with the $50 million from acquisition contributions and the absence of last year's $50 million to $60 million of Innerwear headwinds from the retail inventory destocking and our intimates brand transition, partially offset by approximately $40 million in currency headwinds. From there, the execution of our various sales initiatives as well as a more normalized Q4 represents another $100 million to $150 million in revenue opportunity that could put us at/or above the high end of our range. 
There are 4 specific sales initiatives that I have the organization focused on delivering. One, continue to drive Innovate-to-Elevate by expanding space of our successful innovation platforms such as X-TEMP; two, apply Innovate-to-Elevate to our core products by driving innovation and making the right investments to deliver better volume growth; three, continue to accelerate growth online and build upon our leading market share positions across all of our brands; and four, deliver product enhancements in Champion across all channels. 
With my focus on reenergizing sales growth, I want to emphasize that these efforts and investments will still come with the same focus on profitability and cash flow generation. And you can see that in our guidance, which calls for roughly 100 basis points of operating margin expansion, driven by our acquisition synergies as well as our continued focus on effectively managing our SG&A. 
We also intend to deliver a record level of cash flow this year. Rick will walk you through the various drivers of our cash flow, but let me talk to the largest contributor, inventory. To bring our inventory level down in a cost-efficient manner, we will need to make small adjustments to our manufacturing production schedule, which we'll do by taking a little time-out, internalizing additional production and by drawing down our raw materials and work in process. 
So in closing, our brand is strong. Our innovation is working. We're expanding our margins, and we're generating significant synergies from acquisitions. Add to this the heavy focus I have on exiting our sales initiatives, and I feel really good about our ability to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

Last quarter, I spoke about how we create strong shareholder returns through the combination of our core business strategies or acquisition strategies and our cash deployment strategies. This is the underlying formula that drives the magnification of our growth rate from sales to operating profit and again to earnings per share. 2015 was the third year in a row we've delivered on magnifying our growth rate down the P&L, and we believe we're able to -- we believe we're well positioned to do it again in 2016. 
Before I turn to the results, I'd like to point everyone to our FAQ document, which provides additional details on our 2015 results as well as our 2016 guidance. For 2015, the 8% increase in revenue was driven by acquisitions as our core business ended flat with the sales decline in Q4. Operating profit increased 13% or nearly $100 million due to the addition of roughly $50 million from acquisitions and a 150 basis point increase in our core operating margin as we benefited from efficiency gains in our supply chain, synergies from acquisitions and ongoing cost controls. 
Earnings per share grew 17%, driven by the growth in operating profit and slightly lower tax rate and the contribution from share repurchases. And cash flow from operations was $227 million. The weaker-than-expected cash flow was the result of an inventory buildup due to the sales shortfall coming very late in the year. With no markdown risk and specific action plans to reduce inventory, we believe the impact was temporary. 
Turning to our 2016 guidance. We expect full year sales to be $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, which represents a 1% to 3% increase over last year. And as Gerald highlighted, we have a variety of focused initiatives that give us confidence on our ability to deliver on our revenue target. We expect operating profit to be $920 million to $950 million, which implies a 90 to 110 basis point increase in our operating profit margin and includes roughly $40 million of acquisition synergies. 
Our EPS guidance of $1.85 to $1.91 represents 11% to 15% growth over last year and includes the following assumptions: interest and other expense is expected to be $115 million to $120 million. Our tax rate is expected to be 10% to 11%. And in terms of share repurchases, we expect to spend a similar amount to last year. 
Finally, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $750 million to $850 million. Using the midpoint of our guidance ranges, this represents an increase of roughly $575 million from last year, which is being driven by 4 main factors; first, more than $300 million from improved working capital, driven by reduced inventory; second, roughly $140 million from a lower expected cash XA charges, absent any new acquisitions; third, roughly $60 million from expected growth in adjusted net income; and fourth, a $60 million reduction in our pension contribution. 
With over $300 million of cash on our balance sheet at year-end, a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2.3x as well as our expected cash generation in 2016, we are extremely well positioned to continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy. And our strategy is simple: use our cash flow to fund capital investments in our dividend, use debt for acquisitions and use excess free cash flow to buy back stock. 
So in summary, we've generated significant shareholder value over the past several years. And with our focus on driving sales growth, along with our continued execution on expanding our margins, we are well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit EPS growth. Add to that about $800 million in expected cash flow as well as upside from potential acquisitions, and we feel really good about 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

And December was actually the warmest, and you could actually see the correlation. As temperature got above normal, retail traffic was dropped, and then we saw it impact our POS. So I think a lot of it was clearly impacted by that. How much is overall consumer spending? You can't really tell. But clearly, I think it was a very unusual holiday period. That said, you expect it to be in our cold-weather Activewear areas. It was. That was down about 12% in the quarter. But it was so strong, it actually impacted Innerwear, which when you take out the 53rd week, was actually down 2% in the quarter.

First, we're going to keep doing what's working, and that clearly is Innovate-to-Elevate is working. Our innovation platforms like X-TEMP and our elevated product in Champion are all driving sales increases, and we're gaining additional space that we'll have in -- going in place for 2016. There are 2 areas there where we will refine our strategies a bit. One is in the area of accelerating our growth online. The online channel continues to grow very rapidly, and apparel now, 18% of apparel sales are online. We're well positioned there. Our brand sold leading shares already. And our sales, while there -- 7% of our sales are done online today, they're also growing in a double-digit rate. So we -- and actually one of our largest customers now, our eighth largest customer is a large peer player that sales online is growing at 70% -- approximately 70% rate. So we're going to invest more resources to drive this business faster, both people. We're dedicating more people resources as well as marketing investment to maximize our position in this channel. Secondly, we're rebalancing our focus a bit on driving our core volume and really in 2 areas. If we look at our core business, we've stayed behind our core innovation such as TAGLESS for a number of years and our underwear business, for example. And it's time to drive new innovation there. So you'll see innovation coming across our core basics business late in '16 and into '17. And secondly, you'll see us rebalancing our media to focus more balanced across both the core and our innovation platforms over time. We think these are good strategies that take the best of what we're doing that moderately refines our strategy against basics and gives us confidence that we are well positioned to deliver on our guidance for 2016."

Our ability to last is substantially greater. I'd also remind you that in any given quarter, we have a lot of volatilities, as you've now seen. But in places like Innerwear, over the period of a year or so, those types of things will start to work themselves out. In fact, in both 2008 and 2009, men's underwear, while it had a lot of volatile quarter, ended up slightly up in both of those years. But over a period of a year or more, our ability to react is pretty high. The great thing about our business is we've got a lot of things that drive profitability. We've got acquisition synergies. We're independent of that -- the consumer environment. We got strong cash flow that we can use. So we've talked about to pay dividends and buy back stock.

When you look at the numbers that almost matched up to the -- to what our most recent guidance in 2015 was the -- that sales shortfall. But we continue to have production at levels, and we weren't just able to react in time because of the sales shortfall coming so light in the year. As for '16, you normally see our cash flow very heavily weighted towards the back end of the year. I think with Gerald and his team on the inventory adjustment programs and initiatives that they've got, I think you'll see that moderate some. It's not -- you're still going to see the -- most of the cash flow in the back half of the year. But I don't think you'll see quite as big a peak in '16 as you saw in '15."

We grew revenue, 8%; operating profit, 13%; and earnings per share, 17%, once again magnifying our growth rates as you walk down the P&L. And we intend to do it again in 2016. While these are great results, make no mistake, they are not up to the high standards to which we hold ourselves at HanesBrands. We did not fully deliver on our Q4 commitments. 
While Q4 was impacted by the well-publicized retail traffic declines, frankly, we struggled a bit on the sales line all last year. So it's time to refine our approach and regain our sales momentum. We have a variety of focused initiatives designed to reenergize sales. These initiatives, which Gerald will highlight, give us confidence in our ability to firmly deliver our 2016 revenue target. 
We also expect another year of double-digit earnings growth, growing EPS 11% to 15%. Importantly, we can achieve the low end of this range just with our expected acquisition synergies, our historical level of SG&A leverage and the projected contribution from share repurchases. 
In terms of cash flow, we have several action plans in place that put us on track to generate up to $850 million this year, which would be the highest level on our history. To put this in perspective, this is the amount of cumulative cash flow we generated in the first 3 years as a public company. 
Turning to acquisitions. Both DBA, now renamed Hanes Europe, and Knights Apparel continued to perform extremely well. Operating results were above plan, the integrations are progressing on schedule and we are on target to deliver $40 million in synergies this year. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have turned our attention to 2016 acquisitions. A number of variables obviously need to fall into place. But with the integration of Knights Apparel and Hanes Europe now in full swing, we have the bandwidth to take on additional acquisitions. 
So in closing, we are refocusing on driving our top line, and we are well positioned for another year of double-digit EPS growth with upside provided by potential future acquisitions. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."

We have a lot of things working very well in our business, such as our innovations, our supply chain efficiencies, our margin-enhancement strategies and our acquisitions. And this is evidenced by 3 consecutive years of double-digit growth in both operating profit and earnings per share. However, the fourth quarter did not turn out as we had expected. Retail traffic declined in high single-digit rates in November and the first 3 weeks of December, driven by one of the warmest holidays on record. The prolonged traffic decline weighed on point-of-sale trends, even in our Innerwear products as there were fewer people in the stores. This caused retailers to pull back on their orders, which in turn impacted our shipments for the quarter. The impact was across all channels, and relative to our expectations, it was split between our Innerwear and Activewear segments. Relative to last year, the lion's share of the decline was in Activewear as Innerwear sales were down only 2% in the quarter. 
As retail traffic improved in the last 2 weeks of December and into January, so did our point-of-sale trends. Looking at January, our basics POS is up low single digits month-to-date, while Champion in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels is up low double digits. 
While weather affected Q4 and our POS is rebounding from that, our core business in 2015 was essentially flat for the year, and I am not at all satisfied with that level of performance. So we're being proactive by putting in place several focused initiatives to drive improved revenue growth in 2016 and beyond, and this is something I am committed to deliver. 
Let me take you through why I'm so confident that we can achieve our sales guidance for 2016, which calls for growth of 1% on the low end of the range and 3% on the high end. To reach the low end of our range, we only need about $70 million of incremental sales, which we should be able to hit with the $50 million from acquisition contributions and the absence of last year's $50 million to $60 million of Innerwear headwinds from the retail inventory destocking and our intimates brand transition, partially offset by approximately $40 million in currency headwinds. From there, the execution of our various sales initiatives as well as a more normalized Q4, represents another $100 million to $150 million in revenue opportunity that could put us at/or above the high end of our range. 
There are 4 specific sales initiatives that I have the organization focused on delivering. One, continue to drive Innovate-to-Elevate by expanding space of our successful innovation platforms such as X-TEMP; two, apply Innovate-to-Elevate to our core products by driving innovation and making the right investments to deliver better volume growth; three, continue to accelerate growth online and build upon our leading market share positions across all of our brands; and four, deliver product enhancements in Champion across all channels. 
With my focus on reenergizing sales growth, I want to emphasize that these efforts and investments will still come with the same focus on profitability and cash flow generation. And you can see that in our guidance, which calls for roughly 100 basis points of operating margin expansion, driven by our acquisition synergies as well as our continued focus on effectively managing our SG&A. 
We also intend to deliver a record level of cash flow this year. Rick will walk you through the various drivers of our cash flow, but let me talk to the largest contributor, inventory. To bring our inventory level down in a cost-efficient manner, we will need to make small adjustments to our manufacturing production schedule, which we'll do by taking a little time-out, internalizing additional production and by drawing down our raw materials and work in process. 
So in closing, our brand is strong. Our innovation is working. We're expanding our margins, and we're generating significant synergies from acquisitions. Add to this the heavy focus I have on executing our sales initiatives, and I feel really good about our ability to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

Last quarter, I spoke about how we create strong shareholder returns through the combination of our core business strategies or acquisition strategies and our cash deployment strategies. This is the underlying formula that drives the magnification of our growth rate from sales to operating profit and again to earnings per share. 2015 was the third year in a row we've delivered on magnifying our growth rate down the P&L, and we believe we're able to -- we believe we're well positioned to do it again in 2016. 
Before I turn to the results, I'd like to point everyone to our FAQ document, which provides additional details on our 2015 results as well as our 2016 guidance. For 2015, the 8% increase in revenue was driven by acquisitions as our core business ended flat with the sales decline in Q4. Operating profit increased 13% or nearly $100 million due to the addition of roughly $50 million from acquisitions and a 150 basis point increase in our core operating margin as we benefited from efficiency gains in our supply chain, synergies from acquisitions and ongoing cost controls. 
Earnings per share grew 17%, driven by the growth in operating profit and slightly lower tax rate and the contribution from share repurchases. And cash flow from operations was $227 million. The weaker-than-expected cash flow was the result of an inventory buildup due to the sales shortfall coming very late in the year. With no markdown risk and specific action plans to reduce inventory, we believe the impact was temporary. 
Turning to our 2016 guidance. We expect full year sales to be $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, which represents a 1% to 3% increase over last year. And as Gerald highlighted, we have a variety of focused initiatives that give us confidence on our ability to deliver on our revenue target. We expect operating profit to be $920 million to $950 million, which implies a 90 to 110 basis point increase in our operating profit margin and includes roughly $40 million of acquisition synergies. 
Our EPS guidance of $1.85 to $1.91 represents 11% to 15% growth over last year and includes the following assumptions: interest and other expense is expected to be $115 million to $120 million. Our tax rate is expected to be 10% to 11%. And in terms of share repurchases, we expect to spend a similar amount to last year. 
Finally, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $750 million to $850 million. Using the midpoint of our guidance ranges, this represents an increase of roughly $575 million from last year, which is being driven by 4 main factors; first, more than $300 million from improved working capital, driven by reduced inventory; second, roughly $140 million from a lower expected cash XA charges, absent any new acquisitions; third, roughly $60 million from expected growth in adjusted net income; and fourth, a $60 million reduction in our pension contribution. 
With over $300 million of cash on our balance sheet at year-end, a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2.3x as well as our expected cash generation in 2016, we are extremely well positioned to continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy. And our strategy is simple: use our cash flow to fund capital investments in our dividend, use debt for acquisitions and use excess free cash flow to buy back stock. 
So in summary, we've generated significant shareholder value over the past several years. And with our focus on driving sales growth, along with our continued execution on expanding our margins, we are well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit EPS growth. Add to that about $800 million in expected cash flow as well as upside from potential acquisitions, and we feel really good about 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

And December was actually the warmest, and you could actually see the correlation. As temperature got above normal, retail traffic was dropped, and then we saw it impact our POS. So I think a lot of it was clearly impacted by that. How much is overall consumer spending? You can't really tell. But clearly, I think it was a very unusual holiday period. That said, you expect it to be in our cold-weather Activewear areas. It was. That was down about 12% in the quarter. But it was so strong, it actually impacted Innerwear, which when you take out the 53rd week, was actually down 2% in the quarter.

First, we're going to keep doing what's working, and that clearly is Innovate-to-Elevate is working. Our innovation platforms like X-TEMP and our elevated product in Champion are all driving sales increases, and we're gaining additional space that we'll have in -- going in place for 2016. There are 2 areas there where we will refine our strategies a bit. One is in the area of accelerating our growth online. The online channel continues to grow very rapidly, and apparel now, 18% of apparel sales are online. We're well positioned there. Our brands hold leading shares already. And our sales, while there -- 7% of our sales are done online today, they're also growing in a double-digit rate. So we -- and actually one of our largest customers now, our eighth largest customer is a large pure player that sales online is growing at 70% -- approximately 70% rate. So we're going to invest more resources to drive this business faster, both people. We're dedicating more people resources as well as marketing investment to maximize our position in this channel. Secondly, we're rebalancing our focus a bit on driving our core volume and really in 2 areas. If we look at our core business, we've stayed behind our core innovation such as TAGLESS for a number of years in our underwear business, for example. And it's time to drive new innovation there. So you'll see innovation coming across our core basics business late in '16 and into '17. And secondly, you'll see us rebalancing our media to focus more balanced across both the core and our innovation platforms over time. We think these are good strategies that take the best of what we're doing that moderately refines our strategy against basics and gives us confidence that we are well positioned to deliver on our guidance for 2016."

We've seen our basics POS, for example, rise into low single digits. And I would say that as you look through the data, you can see that in the bra business, for example, we came off a strong third quarter.

As I look at different revenue scenarios for all the companies under the -- in the group here, it's pretty easy to figure out for you guys, in particular, the incremental margins if revenues come in above plans since you guys are really good at controlling the cost in even a strong macro. But if the revenues do come in closer to flat, how should we think about the point of fixed versus floating cost and your ability to deliver on the EPS line if the macro works against us?

In the very short term, it's obviously a little harder to overreact. Actually, I was -- given where sales ended up, I was thrilled with the fact that actually our operating margin didn't delever in Q4. So I think our ability to manage it quickly was pretty darn good in that quarter. If it's over a longer period of time, and I'm inferring some -- the way you're asking it, if you started to see a much broader base, soft consumer environment, it's going to last. Our ability to last is substantially greater. I'd also remind you that in any given quarter, we have a lot of volatilities, as you've now seen. But in places like Innerwear, over the period of a year or so, those types of things will start to work themselves out. In fact, in both 2008 and 2009, men's underwear, while it had a lot of volatile quarter, ended up slightly up in both of those years. But over a period of a year or more, our ability to react is pretty high. The great thing about our business is we've got a lot of things that drive profitability. We've got acquisition synergies. We're independent of that -- the consumer environment. We got strong cash flow that we can use as we've talked about to pay dividends and buy back stock. We've got other acquisitions to do, and I'm very comfortable, as Gerld took you through the sales, what we need to just get to, to the low end of our sales range. A lot of it's just the acquisition wrap that we've got, plus the absence of onetime things from '15. And so we feel really good about our '16 numbers to be able to deliver them."

We grew revenue, 8%; operating profit, 13%; and earnings per share, 17%, once again magnifying our growth rates as you walk down the P&L. And we intend to do it again in 2016. While these are great results, make no mistake, they are not up to the high standards to which we hold ourselves at HanesBrands. We did not fully deliver on our Q4 commitments. 
While Q4 was impacted by the well-publicized retail traffic declines, frankly, we struggled a bit on the sales line all last year. So it's time to refine our approach and regain our sales momentum. We have a variety of focused initiatives designed to reenergize sales. These initiatives, which Gerald will highlight, give us confidence in our ability to firmly deliver our 2016 revenue target. 
We also expect another year of double-digit earnings growth, growing EPS 11% to 15%. Importantly, we can achieve the low end of this range just with our expected acquisition synergies, our historical level of SG&A leverage and the projected contribution from share repurchases. 
In terms of cash flow, we have several action plans in place that put us on track to generate up to $850 million this year, which would be the highest level on our history. To put this in perspective, this is the amount of cumulative cash flow we generated in the first 3 years as a public company. 
Turning to acquisitions. Both DBA, now renamed Hanes Europe, and Knights Apparel continued to perform extremely well. Operating results were above plan, the integrations are progressing on schedule and we are on target to deliver $40 million in synergies this year. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have turned our attention to 2016 acquisitions. A number of variables obviously need to fall into place. But with the integration of Knights Apparel and Hanes Europe now in full swing, we have the bandwidth to take on additional acquisitions. 
So in closing, we are refocusing on driving our top line, and we are well positioned for another year of double-digit EPS growth with upside provided by potential future acquisitions. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."

We have a lot of things working very well in our business, such as our innovations, our supply chain efficiencies, our margin-enhancement strategies and our acquisitions. And this is evidenced by 3 consecutive years of double-digit growth in both operating profit and earnings per share. However, the fourth quarter did not turn out as we had expected. Retail traffic declined in high single-digit rates in November and the first 3 weeks of December, driven by one of the warmest holidays on record. The prolonged traffic decline weighed on point-of-sale trends, even in our Innerwear products as there were fewer people in the stores. This caused retailers to pull back on their orders, which in turn impacted our shipments for the quarter. The impact was across all channels, and relative to our expectations, it was split between our Innerwear and Activewear segments. Relative to last year, the lion's share of the decline was in Activewear as Innerwear sales were down only 2% in the quarter. 
As retail traffic improved in the last 2 weeks of December and into January, so did our point-of-sale trends. Looking at January, our basics POS is up low single digits month-to-date, while Champion in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels is up low double digits. 
While weather affected Q4 and our POS is rebounding from that, our core business in 2015 was essentially flat for the year, and I am not at all satisfied with that level of performance. So we're being proactive by putting in place several focused initiatives to drive improved revenue growth in 2016 and beyond, and this is something I am committed to deliver. 
Let me take you through why I'm so confident that we can achieve our sales guidance for 2016, which calls for growth of 1% on the low end of the range and 3% on the high end. To reach the low end of our range, we only need about $70 million of incremental sales, which we should be able to hit with the $50 million from acquisition contributions and the absence of last year's $50 million to $60 million of Innerwear headwinds from the retail inventory destocking and our intimates brand transition, partially offset by approximately $40 million in currency headwinds. From there, the execution of our various sales initiatives as well as a more normalized Q4, represents another $100 million to $150 million in revenue opportunity that could put us at/or above the high end of our range. 
There are 4 specific sales initiatives that I have the organization focused on delivering. One, continue to drive Innovate-to-Elevate by expanding space of our successful innovation platforms such as X-TEMP; two, apply Innovate-to-Elevate to our core products by driving innovation and making the right investments to deliver better volume growth; three, continue to accelerate growth online and build upon our leading market share positions across all of our brands; and four, deliver product enhancements in Champion across all channels. 
With my focus on reenergizing sales growth, I want to emphasize that these efforts and investments will still come with the same focus on profitability and cash flow generation. And you can see that in our guidance, which calls for roughly 100 basis points of operating margin expansion, driven by our acquisition synergies as well as our continued focus on effectively managing our SG&A. 
We also intend to deliver a record level of cash flow this year. Rick will walk you through the various drivers of our cash flow, but let me talk to the largest contributor, inventory. To bring our inventory level down in a cost-efficient manner, we will need to make small adjustments to our manufacturing production schedule, which we'll do by taking a little time-out, internalizing additional production and by drawing down our raw materials and work in process. 
So in closing, our brand is strong. Our innovation is working. We're expanding our margins, and we're generating significant synergies from acquisitions. Add to this the heavy focus I have on executing our sales initiatives, and I feel really good about our ability to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

Last quarter, I spoke about how we create strong shareholder returns through the combination of our core business strategies or acquisition strategies and our cash deployment strategies. This is the underlying formula that drives the magnification of our growth rate from sales to operating profit and again to earnings per share. 2015 was the third year in a row we've delivered on magnifying our growth rate down the P&L, and we believe we're able to -- we believe we're well positioned to do it again in 2016. 
Before I turn to the results, I'd like to point everyone to our FAQ document, which provides additional details on our 2015 results as well as our 2016 guidance. For 2015, the 8% increase in revenue was driven by acquisitions as our core business ended flat with the sales decline in Q4. Operating profit increased 13% or nearly $100 million due to the addition of roughly $50 million from acquisitions and a 150 basis point increase in our core operating margin as we benefited from efficiency gains in our supply chain, synergies from acquisitions and ongoing cost controls. 
Earnings per share grew 17%, driven by the growth in operating profit and slightly lower tax rate and the contribution from share repurchases. And cash flow from operations was $227 million. The weaker-than-expected cash flow was the result of an inventory buildup due to the sales shortfall coming very late in the year. With no markdown risk and specific action plans to reduce inventory, we believe the impact was temporary. 
Turning to our 2016 guidance. We expect full year sales to be $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, which represents a 1% to 3% increase over last year. And as Gerald highlighted, we have a variety of focused initiatives that give us confidence on our ability to deliver on our revenue target. We expect operating profit to be $920 million to $950 million, which implies a 90 to 110 basis point increase in our operating profit margin and includes roughly $40 million of acquisition synergies. 
Our EPS guidance of $1.85 to $1.91 represents 11% to 15% growth over last year and includes the following assumptions: interest and other expense is expected to be $115 million to $120 million. Our tax rate is expected to be 10% to 11%. And in terms of share repurchases, we expect to spend a similar amount to last year. 
Finally, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $750 million to $850 million. Using the midpoint of our guidance ranges, this represents an increase of roughly $575 million from last year, which is being driven by 4 main factors; first, more than $300 million from improved working capital, driven by reduced inventory; second, roughly $140 million from a lower expected cash XA charges, absent any new acquisitions; third, roughly $60 million from expected growth in adjusted net income; and fourth, a $60 million reduction in our pension contribution. 
With over $300 million of cash on our balance sheet at year-end, a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2.3x as well as our expected cash generation in 2016, we are extremely well positioned to continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy. And our strategy is simple: use our cash flow to fund capital investments in our dividend, use debt for acquisitions and use excess free cash flow to buy back stock. 
So in summary, we've generated significant shareholder value over the past several years. And with our focus on driving sales growth, along with our continued execution on expanding our margins, we are well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit EPS growth. Add to that about $800 million in expected cash flow as well as upside from potential acquisitions, and we feel really good about 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

You go back to October, it was cold, things are looking really good. November, December came. It was the third warmest November and December since 1895. And December was actually the warmest, and you could actually see the correlation. As temperature got above normal, retail traffic was dropped, and then we saw it impact our POS. So I think a lot of it was clearly impacted by that. How much is overall consumer spending? You can't really tell. But clearly, I think it was a very unusual holiday period. That said, you expect it to be in our cold-weather Activewear areas. It was. That was down about 12% in the quarter.

The good thing is we started to see it rebound in December going into January. And I'll turn it over to Gerald to talk a little bit more about initiatives to drive results in '16."

First, we're going to keep doing what's working, and that clearly is Innovate-to-Elevate is working. Our innovation platforms like X-TEMP and our elevated product in Champion are all driving sales increases, and we're gaining additional space that we'll have in -- going in place for 2016. There are 2 areas there where we will refine our strategies a bit. One is in the area of accelerating our growth online. The online channel continues to grow very rapidly, and apparel now, 18% of apparel sales are online. We're well positioned there. Our brands hold leading shares already. And our sales, while there -- 7% of our sales are done online today, they're also growing in a double-digit rate. So we -- and actually one of our largest customers now, our eighth largest customer is a large pure player that sales online is growing at 70% -- approximately 70% rate. So we're going to invest more resources to drive this business faster, both people. We're dedicating more people resources as well as marketing investment to maximize our position in this channel. Secondly, we're rebalancing our focus a bit on driving our core volume and really in 2 areas. If we look at our core business, we've stayed behind our core innovation such as TAGLESS for a number of years in our underwear business, for example. And it's time to drive new innovation there. So you'll see innovation coming across our core basics business late in '16 and into '17. And secondly, you'll see us rebalancing our media to focus more balanced across both the core and our innovation platforms over time. We think these are good strategies that take the best of what we're doing that moderately refines our strategy against basics and gives us confidence that we are well positioned to deliver on our guidance for 2016."

So we feel good about them continuing to drive Hanes and Champion in that market. We have rights for Champion throughout the Americas and Asia and where we can start to use that, plugging into the design in the products that we do for the U.S. and continue to expand in Japan.

Actually, I was -- given where sales ended up, I was thrilled with the fact that actually our operating margin didn't delever in Q4. So I think our ability to manage it quickly was pretty darn good in that quarter. If it's over a longer period of time, and I'm inferring some -- the way you're asking it, if you started to see a much broader base, soft consumer environment, it's going to last. Our ability to last is substantially greater. I'd also remind you that in any given quarter, we have a lot of volatilities, as you've now seen. But in places like Innerwear, over the period of a year or so, those types of things will start to work themselves out. In fact, in both 2008 and 2009, men's underwear, while it had a lot of volatile quarter, ended up slightly up in both of those years. But over a period of a year or more, our ability to react is pretty high. The great thing about our business is we've got a lot of things that drive profitability. We've got acquisition synergies. We're independent of that -- the consumer environment. We got strong cash flow that we can use as we've talked about to pay dividends and buy back stock. We've got other acquisitions to do, and I'm very comfortable, as Gerald took you through the sales, what we need to just get to, to the low end of our sales range. A lot of it's just the acquisition wrap that we've got, plus the absence of onetime things from '15. And so we feel really good about our '16 numbers to be able to deliver them."

The outlet business for us has always been there. We're in most of the malls around the country. It's a business for us to be in. It's never going to be a growth driver. In some cases, as rents in some places have gone up, it doesn't make sense for us to be there. And if the lease comes up, we'll go ahead and exit from that particular mall. We look at everything on our 4-wall profitability basis. And as long as the thing is making money, we'll continue to keep the store. And if it's not, we'll let it wind down.

We grew revenue, 8%; operating profit, 13%; and earnings per share, 17%, once again magnifying our growth rates as you walk down the P&L. And we intend to do it again in 2016. While these are great results, make no mistake, they are not up to the high standards to which we hold ourselves at HanesBrands. We did not fully deliver on our Q4 commitments. 
While Q4 was impacted by the well-publicized retail traffic declines, frankly, we struggled a bit on the sales line all last year. So it's time to refine our approach and regain our sales momentum. We have a variety of focused initiatives designed to reenergize sales. These initiatives, which Gerald will highlight, give us confidence in our ability to firmly deliver our 2016 revenue target. 
We also expect another year of double-digit earnings growth, growing EPS 11% to 15%. Importantly, we can achieve the low end of this range just with our expected acquisition synergies, our historical level of SG&A leverage and the projected contribution from share repurchases. 
In terms of cash flow, we have several action plans in place that put us on track to generate up to $850 million this year, which would be the highest level on our history. To put this in perspective, this is the amount of cumulative cash flow we generated in the first 3 years as a public company. 
Turning to acquisitions. Both DBA, now renamed Hanes Europe, and Knights Apparel continued to perform extremely well. Operating results were above plan, the integrations are progressing on schedule and we are on target to deliver $40 million in synergies this year. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have turned our attention to 2016 acquisitions. A number of variables obviously need to fall into place. But with the integration of Knights Apparel and Hanes Europe now in full swing, we have the bandwidth to take on additional acquisitions. 
So in closing, we are refocusing on driving our top line, and we are well positioned for another year of double-digit EPS growth with upside provided by potential future acquisitions. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."

We have a lot of things working very well in our business, such as our innovations, our supply chain efficiencies, our margin-enhancement strategies and our acquisitions. And this is evidenced by 3 consecutive years of double-digit growth in both operating profit and earnings per share. However, the fourth quarter did not turn out as we had expected. Retail traffic declined in high single-digit rates in November and the first 3 weeks of December, driven by one of the warmest holidays on record. The prolonged traffic decline weighed on point-of-sale trends, even in our Innerwear products as there were fewer people in the stores. This caused retailers to pull back on their orders, which in turn impacted our shipments for the quarter. The impact was across all channels, and relative to our expectations, it was split between our Innerwear and Activewear segments. Relative to last year, the lion's share of the decline was in Activewear as Innerwear sales were down only 2% in the quarter. 
As retail traffic improved in the last 2 weeks of December and into January, so did our point-of-sale trends. Looking at January, our basics POS is up low single digits month-to-date, while Champion in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels is up low double digits. 
While weather affected Q4 and our POS is rebounding from that, our core business in 2015 was essentially flat for the year, and I am not at all satisfied with that level of performance. So we're being proactive by putting in place several focused initiatives to drive improved revenue growth in 2016 and beyond, and this is something I am committed to deliver. 
Let me take you through why I'm so confident that we can achieve our sales guidance for 2016, which calls for growth of 1% on the low end of the range and 3% on the high end. To reach the low end of our range, we only need about $70 million of incremental sales, which we should be able to hit with the $50 million from acquisition contributions and the absence of last year's $50 million to $60 million of Innerwear headwinds from the retail inventory destocking and our intimates brand transition, partially offset by approximately $40 million in currency headwinds. From there, the execution of our various sales initiatives as well as a more normalized Q4, represents another $100 million to $150 million in revenue opportunity that could put us at/or above the high end of our range. 
There are 4 specific sales initiatives that I have the organization focused on delivering. One, continue to drive Innovate-to-Elevate by expanding space of our successful innovation platforms such as X-TEMP; two, apply Innovate-to-Elevate to our core products by driving innovation and making the right investments to deliver better volume growth; three, continue to accelerate growth online and build upon our leading market share positions across all of our brands; and four, deliver product enhancements in Champion across all channels. 
With my focus on reenergizing sales growth, I want to emphasize that these efforts and investments will still come with the same focus on profitability and cash flow generation. And you can see that in our guidance, which calls for roughly 100 basis points of operating margin expansion, driven by our acquisition synergies as well as our continued focus on effectively managing our SG&A. 
We also intend to deliver a record level of cash flow this year. Rick will walk you through the various drivers of our cash flow, but let me talk to the largest contributor, inventory. To bring our inventory level down in a cost-efficient manner, we will need to make small adjustments to our manufacturing production schedule, which we'll do by taking a little time-out, internalizing additional production and by drawing down our raw materials and work in process. 
So in closing, our brand is strong. Our innovation is working. We're expanding our margins, and we're generating significant synergies from acquisitions. Add to this the heavy focus I have on executing our sales initiatives, and I feel really good about our ability to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

Last quarter, I spoke about how we create strong shareholder returns through the combination of our core business strategies or acquisition strategies and our cash deployment strategies. This is the underlying formula that drives the magnification of our growth rate from sales to operating profit and again to earnings per share. 2015 was the third year in a row we've delivered on magnifying our growth rate down the P&L, and we believe we're able to -- we believe we're well positioned to do it again in 2016. 
Before I turn to the results, I'd like to point everyone to our FAQ document, which provides additional details on our 2015 results as well as our 2016 guidance. For 2015, the 8% increase in revenue was driven by acquisitions as our core business ended flat with the sales decline in Q4. Operating profit increased 13% or nearly $100 million due to the addition of roughly $50 million from acquisitions and a 150 basis point increase in our core operating margin as we benefited from efficiency gains in our supply chain, synergies from acquisitions and ongoing cost controls. 
Earnings per share grew 17%, driven by the growth in operating profit and slightly lower tax rate and the contribution from share repurchases. And cash flow from operations was $227 million. The weaker-than-expected cash flow was the result of an inventory buildup due to the sales shortfall coming very late in the year. With no markdown risk and specific action plans to reduce inventory, we believe the impact was temporary. 
Turning to our 2016 guidance. We expect full year sales to be $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, which represents a 1% to 3% increase over last year. And as Gerald highlighted, we have a variety of focused initiatives that give us confidence on our ability to deliver on our revenue target. We expect operating profit to be $920 million to $950 million, which implies a 90 to 110 basis point increase in our operating profit margin and includes roughly $40 million of acquisition synergies. 
Our EPS guidance of $1.85 to $1.91 represents 11% to 15% growth over last year and includes the following assumptions: interest and other expense is expected to be $115 million to $120 million. Our tax rate is expected to be 10% to 11%. And in terms of share repurchases, we expect to spend a similar amount to last year. 
Finally, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $750 million to $850 million. Using the midpoint of our guidance ranges, this represents an increase of roughly $575 million from last year, which is being driven by 4 main factors; first, more than $300 million from improved working capital, driven by reduced inventory; second, roughly $140 million from a lower expected cash XA charges, absent any new acquisitions; third, roughly $60 million from expected growth in adjusted net income; and fourth, a $60 million reduction in our pension contribution. 
With over $300 million of cash on our balance sheet at year-end, a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2.3x as well as our expected cash generation in 2016, we are extremely well positioned to continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy. And our strategy is simple: use our cash flow to fund capital investments in our dividend, use debt for acquisitions and use excess free cash flow to buy back stock. 
So in summary, we've generated significant shareholder value over the past several years. And with our focus on driving sales growth, along with our continued execution on expanding our margins, we are well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit EPS growth. Add to that about $800 million in expected cash flow as well as upside from potential acquisitions, and we feel really good about 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

And December was actually the warmest, and you could actually see the correlation. As temperature got above normal, retail traffic was dropped, and then we saw it impact our POS. So I think a lot of it was clearly impacted by that. How much is overall consumer spending? You can't really tell. But clearly, I think it was a very unusual holiday period. That said, you expect it to be in our cold-weather Activewear areas. It was. That was down about 12% in the quarter. But it was so strong, it actually impacted Innerwear, which when you take out the 53rd week, was actually down 2% in the quarter.

First, we're going to keep doing what's working, and that clearly is Innovate-to-Elevate is working. Our innovation platforms like X-TEMP and our elevated product in Champion are all driving sales increases, and we're gaining additional space that we'll have in -- going in place for 2016. There are 2 areas there where we will refine our strategies a bit. One is in the area of accelerating our growth online. The online channel continues to grow very rapidly, and apparel now, 18% of apparel sales are online. We're well positioned there. Our brands hold leading shares already. And our sales, while there -- 7% of our sales are done online today, they're also growing in a double-digit rate. So we -- and actually one of our largest customers now, our eighth largest customer is a large pure player that sales online is growing at 70% -- approximately 70% rate. So we're going to invest more resources to drive this business faster, both people. We're dedicating more people resources as well as marketing investment to maximize our position in this channel. Secondly, we're rebalancing our focus a bit on driving our core volume and really in 2 areas. If we look at our core business, we've stayed behind our core innovation such as TAGLESS for a number of years in our underwear business, for example. And it's time to drive new innovation there. So you'll see innovation coming across our core basics business late in '16 and into '17. And secondly, you'll see us rebalancing our media to focus more balanced across both the core and our innovation platforms over time. We think these are good strategies that take the best of what we're doing that moderately refines our strategy against basics and gives us confidence that we are well positioned to deliver on our guidance for 2016."

You've got manufacturing cost savings that will flow through. And again, some of -- that will be offset somewhat by the cost associated with the inventory reduction. And so we think that the operating -- or the gross profit margin improvement this year will be a little more modest than what we've seen in recent years. But remember, the recent years have been distorted a little bit by things like DBA's P&L structure, which has much higher gross profit margins and much higher SG&A. That's now kind of the flow -- we've now seen that flow through our P&L, and it's now a part of who we are. So let's -- so we think basically the same drivers, just a little more modest growth than what we've seen."

So I think our ability to manage it quickly was pretty darn good in that quarter. If it's over a longer period of time, and I'm inferring some -- the way you're asking it, if you started to see a much broader base, soft consumer environment, it's going to last. Our ability to last is substantially greater. I'd also remind you that in any given quarter, we have a lot of volatilities, as you've now seen. But in places like Innerwear, over the period of a year or so, those types of things will start to work themselves out. In fact, in both 2008 and 2009, men's underwear, while it had a lot of volatile quarter, ended up slightly up in both of those years. But over a period of a year or more, our ability to react is pretty high. The great thing about our business is we've got a lot of things that drive profitability. We've got acquisition synergies. We're independent of that -- the consumer environment. We got strong cash flow that we can use as we've talked about to pay dividends and buy back stock. We've got other acquisitions to do, and I'm very comfortable, as Gerald took you through the sales, what we need to just get to, to the low end of our sales range. A lot of it's just the acquisition wrap that we've got, plus the absence of onetime things from '15. And so we feel really good about our '16 numbers to be able to deliver them."

And so while it's something that's out there, as you said, it's a relatively small business. And it will continue to be on our list. What we're focused on is there's lots of ways for us to create value with acquisition. There's a lot of different types of companies that fit our 4 criteria.

Point-of-sale trends have rebounded from their severely negative levels in Q4. Our acquisition synergies are ramping on schedule, and our initiatives to reenergize sales growth are on track.

We delivered solid results for the first quarter, but more importantly, we made significant progress on our sales initiatives, our inventory actions and our integrations.
So let me speak to these in order. Starting with our sales initiatives. If you recall last quarter, I walked you through several initiatives that I had the organization focused on delivering. One of the initiatives is to expand the space of our successful Innovate-to-Elevate platforms. For 2016, we secured new space for various X-TEMP products in the mass and mid-tier channels. 
A second initiative is to ensure we are focusing on our core products with the right balance of promotion, media and innovation. During the first quarter, we began rebalancing our marketing features to drive our core, and the initial sell-through results were positive. As we look to the second half, we're on track to launch our next big innovation directly into our core. 
And the third initiative is to drive online growth. As the migration to online accelerates, we are reallocating our personnel and marketing resources to capture this consumer shift. In the first quarter, our U.S. online sales across all channels increased 15% over last year and now represent 8% of our domestic sales.
I feel really good about the progress we have made. While these initiatives are not expected to fully impact sales growth until the second half of the year, our progress to date gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our 1% to 3% revenue growth guidance for the year.
Turning to our inventory reduction actions. Recall that the bulk of these actions are expected to come in the first half, while the reduction in our inventory level is expected to begin in the third quarter and continue through the end of the year. During the first quarter, we took time out within our manufacturing network, we lowered the use of external sourcing and we reduced raw material purchases. We expect to complete essentially all of these actions in the second quarter. We're on track to reduce our inventory as planned, and this gives us confidence in our ability to deliver our cash flow guidance for the year. 
Next, I'd like to provide an update on our acquisition integrations. Beginning with Hanes Europe. We're making great progress on our synergies and remain on track to deliver EUR 100 million of annual operating profit by the end of 2018.
The insourcing of production continues to ramp up, and we've begun reducing SG&A, as 120 people exited our operations in France at the end of the quarter. We've completed nearly 8,000 action items and are about 2/3 of the way through the integration.
Touching briefly on their business. Hanes Europe had a solid quarter, delivering operating profit that was slightly ahead of plan. The European price increases are now in place, and we're on track to generate substantial profit growth this year as synergies ramp.
Turning to Knights Apparel. We have completed essentially all of the integration actions and are on track to double their operating profit by 2018. 
With respect to our Champion Japan acquisition, this integration is complete, and we now generate roughly $140 million in sales in Japan between our Champion and Hanes product lines. 
Lastly, we have begun our initial integration planning for Champion Europe. We're excited about the significant revenue growth opportunity for the Champion brand, and we are on track for mid-year close.
Overall, our integrations are progressing on or ahead of schedule, which not only gives us confidence in our ability to deliver $40 million of synergy benefits this year, but also provides us with the bandwidth to do additional acquisitions. 
So in summary, our strategies are working, our acquisition synergies are ramping on schedule, we're progressing on our initiatives to reenergize sales growth and we're on track to reduce our inventory levels, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to drive low single-digit sales growth and double-digit EPS growth in 2016 and beyond. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

We delivered another record first quarter. The combination of our margin enhancement strategies, our acquisition strategies and our capital allocation strategies drove an 18% increase in our earnings per share, once again highlighting the power of our business model to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.
Now let me give you some color on the quarter. Sales increased 1% over last year, driven by the contribution from Knights Apparel and the 1% growth in our Innerwear segment, which was partially offset by $12 million of currency headwinds. As expected, our gross profit margin declined from last year. Efficiency gains from the supply chain were more than offset by the recognition of certain inventory reduction costs, which resulted in a 20 basis point decline in our margin. Our costs were close to $20 million of inventory-related costs this year, $8 million of which hit our P&L in the first quarter, with the majority of the remaining costs expected to come in the second quarter.
SG&A costs in the quarter declined approximately 130 basis points to 25.8% of sales. Key drivers of this improvement were synergies from acquisitions, planned catalog circulation reductions and tight cost controls. This resulted in a 110 basis point increase in our operating profit margin to 12.1%.
Our earnings per share of $0.26 was an increase of 18% over last year. The $0.04 improvement includes $0.01 from operational performance, $0.01 from the 2015 share repurchases and $0.02 of expense timing between the first and second quarters. 
And lastly, our cash flow from operations was a use of $285 million, roughly in line with our expectations.
Turning to guidance. We reiterated our full 2016 guidance, which does not yet include the impact from Champion Europe. Looking at the key components, we expect sales of $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, which represents a 1% to 3% increase over last year. We expect operating profit to be $920 million to $950 million, which, at the mid-point, implies a 100 basis point increase in our operating profit margin.
We expect EPS of $1.85 to $1.91, which represents 11% to 15% growth over last year. And we expect cash flow from operations to be $750 million to $850 million. 
So in closing, we're off to a great start in 2016, and we're well positioned to deliver on our guidance. Looking forward, as we execute on our proven long-term strategies, we believe we're well positioned to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns for many years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.."

Let me just start with saying that, overall, the business was up 3%. In the quarter, the sports license apparel business performed particularly well, both the gear business, and we did have the ramp of the Knights Apparel acquisition in the quarter. Underneath that, to dig a little deeper, the Champion business did experience in sports and department stores experienced the headwind of The Sports Authority bankruptcy in the quarter. Now while it's not particularly big to the total company's only about 0.5% of sales. It's a big customer within that mix. And so that business overall was flat for the quarter. When you peel that back, the rest of the business was actually up nicely double-digit rate. So the core business is sound, just a little bit of headwind there from the TSA perspective. The POS in that business is up double digits as well in the core business. So we see nice fundamentals there. That Champion at mass business is -- we are in the final changes every doing that product.

We delivered solid results for the first quarter, but more importantly, we made significant progress on our sales initiatives, our inventory actions and our integrations.So let me speak to these in order, starting with our sales initiative",674,"Thanks, Rich. We delivered solid results for the first quarter, but more importantly, we made significant progress on our sales initiatives, our inventory actions and our integrations.
So let me speak to these in order, starting with our sales initiatives. If you recall last quarter, I walked you through several initiatives that I had the organization focused on delivering. One of the initiatives is to expand the space of our successful Innovate-to-Elevate platforms. For 2016, we secured new space for various X-TEMP products in the mass and mid-tier channels. 
A second initiative is to ensure we are focusing on our core products with the right balance of promotion, media and innovation. During the first quarter, we began rebalancing our marketing features to drive our core, and the initial sell-through results were positive. As we look to the second half, we're on track to launch our next big innovation directly into our core. 
And our third initiative is to drive online growth. As the migration to online accelerates, we are reallocating our personnel and marketing resources to capture this consumer shift. In the first quarter, our U.S. online sales across all channels increased 15% over last year and now represent 8% of our domestic sales.
I feel really good about the progress we have made. While these initiatives are not expected to fully impact sales growth until the second half of the year, our progress to date gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our 1% to 3% revenue growth guidance for the year.
Turning to our inventory reduction actions. Recall that the bulk of these actions are expected to come in the first half, while the reduction in our inventory level is expected to begin in the third quarter and continue through the end of the year. During the first quarter, we took time out within our manufacturing network, we lowered the use of external sourcing and we reduced raw material purchases. We expect to complete essentially all of these actions in the second quarter. We're on track to reduce our inventory as planned, and this gives us confidence in our ability to deliver our cash flow guidance for the year. 
Next, I'd like to provide an update on our acquisition integrations, beginning with Hanes Europe. We're making great progress on our synergies and remain on track to deliver EUR 100 million of annual operating profit by the end of 2018.
The insourcing of production continues to ramp up, and we've begun reducing SG&A, as 120 people exited our operations in France at the end of the quarter. We've completed nearly 8,000 action items and are about 2/3 of the way through the integration.
Touching briefly on their business. Hanes Europe had a solid quarter, delivering operating profit that was slightly ahead of plan. The European price increases are now in place, and we're on track to generate substantial profit growth this year as synergies ramp.
Turning to Knights Apparel. We have completed essentially all of the integration actions and are on track to double their operating profit by 2018. 
With respect to our Champion Japan acquisition, this integration is complete, and we now generate roughly $140 million in sales in Japan between our Champion and Hanes product lines. 
Lastly, we have begun our initial integration planning for Champion Europe. We're excited about the significant revenue growth opportunity for the Champion brand, and we are on track for mid-year close.
Overall, our integrations are progressing on or ahead of schedule, which not only gives us confidence in our ability to deliver $40 million of synergy benefits this year, but also provides us with the bandwidth to do additional acquisitions. 
So in summary, our strategies are working, our acquisition synergies are ramping on schedule, we're progressing on our initiatives to reenergize sales growth and we're on track to reduce our inventory levels, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to drive low single-digit sales growth and double-digit EPS growth in 2016 and beyond. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

We delivered another record first quarter. The combination of our margin enhancement strategies, our acquisition strategies and our capital allocation strategies drove an 18% increase in our earnings per share, once again highlighting the power of our business model to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.
Now let me give you some color on the quarter. Sales increased 1% over last year, driven by the contribution from Knights Apparel and the 1% growth in our Innerwear segment, which was partially offset by $12 million of currency headwinds. As expected, our gross profit margin declined from last year. Efficiency gains from the supply chain were more than offset by the recognition of certain inventory reduction costs, which resulted in a 20 basis point decline in our margin. 
Our guidance calls for close to $20 million of inventory-related costs this year, $8 million of which hit our P&L in the first quarter, with the majority of the remaining costs expected to come in the second quarter.
SG&A cost in the quarter declined approximately 130 basis points to 25.8% of sales. Key drivers of this improvement were synergies from acquisitions, planned catalog circulation reductions and tight cost controls. This resulted in a 110 basis point increase in our operating profit margin to 12.1%.
Our earnings per share of $0.26 was an increase of 18% over last year. The $0.04 improvement includes $0.01 from operational performance, $0.01 from the 2015 share repurchases and $0.02 of expense timing between the first and second quarters. 
And lastly, our cash flow from operations was a use of $285 million, roughly in line with our expectations.
Turning to guidance. We reiterated our full 2016 guidance, which does not yet include the impact from Champion Europe. Looking at the key components, we expect sales of $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, which represents a 1% to 3% increase over last year. We expect operating profit to be $920 million to $950 million, which, at the mid-point, implies a 100 basis point increase in our operating profit margin.
We expect EPS of $1.85 to $1.91, which represents 11% to 15% growth over last year. And we expect cash flow from operations to be $750 million to $850 million. 
So in closing, we're off to a great start in 2016, and we're well positioned to deliver on our guidance. Looking forward, as we execute on our proven long-term strategies, we believe we're well positioned to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns for many years to come.

Let me just start with saying that, overall, the business was up 3%. In the quarter, the sports license apparel business performed particularly well, both the gear business, and we did have the wrap of the Knights Apparel acquisition in the quarter. Underneath that, to dig a little deeper, the Champion business did experience in sports, especially in the department stores, experienced the headwind of the Sports Authority bankruptcy in the quarter. Now while it's not particularly big to the total company, it's only about 0.5% of sales, it's a big customer within that mix. And so that business, overall, was flat for the quarter. When you peel that back, the rest of the business was actually up nicely at double-digit rate. So the core business is sound, just a little bit of headwind there from the TSA perspective. The POS in that business is up double digits as well in the core business. So we see nice fundamentals there. That Champion at mass business is -- we are in the final stages of redoing that product. It's beginning to flow in now, continues through the second half, and really project that returning to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year.

We're driving innovation in our categories, we're generating efficiencies within our supply chain, we're enhancing our margins and we're effectively allocating our capital. 
Within the first 100 days of 2016, we increased our dividend 10%, repurchased $380 million of stock and announced the acquisition of Champion Europe. Overall, the year is unfolding as we expected. Point-of-sale trends have rebounded from their severely negative levels in Q4. Our acquisition synergies are ramping on schedule, and our initiatives to reenergize sales growth are on track. All of this gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our 2016 guidance.

We delivered solid results for the first quarter, but more importantly, we made significant progress on our sales initiatives, our inventory actions and our integrations.So let me speak to these in order, starting with our sales initiative",674,"Thanks, Rich. We delivered solid results for the first quarter, but more importantly, we made significant progress on our sales initiatives, our inventory actions and our integrations.
So let me speak to these in order, starting with our sales initiatives. If you recall last quarter, I walked you through several initiatives that I had the organization focused on delivering. One of the initiatives is to expand the space of our successful Innovate-to-Elevate platforms. For 2016, we secured new space for various X-TEMP products in the mass and mid-tier channels. 
A second initiative is to ensure we are focusing on our core products with the right balance of promotion, media and innovation. During the first quarter, we began rebalancing our marketing features to drive our core, and the initial sell-through results were positive. As we look to the second half, we're on track to launch our next big innovation directly into our core. 
And a third initiative is to drive online growth. As the migration to online accelerates, we are reallocating our personnel and marketing resources to capture this consumer shift. In the first quarter, our U.S. online sales across all channels increased 15% over last year and now represent 8% of our domestic sales.
I feel really good about the progress we have made. While these initiatives are not expected to fully impact sales growth until the second half of the year, our progress to date gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our 1% to 3% revenue growth guidance for the year.
Turning to our inventory reduction actions. Recall that the bulk of these actions are expected to come in the first half, while the reduction in our inventory level is expected to begin in the third quarter and continue through the end of the year. During the first quarter, we took time out within our manufacturing network, we lowered the use of external sourcing and we reduced raw material purchases. We expect to complete essentially all of these actions in the second quarter. We're on track to reduce our inventory as planned, and this gives us confidence in our ability to deliver our cash flow guidance for the year. 
Next, I'd like to provide an update on our acquisition integrations, beginning with Hanes Europe. We're making great progress on our synergies and remain on track to deliver EUR 100 million of annual operating profit by the end of 2018.
The insourcing of production continues to ramp up, and we've begun reducing SG&A, as 120 people exited our operations in France at the end of the quarter. We've completed nearly 8,000 action items and are about 2/3 of the way through the integration.
Touching briefly on their business. Hanes Europe had a solid quarter, delivering operating profit that was slightly ahead of plan. The European price increases are now in place, and we're on track to generate substantial profit growth this year as synergies ramp.
Turning to Knights Apparel. We've completed essentially all of the integration actions and are on track to double their operating profit by 2018. 
With respect to our Champion Japan acquisition, this integration is complete, and we now generate roughly $140 million in sales in Japan between our Champion and Hanes product lines. 
Lastly, we have begun our initial integration planning for Champion Europe. We're excited about the significant revenue growth opportunity for the Champion brand, and we are on track for a midyear close.
Overall, our integrations are progressing on or ahead of schedule, which not only gives us confidence in our ability to deliver $40 million of synergy benefits this year, but also provides us with the bandwidth to do additional acquisitions. 
So in summary, our strategies are working, our acquisition synergies are ramping on schedule, we're progressing on our initiatives to reenergize sales growth and we're on track to reduce our inventory levels, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to drive low single-digit sales growth and double-digit EPS growth in 2016 and beyond. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

We delivered another record first quarter. The combination of our margin enhancement strategies, our acquisition strategies and our capital allocation strategies drove an 18% increase in our earnings per share, once again highlighting the power of our business model to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.
Now let me give you some color on the quarter. Sales increased 1% over last year, driven by the contribution from Knights Apparel and the 1% growth in our Innerwear segment, which was partially offset by $12 million of currency headwinds. As expected, our gross profit margin declined from last year. Efficiency gains from the supply chain were more than offset by the recognition of certain inventory reduction costs, which resulted in a 20 basis point decline in our margin. 
Our guidance calls for close to $20 million of inventory-related costs this year, $8 million of which hit our P&L in the first quarter, with the majority of the remaining costs expected to come in the second quarter.
SG&A costs in the quarter declined approximately 130 basis points to 25.8% of sales. Key drivers of this improvement were synergies from acquisitions, planned catalog circulation reductions and tight cost controls. This resulted in a 110 basis point increase in our operating profit margin to 12.1%.
Our earnings per share of $0.26 was an increase of 18% over last year. The $0.04 improvement includes $0.01 from operational performance, $0.01 from the 2015 share repurchases and $0.02 of expense timing between the first and second quarters. 
And lastly, our cash flow from operations was a use of $285 million, roughly in line with our expectations.
Turning to guidance. We reiterated our full 2016 guidance, which does not yet include the impact from Champion Europe. Looking at the key components, we expect sales of $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, which represents a 1% to 3% increase over last year. We expect operating profit to be $920 million to $950 million, which, at the midpoint, implies a 100 basis point increase in our operating profit margin.
We expect EPS of $1.85 to $1.91, which represents 11% to 15% growth over last year. And we expect cash flow from operations to be $750 million to $850 million. 
So in closing, we're off to a great start in 2016, and we're well positioned to deliver on our guidance. Looking forward, as we execute on our proven long-term strategies, we believe we're well positioned to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns for many years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

Let me just start with saying that, overall, the business was up 3% in the quarter. The sports license apparel business performed particularly well, both the Gear business, and we did have the wrap of the Knights Apparel acquisition in the quarter. Underneath that, to dig a little deeper, the Champion business did experience in sports, especially in the department stores, experienced the headwind of the Sports Authority bankruptcy in the quarter. Now while it's not particularly big to the total company, it's only about 0.5% of sales, it's a big customer within that mix. And so that business, overall, was flat for the quarter. When you peel that back, the rest of the business was actually up nicely at double-digit rate. So the core business is sound, just a little bit of headwind there from the TSA perspective. The POS in that business is up double digits as well in the core business. So we see nice fundamentals there. The Champion at mass business is -- we are in the final stages of redoing that product. It's beginning to flow in now, continues through the second half, and really project that returning to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year. So when we look at all that together, we're optimistic about as we turn the corner on that business, that we'll see nice, positive growth through the year."

And as Rick said, we don't actually cross the line below until it actually -- I think the projection's about July, which you wouldn't see until -- in Q3. So we've done all -- many of the things, or they'll be finished within the second quarter. And then inventory will just bleed off through the rest of the year. It's almost like it's math at that point."

We're driving innovation in our categories, we're generating efficiencies within our supply chain, we're enhancing our margins and we're effectively allocating our capital. 
Within the first 100 days of 2016, we increased our dividend 10%, repurchased $380 million of stock and announced the acquisition of Champion Europe. Overall, the year is unfolding as we expected. Point-of-sale trends have rebounded from their severely negative levels in Q4. Our acquisition synergies are ramping on schedule, and our initiatives to reenergize sales growth are on track. All of this gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our 2016 guidance. Add to this our continued focus on executing our long-term strategies, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver double-digit EPS growth for many years to come.

We delivered solid results for the first quarter, but more importantly, we made significant progress on our sales initiatives, our inventory actions and our integrations.So let me speak to these in order, starting with our sales initiative",674,"Thanks, Rich. We delivered solid results for the first quarter, but more importantly, we made significant progress on our sales initiatives, our inventory actions and our integrations.
So let me speak to these in order, starting with our sales initiatives. If you recall last quarter, I walked you through several initiatives that I had the organization focused on delivering. One of the initiatives is to expand the space of our successful Innovate-to-Elevate platforms. For 2016, we secured new space for various X-TEMP products in the mass and mid-tier channels. 
A second initiative is to ensure we are focusing on our core products with the right balance of promotion, media and innovation. During the first quarter, we began rebalancing our marketing features to drive our core, and the initial sell-through results were positive. As we look to the second half, we're on track to launch our next big innovation directly into our core. 
And a third initiative is to drive online growth. As the migration to online accelerates, we are reallocating our personnel and marketing resources to capture this consumer shift. In the first quarter, our U.S. online sales across all channels increased 15% over last year and now represent 8% of our domestic sales.
I feel really good about the progress we have made. While these initiatives are not expected to fully impact sales growth until the second half of the year, our progress to date gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our 1% to 3% revenue growth guidance for the year.
Turning to our inventory reduction actions. Recall that the bulk of these actions are expected to come in the first half, while the reduction in our inventory level is expected to begin in the third quarter and continue through the end of the year. During the first quarter, we took time out within our manufacturing network, we lowered the use of external sourcing and we reduced raw material purchases. We expect to complete essentially all of these actions in the second quarter. We're on track to reduce our inventory as planned, and this gives us confidence in our ability to deliver our cash flow guidance for the year. 
Next, I'd like to provide an update on our acquisition integrations, beginning with Hanes Europe. We're making great progress on our synergies and remain on track to deliver EUR 100 million of annual operating profit by the end of 2018.
The insourcing of production continues to ramp up, and we've begun reducing SG&A, as 120 people exited our operations in France at the end of the quarter. We've completed nearly 8,000 action items and are about 2/3 of the way through the integration.
Touching briefly on their business. Hanes Europe had a solid quarter, delivering operating profit that was slightly ahead of plan. The European price increases are now in place, and we're on track to generate substantial profit growth this year as synergies ramp.
Turning to Knights Apparel. We've completed essentially all of the integration actions and are on track to double their operating profit by 2018. 
With respect to our Champion Japan acquisition, this integration is complete, and we now generate roughly $140 million in sales in Japan between our Champion and Hanes product lines. 
Lastly, we have begun our initial integration planning for Champion Europe. We're excited about the significant revenue growth opportunity for the Champion brand, and we are on track for a midyear close.
Overall, our integrations are progressing on or ahead of schedule, which not only gives us confidence in our ability to deliver $40 million of synergy benefits this year, but also provides us with the bandwidth to do additional acquisitions. 
So in summary, our strategies are working, our acquisition synergies are ramping on schedule, we're progressing on our initiatives to reenergize sales growth and we're on track to reduce our inventory levels, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to drive low single-digit sales growth and double-digit EPS growth in 2016 and beyond. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

We delivered another record first quarter. The combination of our margin enhancement strategies, our acquisition strategies and our capital allocation strategies drove an 18% increase in our earnings per share, once again highlighting the power of our business model to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.
Now let me give you some color on the quarter. Sales increased 1% over last year, driven by the contribution from Knights Apparel and the 1% growth in our Innerwear segment, which was partially offset by $12 million of currency headwinds. As expected, our gross profit margin declined from last year. Efficiency gains from the supply chain were more than offset by the recognition of certain inventory reduction costs, which resulted in a 20 basis point decline in our margin. 
Our guidance calls for close to $20 million of inventory-related costs this year, $8 million of which hit our P&L in the first quarter, with the majority of the remaining costs expected to come in the second quarter.
SG&A costs in the quarter declined approximately 130 basis points to 25.8% of sales. Key drivers of this improvement were synergies from acquisitions, planned catalog circulation reductions and tight cost controls. This resulted in a 110 basis point increase in our operating profit margin to 12.1%.
Our earnings per share of $0.26 was an increase of 18% over last year. The $0.04 improvement includes $0.01 from operational performance, $0.01 from the 2015 share repurchases and $0.02 of expense timing between the first and second quarters. 
And lastly, our cash flow from operations was a use of $285 million, roughly in line with our expectations.
Turning to guidance. We reiterated our full 2016 guidance, which does not yet include the impact from Champion Europe. Looking at the key components, we expect sales of $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, which represents a 1% to 3% increase over last year. We expect operating profit to be $920 million to $950 million, which, at the midpoint, implies a 100 basis point increase in our operating profit margin.
We expect EPS of $1.85 to $1.91, which represents 11% to 15% growth over last year. And we expect cash flow from operations to be $750 million to $850 million. 
So in closing, we're off to a great start in 2016, and we're well positioned to deliver on our guidance. Looking forward, as we execute on our proven long-term strategies, we believe we're well positioned to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns for many years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

Let me just start with saying that, overall, the business was up 3% in the quarter. The sports license apparel business performed particularly well, both the Gear business, and we did have the wrap of the Knights Apparel acquisition in the quarter. Underneath that, to dig a little deeper, the Champion business did experience in sports, especially in the department stores, experienced the headwind of the Sports Authority bankruptcy in the quarter. Now while it's not particularly big to the total company, it's only about 0.5% of sales, it's a big customer within that mix. And so that business, overall, was flat for the quarter. When you peel that back, the rest of the business was actually up nicely at double-digit rate. So the core business is sound, just a little bit of headwind there from the TSA perspective. The POS in that business is up double digits as well in the core business. So we see nice fundamentals there. The Champion at mass business is -- we are in the final stages of redoing that product. It's beginning to flow in now, continues through the second half, and really project that returning to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year. So when we look at all that together, we're optimistic about as we turn the corner on that business, that we'll see nice, positive growth through the year."

I'd like to take this opportunity to reflect back a little but also to frame our future. 
Over the last 10 years, we've had 3 distinct phases: the first to transform our supply chain and cost structure to make us competitive globally; the second, to drive Innovate-to-Elevate to expand our operating margins; and the third, grafting both of these strategies onto acquisitions. 
Over that time, we've built a strong business model that creates value by nurturing world-class brands, delivering innovation to a broad base of consumers, driving volume through our highly efficient global supply chain and effectively deploying our cash flow.
The results have been great for all stakeholders. Over this decade, we have increased revenue from $4 billion to nearly $7 billion, allowing us to expand our employment base from 50,000 to 70,000 people. We have completed 8 acquisitions, mainly internationally, with international sales now close to 1/3 of the business. But we paid attention to more than just expanding the business. We have won numerous awards for our community support, our environmental efforts and have also been recognized as a great place to work. All of this superb effort can be seen in our financial results. We increased operating profit from $400 million to over $1 billion, growing earnings per share from $0.37 to over $2, a 20% compound annual growth rate for the decade, and generated more than $4 billion in cash flow from operations.
But what's even more exciting is our future, as these proven strategies have significant scale and are repeatable. At our current profit run rate, we should be able to generate the next $4 billion of cash flow in less than half the time, which positions us extremely well to continue to annually generate solid double-digit shareholder returns and when you combine this with our experienced management team and the breadth of talent within our organization. That's why I truly believe that for HanesBrands, the best is yet to come.
Before I go, let me add that the last 10 years has been an amazing journey and one that I am deeply proud to have taken with all of you and all of the HanesBrands employees around the world. I had the pleasure of working with this management team for the past decade and, in case of Gerald, over 25 years. Under Gerald's leadership, we created a low-cost, global supply chain, the strength in our world-class brands with Innovate-to-Elevate and seamlessly integrated several acquisitions. The company is in great hands, and I look forward to seeing the next phase unfold as Gerald and the organization takes the business to new heights.
And with that, I am pleased to turn things over to our CEO-elect, who will talk about delivering on our fourth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. Gerald?"

On behalf of all the employees at HanesBrands, we greatly appreciate your leadership over the past decade. And we look forward to continuing to drive our strategies and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. On a personal note, I've thoroughly enjoyed our working relationship over the past 25 years, and I wish you nothing but the best.
Coming into the year, we knew we were facing a tough comparison in the second quarter due to X-TEMP and Champion pipes that drove last year's mid-single digit growth in basics and 42% growth in Champion in the sports specialty and department store channels, and we planned for it. Year-to-date, our results are right where we expected them to be in terms of sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow from operations. More importantly, we reiterated our guidance for the full year, which, at their midpoints, calls for 8% growth in revenue, 11% growth in operating profit, 16% growth in EPS and $800 million in cash flow from operations.
As we look to the back half of the year, we believe we are very well positioned to achieve our guidance as our key initiatives are unfolding as expected. While there are many initiatives driving our confidence in delivering on the second half, let me highlight 4 specific examples. First, our inventory reduction actions are complete and delivering their intended results, adjusting for the addition of Champion Europe, our inventory decline from the first quarter's level, which in turn helped drive the strong cash flow performance in the quarter. We expect our inventory, excluding Champion Europe and Pacific Brands, to continue to decline through the second half of the year, and we're firmly on track to achieve our cash flow guidance.
Second, the initiative that I laid out at the beginning of the year to drive volume growth in our core Innerwear business is gaining traction. For the quarter, we grew market share in men's underwear, women's panties and socks. Moreover, our focus on the core initiative positions us well for the second half. We have targeted promotions in place for both back-to-school and holiday. We're also set to begin advertising behind our new innovation, Fresh IQ.
Fresh IQ is an odor control technology that mechanically attacks bacteria. This is a great innovation that, we believe, has the potential to impact the overall apparel category. In fact, we've seen some of our highest advertising testing ever with this new product, and the reception by our retailers has been strong. The benefits of Fresh IQ span both Innerwear and Activewear and is now in the market men's underwear, socks and certain Champion products. 
Third, the integrations of Hanes Europe and Knights Apparel are tracking to plan, which puts us on schedule to deliver $40 million in synergies this year. 
And the fourth example driving our confidence in delivering on the second half is that we closed our 2 most recent acquisitions: Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. 
Touching briefly on these acquisitions, we're extremely excited about the addition of these great businesses. Not only do they provide us with strong management teams, but they also provide a nice balance between mid- to high single-digit revenue growth and margin expansion opportunity through synergies. Both management teams have already been to our headquarters, and we are well underway in developing our detailed integration plans. 
So in summary, we are confident in our outlook for the second half. Our results year-to-date are right in line with our plan, and our key initiatives for the second half are unfolding as expected. Looking beyond this year, our goal is to continue to drive our successful setup strategies and leverage our strong business model, which we believe positions us to deliver, on average, mid-single digit revenue growth and double-digit earnings per share growth for many years to come. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

While our second quarter results declined over last year, our Q2 plan called for a decline due to the tough comparisons in basics and Champion as well as quarterly timing shifts in shipments. Year-to-date, our results are right in line wit",1054,"Thanks, Gerald. While our second quarter results declined over last year, our Q2 plan called for a decline due to the tough comparisons in basics and Champion as well as quarterly timing shifts in shipments. Year-to-date, our results are right in line with our expectations for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow.
We reiterated our guidance for the full year, and this was driven by 3 factors: one, the challenges in the overall retail environment were already reflected on our guidance when it was initially set back in February; two, our year-to-date results were in line with our plan; and three, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the second half, as our sales initiatives have traction and are ramping, our acquisitions are generating synergies and our inventory reduction actions are working.
Now let me speak to our performance during the quarter. Beginning with our Innerwear segment. The sequential sales growth in the quarter was right in line with historical trends. And for quarter, the sales performance mirrored the broader retail environment, with a soft April and May giving way to a stronger June. In fact, our Innerwear sales were up 10% in the month of June, with strength continuing into July. Margins in the quarter were strong with segment operating margins of 24.2%. 
Turning to Activewear. The sales decline was driven by our Hanes Activewear business, as our U.S. Champion business was flat when compared to last year. 
Looking at Champion by channel. We saw mid-single digit revenue growth in mass and mid-teens growth in the college bookstore channel. This was offset by declines in the sporting goods mid-tier and department store channels, which were impacted by bankruptcies and a tough comparison as we had a significant concentration of shipments in last year's second quarter.
With respect to profitability, Activewear's operating margins held above 15%, as SG&A controls helped to partially offset the volume decline. 
Switching to international. Sales in the quarter increased by 2%, driven by strength in Europe and Asia. Operating profit increased 14%, while operating margins expanded 90 basis points. Hanes Europe delivered another solid quarter, with sales up 1%, driven by hosiery in France and bras in Spain, while operating margins improved 350 basis points to nearly 9%. We expect continued strong performance in our international business in the second half due to Hanes Europe synergies, momentum in Asia as well as the addition of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands.
Looking at our overall results for the quarter. The decline in both our gross and operating margins was due almost exclusively to the roughly $12 million and expected costs associated with our inventory-related actions. Absent these costs, our margins would have been up slightly over last year despite the expected decline in sales as we benefited from acquisition synergies and SG&A leverage.
Interest and other expense, excluding the one-time costs associated with our refinancing actions, increased nearly $8 million due to increased debt balances, $6 million of which, or $0.01 per share in the quarter, was due to our decision to prefund our recent acquisitions. 
Given the current interest rate environment, the need to fund recent acquisitions and higher rate notes that were callable, we proactively took the opportunity during the quarter to optimize our capital structure. We lowered our overall interest rate and increase the amount of fixed rate debt on our balance sheet. Roughly 2/3 of our debt is now fixed, and we have a blended interest rate of approximately 3.6%.
Tax rate was roughly 6% during the quarter. For the first half, our tax rate was roughly 8%, which is in line with our full year guidance of a high single-digit tax rate. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.51.
If you recall from last quarter, I highlighted that the decline in our accounts payable balance was a precursor to the expected improvements in both our inventory and our cash flow, and that's exactly what we saw during the second quarter. Our inventory, excluding the $51 million from Champion Europe, declined from the first quarter's level. And this, along with improvements in accounts payable, helped drive $156 million in cash flow from operations, a record for any second quarter in our history.
Now turning to our guidance. We reiterated our full year outlook, which, at their midpoints, implies 8% growth in revenue, 11% growth in operating profit, 16% growth in EPS and $800 million in cash flow from operations. We made small adjustments to our full year estimates for CapEx and acquisition and integration charges now that we've closed the acquisitions and have begun our detailed integration plans. 
Looking at the integration of both Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. We're confident that the total charges for both acquisitions combined should be substantially below earlier acquisitions. As we've become more efficient at integration, we're able to leverage our prior foundational investments, and these integrations are less complex. We estimate the total cost to acquire and integrate both of these acquisitions to be less than $100 million, of which a little more than $50 million are expected to be recognized this year. 
With respect to these 2 acquisitions, we gave you their expected full year contributions in late May. So now let me give you the specific guidance for the quarters because it's very different due to the timing of when we closed Pac Brands and their seasonality.
About $200 million, or approximately 55% of the sales from Champion Europe and Pacific Brands, are expected to be in the fourth quarter. For total HBI, that means third quarter sales should be slightly greater than the fourth quarter, as the impact from these acquisitions temper some of our normal sales cadence. However, from a profit perspective, virtually the entire $0.04 EPS increase from late May shows up in the fourth quarter, leaving the total company's EPS for Q3 between 57 -- $0.55 and $0.57 and, for Q4, between $0.57 and $0.61.
So in closing, our overall results are tracking to plan, our inventory actions are working, our integrations are on schedule, our core sales initiatives are gaining traction and we launched our new innovation, Fresh IQ. All of this gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our guidance for the year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

We need to give innovation that we can give to our broad audience, which means we need to nurture strong brands. And if we can do that successfully, we generate a lot of cash and then we can deploy that cash, whatever the environment, to create a lot of value. Right now, it makes a lot of sense to graft those strategies on the acquisitions. That's been working for well over a decade, and that's going to continue to work many decades into the future. And that's what gives me confidence about this thing power of this company. I've said this before, I said it in 2009 in March when everything looked like it was -- the world was going to end.

And second, our low and already assumed a challenging consumer environment as that's played out through the year. And then the third is we have a number of key initiatives in mind, and they're unfolding exactly as we expected them to unfold as we execute them. As we focused and our core initiatives, we saw some initial share gains and Q2 and now we've got promotions in place. We and our core basics for back-to-school and holiday and that with our Fresh IQ initiative, our innovation coming as well. We feel great about the momentum we are carrying into the second half of the year there. As you heard Rick there, inventory reduction actions are working. The inventory's coming down, and we've got those actions behind us. And we're looking forward to more cash flow in the months and quarters ahead. Our Hanes Europe and apparel integrations continue to do extremely well, and we're on target to deliver those synergies. And then finally, we closed on Champion Europe and Pacific Brands that gives us both sales and revenue and profit momentum in the second half. So things are going exactly as we planned, and we feel very comfortable in reaffirming our guidance for the year."

The couple of ways to look at it as you pointed out, Eric, the inventory levels, absent Champion Europe, were actually down from Q2 to Q1. That's unusual. Normally, we build inventory for back-to-school. I think that shows our management inventory management processes are working. Another way to look at it, though, is to look at that at the Bill, the build is about $70 million less in the first half of this year than it was last year. So we're doing a lot to manage this inventory, and it's showing up in our cash flow. We talked about XA charges, and they're going to be significantly lower this year than they were last year. And that's obviously going to be a positive driver for cash flow from operations as well. So I look at all the factors, including improved profitability, I would not forget that in terms of driving cash flow as well.

Well, what I would say is, right now, it's in the first half of their, it's really performed as expected. It was up nicely in Q1, up over 1 percentage point in Q1. And we had expected it to be down and shipments in Q2 as we overlapped the pretty substantial space gains that we experienced in our basics business and X-TEMP last year. As we look to the balance of the year and we execute our initiatives behind our focus on the core initiative as well as we're seeing sequentially improving trends in our bra business, we feel good that we'll have very positive momentum, along with now our new innovation in Fresh IQ and the Innerwear business as we look to the second half. As I turn to the Activewear business, we were down in Q2, but again, it's expected after coming off of a strong first quarter, where we're up 2.8% in first quarter. In the Q2, Hanes Activewear was a key driver of our decline for the quarter as We had some space adjustments to some of our key customers. In Champion, we did bear the brunt of overlapping big pipes in Q2 of last year as well as we did have some headwinds from bankruptcies in the sports specialty. But they were -- Champion overall was flat because we saw mid-single digit results in our mass business and double-digit growth within our college bookstore business. And our Champion POS and sports specialty, in spite of the challenges with bankruptcies, was actually up a quite a bit in the quarter double-digit basis. So overall, we expect Activewear to return to growth as we put the Hanes Activewear adjustments in Q2 behind us. And we continue to see momentum in the business going forward. What I do -- would say, too, is on a global basis, the Champion brand had solid quarter and grew nicely in the quarter, with particular strength in Japan. As we look at Champion on a global basis in the second half, we expect that growth to continue to accelerate. And then addition of Champion Europe will just further accelerate growth on top of that."

I'd like to take this opportunity to reflect back a little but also to frame our future. 
Over the last 10 years, we've had 3 distinct phases: the first, to transform our supply chain and cost structure to make us competitive globally; the second, to drive Innovate-to-Elevate to expand our operating margins; and the third, grafting both of these strategies onto acquisitions. 
Over that time, we've built a strong business model that creates value by nurturing world-class brands, delivering innovation to a broad base of consumers, driving volume through our highly efficient global supply chain and effectively deploying our cash flow.
The results have been great for all stakeholders. Over this decade, we have increased revenue from $4 billion to nearly $7 billion, allowing us to expand our employment base from 50,000 to 70,000 people. We have completed 8 acquisitions, mainly internationally, with international sales now close to 1/3 of the business. But we paid attention to more than just expanding the business. We have won numerous awards for our community support, our environmental efforts and have also been recognized as a great place to work. All of this superb effort can be seen in our financial results. We increased operating profit from $400 million to over $1 billion, growing earnings per share from $0.37 to over $2, a 20% compound annual growth rate for the decade, and generated more than $4 billion in cash flow from operations.
But what's even more exciting is our future, as these proven strategies have significant scale and are repeatable. At our current profit run rate, we should be able to generate the next $4 billion of cash flow in less than half the time, which positions us extremely well to continue to annually generate solid double-digit shareholder returns and when you combine this with our experienced management team and the breadth of talent within our organization. That's why I truly believe that for HanesBrands, the best is yet to come.
Before I go, let me add that the last 10 years has been an amazing journey and one that I am deeply proud to have taken with all of you and all of the HanesBrands employees around the world. I had the pleasure of working with this management team for the past decade, and in case of Gerald, over 25 years. Under Gerald's leadership, we created a low-cost, global supply chain, the strength in our world-class brands with Innovate-to-Elevate and seamlessly integrated several acquisitions. The company is in great hands, and I look forward to seeing the next phase unfold as Gerald and the organization takes the business to new heights.
And with that, I am pleased to turn things over to our CEO-elect, who will talk about delivering on our fourth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. Gerald?"

On behalf of all the employees at HanesBrands, we greatly appreciate your leadership over the past decade. And we look forward to continuing to drive our strategies and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. On a personal note, I've thoroughly enjoyed our working relationship over the past 25 years, and I wish you nothing but the best.
Coming into the year, we knew we were facing a tough comparison in the second quarter due to X-TEMP and Champion pipes that drove last year's mid-single digit growth in basics and 42% growth in Champion in the sports specialty and department store channels. And we planned for it. Year-to-date, our results are right where we expected them to be in terms of sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow from operations. More importantly, we reiterated our guidance for the full year, which at their midpoints, calls for 8% growth in revenue, 11% growth in operating profit, 16% growth in EPS and $800 million in cash flow from operations.
As we look to the back half of the year, we believe we are very well positioned to achieve our guidance as our key initiatives are unfolding as expected. While there are many initiatives driving our confidence in delivering on the second half, let me highlight 4 specific examples. 
First, our inventory reduction actions are complete and delivering their intended results. Adjusting for the addition of Champion Europe, our inventory declined from the first quarter's level, which in turn, helped drive the strong cash flow performance in the quarter. We expect our inventory, excluding Champion Europe and Pacific Brands, to continue to decline through the second half of the year, and we're firmly on track to achieve our cash flow guidance.
Second, the initiative that I laid out at the beginning of the year to drive volume growth in our core Innerwear business is gaining traction. For the quarter, we grew market share in men's underwear, women's panties and socks. Moreover, our focus on the core initiative positions us well for the second half. We have targeted promotions in place for both back-to-school and holiday. We're also set to begin advertising behind our new innovation, Fresh IQ.
Fresh IQ is an odor control technology that mechanically attacks bacteria. This is a great innovation that, we believe, has the potential to impact the overall apparel category. In fact, we've seen some of our highest advertising testing ever with this new product, and the reception by our retailers has been strong. The benefits of Fresh IQ span both Innerwear and Activewear and it's now in the market in men's underwear, socks and certain Champion products. 
Third, the integrations of Hanes Europe and Knights Apparel are tracking to plan, which puts us on schedule to deliver $40 million in synergies this year. 
And the fourth example driving our confidence in delivering on the second half is that we closed our 2 most recent acquisitions: Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. 
Touching briefly on these acquisitions, we're extremely excited about the addition of these great businesses. Not only do they provide us with strong management teams, but they also provide a nice balance between mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth and margin expansion opportunity through synergies. Both management teams have already been to our headquarters, and we are well underway in developing our detailed integration plans.
So in summary, we are confident in our outlook for the second half. Our results year-to-date are right in line with our plan, and our key initiatives for the second half are unfolding as expected. Looking beyond this year, our goal is to continue to drive our successful setup strategies and leverage our strong business model, which we believe positions us to deliver, on average, mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit earnings per share growth for many years to come. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

While our second quarter results declined over last year, our Q2 plan called for a decline due to the tough comparisons in basics and Champion as well as quarterly timing shifts in shipments.

While our second quarter results declined over last year, our Q2 plan called for a decline due to the tough comparisons in basics and Champion as well as quarterly timing shifts in shipments. Year-to-date, our results are right in line with our expectations for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow.
We reiterated our guidance for the full year, and this was driven by 3 factors: one, the challenges in the overall retail environment were already reflected in our guidance when it was initially set back in February; two, our year-to-date results were in line with our plan; and three, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the second half, as our sales initiatives have traction and are ramping, our acquisitions are generating synergies and our inventory reduction actions are working.
Now let me speak to our performance during the quarter. Beginning with our Innerwear segment. The sequential sales growth in the quarter was right in line with historical trends. And for quarter, the sales performance mirrored the broader retail environment, with a soft April and May giving way to a stronger June. In fact, our Innerwear sales were up 10% in the month of June, with strength continuing into July. Margins in the quarter were strong with segment operating margins of 24.2%. 
Turning to Activewear. The sales decline was driven by our Hanes Activewear business, as our U.S. Champion business was flat when compared to last year. 
Looking at Champion by channel. We saw mid-single-digit revenue growth in mass and mid-teens growth in the college bookstore channel. This was offset by declines in the sporting goods mid-tier and department store channels, which were impacted by bankruptcies and a tough comparison as we had a significant concentration of shipments in last year's second quarter.
With respect to profitability, Activewear's operating margins held above 15%, as SG&A controls helped to partially offset the volume decline. 
Switching to international. Sales in the quarter increased by 2%, driven by strength in Europe and Asia. Operating profit increased 14%, while operating margins expanded 90 basis points. Hanes Europe delivered another solid quarter, with sales up 1%, driven by hosiery in France and bras in Spain, while operating margins improved 350 basis points to nearly 9%. We expect continued strong performance in our international business in the second half due to Hanes Europe synergies, momentum in Asia as well as the addition of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands.
Looking at our overall results for the quarter. The decline in both our gross and operating margins was due almost exclusively to the roughly $12 million in expected costs associated with our inventory-related actions. Absent these costs, our margins would have been up slightly over last year despite the expected decline in sales as we benefited from acquisition synergies and SG&A leverage.
Interest and other expense, excluding the one-time costs associated with our refinancing actions, increased nearly $8 million due to increased debt balances, $6 million of which, or $0.01 per share in the quarter, was due to our decision to prefund our recent acquisitions. 
Given the current interest rate environment, the need to fund recent acquisitions and higher rate notes that were callable, we proactively took the opportunity during the quarter to optimize our capital structure. We lowered our overall interest rate and increased the amount of fixed rate debt on our balance sheet. Roughly 2/3 of our debt is now fixed, and we have a blended interest rate of approximately 3.6%.
The tax rate was roughly 6% during the quarter. For the first half, our tax rate was roughly 8%, which is in line with our full year guidance of a high-single-digit tax rate. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.51.
If you recall from last quarter, I highlighted that the decline in our accounts payable balance was a precursor to the expected improvements in both our inventory and our cash flow, and that's exactly what we saw during the second quarter. Our inventory, excluding the $51 million from Champion Europe, declined from the first quarter's level. And this, along with improvements in accounts payable, helped drive $156 million in cash flow from operations, a record for any second quarter in our history.
Now turning to our guidance. We reiterated our full year outlook, which at their midpoints, implies 8% growth in revenue, 11% growth in operating profit, 16% growth in EPS and $800 million in cash flow from operations. We made small adjustments to our full year estimates for CapEx and acquisition and integration charges now that we've closed the acquisitions and have begun our detailed integration plans. 
Looking at the integration of both Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. We're confident that the total charges for both acquisitions combined should be substantially below earlier acquisitions. As we've become more efficient at integration, we're able to leverage our prior foundational investments, and these integrations are less complex. We estimate the total cost to acquire and integrate both of these acquisitions to be less than $100 million, of which a little more than $50 million are expected to be recognized this year. 
With respect to these 2 acquisitions, we gave you their expected full year contributions in late May. So now let me give you the specific guidance for the quarters because it's very different due to the timing of when we closed Pac Brands and their seasonality.
About $200 million, or approximately 55% of the sales from Champion Europe and Pacific Brands, are expected to be in the fourth quarter. For total HBI, that means third quarter sales should be slightly greater than the fourth quarter, as the impact from these acquisitions temper some of our normal sales cadence. However, from a profit perspective, virtually the entire $0.04 EPS increase from late May shows up in the fourth quarter, leaving the total company's EPS for Q3 between 57 -- $0.55 and $0.57, and for Q4, between $0.57 and $0.61.
So in closing, our overall results are tracking to plan. Our inventory actions are working. Our integrations are on schedule. Our core sales initiatives are getting traction and we launched our new innovation, Fresh IQ. All of this gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our guidance for the year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

And if we can do that successfully, we'd generate a lot of cash and then we can deploy that cash, whatever the environment, to create a lot of value. Right now, it makes a lot of sense to graft those strategies on to acquisitions. That's been working for well over a decade, and it's going to continue to work many decades into the future. And that's what gives me confidence about the staying power of this company. I've said this before, I said it in 2009 in March when everything looks like it was -- the world was going to end.

We're generating strong, on average, sort of mid-single digit growth in the revenue line and double-digit EPS. So there's an awful lot to like about that strategy going forward. Where we do see opportunity is certainly we have a consumer who's increasingly engaging with our brands to learn about our brands and also buy our brands online and we'll consistently -- going to put more and more effort against going where that consumer's going, both people and resources. And we're seeing good results and we're going to work at that even harder. But we're starting in a great place and we're going to build upon what we've built over the last 10 years. I think the second part of your question was about our confidence and guidance for the balance of the year. And let me just say that as we look at that, we see that, first and foremost, our first half results were right in line with our expectations. And second, our low end already assumed a challenging consumer environment as that's played out through the years. And then the third is, certainly, we had a number of key initiatives in mind, and they're unfolding exactly as we expected them to unfold as we execute them. As we focused on our core initiatives, we saw some initial share gains in Q2 and now we've got promotions in place behind our core basics for back-to-school and holiday and that with our Fresh IQ initiative, our innovation coming as well. We feel great about the momentum we're carrying into the second half of the year there. As you heard Rick say, our inventory reduction actions are working. The inventory is coming down, and we've got those actions behind us. And we're looking forward to more cash flow in the months and the quarters ahead. Our Hanes Europe and Knights apparel integrations continue to do extremely well, and we're on target to deliver those synergies. And then, finally, we closed on Champion Europe and Pacific Brands that gives us both sales and revenue -- and profit momentum in the second half. So things are going exactly as we planned, and we feel very comfortable in reaffirming our guidance for the year."

A couple of ways to look at it as you pointed out, Eric, the inventory levels, absent Champion Europe, were actually down from Q2 to Q1. That's unusual. Normally, we build inventory for back-to-school. I think that shows our management -- inventory management processes are working. Another way to look at it, though, is to look at the -- at the build. The build is about $70 million less in the first half of this year than it was last year. So we're doing a lot to manage this inventory, and it's showing up in our cash flow. We talked about XA charges. They're going to be significantly lower this year than they were last year. And that's obviously going to be a positive driver for cash flow from operations as well. So I look at all the factors, including improved profitability, I would also not forget that in terms of driving cash flow as well. Look at all the key drivers of cash flow, they're all working just as we had expected them to. So I'm feeling really good about that $800 million."

Well, what I would say is, right now, it's in the first half of their, it's really performed as we expected. It was up nicely in Q1, up over 1 percentage point in Q1. And we had expected it to be down in shipments in Q2 as we overlapped the pretty substantial space gains that we experienced in our basics business and X-TEMP last year. As we look to the balance of the year and we execute our initiatives behind our focus on the core initiative as well as we're seeing sequentially improving trends in our bra business, we feel good that we'll have very positive momentum, along with now our new innovation in Fresh IQ in the Innerwear business as we look to the second half. As I turn to the Activewear business, we were down in Q2, but again, as expected after coming off of a strong first quarter, where we were up 2.8% in first quarter. In the Q2, Hanes Activewear was a key driver of our decline for the quarter as we had some space adjustments in some of our key customers. In Champion, we did bear the brunt of overlapping big pipes in Q2 of last year as well as we did have some headwinds from bankruptcies in the sports specialty. But they were -- Champion overall was flat because we saw mid-single-digit results in our mass business and double-digit growth within our college bookstore business. And our Champion POS and sports specialty, in spite of the challenges with bankruptcies, was actually up a quite a bit in the quarter, up double-digit basis. So overall, we expect Activewear to return to growth as we put the Hanes Activewear adjustments in Q2 behind us. And we continue to see momentum in the business going forward. What I do -- would say, too, is on a global basis, the Champion brand had solid quarter and grew nicely in the quarter, with particular strength in Japan. As we look at Champion on a global basis in the second half, we expect that growth to continue to accelerate. And then the addition of Champion Europe will just further accelerate growth on top of that."

I'd like to take this opportunity to reflect back a little but also to frame our future. 
Over the last 10 years, we've had 3 distinct phases: the first, to transform our supply chain and cost structure to make us competitive globally; the second, to drive Innovate-to-Elevate to expand our operating margins; and the third, grafting both of these strategies onto acquisitions. 
Over that time, we've built a strong business model that creates value by nurturing world-class brands, delivering innovation to a broad base of consumers, driving volume through our highly efficient global supply chain and effectively deploying our cash flow.
The results have been great for all stakeholders. Over this decade, we have increased revenue from $4 billion to nearly $7 billion, allowing us to expand our employment base from 50,000 to 70,000 people. We have completed 8 acquisitions, mainly internationally, with international sales now close to 1/3 of the business. But we paid attention to more than just expanding the business. We have won numerous awards for our community support, our environmental efforts and have also been recognized as a great place to work. All of this superb effort can be seen in our financial results. We increased operating profit from $400 million to over $1 billion, growing earnings per share from $0.37 to over $2, a 20% compound annual growth rate for the decade, and generated more than $4 billion in cash flow from operations.
But what's even more exciting is our future, as these proven strategies have significant scale and are repeatable. At our current profit run rate, we should be able to generate the next $4 billion of cash flow in less than half the time, which positions us extremely well to continue to annually generate solid double-digit shareholder returns and when you combine this with our experienced management team and the breadth of talent within our organization. That's why I truly believe that for Hanesbrands, the best is yet to come.
Before I go, let me add that the last 10 years has been an amazing journey and one that I am deeply proud to have taken with all of you and all of the Hanesbrands employees around the world. I had the pleasure of working with this management team for the past decade, and in case of Gerald, over 25 years. Under Gerald's leadership, we created a low-cost, global supply chain, we strengthened our world-class brands with Innovate-to-Elevate and seamlessly integrated several acquisitions. The company is in great hands, and I look forward to seeing the next phase unfold as Gerald and the organization takes the business to new heights.
And with that, I am pleased to turn things over to our CEO-elect, who will talk about delivering on our fourth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. Gerald?"

On a personal note, I've thoroughly enjoyed our working relationship over the past 25 years, and I wish you nothing but the best.
Coming into the year, we knew we were facing a tough comparison in the second quarter due to X-TEMP and Champion pipes that drove last year's mid-single digit growth in basics and 42% growth in Champion in the sports specialty and department store channels. And we planned for it. Year-to-date, our results are right where we expected them to be in terms of sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow from operations. More importantly, we reiterated our guidance for the full year, which at their midpoints, calls for 8% growth in revenue, 11% growth in operating profit, 16% growth in EPS and $800 million in cash flow from operations.
As we look to the back half of the year, we believe we are very well positioned to achieve our guidance as our key initiatives are unfolding as expected. While there are many initiatives driving our confidence in delivering on the second half, let me highlight 4 specific examples. 
First, our inventory reduction actions are complete and delivering their intended results. Adjusting for the addition of Champion Europe, our inventory declined from the first quarter's level, which in turn, helped drive the strong cash flow performance in the quarter. We expect our inventory, excluding Champion Europe and Pacific Brands, to continue to decline through the second half of the year, and we're firmly on track to achieve our cash flow guidance.
Second, the initiative that I laid out at the beginning of the year to drive volume growth in our core Innerwear business is gaining traction. For the quarter, we grew market share in men's underwear, women's panties and socks. Moreover, our focus on the core initiative positions us well for the second half. We have targeted promotions in place for both back-to-school and holiday. We're also set to begin advertising behind our new innovation, Fresh IQ.
Fresh IQ is an odor control technology that mechanically attacks bacteria. This is a great innovation that, we believe, has the potential to impact the overall apparel category. In fact, we've seen some of our highest advertising testing ever with this new product, and the reception by our retailers has been strong. The benefits of Fresh IQ span both Innerwear and Activewear and it's now in the market in men's underwear, socks and certain Champion products. 
Third, the integrations of Hanes Europe and Knights Apparel are tracking to plan, which puts us on schedule to deliver $40 million in synergies this year. 
And the fourth example driving our confidence in delivering on the second half is that we closed our 2 most recent acquisitions: Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. 
Touching briefly on these acquisitions, we're extremely excited about the addition of these great businesses. Not only do they provide us with strong management teams, but they also provide a nice balance between mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth and margin expansion opportunity through synergies. Both management teams have already been to our headquarters, and we are well underway in developing our detailed integration plans.
So in summary, we are confident in our outlook for the second half. Our results year-to-date are right in line with our plan, and our key initiatives for the second half are unfolding as expected. Looking beyond this year, our goal is to continue to drive our successful set of strategies and leverage our strong business model, which we believe positions us to deliver, on average, mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit earnings per share growth for many years to come. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."
4212820,377234115,1022430,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gerald. While our second quarter results declined over last year, our Q2 plan called for a decline due to the tough comparisons in basics and Champion as well as quarterly timing shifts in shipments. Year-to-date, our results are right in line wit",1053,"Thanks, Gerald. While our second quarter results declined over last year, our Q2 plan called for a decline due to the tough comparisons in basics and Champion as well as quarterly timing shifts in shipments. Year-to-date, our results are right in line with our expectations for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow.
We reiterated our guidance for the full year, and this was driven by 3 factors: one, the challenges in the overall retail environment were already reflected in our guidance when it was initially set back in February; two, our year-to-date results were in line with our plan; and three, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the second half, as our sales initiatives have traction and are ramping, our acquisitions are generating synergies and our inventory reduction actions are working.
Now let me speak to our performance during the quarter. Beginning with our Innerwear segment. The sequential sales growth in the quarter was right in line with historical trends. And for quarter, the sales performance mirrored the broader retail environment, with a soft April and May giving way to a stronger June. In fact, our Innerwear sales were up 10% in the month of June, with strength continuing into July. Margins in the quarter were strong with segment operating margins of 24.2%. 
Turning to Activewear. The sales decline was driven by our Hanes Activewear business, as our U.S. Champion business was flat when compared to last year. 
Looking at Champion by channel. We saw mid-single-digit revenue growth in mass and mid-teens growth in the college bookstore channel. This was offset by declines in the sporting goods mid-tier and department store channels, which were impacted by bankruptcies and a tough comparison as we had a significant concentration of shipments in last year's second quarter.
With respect to profitability, Activewear's operating margins held above 15%, as SG&A controls helped to partially offset the volume decline. 
Switching to international. Sales in the quarter increased by 2%, driven by strength in Europe and Asia. Operating profit increased 14%, while operating margins expanded 90 basis points. Hanes Europe delivered another solid quarter, with sales up 1%, driven by hosiery in France and bras in Spain, while operating margins improved 350 basis points to nearly 9%. We expect continued strong performance in our international business in the second half due to Hanes Europe synergies, momentum in Asia as well as the addition of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands.
Looking at our overall results for the quarter. The decline in both our gross and operating margins was due almost exclusively to the roughly $12 million in expected costs associated with our inventory-related actions. Absent these costs, our margins would have been up slightly over last year despite the expected decline in sales as we benefited from acquisition synergies and SG&A leverage.
Interest and other expense, excluding the one-time costs associated with our refinancing actions, increased nearly $8 million due to increased debt balances, $6 million of which, or $0.01 per share in the quarter, was due to our decision to prefund our recent acquisitions. 
Given the current interest rate environment, the need to fund recent acquisitions and higher rate notes that were callable, we proactively took the opportunity during the quarter to optimize our capital structure. We lowered our overall interest rate and increased the amount of fixed rate debt on our balance sheet. Roughly 2/3 of our debt is now fixed, and we have a blended interest rate of approximately 3.6%.
The tax rate was roughly 6% during the quarter. For the first half, our tax rate was roughly 8%, which is in line with our full year guidance of a high-single-digit tax rate. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.51.
If you recall from last quarter, I highlighted that the decline in our accounts payable balance was a precursor to the expected improvements in both our inventory and our cash flow, and that's exactly what we saw during the second quarter. Our inventory, excluding the $51 million from Champion Europe, declined from the first quarter's level. And this, along with improvements in accounts payable, helped drive $156 million in cash flow from operations, a record for any second quarter in our history.
Now turning to our guidance. We reiterated our full year outlook, which at their midpoints, implies 8% growth in revenue, 11% growth in operating profit, 16% growth in EPS and $800 million in cash flow from operations. We made small adjustments to our full year estimates for CapEx and acquisition and integration charges now that we've closed the acquisitions and have begun our detailed integration plans. 
Looking at the integration of both Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. We're confident that the total charges for both acquisitions combined should be substantially below earlier acquisitions. As we've become more efficient at integration, we're able to leverage our prior foundational investments, and these integrations are less complex. We estimate the total cost to acquire and integrate both of these acquisitions to be less than $100 million, of which a little more than $50 million are expected to be recognized this year. 
With respect to these 2 acquisitions, we gave you their expected full year contributions in late May. So now let me give you the specific guidance for the quarters because it's very different due to the timing of when we closed Pac Brands and their seasonality.
About $200 million, or approximately 55% of the sales from Champion Europe and Pacific Brands, are expected to be in the fourth quarter. For total HBI, that means third quarter sales should be slightly greater than the fourth quarter, as the impact from these acquisitions temper some of our normal sales cadence. However, from a profit perspective, virtually the entire $0.04 EPS increase from late May shows up in the fourth quarter, leaving the total company's EPS for Q3 between 57 -- $0.55 and $0.57, and for Q4, between $0.57 and $0.61.
So in closing, our overall results are tracking to plan. Our inventory actions are working. Our integrations are on schedule. Our core sales initiatives are getting traction and we launched our new innovation, Fresh IQ. All of this gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our guidance for the year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

They've been using them for centuries, and they're going to use them centuries from now. And as long as we do a couple of things -- I think it's the secret to success -- and that is we need to make sure our cost structure is competitive globally; we need to give innovation that we can give to a broad audience, which means we need to nurture strong brands. And if we can do that successfully, we'd generate a lot of cash and then we can deploy that cash, whatever the environment, to create a lot of value. Right now, it makes a lot of sense to graft those strategies on to acquisitions. That's been working for well over a decade, and it's going to continue to work many decades into the future. And that's what gives me confidence about the staying power of this company. I've said this before, I said it in 2009 in March when everything looked like it was -- the world was going to end.

We're generating strong, on average, sort of mid-single digit growth in the revenue line and double-digit EPS. So there's an awful lot to like about that strategy going forward. Where we do see opportunity is certainly we have a consumer who's increasingly engaging with our brands to learn about our brands and also buy our brands online and we'll consistently -- going to put more and more effort against going where that consumer's going, both people and resources. And we're seeing good results and we're going to work at that even harder. But we're starting in a great place and we're going to build upon what we've built over the last 10 years. I think the second part of your question was about our confidence in guidance for the balance of the year. And let me just say that as we look at that, we see that, first and foremost, our first half results were right in line with our expectations. And second, our low end already assumed a challenging consumer environment as that's played out through the years. And then the third is, certainly, we had a number of key initiatives in mind, and they're unfolding exactly as we expected them to unfold as we execute them. As we focused on our core initiatives, we saw some initial share gains in Q2 and now we've got promotions in place behind our core basics for back-to-school and holiday and that with our Fresh IQ initiative, our innovation coming as well. We feel great about the momentum we're carrying into the second half of the year there. As you heard Rick say, our inventory reduction actions are working. The inventory is coming down, and we've got those actions behind us. And we're looking forward to more cash flow in the months and the quarters ahead. Our Hanes Europe and Knights apparel integrations continue to do extremely well, and we're on target to deliver those synergies. And then, finally, we closed on Champion Europe and Pacific Brands that gives us both sales and revenue -- and profit momentum in the second half. So things are going exactly as we planned, and we feel very comfortable in reaffirming our guidance for the year."

A couple of ways to look at it as you pointed out, Eric, the inventory levels, absent Champion Europe, were actually down from Q2 to Q1. That's unusual. Normally, we build inventory for back-to-school. I think that shows our management -- inventory management processes are working. Another way to look at it, though, is to look at the -- at the build. The build is about $70 million less in the first half of this year than it was last year. So we're doing a lot to manage this inventory, and it's showing up in our cash flow. We talked about XA charges. They're going to be significantly lower this year than they were last year. And that's obviously going to be a positive driver for cash flow from operations as well. So I look at all the factors, including improved profitability, I would also not forget that in terms of driving cash flow as well. Look at all the key drivers of cash flow, they're all working just as we had expected them to. So I'm feeling really good about that $800 million."

As we look to the balance of the year and we execute our initiatives behind our focus on the core initiative as well as we're seeing sequentially improving trends in our bra business, we feel good that we'll have very positive momentum, along with now our new innovation in Fresh IQ in the Innerwear business as we look to the second half. As I turn to the Activewear business, we were down in Q2, but again, as expected after coming off of a strong first quarter, where we were up 2.8% in first quarter. In the Q2, Hanes Activewear was the key driver of our decline for the quarter as we had some space adjustments in some of our key customers. In Champion, we did bear the brunt of overlapping big pipes in Q2 of last year as well as we did have some headwinds from bankruptcies in the sports specialty. But they were -- Champion overall was flat because we saw mid-single-digit results in our mass business and double-digit growth within our college bookstore business. And our Champion POS and sports specialty, in spite of the challenges with bankruptcies, was actually up quite a bit in the quarter, up double-digit basis. So overall, we expect Activewear to return to growth as we put the Hanes Activewear adjustments of Q2 behind us. And we continue to see momentum in the business going forward. What I do -- would say, too, is on a global basis, the Champion brand had a solid quarter and grew nicely in the quarter, with particular strength in Japan. As we look at Champion on a global basis in the second half, we expect that growth to continue to accelerate. And then the addition of Champion Europe will just further accelerate growth on top of that."

The $20 million that we referred to at the beginning of the year, it was being in the first half, did flow through. We're done with our projects, which is our inventory management projects. As a result, you should see -- at the end of Q3, you should see ex acquisitions, Pacific Brands and Champion, you should see inventory actually go down in real terms. And so -- and then continue down in the fourth quarter as well. So we kind of crossed the bridge, if you will, in terms of inventory, in terms of absolute dollars. So what effect does that have on the back half in terms of margins? If you look at the impact in Q2 of the $12 million that I referred to, that was an 80 basis point hit to the margins, and margins were down a little less than that. So we would actually have been up in margins in Q2. Same would have been true in Q1 as well. So the -- so we're looking -- we've always said that we looked for gross margins in the first half to be down as a result of the inventory costs, but to be up in the back half of the year as those go away and the traditional drivers of margin expansion kick in, manufacturing efficiencies, synergies, et cetera, et cetera."

There are a couple of things that you should remember -- that we've always told you. Activewear's strongest quarter is the third quarter, and that tends to mix our margins down a little bit. The margins in Activewear tend to be a little lower. So be careful as you're looking at the -- at those 2 quarters. The other thing that you're going to keep in mind in terms of operating margins -- well, before -- yes, operating margins for the back half is, again, the operating margins that we're getting from our new acquisitions: Pac Brands and Champion Europe, will be about -- will have about 100 basis point impact on our margins for the back half at an operating profit margin basis. So 50 basis points for the full year, about 100 -- if you do the math on the guidance, that's what it'll tell you.

I'd like to take this opportunity to reflect back a little but also to frame our future. 
Over the last 10 years, we've had 3 distinct phases: the first, to transform our supply chain and cost structure to make us competitive globally; the second, to drive Innovate-to-Elevate to expand our operating margins; and the third, grafting both of these strategies onto acquisitions. 
Over that time, we've built a strong business model that creates value by nurturing world-class brands, delivering innovation to a broad base of consumers, driving volume through our highly efficient global supply chain and effectively deploying our cash flow.
The results have been great for all stakeholders. Over this decade, we have increased revenue from $4 billion to nearly $7 billion, allowing us to expand our employment base from 50,000 to 70,000 people. We have completed 8 acquisitions, mainly internationally, with international sales now close to 1/3 of the business. But we paid attention to more than just expanding the business. We have won numerous awards for our community support, our environmental efforts and have also been recognized as a great place to work. All of this superb effort can be seen in our financial results. We increased operating profit from $400 million to over $1 billion, growing earnings per share from $0.37 to over $2, a 20% compound annual growth rate for the decade, and generated more than $4 billion in cash flow from operations.
But what's even more exciting is our future, as these proven strategies have significant scale and are repeatable. At our current profit run rate, we should be able to generate the next $4 billion of cash flow in less than half the time, which positions us extremely well to continue to annually generate solid double-digit shareholder returns and when you combine this with our experienced management team and the breadth of talent within our organization. That's why I truly believe that for Hanesbrands, the best is yet to come.
Before I go, let me add that the last 10 years has been an amazing journey and one that I am deeply proud to have taken with all of you and all of the Hanesbrands employees around the world. I had the pleasure of working with this management team for the past decade, and in case of Gerald, over 25 years. Under Gerald's leadership, we created a low-cost, global supply chain, we strengthened our world-class brands with Innovate-to-Elevate and seamlessly integrated several acquisitions. The company is in great hands, and I look forward to seeing the next phase unfold as Gerald and the organization takes the business to new heights.
And with that, I am pleased to turn things over to our CEO-elect, who will talk about delivering on our fourth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. Gerald?"

On behalf of all the employees at Hanesbrands, we greatly appreciate your leadership over the past decade. And we look forward to continuing to drive our strategies and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. On a personal note, I've thoroughly enjoyed our working relationship over the past 25 years, and I wish you nothing but the best.
Coming into the year, we knew we were facing a tough comparison in the second quarter due to X-TEMP and Champion pipes that drove last year's mid-single digit growth in basics and 42% growth in Champion in the sports specialty and department store channels. And we planned for it. Year-to-date, our results are right where we expected them to be in terms of sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow from operations. More importantly, we reiterated our guidance for the full year, which at their midpoints, calls for 8% growth in revenue, 11% growth in operating profit, 16% growth in EPS and $800 million in cash flow from operations.
As we look to the back half of the year, we believe we are very well positioned to achieve our guidance as our key initiatives are unfolding as expected. While there are many initiatives driving our confidence in delivering on the second half, let me highlight 4 specific examples. 
First, our inventory reduction actions are complete and delivering their intended results. Adjusting for the addition of Champion Europe, our inventory declined from the first quarter's level, which in turn, helped drive the strong cash flow performance in the quarter. We expect our inventory, excluding Champion Europe and Pacific Brands, to continue to decline through the second half of the year, and we're firmly on track to achieve our cash flow guidance.
Second, the initiative that I laid out at the beginning of the year to drive volume growth in our core Innerwear business is gaining traction. For the quarter, we grew market share in men's underwear, women's panties and socks. Moreover, our focus on the core initiative positions us well for the second half. We have targeted promotions in place for both back-to-school and holiday. We're also set to begin advertising behind our new innovation, Fresh IQ.
Fresh IQ is an odor control technology that mechanically attacks bacteria. This is a great innovation that, we believe, has the potential to impact the overall apparel category. In fact, we've seen some of our highest advertising testing ever with this new product, and the reception by our retailers has been strong. The benefits of Fresh IQ span both Innerwear and Activewear and it's now in the market in men's underwear, socks and certain Champion products. 
Third, the integrations of Hanes Europe and Knights Apparel are tracking to plan, which puts us on schedule to deliver $40 million in synergies this year. 
And the fourth example driving our confidence in delivering on the second half is that we closed our 2 most recent acquisitions: Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. 
Touching briefly on these acquisitions, we're extremely excited about the addition of these great businesses. Not only do they provide us with strong management teams, but they also provide a nice balance between mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth and margin expansion opportunity through synergies. Both management teams have already been to our headquarters, and we are well underway in developing our detailed integration plans.
So in summary, we are confident in our outlook for the second half. Our results year-to-date are right in line with our plan, and our key initiatives for the second half are unfolding as expected. Looking beyond this year, our goal is to continue to drive our successful set of strategies and leverage our strong business model, which we believe positions us to deliver, on average, mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit earnings per share growth for many years to come. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

While our second quarter results declined over last year, our Q2 plan called for a decline due to the tough comparisons in basics and Champion as well as quarterly timing shifts in shipments. Year-to-date, our results are right in line wit",1053,"Thanks, Gerald. While our second quarter results declined over last year, our Q2 plan called for a decline due to the tough comparisons in basics and Champion as well as quarterly timing shifts in shipments. Year-to-date, our results are right in line with our expectations for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow.
We reiterated our guidance for the full year, and this was driven by 3 factors: one, the challenges in the overall retail environment were already reflected in our guidance when it was initially set back in February; two, our year-to-date results were in line with our plan; and three, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the second half, as our sales initiatives have traction and are ramping, our acquisitions are generating synergies and our inventory reduction actions are working.
Now let me speak to our performance during the quarter. Beginning with our Innerwear segment. The sequential sales growth in the quarter was right in line with historical trends. And for quarter, the sales performance mirrored the broader retail environment, with a soft April and May giving way to a stronger June. In fact, our Innerwear sales were up 10% in the month of June, with strength continuing into July. Margins in the quarter were strong with segment operating margins of 24.2%. 
Turning to Activewear. The sales decline was driven by our Hanes Activewear business, as our U.S. Champion business was flat when compared to last year. 
Looking at Champion by channel. We saw mid-single-digit revenue growth in mass and mid-teens growth in the college bookstore channel. This was offset by declines in the sporting goods mid-tier and department store channels, which were impacted by bankruptcies and a tough comparison as we had a significant concentration of shipments in last year's second quarter.
With respect to profitability, Activewear's operating margins held above 15%, as SG&A controls helped to partially offset the volume decline. 
Switching to international. Sales in the quarter increased by 2%, driven by strength in Europe and Asia. Operating profit increased 14%, while operating margins expanded 90 basis points. Hanes Europe delivered another solid quarter, with sales up 1%, driven by hosiery in France and bras in Spain, while operating margins improved 350 basis points to nearly 9%. We expect continued strong performance in our international business in the second half due to Hanes Europe synergies, momentum in Asia as well as the addition of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands.
Looking at our overall results for the quarter. The decline in both our gross and operating margins was due almost exclusively to the roughly $12 million in expected costs associated with our inventory-related actions. Absent these costs, our margins would have been up slightly over last year despite the expected decline in sales as we benefited from acquisition synergies and SG&A leverage.
Interest and other expense, excluding the one-time costs associated with our refinancing actions, increased nearly $8 million due to increased debt balances, $6 million of which, or $0.01 per share in the quarter, was due to our decision to prefund our recent acquisitions. 
Given the current interest rate environment, the need to fund recent acquisitions and higher rate notes that were callable, we proactively took the opportunity during the quarter to optimize our capital structure. We lowered our overall interest rate and increased the amount of fixed rate debt on our balance sheet. Roughly 2/3 of our debt is now fixed, and we have a blended interest rate of approximately 3.6%.
The tax rate was roughly 6% during the quarter. For the first half, our tax rate was roughly 8%, which is in line with our full year guidance of a high-single-digit tax rate. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.51.
If you recall from last quarter, I highlighted that the decline in our accounts payable balance was a precursor to the expected improvements in both our inventory and our cash flow, and that's exactly what we saw during the second quarter. Our inventory, excluding the $51 million from Champion Europe, declined from the first quarter's level. And this, along with improvements in accounts payable, helped drive $156 million in cash flow from operations, a record for any second quarter in our history.
Now turning to our guidance. We reiterated our full year outlook, which at their midpoints, implies 8% growth in revenue, 11% growth in operating profit, 16% growth in EPS and $800 million in cash flow from operations. We made small adjustments to our full year estimates for CapEx and acquisition and integration charges now that we've closed the acquisitions and have begun our detailed integration plans. 
Looking at the integration of both Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. We're confident that the total charges for both acquisitions combined should be substantially below earlier acquisitions. As we've become more efficient at integration, we're able to leverage our prior foundational investments, and these integrations are less complex. We estimate the total cost to acquire and integrate both of these acquisitions to be less than $100 million, of which a little more than $50 million are expected to be recognized this year. 
With respect to these 2 acquisitions, we gave you their expected full year contributions in late May. So now let me give you the specific guidance for the quarters because it's very different due to the timing of when we closed Pac Brands and their seasonality.
About $200 million, or approximately 55% of the sales from Champion Europe and Pacific Brands, are expected to be in the fourth quarter. For total HBI, that means third quarter sales should be slightly greater than the fourth quarter, as the impact from these acquisitions temper some of our normal sales cadence. However, from a profit perspective, virtually the entire $0.04 EPS increase from late May shows up in the fourth quarter, leaving the total company's EPS for Q3 between 57 -- $0.55 and $0.57, and for Q4, between $0.57 and $0.61.
So in closing, our overall results are tracking to plan. Our inventory actions are working. Our integrations are on schedule. Our core sales initiatives are getting traction and we launched our new innovation, Fresh IQ. All of this gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our guidance for the year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

We're generating strong, on average, sort of mid-single digit growth in the revenue line and double-digit EPS. So there's an awful lot to like about that strategy going forward. Where we do see opportunity is certainly we have a consumer who's increasingly engaging with our brands to learn about our brands and also buy our brands online and we'll consistently -- going to put more and more effort against going where that consumer's going, both people and resources. And we're seeing good results and we're going to work at that even harder. But we're starting in a great place and we're going to build upon what we've built over the last 10 years. I think the second part of your question was about our confidence in guidance for the balance of the year. And let me just say that as we look at that, we see that, first and foremost, our first half results were right in line with our expectations. And second, our low end already assumed a challenging consumer environment as that's played out through the years. And then the third is, certainly, we had a number of key initiatives in mind, and they're unfolding exactly as we expected them to unfold as we execute them. As we focused on our core initiatives, we saw some initial share gains in Q2 and now we've got promotions in place behind our core basics for back-to-school and holiday and that with our Fresh IQ initiative, our innovation coming as well. We feel great about the momentum we're carrying into the second half of the year there. As you heard Rick say, our inventory reduction actions are working. The inventory is coming down, and we've got those actions behind us. And we're looking forward to more cash flow in the months and the quarters ahead. Our Hanes Europe and Knights apparel integrations continue to do extremely well, and we're on target to deliver those synergies. And then, finally, we closed on Champion Europe and Pacific Brands that gives us both sales and revenue -- and profit momentum in the second half. So things are going exactly as we planned, and we feel very comfortable in reaffirming our guidance for the year."

A couple of ways to look at it as you pointed out, Eric, the inventory levels, absent Champion Europe, were actually down from Q2 to Q1. That's unusual. Normally, we build inventory for back-to-school. I think that shows our management -- inventory management processes are working. Another way to look at it, though, is to look at the -- at the build. The build is about $70 million less in the first half of this year than it was last year. So we're doing a lot to manage this inventory, and it's showing up in our cash flow. We talked about XA charges. They're going to be significantly lower this year than they were last year. And that's obviously going to be a positive driver for cash flow from operations as well. So I look at all the factors, including improved profitability, I would also not forget that in terms of driving cash flow as well. Look at all the key drivers of cash flow, they're all working just as we had expected them to. So I'm feeling really good about that $800 million."

As I turn to the Activewear business, we were down in Q2, but again, as expected after coming off of a strong first quarter, where we were up 2.8% in first quarter. In the Q2, Hanes Activewear was the key driver of our decline for the quarter as we had some space adjustments in some of our key customers. In Champion, we did bear the brunt of overlapping big pipes in Q2 of last year as well as we did have some headwinds from bankruptcies in the sports specialty. But they were -- Champion overall was flat because we saw mid-single-digit results in our mass business and double-digit growth within our college bookstore business. And our Champion POS and sports specialty, in spite of the challenges with bankruptcies, was actually up quite a bit in the quarter, up double-digit basis. So overall, we expect Activewear to return to growth as we put the Hanes Activewear adjustments of Q2 behind us. And we continue to see momentum in the business going forward. What I do -- would say, too, is on a global basis, the Champion brand had a solid quarter and grew nicely in the quarter, with particular strength in Japan. As we look at Champion on a global basis in the second half, we expect that growth to continue to accelerate. And then the addition of Champion Europe will just further accelerate growth on top of that."

We certainly have seen a shift in the consumer's mind to learn and engage with brands from a learning standpoint as well as buying increasingly online. And our categories have seen some of those same shifts, whether they were basics or certainly the active wear business or the intimates business for that matter. And we've been pretty clear for a while that we're going to invest the resources, both people and dollars, to make sure that we get full advantage of that. Within the U.S., for example. We saw, again, a mid-teens growth in our online business during the quarter. And in Europe, we also see a number of those markets are highly developed from an online standpoint. We're organizing equally strongly to go after that business and drive those businesses as well. And as we've stated before, our shares online or we have leading shares. They're not as fully developed as they are in the bricks-and-mortar and we'll continue to work to drive those and we're going to do that really by working across all the elements of that online channel, which would include working with our bricks-and-mortar very closely and helping drive their businesses. And they understand that our learning in our brands are an important avenue to lead people to their site. Certainly, we could continue to develop our own sites, not only as a selling location, but as a communication location of our brand positionings and what our brands have to offer. And then, certainly, from the standpoint of working with the major pure plays, we've got a significant amount of effort against that, and we're seeing very strong results as we look at that. Overall, in the U.S., our business is now 8% online and is continuing to grow. And we've got a lot of focus on that going forward."

The $20 million that we referred to at the beginning of the year, it was being in the first half, did flow through. We're done with our projects, which is our inventory management projects. As a result, you should see -- at the end of Q3, you should see ex acquisitions, Pacific Brands and Champion, you should see inventory actually go down in real terms. And so -- and then continue down in the fourth quarter as well. So we kind of crossed the bridge, if you will, in terms of inventory, in terms of absolute dollars. So what effect does that have on the back half in terms of margins? If you look at the impact in Q2 of the $12 million that I referred to, that was an 80 basis point hit to the margins, and margins were down a little less than that. So we would actually have been up in margins in Q2. Same would have been true in Q1 as well. So the -- so we're looking -- we've always said that we looked for gross margins in the first half to be down as a result of the inventory costs, but to be up in the back half of the year as those go away and the traditional drivers of margin expansion kick in, manufacturing efficiencies, synergies, et cetera, et cetera."

Our sales initiatives have reaccelerated organic growth in several of our core business lines. Our acquisitions both past and present are performing extremely well. Our inventory level is declining. And cash flow",690,"Thank you, T.C. We're having a great year. Our sales initiatives have reaccelerated organic growth in several of our core business lines. Our acquisitions both past and present are performing extremely well. Our inventory level is declining. And cash flow from operations is already $300 million ahead of last year. Overall our business is tracking to our plans and remain constant ability to deliver our full year guidance. 
Our business model is as strong as ever and continues to create significant value for our shareholders. The real power of our model comes from its diversification. We have a variety of different levers that allow us to consistently grow both revenue and earnings per share, while at the same time, generate significant amounts of cash flow. It's not just one strategy or one facet of our business, it's a number of them, working together that drive strong consistent results. And this was evident once again in our third quarter as 3 different levers combined to drive and 11% increase in revenue, a 12% increase in earnings per share and a record level of cash flow from operations. 
The first lever contributing to our strong results was our focus on the core initiatives. If you recall, at the beginning of the year, we highlighted various sales initiatives to drive second half growth in parts of our core. And these initiatives delivered as we saw accelerated organic growth across several of our business lines. 
For the quarter, our Basics revenue increased 9% organically driven by a 20% growth in men's underwear as we gain market share and began to flow in shipments of our new odor control innovation, Fresh IQ. Year-to-date, our Basics business is up 2% organically and we expect momentum to continue through the fourth quarter as our holiday promotions are in place and we begun to advertise behind Fresh IQ. 
Global Champion for the quarter delivered low single-digit organic revenue growth driven by low double-digit growth in the mass channel and strong double-digit organic growth in Japan. And in terms of our U.S. online business, sales across all channels increased 17% in the quarter. 
The second lever of our business model that drove strong third quarter results was our acquisition strategy. We continue to generate significant synergies from our prior acquisitions, including Hanes Europe, Knights Apparel and Maidenform, which continues to create synergies even 3 years after closing. For the full year, we remain on track to achieve our target of $40 million in acquisition synergies. 
We also benefited from the addition of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. Both businesses drove revenue and operating profit results that exceeded our plan, further reinforcing our excitement about these acquisitions. These are great business with great brand and very strong management team that are already creating value for our shareholders. We remain on schedule with the integration planning and we're confident in our ability to deliver over $125 million in combined annual operating profit within 3 years. 
And the third level of our business model that drove strong results in the quarter was our cash generation strategy. When we exited the fourth quarter last year, the weather-driven slowdown created an inventory overhand that temporarily impacted our cash flow. While there have been some skeptics, we communicated a specific strategy to reduce inventory and generate record levels of cash flow, and that's exactly what we've done. Inventory in the quarter, excluding recent acquisitions declined significantly from the second quarter's level, which in turn help drive $337 million in cash flow from operations. And as we expected, our acquisition and integration expenses continue to decline, all of which keeps us firmly on track to deliver our cash flow guidance for the year. 
So in summary, we had a great quarter. And this combined, with our full year outlook, represents further proof that our business model is as strong as ever and continues to create significant long-term returns for our shareholders. Looking forward, we believe we are extremely well positioned to deliver on average mid-single digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth for many years to come. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick."
4212820,405022579,1063963,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gerald. We delivered strong operating results for the quarter. Our sales initiatives reaccelerated organic growth across multiple business lines. Our inventory reduction actions generated record levels of cash flow from operations. Our acquisition",865,"Thanks, Gerald. We delivered strong operating results for the quarter. Our sales initiatives reaccelerated organic growth across multiple business lines. Our inventory reduction actions generated record levels of cash flow from operations. Our acquisitions both past and present posted better-than-expected profit results. And our acquisition- and integration-related expenses continue to decline. 
Now let me walk you through the specifics for the quarter. Sales increased 11% over last year and like many diversified global companies, we had various puts and takes across our multiple business lines. Acquisitions contributed nicely as Champion Europe, Pacific Brands and the acquired Champion license in Japan added approximately $180 million of revenue in the quarter. We delivered strong organic growth in several business lines, including Basics, Champion of mass, Gear for Sports, Champion Japan and online. This growth was offset by a decline in Champion in the sports speciality channel as well as a decline in our U.S. direct-to-consumer business where we're proactively transitioning to a growth model by exiting our legacy catalog business and removing noncore offerings. 
Looking at our 2 largest segments, Innerwear sales increased 2% organically in the quarter. Our Basics business was up 9% over last year, including a 20% increase in men's underwear. This strong organic growth was driven by our various focus on the core sales initiatives, including increased marketing and promotion as well as the launch of Fresh IQ, the first innovation in our core in over a decade. 
Year-to-date, our Basics business is up 2% with the growth evenly balanced across all product categories. This is partially offset by the expected decline in intimates as we annivery-ied the large pipe of Hanes bras in last year's third quarter. 
Turning to our Activewear segment. Sales declined 2% in the quarter. Our Champion business at mass increased by over 10% organically as our refresh product offering continues to resonate with consumers. 
Gear for Sports, which is our college bookstore business, also delivered organic growth in the quarter, up mid-single digits over last year. This growth is more than offset by declines in Champion in the sports specialty channel due to the bankruptcies of certain sporting goods retailers in the U.S. While we're disappointed with results in this channel, we believe the headwind is temporary. More importantly, we expect this channel to return to growth in 2017 as our POS trends remain positive at key accounts. We secured new space and we lap the impact from the bankruptcies. 
Switching to margins. Now that our inventory-related actions are behind us, as expected, our gross margins returned to growth in the quarter increasing 60 basis points over last year, while operating margins decreased 40 basis points due to the short-term dilution from recent acquisitions. Adjusting for these acquisitions, operating margins increased 30 basis points over last year driven by synergies from Hanes Europe, Knights Apparel and Maidenform. 
Interest and other expense increased roughly $13 million over last year as a result of the higher debt balances associated with the acquisitions of Champion Europe [indiscernible] brands. 
The tax rate in the quarter was roughly 6%, bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 7%, which is in line with our full year expectation of a high single digit rate. 
Earnings per share of $0.56 increased 12% over last year and came in at the midpoint of our guidance range. 
Turning to inventory cash flow. Inventory in the quarter, excluding approximately $173 million from recent acquisitions, declined by roughly $124 million from second quarter's level as our actions to reduce inventory continued to deliver results. This, in turn, helped generate $337 million in cash flow from operations, a record for any quarter in our history. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations is roughly $300 million higher than last year, which puts us right on track to deliver on our cash flow guidance for the full year. 
Touching briefly on guidance. While still within our initial range, we've narrowed our full year outlook. This reflects the expected retailer caution heading into the holiday season. If holiday is, in fact, more robust, then that would represent upside to our guidance. At the midpoint, our guidance now implies approximately 8% growth in revenue, roughly 10% growth in operating profit, approximately 15% growth in EPS and $775 million in cash flow from operations. 
In terms of acquisition and integration-related charges, our guidance of approximately $180 million remains unchanged and represents a decline of nearly $90 million from last year. Looking to next year, despite the addition of nearly $1 billion in acquisitions this year, we expect these charges to take another significant step down in 2017 as we benefit from integration efficiencies and leverage our prior foundational investments. 
So in closing, let me in right where Gerald began. We're having a great year, our sales initiatives have reaccelerated organic growth in several of our core business lines. Our acquisitions both past and present are performing extremely well. Our inventory levels declining and cash flow from operations is already $300 million ahead of last year. Overall, our business is tracking to our plan, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

Those sales initiatives resulted and drive a very strong Basics results for us in the quarter, up 9%, up 2% year-to-date, and we see that momentum only continuing to build in the Basics business as we have a number of events planned for the fourth quarter behind our key launches like our Fresh IQ and for the holiday period. We've also seen a pretty strong improvement in our Activewear business sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. And when you back out the impact of the sporting goods bankruptcies, you see very strong, actually, a 1% increase in Activewear for the quarter and really strong performance out of our Champion and mas business as well as positive improvement in our Hanes Activewear business. And also our online growth very positive growth, up 17%, which is actually an accelerated rate of where we've been year-to-date. When we look at specific channel, certainly, we had a very strong back-to-school period as indicated by our Q3 results and continued our share gains in core areas like underwear and socks.

It is what caused us to take some of our actions within our DTC business, that's a relatively small business for us.

So frankly, we're taking the step there as well to exit that catalog business, which is the masking, the double-digit growth within our websites and position that business, along with our other segments to grow as apparel ships online.

But let me break that down for you, kind of give you a sense of where that 250 -- or $350 million to -- or probably $550 million to $600 million is coming from. About $250 million of it is coming from net income and other noncash items like depreciation and amortization. If you take our guidance for those fourth quarter, you get to those kinds of numbers. The balance of it, about $300 million to $350 million, come will primarily from working capital.

Our sales initiatives have reaccelerated organic growth in several of our core business lines. Our acquisitions both past and present are performing extremely well. Our inventory level is declining. And cash flow",690,"Thank you, T.C. We're having a great year. Our sales initiatives have reaccelerated organic growth in several of our core business lines. Our acquisitions both past and present are performing extremely well. Our inventory level is declining. And cash flow from operations is already $300 million ahead of last year. Overall, our business is tracking to our plan, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver a full year guidance.
Our business model is as strong as ever and continues to create significant value for our shareholders. The real power of our model comes from its diversification. We have a variety of different levers that allow us to consistently grow both revenue and earnings per share, while at the same time, generate significant amounts of cash flow. It's not just one strategy or one facet of our business, it's a number of them, working together that drive strong consistent results. And this was evident once again in our third quarter, as 3 different levers combined to drive 11% increase in revenue, 12% increase in earnings per share and a record level of cash flow from operations.
The first lever contributing to our strong results was our focus on the core initiatives. If you recall, at the beginning of the year, we highlighted various sales initiatives to drive second half growth in parts of our core. And these initiatives delivered as we saw accelerated organic growth across several of our business lines.
For the quarter, our Basics revenue increased 9% organically, driven by 20% growth in men's underwear, as we gain market share and began to flow in shipments of our new odor control innovation, Fresh IQ. Year-to-date, our Basics business is up 2% organically, and we expect momentum to continue through the fourth quarter, as our holiday promotions are in place, and we begin to advertise behind Fresh IQ.
Global Champion for the quarter delivered low single-digit organic revenue growth, driven by low double-digit growth in the mass channel and strong double-digit organic growth in Japan. And in terms of our U.S. online business, sales across all channels increased 17% in the quarter.
The second lever of our business model that drove strong third quarter results was our acquisition strategy. We continue to generate significant synergies from our prior acquisitions, including Hanes Europe, Knights Apparel and Maidenform, which continues to create synergies even 3 years after closing. For the full year, we remain on track to achieve our target of $40 million in acquisition synergies.
We also benefited from the addition of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. Both businesses drove revenue and operating profit results that exceeded our plan, further reinforcing our excitement about these acquisitions. These are great businesses with great brands and very strong management teams that are already creating value for our shareholders. We remain on schedule with the integration planning, and we're confident in our ability to deliver over $125 million in combined annual operating profit within 3 years.
And the third lever of our business model that drove strong results in the quarter was our cash generation strategy. When we exited the fourth quarter last year, the weather-driven slowdown created an inventory overhang that temporarily impacted our cash flow. While there have been some skeptics, we communicated a specific strategy to reduce inventory and generate record levels of cash flow, and that's exactly what we've done. Inventory in the quarter, excluding recent acquisitions, declined significantly from the second quarter's level, which in turn helped drive $337 million in cash flow from operations. And as we expected, our acquisition and integration expenses continue to decline, all of which keeps us firmly on track to deliver our cash flow guidance for the year.
So in summary, we had a great quarter. And this, combined with our full year outlook, represents further proof that our business model is as strong as ever and continues to create significant long-term returns for our shareholders. Looking forward, we believe we are extremely well positioned to deliver on average mid-single digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth for many years to come.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick."
4212820,405022579,1064464,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gerald. We delivered strong operating results for the quarter. Our sales initiatives reaccelerated organic growth across multiple business lines. Our inventory reduction actions generated record levels of cash flow from operations. Our acquisition",870,"Thanks, Gerald. We delivered strong operating results for the quarter. Our sales initiatives reaccelerated organic growth across multiple business lines. Our inventory reduction actions generated record levels of cash flow from operations. Our acquisitions, both past and present, posted better-than-expected profit results. And our acquisition- and integration-related expenses continued to decline.
Now let me walk you through the specifics for the quarter. Sales increased 11% over last year, and like many diversified global companies, we had various puts and takes across our multiple business lines. Acquisitions contributed nicely as Champion Europe, Pacific Brands and the acquired Champion license in Japan added approximately $180 million of revenue in the quarter. We delivered strong organic growth in several business lines, including Basics, Champion of mass, Gear for Sports, Champion Japan and online. This growth was offset by a decline in Champion in the sports speciality channel as well as a decline in our U.S. direct-to-consumer business, where we are proactively transitioning to a growth model by exiting our legacy catalog business and removing noncore offerings.
Looking at our 2 largest segments, Innerwear sales increased 2% organically in the quarter. Our Basics business was up 9% over last year, including 20% increase in men's underwear. This strong organic growth was driven by our various focus on the core sales initiatives, including increased marketing and promotion as well as the launch of Fresh IQ, the first innovation in our core in over a decade. 
Year-to-date, our Basics business is up 2% with the growth evenly balanced across all product categories. This was partially offset by the expected decline in intimates, as we anniversaried the large pipe of Hanes bras in last year's third quarter.
Turning to our Activewear segment. Sales declined 2% in the quarter. Our Champion business at mass increased by over 10% organically as our refreshed product offering continues to resonate with consumers.
Gear for Sports, which is our college bookstore business, also delivered organic growth in the quarter, up mid-single digits over last year. This growth is more than offset by declines in Champion in the sports specialty channel, due to the bankruptcies of certain sporting goods retailers in the U.S. While we're disappointed with the results in this channel, we believe the headwind is temporary. More importantly, we expect this channel to return to growth in 2017, as our POS trends remain positive at key accounts. We secured new space, and we lap the impact from the bankruptcies.
Switching to margins. Now that our inventory-related actions are behind us, as expected, our gross margins returned to growth in the quarter, increasing 60 basis points over last year, while operating margins decreased 40 basis points, due to the short-term dilution from recent acquisitions. Adjusting for these acquisitions, operating margins increased 30 basis points over last year, driven by synergies from Hanes Europe, Knights Apparel and Maidenform.
Interest and other expense increased roughly $13 million over last year, as a result of the higher debt balances associated with the acquisitions of Champion Europe and Pac Brands.
The tax rate in the quarter was roughly 6%, bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 7%, which is in line with our full year expectation of a high single digit rate.
Earnings per share of $0.56 increased 12% over last year and came in at the midpoint of our guidance range.
Turning to inventory and cash flow. Inventory in the quarter, excluding approximately $173 million from recent acquisitions, declined by roughly $124 million from second quarter's level as our actions to reduce inventory continued to deliver results. This, in turn, helped to generate $337 million in cash flow from operations, a record for any quarter in our history. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations is roughly $300 million higher than last year, which puts us right on track to deliver on our cash flow guidance for the full year.
Touching briefly on guidance. While still within our initial range, we've narrowed our full year outlook. This reflects the expected retailer caution heading into the holiday season. If holiday is, in fact, more robust, then that would represent upside to our guidance. At the midpoint, our guidance now implies approximately 8% growth in revenue, roughly 10% growth in operating profit, approximately 15% growth in EPS and $775 million in cash flow from operations.
In terms of acquisition- and integration-related charges, our guidance of approximately $180 million remains unchanged and represents a decline of nearly $90 million from last year. Looking to next year, despite the addition of nearly $1 billion in acquisitions this year, we expect these charges to take another significant step down in 2017, as we benefit from integration efficiencies and leverage our prior foundational investments.
So in closing, let me end right where Gerald began. We're having a great year, our sales initiatives have reaccelerated organic growth in several of our core business lines. Our acquisitions both past and present are performing extremely well. Our inventory level is declining, and cash flow from operations is already $300 million ahead of last year. Overall, our business is tracking to our plan, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

Those sales initiatives resulted in driving very strong Basics results for us in the quarter, up 9%, up 2% year-to-date, and we see that momentum only continuing to build in the Basics business, as we have a number of events planned for the fourth quarter behind our key launches, like our Fresh IQ and for the holiday period. We've also seen a pretty strong improvement in our Activewear business sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. And when you backout the impact of sporting goods bankruptcies, you see very strong -- actually, 1% increase in Activewear for the quarter and really strong performance out of our Champion at mass business as well as positive improvement in our Hanes Activewear business. And also our online growth showed very positive growth, up 17%, which is actually an accelerated rate of where we've been year-to-date. When we look at specific channel, certainly, we had a very strong back-to-school period, as indicated by our Q3 results and continued our share gains in core areas, like underwear and socks. So from a mass channel perspective, we feel that it's performing very well for us. We came out of the back-to-school period with our inventories in line.

And as we look to the fourth quarter, their business skews a little more heavily to the fourth quarter, so you'll see even a little more impact out of them in the fourth quarter."

And when you look at the Innerwear business across Basics, with that kind of lift, certainly it touched every channel. We do continue to see a shift of apparel sales, in general, online and our categories are shifting with them. As we've discussed before, we hold the #1 share position in our core categories online. We saw very solid growth, really, at about 2x the rate of total apparel growth with our growth trend within the quarter. It is what caused us to take some of our actions within our DTC business. That's a relatively small business for us. And that business really contains the U.S. outlet stores as well as our own websites and legacy catalog business. So frankly, we are taking the step there as well to exit that catalog business, which is the masking, the double-digit growth within our websites and position that business, along with our other segments to grow as apparel shifts online. So that's a strategic decision we've made to drive growth as well. So we feel good about the direction of Innerwear, and we feel good about the momentum we carry into Q4."

But let me break that down for you, kind of give you a sense of where that $250 million -- $350 million to -- or probably $550 million to $600 million is coming from. About $250 million of it is coming from net income and other noncash items, like depreciation and amortization. If you take our guidance for the fourth quarter, you get to those kinds of numbers. The balance of it, about $300 million to $350 million, will come primarily from working capital. The bulk of it from inventory -- continued inventory reductions as we continue to drive our inventory reduction plans as well as the normal AR reductions that we always see in Q4. That will be the majority. We'll get a little pick up from accounts payable and a little here and there as well. So very confident though that we're going to get to the numbers that we've been talking about."

These are really more longer-term strategic types of the things. One helps us to expand our sports apparel business into the high school channel. The other represents the acquisition of some stores in Italy and the geography that we're not currently in. And so these are complementary to what we've been doing in -- to our current business.

Every one of our acquisitions is running ahead of plan in terms of the synergies that we're seeing. So we think our integration efforts are being really successful, and we expect to be able to continue to drive those. I think a lot of the things that have driven our -- drivers of our margin improvement in the past couple of years will continue on. We said that we don't really see those as having finite terms. So we'll continue to generate cost savings for manufacturing facilities. We'll continue to generate synergies. I feel we'll continue to generate gross profit improvement. So all of those drivers will continue on into the future. So we'll be giving you a little more color on that as we get to the '17 guidance on the next call."

Our sales initiatives have reaccelerated organic growth in several of our core business lines. Our acquisitions both past and present are performing extremely well. Our inventory level is declining. And cash flow",690,"Thank you, T.C. We're having a great year. Our sales initiatives have reaccelerated organic growth in several of our core business lines. Our acquisitions both past and present are performing extremely well. Our inventory level is declining. And cash flow from operations is already $300 million ahead of last year. Overall, our business is tracking to our plan, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver our full year guidance.
Our business model is as strong as ever and continues to create significant value for our shareholders. The real power of our model comes from its diversification. We have a variety of different levers that allow us to consistently grow both revenue and earnings per share, while at the same time generate significant amounts of cash flow. It's not just one strategy or one facet of our business, it's a number of them, working together that drive strong consistent results. And this was evident once again in our third quarter, as 3 different levers combined to drive 11% increase in revenue, 12% increase in earnings per share and a record level of cash flow from operations.
The first lever contributing to our strong results was our focus on the core initiatives. If you recall, at the beginning of the year, we highlighted various sales initiatives to drive second half growth in parts of our core. And these initiatives delivered as we saw accelerated organic growth across several of our business lines.
For the quarter, our Basics revenue increased 9% organically, driven by  20's% growth in men's underwear, as we gain market share and began to flow in shipments of our new odor control innovation, Fresh IQ. Year-to-date, our Basics business is up 2% organically, and we expect momentum to continue through the fourth quarter, as our holiday promotions are in place, and we begin to advertise behind Fresh IQ.
Global Champion for the quarter delivered low single-digit organic revenue growth, driven by low double-digit growth in the mass channel and strong double-digit organic growth in Japan. And in terms of our U.S. online business, sales across all channels increased 17% in the quarter.
The second lever of our business model that drove strong third quarter results was our acquisition strategy. We continued to generate significant synergies from our prior acquisitions, including Hanes Europe, Knights Apparel and Maidenform, which continues to create synergies even 3 years after closing. For the full year, we remain on track to achieve our target of $40 million in acquisition synergies.
We also benefited from the addition of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. Both businesses drove revenue and operating profit results that exceeded our plan, further reinforcing our excitement about these acquisitions. These are great businesses with great brands and very strong management teams that are already creating value for our shareholders. We remain on schedule with the integration planning, and we're confident in our ability to deliver over $125 million in combined annual operating profit within 3 years.
And the third lever of our business model that drove strong results in the quarter was our cash generation strategy. When we exited the fourth quarter last year, the weather-driven slowdown created an inventory overhang that temporarily impacted our cash flow. While there have been some skeptics, we communicated a specific strategy to reduce inventory and generate record levels of cash flow, and that's exactly what we've done. Inventory in the quarter, excluding recent acquisitions, declined significantly from the second quarter's level, which in turn helped drive $337 million in cash flow from operations. And as we expected, our acquisition and integration expenses continued to decline, all of which keeps us firmly on track to deliver our cash flow guidance for the year.
So in summary, we had a great quarter. And this, combined with our full year outlook, represents further proof that our business model is as strong as ever and continues to create significant long-term returns for our shareholders. Looking forward, we believe we are extremely well positioned to deliver, on average, mid-single digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth for many years to come.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick."

We delivered strong operating results for the quarter. Our sales initiatives reaccelerated organic growth across multiple business lines. Our inventory reduction actions generated record levels of cash flow from operations. Our acquisition",867,"Thanks, Gerald. We delivered strong operating results for the quarter. Our sales initiatives reaccelerated organic growth across multiple business lines. Our inventory reduction actions generated record levels of cash flow from operations. Our acquisitions, both past and present, posted better-than-expected profit results. And our acquisition- and integration-related expenses continued to decline.
Now let me walk you through the specifics for the quarter. Sales increased 11% over last year, and like many diversified global companies, we had various puts and takes across our multiple business lines. Acquisitions contributed nicely as Champion Europe, Pacific Brands and the acquired Champion license in Japan added approximately $180 million of revenue in the quarter. We delivered strong organic growth in several business lines, including Basics, Champion of mass, Gear for Sports, Champion Japan and online. This growth was offset by a decline in Champion in the sports speciality channel as well as a decline in our U.S. direct-to-consumer business, where we are proactively transitioning to a growth model by exiting our legacy catalog business and removing noncore offerings.
Looking at our 2 largest segments, Innerwear sales increased 2% organically in the quarter. Our Basics business was up 9% over last year, including a 20% increase in men's underwear. This strong organic growth was driven by our various focus-on-the-core sales initiatives, including increased marketing and promotion as well as the launch of Fresh IQ, the first innovation in our core in over a decade. 
Year-to-date, our Basics business is up 2%, with the growth evenly balanced across all product categories. This was partially offset by the expected decline in intimates, as we anniversaried the large pipe of Hanes bras in last year's third quarter.
Turning to our Activewear segment. Sales declined 2% in the quarter. Our Champion business at mass increased by over 10% organically as our refreshed product offering continues to resonate with consumers.
Gear for Sports, which is our college bookstore business, also delivered organic growth in the quarter, up mid-single digits over last year. This growth is more than offset by declines in Champion in the sports specialty channel, due to the bankruptcies of certain sporting goods retailers in the U.S. While we're disappointed with the results in this channel, we believe the headwind is temporary. More importantly, we expect this channel to return to growth in 2017, as our POS trends remain positive at key accounts. We've secured new space, and we lapped the impact from the bankruptcies.
Switching to margins. Now that our inventory-related actions are behind us, as expected, our gross margins returned to growth in the quarter, increasing 60 basis points over last year, while operating margins decreased 40 basis points, due to the short-term dilution from recent acquisitions. Adjusting for these acquisitions, operating margins increased 30 basis points over last year, driven by synergies from Hanes Europe, Knights Apparel and Maidenform.
Interest and other expense increased roughly $13 million over last year, as a result of the higher debt balances associated with the acquisitions of Champion Europe and Pac Brands.
The tax rate in the quarter was roughly 6%, bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 7%, which is in line with our full year expectation of a high single-digit rate.
Earnings per share of $0.56 increased 12% over last year and came in at the midpoint of our guidance range.
Turning to inventory and cash flow. Inventory in the quarter, excluding approximately $173 million from recent acquisitions, declined by roughly $124 million from second quarter's level as our actions to reduce inventory continued to deliver results. This, in turn, helped to generate $337 million in cash flow from operations, a record for any quarter in our history. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations is roughly $300 million higher than last year, which puts us right on track to deliver on our cash flow guidance for the full year.
Touching briefly on guidance. While still within our initial range, we've narrowed our full year outlook. This reflects the expected retailer caution heading into the holiday season. If holiday is, in fact, more robust, then that would represent upside to our guidance. At the midpoint, our guidance now implies approximately 8% growth in revenue, roughly 10% growth in operating profit, approximately 15% growth in EPS and $775 million in cash flow from operations.
In terms of acquisition- and integration-related charges, our guidance of approximately $180 million remains unchanged and represents a decline of nearly $90 million from last year. Looking to next year, despite the addition of nearly $1 billion in acquisitions this year, we expect these charges to take another significant step down in 2017, as we benefit from integration efficiencies and leverage our prior foundational investments.
So in closing, let me end right where Gerald began. We're having a great year, our sales initiatives have reaccelerated organic growth in several of our core business lines. Our acquisitions both past and present are performing extremely well. Our inventory level is declining, and cash flow from operations is already $300 million ahead of last year. Overall, our business is tracking to our plan, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

We put a number of sales initiatives in early in the year, and they've begun to take hold that really helped drive that strong results in the quarter, up 11% in total revenue growth and up 12% in the EPS. Those sales initiatives resulted in driving very strong Basics results for us in the quarter, up 9%, up 2% year-to-date, and we see that momentum only continuing to build in the Basics business, as we have a number of events planned for the fourth quarter behind our key launches, like our Fresh IQ and for the holiday period. We've also seen a pretty strong improvement in our Activewear business sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. And when you backout the impact of sporting goods bankruptcies, you see very strong -- actually, 1% increase in Activewear for the quarter and really strong performance out of our Champion at mass business as well as positive improvement in our Hanes Activewear business. And also our online growth showed very positive growth, up 17%, which is actually an accelerated rate over where we've been year-to-date. When we look at specific channel, certainly, we had a very strong back-to-school period, as indicated by our Q3 results and continued our share gains in core areas, like underwear and socks. So from a mass channel perspective, we feel that it's performing very well for us. We came out of the back-to-school period with our inventories in line. So we feel that with the momentum we're carrying into Q4 as well as our inventories in line and the Basics initiatives we have that we've got a good strong performance that we'll carry into Q4 and mass as well."

We saw very solid growth, really, at about 2x the rate of total apparel growth was our growth trend within the quarter. It is what caused us to take some of our actions within our DTC business. That's a relatively small business for us. And that business really contains the U.S. outlet stores as well as our own websites and legacy catalog business. So frankly, we are taking the step there as well to exit that catalog business, which has been masking the double-digit growth within our websites, and position that business, along with our other segments, to grow as apparel shifts online. So that's a strategic decision we've made to drive growth as well. So we feel good about the direction of Innerwear, and we feel good about the momentum we carry into Q4."

But let me break that down for you, kind of give you a sense of where that $250 million -- $350 million to -- or pardon me $550 million to $600 million is coming from. About $250 million of it is coming from net income and other noncash items, like depreciation and amortization. If you take our guidance for the fourth quarter, you get to those kinds of numbers. The balance of it, about $300 million to $350 million, will come primarily from working capital. The bulk of it from inventory -- continued inventory reductions as we continue to drive our inventory reduction plans as well as the normal AR reductions that we always see in Q4. That will be the majority of it. We'll get a little pick up from accounts payable and a little here and there as well.

It goes across our core underwear and socks as well. We really haven't done a launch like that since TAGLESS tee over 10 years ago. And this really reaches a broad base of consumers. As we turn on the TV, we encourage that trial. This is a product that's built on one of the biggest concerns of the consumer. And so as you offer them that odor elimination option, it creates a real reason for trial, that we're going to back up with great advertising and promotion packs.

Our sales initiatives have reaccelerated organic growth in several of our core business lines. Our acquisitions both past and present are performing extremely well. Our inventory level is declining. And cash flow",690,"Thank you, T.C. We're having a great year. Our sales initiatives have reaccelerated organic growth in several of our core business lines. Our acquisitions both past and present are performing extremely well. Our inventory level is declining. And cash flow from operations is already $300 million ahead of last year. Overall, our business is tracking to our plan, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver our full year guidance.
Our business model is as strong as ever and continues to create significant value for our shareholders. The real power of our model comes from its diversification. We have a variety of different levers that allow us to consistently grow both revenue and earnings per share, while at the same time generate significant amounts of cash flow. It's not just one strategy or one facet of our business, it's a number of them, working together that drive strong consistent results. And this was evident once again in our third quarter, as 3 different levers combined to drive 11% increase in revenue, 12% increase in earnings per share and a record level of cash flow from operations.
The first lever contributing to our strong results was our focus on the core initiatives. If you recall, at the beginning of the year, we highlighted various sales initiatives to drive second half growth in parts of our core. And these initiatives delivered as we saw accelerated organic growth across several of our business lines.
For the quarter, our Basics revenue increased 9% organically, driven by  20's% growth in men's underwear, as we gain market share and began to flow in shipments of our new odor control innovation, Fresh IQ. Year-to-date, our Basics business is up 2% organically, and we expect momentum to continue through the fourth quarter, as our holiday promotions are in place, and we begin to advertise behind Fresh IQ.
Global Champion for the quarter delivered low single-digit organic revenue growth, driven by low double-digit growth in the mass channel and strong double-digit organic growth in Japan. And in terms of our U.S. online business, sales across all channels increased 17% in the quarter.
The second lever of our business model that drove strong third quarter results was our acquisition strategy. We continued to generate significant synergies from our prior acquisitions, including Hanes Europe, Knights Apparel and Maidenform, which continues to create synergies even 3 years after closing. For the full year, we remain on track to achieve our target of $40 million in acquisition synergies.
We also benefited from the addition of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. Both businesses drove revenue and operating profit results that exceeded our plan, further reinforcing our excitement about these acquisitions. These are great businesses with great brands and very strong management teams that are already creating value for our shareholders. We remain on schedule with the integration planning, and we're confident in our ability to deliver over $125 million in combined annual operating profit within 3 years.
And the third lever of our business model that drove strong results in the quarter was our cash generation strategy. When we exited the fourth quarter last year, the weather-driven slowdown created an inventory overhang that temporarily impacted our cash flow. While there have been some skeptics, we communicated a specific strategy to reduce inventory and generate record levels of cash flow, and that's exactly what we've done. Inventory in the quarter, excluding recent acquisitions, declined significantly from the second quarter's level, which in turn helped drive $337 million in cash flow from operations. And as we expected, our acquisition and integration expenses continued to decline, all of which keeps us firmly on track to deliver our cash flow guidance for the year.
So in summary, we had a great quarter. And this, combined with our full year outlook, represents further proof that our business model is as strong as ever and continues to create significant long-term returns for our shareholders. Looking forward, we believe we are extremely well positioned to deliver, on average, mid-single digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth for many years to come.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick."
4212820,405022579,1065279,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gerald. We delivered strong operating results for the quarter. Our sales initiatives reaccelerated organic growth across multiple business lines. Our inventory reduction actions generated record levels of cash flow from operations. Our acquisition",867,"Thanks, Gerald. We delivered strong operating results for the quarter. Our sales initiatives reaccelerated organic growth across multiple business lines. Our inventory reduction actions generated record levels of cash flow from operations. Our acquisitions, both past and present, posted better-than-expected profit results. And our acquisition- and integration-related expenses continued to decline.
Now let me walk you through the specifics for the quarter. Sales increased 11% over last year, and like many diversified global companies, we had various puts and takes across our multiple business lines. Acquisitions contributed nicely as Champion Europe, Pacific Brands and the acquired Champion license in Japan added approximately $180 million of revenue in the quarter. We delivered strong organic growth in several business lines, including Basics, Champion of mass, Gear for Sports, Champion Japan and online. This growth was offset by a decline in Champion in the sports speciality channel as well as a decline in our U.S. direct-to-consumer business, where we are proactively transitioning to a growth model by exiting our legacy catalog business and removing noncore offerings.
Looking at our 2 largest segments, Innerwear sales increased 2% organically in the quarter. Our Basics business was up 9% over last year, including a 20% increase in men's underwear. This strong organic growth was driven by our various focus-on-the-core sales initiatives, including increased marketing and promotion as well as the launch of Fresh IQ, the first innovation in our core in over a decade. 
Year-to-date, our Basics business is up 2%, with the growth evenly balanced across all product categories. This was partially offset by the expected decline in intimates, as we anniversaried the large pipe of Hanes bras in last year's third quarter.
Turning to our Activewear segment. Sales declined 2% in the quarter. Our Champion business at mass increased by over 10% organically as our refreshed product offering continues to resonate with consumers.
Gear for Sports, which is our college bookstore business, also delivered organic growth in the quarter, up mid-single digits over last year. This growth is more than offset by declines in Champion in the sports specialty channel, due to the bankruptcies of certain sporting goods retailers in the U.S. While we're disappointed with the results in this channel, we believe the headwind is temporary. More importantly, we expect this channel to return to growth in 2017, as our POS trends remain positive at key accounts. We've secured new space, and we lapped the impact from the bankruptcies.
Switching to margins. Now that our inventory-related actions are behind us, as expected, our gross margins returned to growth in the quarter, increasing 60 basis points over last year, while operating margins decreased 40 basis points, due to the short-term dilution from recent acquisitions. Adjusting for these acquisitions, operating margins increased 30 basis points over last year, driven by synergies from Hanes Europe, Knights Apparel and Maidenform.
Interest and other expense increased roughly $13 million over last year, as a result of the higher debt balances associated with the acquisitions of Champion Europe and Pac Brands.
The tax rate in the quarter was roughly 6%, bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 7%, which is in line with our full year expectation of a high single-digit rate.
Earnings per share of $0.56 increased 12% over last year and came in at the midpoint of our guidance range.
Turning to inventory and cash flow. Inventory in the quarter, excluding approximately $173 million from recent acquisitions, declined by roughly $124 million from second quarter's level as our actions to reduce inventory continued to deliver results. This, in turn, helped to generate $337 million in cash flow from operations, a record for any quarter in our history. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations is roughly $300 million higher than last year, which puts us right on track to deliver on our cash flow guidance for the full year.
Touching briefly on guidance. While still within our initial range, we've narrowed our full year outlook. This reflects the expected retailer caution heading into the holiday season. If holiday is, in fact, more robust, then that would represent upside to our guidance. At the midpoint, our guidance now implies approximately 8% growth in revenue, roughly 10% growth in operating profit, approximately 15% growth in EPS and $775 million in cash flow from operations.
In terms of acquisition- and integration-related charges, our guidance of approximately $180 million remains unchanged and represents a decline of nearly $90 million from last year. Looking to next year, despite the addition of nearly $1 billion in acquisitions this year, we expect these charges to take another significant step down in 2017, as we benefit from integration efficiencies and leverage our prior foundational investments.
So in closing, let me end right where Gerald began. We're having a great year, our sales initiatives have reaccelerated organic growth in several of our core business lines. Our acquisitions both past and present are performing extremely well. Our inventory level is declining, and cash flow from operations is already $300 million ahead of last year. Overall, our business is tracking to our plan, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

First of all, I want to say that the year is really unfolding as we expected. We had a great Q3. We put a number of sales initiatives in early in the year, and they've begun to take hold that really helped drive that strong results in the quarter, up 11% in total revenue growth and up 12% in the EPS. Those sales initiatives resulted in driving very strong Basics results for us in the quarter, up 9%, up 2% year-to-date, and we see that momentum only continuing to build in the Basics business, as we have a number of events planned for the fourth quarter behind our key launches, like our Fresh IQ and for the holiday period. We've also seen a pretty strong improvement in our Activewear business sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. And when you backout the impact of sporting goods bankruptcies, you see very strong -- actually, 1% increase in Activewear for the quarter and really strong performance out of our Champion at mass business as well as positive improvement in our Hanes Activewear business. And also our online growth showed very positive growth, up 17%, which is actually an accelerated rate over where we've been year-to-date. When we look at specific channel, certainly, we had a very strong back-to-school period, as indicated by our Q3 results and continued our share gains in core areas, like underwear and socks. So from a mass channel perspective, we feel that it's performing very well for us. We came out of the back-to-school period with our inventories in line. So we feel that with the momentum we're carrying into Q4 as well as our inventories in line and the Basics initiatives we have that we've got a good strong performance that we'll carry into Q4 and mass as well."

And when you look at the Innerwear business across Basics, with that kind of lift, certainly it touched every channel. We do continue to see a shift of apparel sales, in general, online and our categories are shifting with them. As we've discussed before, we hold the #1 share position in our core categories online. We saw very solid growth, really, at about 2x the rate of total apparel growth was our growth trend within the quarter. It is what caused us to take some of our actions within our DTC business. That's a relatively small business for us. And that business really contains the U.S. outlet stores as well as our own websites and legacy catalog business. So frankly, we are taking the step there as well to exit that catalog business, which has been masking the double-digit growth within our websites, and position that business, along with our other segments, to grow as apparel shifts online. So that's a strategic decision we've made to drive growth as well. So we feel good about the direction of Innerwear, and we feel good about the momentum we carry into Q4."

If you look at our guidance, it implies that the fourth quarter is going to generate about $550 million to $600 million of cash flow from operations. Remember that our fourth quarter is normally a disproportionately large percentage of our annual cash flow because of the way the business runs. But let me break that down for you, kind of give you a sense of where that $250 million -- $350 million to -- or pardon me $550 million to $600 million is coming from. About $250 million of it is coming from net income and other noncash items, like depreciation and amortization. If you take our guidance for the fourth quarter, you get to those kinds of numbers. The balance of it, about $300 million to $350 million, will come primarily from working capital. The bulk of it from inventory -- continued inventory reductions as we continue to drive our inventory reduction plans as well as the normal AR reductions that we always see in Q4. That will be the majority of it. We'll get a little pick up from accounts payable and a little here and there as well. So very confident though that we're going to get to the numbers that we've been talking about."

In terms of GTM, that's -- we did a couple of, as you'll see in our 10-Q, we did a couple of very small tuck-in acquisitions towards the end of the quarter that will have really a minimal contribution in terms of revenue, really none in terms of profit. These are really more longer-term strategic types of things. One helps us to expand our sports apparel business into the high school channel. The other represents the acquisition of some stores in Italy and the geography that we're not currently in. And so these are complementary to what we've been doing in -- to our current business.
