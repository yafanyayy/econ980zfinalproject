We will quickly recap our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results this morning. Additionally, and more importantly, I will outline the actions we are taking to improve our operating and financial performance",1626,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We will quickly recap our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results this morning. Additionally, and more importantly, I will outline the actions we are taking to improve our operating and financial performance. Let me begin by saying that overall, I am pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance, which delivered full year results in line with our expectations discussed last quarter. The downturn in our served markets during 2015 was more severe, widespread and persistent than we and the industry at large originally anticipated a year ago.
The sharp decline that began in upstream oil and gas spread across of industrial complex as the year progress. Compounding the challenges in our served industries, the strong dollar was also a major headwind throughout the year. And regionally, petroleum driven economies in most emerging markets, such as Latin America, remain more challenged.
Against this market backdrop, I am pleased with how our organization responded. Our employees remained committed to our customers and continued to deliver quality products and services through our strong operating model focused on execution.
Importantly, we have taken definitive proactive measures to better competitively position Flowserve for long-term growth and value creation. While we anticipate ongoing headwinds in the coming year, we are confident that the actions we implemented in 2015 and the expanded program and growth initiatives we will discuss today provide us with a solid foundation to drive profitable growth through the market cycle. As we look to the future, global macro fundamentals suggest that Flowserve's end markets will continue their longer-term secular growth patterns, confirming we serve the right strategic industries.
Population growth and an emerging middle class will drive energy demand. An aging infrastructure in energy, power, chemical and general industries will require refurbishment or replacement. Our end markets are inherently sound over the long run, although they are currently cyclically challenged. While we can't control the near-term cyclicality, Flowserve is well-equipped to weather periods of volatility, and our track record demonstrates that we are well-positioned to capitalize on long-term industry growth drivers even as we planned for a lower for longer environment in the near term.
Let me dive into some of the actions and opportunities we are pursuing. While leadership in technology products and services are fundamental tenets of our competitive model, the markets we compete in demand that we're also competitive with our cost structure.
In 2015 and continuing into 2016, the actions we are taking are transformational for Flowserve. In essence, we are structurally repositioning Flowserve for the future. First, we're aggressively taking actions to align our SG&A cost structure to market realities. These decisions are difficult, and we consider options thoughtfully before acting. We are not taking these actions lightly as they impact our most valuable asset, namely Flowserve's associates. In addition, we believe the current cycle creates the right environment to accelerate the structural changes we have addressed in prior calls. These actions are critical to leveraging our global operating model in establishing a flexible, responsive manufacturing network that addresses the needs of our markets and customers.
Against both of these objectives, we have made significant progress against our previously announced $125 million realignment plan. In the fourth quarter, we executed over $50 million of activities, bringing the full year 2015 year investment to approximately $80 million. This investment includes the closure or repurposing of 7 manufacturing facilities and a few redundant QRCs, while reducing over 5% of our workforce since the first quarter of 2015.
Beyond this announced program, we also made significant strides in integrating SIHI and achieving the synergies we expected to date as part of our transaction economics. Our ability to execute on our diverse set of initiatives during 2015 has provided us the confidence and the ability to accelerate even more of our longer-term plans. We developed these actions over a number of years and are initially expected an extended timeline to implement. However, current market conditions provide the opportunity to act now.
As such, we are now expanding the previous $125 million realignment initiative, which we expect to execute over a 2-year period. We now envision a total investment of around $350 million, including about $50 million of expense that is below the operating income line with expected annualized savings of approximately $215 million once completed.
With approximately $80 million of realignment expense realized in 2015, excluding SIHI initiatives, this leaves us $270 million remaining to execute over the next 2 years. While some of our initiatives are in response to volume reductions in the current market, the majority of the actions we are taking are structural in nature, focused on capacity optimization, product rationalization, supply chain optimization and developing a low-cost manufacturing base for competitive positioning.
Together, this will fundamentally change our engineered business. We have demonstrated proven success in our ability to transfer manufacturing capacity and permanently reduce cost.
During 2016, we plan to accelerate the closure or repurposing of 8 facilities that were part of our longer-term plans. Additionally, we will further delever the organization, which is intended to increase accountability and performance.
In summary, when our expanded program is complete, we expect to reduce our manufacturing footprint by approximately 30%, improve plant and machine utilization, and significantly increase our manufacturing capabilities and labor hours in low-cost regions. We expect to realize savings of approximately $125 million in 2016 and $185 million next year.
We have a proven record of reducing cost and are confident that we can deliver on this plan. In addition to our ability to drive further cost out of the system, I am equally encouraged by growth opportunities that are available to Flowserve. For instance, we see significant upside for growth in aftermarket and MRO. We have a QRC network that is well-positioned globally. Our core aftermarket activities of parts, repairs and service have shown the resiliency we expect even in 2015. And while we won't predict the timing, we do realize that there is a building aftermarket tailwind coming from last year's deferred maintenance activities. As we had seen in the past, the longer facilities continuously run, the greater the workload is available to us when customers do catch up.
And while much of our MRO sales are classified as run rate OE, this activity demonstrates substantial aftermarket attributes. In short, a significant majority of our annual revenue is brownfield in nature, serving existing infrastructure that is permanent and needs regular attention, which we believe provides opportunities to improve our share of the customer's operational spending.
For Flowserve and our shareholders, this work forms an attractive recurring revenue stream created from decades of our installed base, and we intend to increase our focus on this aspect of our business with a number of initiatives.
We are also committed to remaining a significant competitive supplier into new large project opportunities that make sense for our business. The logic is simple, project work absorbs cost in our manufacturing facilities and keeps Flowserve as a technological leader and innovator in our industry. Additionally, custom and highly engineered products inherent in our EPD segment, creating new installed base and provide a competitive advantage for future aftermarket and MRO opportunities.
We believe with the manufacturing and product optimization strategies we are implementing that Flowserve will remain a strong competitor in the marketplace, while the quality of our products, brands and operational excellence remain key selling points.
We also see sizable opportunities in our industrial business. IPD has done an admirable job of lowering cost to drive margin performance in recent years, but the priority ahead is growth. We have recently named a new leader for this segment that brings a proven track record of success to drive IPD forward. 
One of the unique opportunities available to us is to drive increased sales through the distribution channel. Our valves business recognizes about 40% of its revenue through distributors. IPD has a number of products that are applicable to this avenue, and we are pursuing it aggressively. Additionally, our acquisition of SIHI has enabled alternative go-to-market methods with a greater focus on run-rate business, which we can incorporate with existing IPD products.
Additionally, we now have a more extensive portfolio that we can better leverage as a result of the Innomag and SIHI acquisitions, both of which primarily serve the chemical industry. Even in the challenged market, we believe IPD is positioned for stronger growth long-term.
In fact, we see opportunity to gain share in the marketplace across our strategic product lines. With the depth and breadth of our unparalleled flow control product and service offerings, Flowserve is well-positioned to continue adding value for our customers. Likewise, this frame agreements, multiyear performance contracts and preferred supplier arrangements gain traction in the industry, Flowserve competes very effectively as we currently have over 400 such programs predominantly with substantial customers. And we believe there's still opportunities in our customer-focused initiatives and end-user strategies.
Lastly, Flowserve continues to demonstrate operational excellence and a continuous improvement culture that drives results. We continue to lower the cost of poor quality, pursue outsourcing opportunities and leverage our supply chain and logistics, all in an effort to drive out cost. At the same time, we're committed to producing innovative products and enhancements for the industry and will continue to demonstrate discipline in our pursuit of new work.
Before turning it over to Karyn, who will cover our recent financials in detail, let me finish by saying that while our end markets remain challenged and maybe for some time, we are on top of it. Flowserve is and will remain a strong competitor with the ability and culture to drive performance. 
Let me now turn it over to Karyn, and I will return afterwards for my final comments."
267555,324325992,937038,"Flowserve Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2016",2016-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Flowserve Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mark. As we indicated in our preliminary release several weeks ago, 2015 fourth quarter adjusted earnings were in line with the expectations we conveyed during the third quarter call. Our stronger performance this quarter leverage strong shipment",1145,"Thanks, Mark. As we indicated in our preliminary release several weeks ago, 2015 fourth quarter adjusted earnings were in line with the expectations we conveyed during the third quarter call. Our stronger performance this quarter leverage strong shipment levels consistent with our traditional seasonality. Our adjusted fourth quarter EPS of $0.89 excludes realignment expenses of $0.31, negative below-the-line currency impact of $0.06, $0.02 for the noncash valuation allowance on the Latin American deferred tax asset and SIHI impact of $0.01.
Firstly offsetting these items is the $0.05 benefit from the reduction of contingent consideration related to a 2013 acquisition. All in, reported EPS was $0.54. 
In our preliminary release early this month, we indicated our fourth quarter adjusted EPS would exclude the reserves established for at risk customer. As we've shown today, we did not add back to $0.06 incurred since we view this as part of our business and wanted to be consistent with prior quarters. But to compare on an apples-to-apples basis with our preliminary release, our results were at the high end of our expectations.
The reserve in question is related to an at risk customer and includes the rates on inventory, work in process and receivables from a European company that has formally it needs to rework its liabilities and if unsuccessful, that risk ship. When market conditions get challenging, we recognize we will see these occurrences periodically. While Flowserve generally does not have customer concentration issues, we do try to take all the steps we can to protect Flowserve's assets
Turning to our bookings. On a constant currency basis, they declined 24.8% in the quarter, excluding SIHI's contribution of $54 million. As a reminder, both the 2014 fourth quarter and full year had record levels of bookings, which grated tough comparisons. Looking further at our bookings profile, original equipment orders were down 32.4% while organic aftermarket bookings declined 13.6% constant currency. As Mark mentioned, core part services and repairs aftermarket business has largely shown the resiliency we expect during 2015.
While we have experienced some maintenance delays, the larger headwinds we face come from reduced levels of CapEx driven aftermarket budgets, such as efficiency upgrades, as well as fewer parts tied to new units. Similar to all of 2015, our end markets during the fourth quarter continue to be impacted by low and volatile oil and gas prices, a strong U.S. dollar and emerging market weakness.
Certain end markets even deteriorated further in the quarter as oil drifted lower and uncertainty increased. For instance, during the first 3 quarters of 2015, our bookings in power, chemical and general industries held up better than we experienced in our oil and gas markets. The trend changed a bit in the fourth quarter as we saw these markets taking additional step down as customers defer capital investment and pulled in their maintenance budgets conserving cash.
Likewise on a regional basis, the Middle East and North America were better performers through much of 2015, but this trend did not contain in the fourth quarter. However, Europe produced some relative improvement in activity levels versus the first 3 quarters of the year. Latin America, our most challenged region throughout 2015, remains extremely soft with the delays occurring in nearly all projects with our important customers in Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina.
Considering the quarterly volatility in our served end markets and regions we experienced this year, our visibility heading into 2016 remains limited. From a sales perspective, we generated $1.3 billion in the 2015 fourth quarter, an increase of 1.2% on a constant currency basis, including $76 million from SIHI. This was also a 17.4% increase sequentially, again, reflecting Flowserve's normal seasonality. Excluding SIHI's contribution, sales declined 4.3% in constant currency compared to last year. Again, our aftermarket business held up better as sales increased 2.2% on an organic constant currency basis.
For their full year 2015, Flowserve's constant currency revenues increased 2.4%, including $294 million from SIHI. Looking at our margins. Even with Q4 revenue declines and over 12% in a tough pricing environment, adjusted gross and operating margins declined only modestly, demonstrating Flowserve's strong operating performance, our shareholder alignment and focus on cost. Additionally, the increased mix of aftermarket sales and some savings from our realignment actions also contributed.
Considering we're at a challenging part of the cycle, we are focused on effectively managing our SG&A expenses. Our fourth quarter SG&A declined $23 million year-over-year or 9.1%, excluding the impact of SIHI, realignment and the benefit associated with the reduction and acquisition-related contingent consideration. The decline is primarily due to lower variable compensation and modest realignment benefits.
Our fourth quarter and full year adjusted tax rates of approximately 29.3% and 29.1% were in line with our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. On a reported basis, the fourth quarter and full year tax rate is elevated as a result of the crude exit taxes for site closures and a noncash valuation allowance we took on certain deferred tax assets in Latin America.
Turning to cash flow. Flowserve generated total operating cash flow of $286 million in the 2015 fourth quarter or approximately $2.18 per share. Capital expenditures were $43 million in the quarter, as we continue to make disciplined investments in our business to support long-term growth. We also repurchased approximately $1.2 million Flowserve shares during the quarter. And for full year 2015, we returned almost $400 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. Approximately $160 million remained available under our current share repurchase program at year-end.
Turning to our 2016 outlook and EPS guidance. We are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.40 to $2.75 a share, which includes approximately $0.10 of above-the-line currency headwinds. Our 2016 adjusted EPS target range expects total revenues to decline 7% to 14%, including a 2% currency headwind.
Additionally, it reflects year-end 2015 foreign currency rates, current commodity prices and market conditions. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the $63 million to $66 million range and a tax rate of 30% to 31%. We also expect the quarterly phasing of our guidance to follow our typical seasonal trend. Although the first quarter is likely to be slightly more pronounced after challenged Q4 bookings, then improvement should follow.
Our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of SIHI while it excludes realignment expenses, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration costs, below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other discrete items. We also expect that 2016 capital expenditures will be reduced versus an elevated 2015 level, where we increased manufacturing capacity in Asia Pacific and purchased a license enabling increased aftermarket opportunities.
We also plan to continue contributing to our pension plans to cover service cost even if the U.S. plan is largely fully funded currently.
With that review, let me turn the call back to Mark for his remain comments."

So a lot of cuts that you talked about have typically been with the multinationals. We do still see productivities, which some of the seen companies around the world particular the in the Middle East. But to your point, a portion of our business primarily in EPD, is what you call late cycle. And as we talked about before, when you started to see this happen in the middle part of 2014, they start to curtail their CapEx expenditures. You've seen this with the multinationals trying to protect their dividend. And the fact is, as those things go off out the drawing board, get pushed a little bit, and they don't come back real quick primarily from the multinationals. So the don't decide necessary overnight to bring it back on that. But typically, these are in their long-term plans. So this is part of the reason -- if you take a step back and look why we primarily focus on our engineered business with some of these realignment activities, we've been looking at these for years. If you look at what has occurred over time, it's important that people understand this, we came through a strong cycle in 2008. And in 2009, we adjusted the markets, and they picked up relatively quickly. There were still quite a bit of activity in the Middle East. But more importantly, what we did is we started setting up a lot of our SPO facilities in India, China and enhance the 1 in Mexico, build up more capabilities. And our LPO/SPO strategies designed start to qualify these so that ultimately, we could move the product and work to those locations. So we've had these things on the droving board for a while. 
What this late cycle component does is gives us in time to go ahead and execute the backlog that we had for the last year, 1.5 year, and we still have backlog. And there are projects that will still come in to the backlog. But for the most by, we exited that and then start moving those capabilities to these low-cost regions of the world. 
If you look at around some of the pipeline and other activities. Some of those are on the run rate business. And that's not as late cycle. And a lot of that, as we talked about earlier, some Brownfield activity. So there still is some good Brownfield activity. Because what happens is a lot of these facilities continue to run and they still need repair and upgrade. So kind of walking through it, what the market environment dows allow us to do, and this is what we're doing, is it allows us to plan and execute and accelerate some of our, what we call, transformational activities around restructuring primarily in our engineered segment."

First of all, you talked about Q4. In the year-over-year compare, we had about $550 million of bookings in Q4 2014. That was a very, very strong quarter. That had a lot of parts tied to new units. It also had a lot of upgrade projects. So those are small projects within the aftermarket portfolio. If you strip that down, and you look and you see that our run rate based maintenance was down only slightly year-over-year, both on a quarter basis and on a year-over-year basis, consistent with what we saw back in 2009. So we'd expect that to stabilize. Unless there's any kind of disruptive event that occurs out there. I mean, what our industry saw across the board was very little activity in Q4, particularly on the project and even on the run rate side. That was reflected in our bookings. But we have seen some stability and aftermarket business. My comments earlier is some of the different maintenance will need to come back and come back online. What we're looking for is to see where the efficiency upgrades come back in and while the rationalizing CapEx, that may take some time. So that -- that's market-driven. From our standpoint, what we need to do is to continue to exited that some of our end-user strategies. I've talked about this before. But frankly, we don't know where all of our installed base is. We're working with some of our teams to increase inventory wherever that is so that we can call in those customers. They want us to help them. We just need to know they're there and we're call them. So we're going to continue to execute end user strategies like that in an attempt to grow the aftermarket business in any environment. And in fact, if you look over the last 7 to 10 years, you've seen a fairly consistent strong growth recycles. Most of that is not the net incremental installed base. A lot -- there was a base amount of that installed base that went in, but the fact is the growth rates were higher than that. That was primarily from executing these end-user strategies. But and you look at our business, when you have volatile moves in oil, it takes everything with it. Everything tends to move in tandem when things tends to stabilize and normalize out even at lower levels, then you can get what I'd say is differentiation in your end-user strategies and any other strategies you want to execute."

That tends to lead the more outsourcing because the capabilities internally for the complex work. They're always going to look to absorb their fixed cost in good times and in bad. The transit are occurring is the equipment is becoming more complex that is set certainly one. Also, lot of the resources internally to our customers are aging and retiring. And they would prefer to outsource of that work. And then, you add to that some of the capabilities we have are on the end-user, this is going to be an opportunity. It's not just amount. It's not just maintaining repair and services, but it's how do we get more efficiency out of those products. We haven't seen a lot of that recently, but that will -- that trend will continue. But short term, Mike, in fairness, everybody looks to cover any other fixed cost. So I can say that didn't happen in the margin, but that's not a long-term strategy for a refinery or any kind of processing plant is to try to bring that in internally. Short term, may be some of the things will do. But on a complex equipment, they tend to let the experts do it."

I think if you take a step back and look at IPD, our focus was on improving the operations and the margins, which we've done. If you look at all the adjustments and take out the at risk customer, we were over 16% in the fourth quarter. So from our standpoint, mission accomplished in terms of the margin improvement. But some of my comments earlier were this group broke out in the engineered business, and we have a real opportunity to improve how they go-to-market. Various channels. Configured-to-order on electronically common terms of being able to response. Some of these pieces of equipment are a couple of $100, $500, $600, $1,000, $1,500. The customers aren't as price-sensitive. They just wanted and they want it now. So if we can execute through our online capabilities and improve those, or through a distribution channel, typically you can command margin because they need these for their Brownfield activity. So I think part of what we're aligning out for you is this is a segment of our business. And frankly, we've learned a lot from the SIHI acquisition. This is a segment of our business, which has great opportunity. Just need to improve it. We need to improve the way we go-to-market and how we execute into the channels.

With low levels of bookings in the project business, you'll have an absorption issue, which can get pretty expensive. And part of the reason, not necessarily just the Q4 bookings, but part of the reason we're addressing that in that segment, Charley, we had -- looking back to '14 and folks would have considered that a decent market and a good year for us, we had about $150 million of under absorption in our business. And a lot of that was in that engineered segment. That's what put us on the path towards what we -- at that time, it was going to be about a 5 or 6-year transformation of that business. Now you never get your under absorption down to 0, but you certainly can get it to run $50 million to $70 million of the business. So I just want to make that point around that engineered segment because that's a lot of the reason we're taking those actions is to help and variable lies and be much more competitive and not have to deal with under absorption. It had an overhang coming into this downturn. And so part of that is we need to attack that. Once we attack that, I think you're going to need to see higher levels of project bookings. In Q4, there were a lot of projects that were right there in front of us and they got pushed. That's not atypical because the customers can wait a couple of quarters and see where market settle out, and it's very, very competitive. And it's to their advantage to wait over a short pier to of time. So I think what you're going to see is as we start to address that, we'll deal with the under absorption. The aftermarket mix will help. But there's a lot of large expensive facilities in this division. So it's going to need project work. But will offset that by starting to take cost out. That's also some of the facilities we took out last year. So I don't have the exact math because part of it is, how we get it to cost both in terms of the gross margin line under absorption in the fixed cost as well. As we mentioned earlier, we're taking action in some of those areas as well and then where the aftermarket business comes in."

Additional downstream reserve capabilities. We have a small service acquisition last year. So we're going to stay focused on where we think we make money long-term. There's a couple of things we need to think about. One is we don't want anything to conflict with these restructuring activities because this is a high return on our investment and we need to execute it very well because our customers are relying on that. The other thing to think about is just we need to make sure we're very thoughtful with our cash, both in terms of the restructuring and our shareholders as well. There is always opportunities to use your stock as currency, but we have to look at that relatively asset that we're looking at.

What we are seeing from customers, and just remember, we didn't have a really strong pricing environment in '13 and '14. It was okay. Versus the last cycle, we had a tremendous pricing environment in '07 and '08. So -- but we're certainly seeing it down, gets competitive at that point in time. The other thing that we'll have to deal with is the top line goes down, it's under absorption and how quickly we can offset that with some of the restructuring as well. But the pricing environment is competitive. We saw this back in 2010 primarily because a lot of the project activity in 2010 was in the Middle East, and that is always competitive in just about any environment. Typically, you have the Korean engineering and contracting firms there. They tend to be very competitive on price and demand that are in their supplies. So we're starting to see a very competitive environment.

And also, what you saw was a lot of the initial part was what I'd call volume-related headcount reduction as supposed to permanent closures of facilities. But when you close a facility anywhere but particularly in any OECD part of the world and particularly in Europe, it cost more than the savings. But the savings are permanent. I think the important thing to think about when you take a step back is if you look at our business, a lot of our heritage capacity, going back 10 years, was in very expensive parts of the world, and we're changing that. And so what that will mean is even some of our OECD facilities are going to be -- have higher load levels and higher engineered equipment in them, and we're going to take more advantage of some of our low-cost manufacturing around the world. So that's what we're trying to emphasize. This is permanent. This is the kind of thing that would have address of that $150 million of under absorption back in 2014. And not only that, would have significant improved margins once executed. So as you think about us moving through the cycle and where margins have been, this is something that will, all other things being equal relative to last.

Well, technology to the products, some monitoring capabilities, boots on the ground, but also technology systems to track our installed base. Going back to your earlier question, the distribution channels, those are out and present there. We're not just taking full advantage of them in our industrial product segment. And these are distributors that can carry multiple product clients and are responsive on a 1 or 2 product basis to a customer that he needs it fairly quickly. The end-user strategies are really designed around where there's substantial installed base. If you look at some of the refineries around the world, there's hundreds of pumps that are out there. And all over the world, if you look at our heritage brands going back many years, there are literally some pumps that were installed in the '70s that we're still supplying parts to in remote parts of the world. So it's really around getting our hands around eat, inventory it, making sure we're calling on the customers. So one of the things that we've done this year, and you alluded to it a little bit, is really increased our focus on our sales organization and how we get out to customers on an account basis and get more share of their wallet. Well, part of it is knowing what customer to call on and what product they have in their facilities. So we'll be the first to tell you, we can do a better job on that. And that is one of our key strategic end user initiatives this year. So if you think about how we've rolled it out over the last couple of years, we've increased our QRC network and will continue to do that. We've worked with systems and some end-user strategies to help them develop and understand how they can bring more efficiency out of an existing facility. Because even right now, they're looking for higher yields out of their processing facilities. The other element now is making sure that we have the right people calling on the right customers, not just out of a QRC, but our salespeople. And that's a separate and distinct strategy from using the distribution channel. The distribution channels been very powerful for our valve business, which is haven't limited on the IPD side. But your point is fair. A lot of this OE that goes through distribution as opposed to service and repair work. But a disruptor, they want to get certainly, margin as well. But what we found, and you've seen in our valve segment, is we can still get good margin on product that goes through distribution. Because keep in mind, what the customers looking is they're looking for that product that are very, very quickly. These aren't multi-million dollar pieces of equipment. These can be in hundreds or even in the low thousands. So time is of the essence."

And then, when you do your due diligence on some of the larger prospects, I mean, it seems like always, and especially in this environment, the customers tell whether CMP company or your equipment suppliers, they tell you that the projects are going forward until they're not. So I guess, what is Flowserve doing differently now to make sure that you're going -- you're putting more resources after the projects that are actually going to go forward versus the ones that are kind of just always out there and always getting pushed?"

Now some of our large customers we have quarterly meetings with them to go through exactly what they're planning. It's in nobody's interest that both sides don't understand what's going to happen. And what I mean by that is a customer, if they're going to go forward with a project, they have reasons, long-term reasons, to do that. They may push it a couple of quarters. So once the project starts moving down the road, we have a pretty good sense that's going to go forward. Sometimes they get canceled. We saw that last year, some projects that we thought really were going to go forward, but it got canceled. Today -- it was up by a multinational to that was very focused on the short-term capital. But where we see projects drop off are the ones that are in the ideation phase that are going on the drawing board. And as people look for visibility around the underlying value to researchers, they may put them off at that point in time. But I think what I want to explain to you is there's a lot of work that's done before these things are bid. So in doing that, we get pretty good visibility."

And we don't necessarily see a lot of competition from Chinese suppliers. These are high end control valves, actuations, highly engineered pieces of equipment. But here's the important thing. The way we do this is with the permission of our customer. So part of what we've been working on over the last couple of years through the LPO/SPO strategy is have -- working with our customers to qualify some of the manufacturing in low-cost parts of the word. And don't just mentioned China because labor has gone quite a bit there. We're talking about various parts of the world, India, Mexico. But the other thing to remember with our customers is well, is oftentimes, they want to deal with the OECD facility. So sometimes what we do, when we talked about we purposes, we'll make that facility engineering assembly and test. It'll still be the front end, but a lot of the activity around value-added piece of equipment will be done in the lower cost part of the world. So I'm not suggesting customers on highly engineered pieces of critical equipment are wholesale moving everything to low-cost parts of the world. That may occur over time and we're prepared to move with them in doing that. But I think the important thing, these aren't commodity sold by the pound type equipment. It typically get fully converted over to a low cost region of the world. And we don't expect that to occur over the short-term. But we expect it to occur faster than what its occurred over the last 10 years, which is why we're taking these actions, one of the reasons we're taking these actions."

We will quickly recap our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results this morning. Additionally, and more importantly, I will outline the actions we are taking to improve our operating and financial performance.",1629,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. We will quickly recap our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results this morning. Additionally, and more importantly, I will outline the actions we are taking to improve our operating and financial performance. Let me begin by saying that overall, I am pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance, which delivered full year results in line with our expectations discussed last quarter. The downturn in our served markets during 2015 was more severe, widespread and persistent than we and the industry at large originally anticipated a year ago. The sharp decline that began in upstream oil and gas spread across the industrial complex as the year progressed. Compounding the challenges in our served industries, the strong dollar was also a major headwind throughout the year. And regionally, petroleum-driven economies in most emerging markets, such as Latin America, remain more challenged.
Against this market backdrop, I am pleased with how our organization responded. Our employees remained committed to our customers and continued to deliver quality products and services through our strong operating model focused on execution.
Importantly, we have taken definitive proactive measures to better competitively position Flowserve for long-term growth and value creation. While we anticipate ongoing headwinds in the coming year, we are confident that the actions we implemented in 2015 and the expanded program and growth initiatives we will discuss today, provide us with a solid foundation to drive profitable growth through the market cycle. 
As we look to the future, global macro fundamentals suggest that Flowserve's end markets will continue their longer-term secular growth patterns, confirming we serve the right strategic industries. Population growth and an emerging middle class will drive energy demand. An aging infrastructure in energy, power, chemical and general industries will require refurbishment or replacement. Our end markets are inherently sound over the long run, although they are currently cyclically challenged. While we can't control the near-term cyclicality, Flowserve is well-equipped to weather periods of volatility, and our track record demonstrates that we are well positioned to capitalize on long-term industry growth drivers, even as we planned for a lower-for-longer environment in the near term.
Let me dive into some of the actions and opportunities we are pursuing. While leadership in technology products and services are fundamental tenets of our competitive model, the markets we compete in demand that we are also competitive with our cost structure. In 2015 and continuing into 2016, the actions we are taking are transformational for Flowserve. In essence, we are structurally repositioning Flowserve for the future. 
First, we're aggressively taking actions to align our SG&A cost structure to market realities. These decisions are difficult, and we consider options thoughtfully before acting. We are not taking these actions lightly as they impact our most valuable asset, namely Flowserve's associates. In addition, we believe the current cycle creates the right environment to accelerate the structural changes we have addressed in prior calls. These actions are critical to leveraging our global operating model and establishing a flexible, responsive manufacturing network that addresses the needs of our markets and customers.
Against both of these objectives, we have made significant progress against our previously announced $125 million realignment plan. In the fourth quarter, we executed over $50 million of activities, bringing the full year 2015 year investment to approximately $80 million. This investment includes the closure or repurposing of 7 manufacturing facilities and a few redundant QRCs, while reducing over 5% of our workforce since the first quarter of 2015. Beyond this announced program, we also made significant strides in integrating SIHI and achieving the synergies we expected to date as part of our transaction economics. 
Our ability to execute on our diverse set of initiatives during 2015 has provided us the confidence and the ability to accelerate even more of our longer-term plans. We developed these actions over a number of years and initially expected an extended time line to implement. However, current market conditions provide the opportunity to act now.
As such, we are now expanding the previous $125 million realignment initiative, which we expect to execute over a 2-year period. We now envision a total investment of around $350 million, including about $50 million of expense that is below the operating income line, with expected annualized savings of approximately $215 million once completed. With approximately $80 million of realignment expense realized in 2015, excluding SIHI initiatives, this leaves us $270 million remaining to execute over the next 2 years. 
While some of our initiatives are in response to volume reductions in the current market, a majority of the actions we are taking are structural in nature, focused on capacity optimization, product rationalization, supply chain optimization and developing a low-cost manufacturing base for competitive positioning. Together, this will fundamentally change our engineered business. We have demonstrated proven success in our ability to transfer manufacturing capacity and permanently reduce costs.
During 2016, we plan to accelerate the closure or repurposing of 8 facilities that were part of our longer-term plans. Additionally, we will further delever the organization, which is intended to increase accountability and performance.
In summary, when our expanded program is complete, we expect to reduce our manufacturing footprint by approximately 30%, improve plant and machine utilization, and significantly increase our manufacturing capabilities and labor hours in low-cost regions. We expect to realize savings of approximately $125 million in 2016 and $185 million next year. We have a proven record of reducing cost and are confident that we can deliver on this plan. 
In addition to our ability to drive further costs out of the system, I am equally encouraged by growth opportunities that are available to Flowserve. For instance, we see significant upside for growth in aftermarket and MRO. We have a QRC network that is well positioned globally. Our core aftermarket activities of parts, repairs and service have shown the resiliency we expect even in 2015. And while we won't predict the timing, we do realize there is a building aftermarket tailwind coming from last year's deferred maintenance activities. As we had seen in the past, the longer facilities continuously run, the greater the workload is available to us when customers do catch up. And while much of our MRO sales are classified as run rate OE, this activity demonstrates substantial aftermarket attributes. 
In short, a significant majority of our annual revenue is brownfield in nature, serving existing infrastructure that is permanent and needs regular attention, which we believe provides opportunities to improve our share of the customer's operational spending. For Flowserve and our shareholders, this work forms an attractive recurring revenue stream created from decades of our installed base, and we intend to increase our focus on this aspect of our business with a number of initiatives.
We're also committed to remaining a significant competitive supplier into new large project opportunities that make sense for our business. The logic is simple, project work absorbs cost in our manufacturing facilities and keeps Flowserve as a technological leader and innovator in our industry. Additionally, custom and highly engineered products inherent in our EPD segment, create a new installed base and provide a competitive advantage for future aftermarket and MRO opportunities. We believe with the manufacturing and product optimization strategies we are implementing that Flowserve will remain a strong competitor in the marketplace, while the quality of our products, brands and operational excellence remain key selling points.
We also see sizable opportunities in our industrial business. IPD has done an admirable job of lowering cost to drive margin performance in recent years, but the priority ahead is growth. We have recently named a new leader for this segment that brings a proven track record of success to drive IPD forward. 
One of the unique opportunities available to us is to drive increased sales through the distribution channel. Our valves business recognizes about 40% of its revenue through distributors. IPD has a number of products that are applicable to this avenue, and we are pursuing it aggressively. Additionally, our acquisition of SIHI has enabled alternative go-to-market methods with a greater focus on run-rate business, which we can incorporate with existing IPD products. Additionally, we now have a more extensive portfolio that we can better leverage as a result of the Innomag and SIHI acquisitions, both of which primarily serve the chemical industry. Even in a challenged market, we believe IPD is positioned for stronger growth long term.
In fact, we see opportunity to gain share in the marketplace across our strategic product lines. With the depth and breadth of our unparalleled flow control product and service offerings, Flowserve is well positioned to continue adding value for our customers. Likewise, as frame agreements, multiyear performance contracts and preferred supplier arrangements gain traction in the industry, Flowserve competes very effectively as we currently have over 400 such programs predominantly with substantial customers. And we believe there is still opportunity in our customer-focused initiatives and end-user strategies.
Lastly, Flowserve continues to demonstrate operational excellence and a continuous improvement culture that drives results. We continue to lower the cost of work quality, pursue outsourcing opportunities and leverage our supply chain and logistics, all in an effort to drive out cost. At the same time, we're committed to producing innovative products and enhancements for the industry and will continue to demonstrate discipline in our pursuit of new work.
Before turning it over to Karyn, who will cover our recent financials in detail, let me finish by saying that while our end markets remain challenged, and may be for some time, we are on top of it. Flowserve is and will remain a strong competitor with the ability and culture to drive performance. 
Let me now turn it over to Karyn, and I will return afterwards for my final comments."
267555,324325992,937170,"Flowserve Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2016",2016-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Flowserve Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mark. As we indicated in our preliminary release several weeks ago, 2015 fourth quarter adjusted earnings were in line with the expectations we conveyed during the third quarter call. Our stronger performance this quarter leverage strong shipment",1147,"Thanks, Mark. As we indicated in our preliminary release several weeks ago, 2015 fourth quarter adjusted earnings were in line with the expectations we conveyed during the third quarter call. Our stronger performance this quarter leverage strong shipment levels consistent with our traditional seasonality. Our adjusted fourth quarter EPS of $0.89 excludes realignment expenses of $0.31, negative below-the-line currency impact of $0.06, $0.02 for the noncash valuation allowance on the Latin American deferred tax asset and SIHI impact of $0.01. Firstly offsetting these items is a $0.05 benefit from the reduction of contingent consideration related to a 2013 acquisition. All in, reported EPS was $0.54. 
In our preliminary release early this month, we indicated our fourth quarter adjusted EPS would exclude the reserves established for an at-risk customer. As we've shown today, we did not add back the $0.06 incurred since we view this as part of our business and wanted to be consistent with prior quarters. But to compare on an apples-to-apples basis with our preliminary release, our results were at the high end of our expectations.
The reserve in question is related to an at-risk customer and includes the write-down of inventory, work in process and receivables from a European company that has formally indicated it needs to rework its liabilities, and if unsuccessful, is at risk for insolvency. When market conditions get challenging, we recognize we will see these occurrences periodically. While Flowserve generally does not have customer concentration issues, we do stive to take all the steps we can to protect Flowserve's assets
Turning to our bookings. On a constant currency basis, they declined 24.8% in the quarter, excluding SIHI's contribution of $54 million. As a reminder, both the 2014 fourth quarter and full year had record levels of bookings, which created tough comparisons. Looking further at our bookings profile, original equipment orders were down 32.4% while organic aftermarket bookings declined 13.6% constant currency. As Mark mentioned, our core parts, services and repairs aftermarket business has largely shown the resiliency we expect during 2015. While we have experienced some maintenance delays, the larger headwinds we face come from reduced levels of CapEx-driven aftermarket budgets, such as efficiency upgrades as well as fewer parts tied to new units. 
Similar to all of 2015, our end markets during the fourth quarter continue to be impacted by low and volatile oil and gas prices, a strong U.S. dollar and emerging market weakness. Certain end markets even deteriorated further in the quarter, as oil drifted lower and uncertainty increased. 
For instance, during the first 3 quarters of 2015, our bookings in power, chemical and general industries held up better than we experienced in our oil and gas markets. The trend changed a bit in the fourth quarter as we saw these markets take an additional step down as customers deferred capital investment and pulled in their maintenance budgets, conserving cash.
Likewise on a regional basis, the Middle East and North America were better performers during much of 2015, but this trend did not continue in the fourth quarter. However, Europe produced some relative improvement in activity levels versus the first 3 quarters of the year. Latin America, our most challenged region throughout 2015, remains extremely soft with the delays occurring in nearly all projects with our important customers in Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. Considering the quarterly volatility in our served end markets and regions we experienced this year, our visibility heading into 2016 remains limited. 
From a sales perspective, we generated $1.3 billion in the 2015 fourth quarter, an increase of 1.2% on a constant currency basis, including $76 million from SIHI. This was also a 17.4% increase sequentially, again, reflecting Flowserve's normal seasonality. Excluding SIHI's contribution, sales declined 4.3% in constant currency compared to last year. Again, our aftermarket business held up better as sales increased 2.2% on an organic constant currency basis. For the full year 2015, Flowserve's constant currency revenues increased 2.4%, including $294 million from SIHI. 
Looking at our margins. Even with Q4 revenue declines of over 12% in a tough pricing environment, adjusted gross and operating margins declined only modestly, demonstrating Flowserve's strong operating performance, our shareholder alignment and focus on costs. Additionally, the increased mix of aftermarket sales and some savings from our realignment actions also contributed.
Considering we're at a challenging part of the cycle, we are focused on effectively managing our SG&A expenses. Our fourth quarter SG&A declined $23 million year-over-year or 9.1%, excluding the impact of SIHI, realignment and the benefit associated with the reduction and acquisition-related contingent consideration. The decline is primarily due to lower variable compensation and modest realignment benefits.
Our fourth quarter and full year adjusted tax rates of approximately 29.3% and 29.1% were in line with our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. On a reported basis, the fourth quarter and full year tax rate is elevated as a result of accrued exit taxes for site closures and a noncash valuation allowance we took on certain deferred tax assets in Latin America.
Turning to cash flow. Flowserve generated total operating cash flow of $286 million in the 2015 fourth quarter or approximately $2.18 per share. Capital expenditures were $43 million in the quarter, as we continued to make disciplined investments in our business to support long-term growth. We also repurchased approximately $1.2 million Flowserve shares during the quarter. And for full year 2015, we returned almost $400 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. Approximately $160 million remained available under our current share repurchase program at year-end.
Turning to our 2016 outlook and EPS guidance. We are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.40 to $2.75 a share, which includes approximately $0.10 of above-the-line currency headwinds. Our 2016 adjusted EPS target range expects total revenues to decline 7% to 14%, including a 2% currency headwind. Additionally, it reflects year-end 2015 foreign currency rates, current commodity prices and market conditions. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the $63 million to $66 million range, and a tax rate of 30% to 31%. We also expect the quarterly phasing of our guidance to follow our typical seasonal trends, although the first quarter is likely to be slightly more pronounced after challenged Q4 bookings, then improvement should follow.
Our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of SIHI while it excludes realignment expenses, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration costs, below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other discrete items. We also expect that 2016 capital expenditures will be reduced versus an elevated 2015 level, where we increased manufacturing capacity in Asia Pacific and purchased a license, enabling increased aftermarket opportunities. We also plan to continue contributing to our pension plans to cover service cost even as the U.S. plan is largely fully funded currently.
With that review, let me turn the call back to Mark for his remain comments."

So a lot of cuts that you talked about have typically been with the multinationals. We do still see project activities with some of the state-owned companies around the world, particularly in the Middle East. But to your point, a portion of our business, primarily in EPD, is what you call late cycle. And as we talked about before, when you started to see this happen in the middle part of 2014, they start to curtail their CapEx expenditures. You've seen this with the multinationals trying to protect their dividend. And the fact is, is those things can go off the drawing board, get pushed a little bit, and they don't come back real quick from -- primarily from the multinationals. So they don't decide necessarily overnight to bring it back online. But typically, these are in their long-term plans. So this is part of the reason -- if you take a step back and look why we primarily focused on our engineered business with some of these realignment activities. We've been looking at these for years. If you look at what has occurred over time -- and it's important that people understand this. We came through a strong cycle in 2008. And in 2009, we adjusted to markets, and they picked up relatively quickly. There were still quite a bit of activity in the Middle East. But more importantly, what we did is we started setting up a lot of our SPO facilities in India, China and enhanced the one we had in Mexico, build out more capabilities. And our LPO/SPO strategy is designed start to qualify these so that ultimately, we could move the product and work to those locations. So we've had these things on the drawing board for a while. What this late-cycle component does is gives us in time to go ahead and execute the backlog that we had for the last year, 1.5 year, and we still have backlog. And there are projects that will still come in the backlog. But for the most part, we execute that and then start moving those capabilities to these low-cost regions of the world. If you look at around some of the pipeline and other activities, some of those are on some of our run rate business. And that's not as late cycle. And a lot of that, as we talked about earlier, some brownfield activity. So there still is some good brownfield activity, because what happens is a lot of these facilities continue to run and they still need repair and upgrade. So kind of walking through it, what the market environment does allow us to do, and this is why we're doing it, is it allows us to plan and execute and accelerate some of our, what we call, transformational activities around restructuring, primarily in our engineered segment."

But it came back within the year, back at towards the end of 2009, some of the spend activity. First of all, you talked about Q4. In the year-over-year compare, we had about $550 million of bookings in Q4 2014. That was a very, very strong quarter. That had a lot of parts tied to new units. It also had a lot of upgrade projects. So those are small projects within the aftermarket portfolio. If you strip that down, and you look and you see that our run rate-based maintenance was down only slightly year-over-year, both on a quarter basis and on a year-over-year basis, consistent with what we saw back in 2009. So we'd expect that to stabilize, unless there's any kind of disruptive event that occurs out there. I mean, what our industry saw across the board was very little activity in Q4, particularly on the project and even on the run rate side. That was reflected in our bookings. But we have seen some stability in the aftermarket business. My comments earlier is some of them -- deferred maintenance will need to come back and come back online. What we're looking for is to see where the efficiency upgrades come back in. And while they're rationalizing CapEx, that may take some time. So that is -- that's market driven. From our standpoint, what we need to do is continue to execute on some of our end-user strategies. I've talked about this before. But frankly, we don't know where all of our installed base is. We're working with some of our teams to increase and inventory where that is, so we can call on those customers. They want us to help them. We just need to know they're there and to call on them. So we're going to continue to execute end-user strategies like that in an attempt to grow the aftermarket business in any environment. And in fact, if you look over the last 7 to 10 years, you've seen a fairly consistent strong growth through these cycles. Most of that is not the net incremental installed base. A lot -- there was a base amount of net installed base that went in, but the fact is the growth rates were higher than that. And that was primarily from executing these end-user strategies. But when you look at our business, when you have volatile moves in oil, it takes everything with it. Everything tends to move in tandem when things tend to stabilize and normalize out, even at lower levels, then you can get what I'd say is differentiation in your end-user strategies and any other strategy you want to execute."

On the bookings in the quarter, obviously, really heavy aftermarket weighting, 72% or so, which is, I think, probably unusually high for that business. And you kind of understand why, given that, that's a large project business. But I'm wondering can you maybe talk about the margin impact on that significant mix shift in aftermarket versus OE when you tie then with -- obviously, you've got some absorption because the OE is dropping off. I guess, my question at the end of the day is, what level can you maintain the margins with aftermarket to offset the absorption issues you're hitting on EPD?"

With low-level bookings in the project business, you'll have an absorption issue, which can get pretty expensive. And part of the reason -- not necessarily just the Q4 bookings, but part of the reason we're addressing that in that segment, Charley, we had -- looking back to '14 -- and folks would have considered that a decent market and a good year for us. We had about $150 million of under-absorption in our business, and a lot of that was in that engineered segment. That's what put us on the path towards what we -- at that time, it was going to be about a 5- or 6-year transformation of that business. Now you never get your under-absorption down to 0, but you certainly can get it to run $50 million to $70 million in your business. So I just want to make that point around that engineered segment, because that's a lot of the reason we're taking those actions is to help it variablize and be much more competitive and not have to deal with under-absorption. It had an overhang coming into this downturn. And so part of that is we need to attack that. Once we attack that, I think you're going to need to see higher levels of project bookings. In Q4, there were a lot of projects that were right there in front of us, and they got pushed. That's not atypical because the customer can wait a couple of quarters and see where markets settle out. And it's very, very competitive, and it's to their advantage to wait over a short period of time. So I think what you're going to see is, as we start to address that, we'll deal with the under-absorption. The aftermarket mix will help. But there's a lot of large, expensive facilities in this division. So it's going to need project work. But we'll offset that by starting to take cost out. That's also some of the facilities we took out last year. So I don't have the exact math because part of it is, how we get it to cost, both in terms of the gross margin line under-absorption, in the fixed cost as well. As we mentioned earlier, we're taking action in some of those areas as well. And then where the aftermarket business comes in."

I think what you don't want is for us to decide all of a sudden to go in a left-hand turn direction into some area that's not core to us just because it may be viewed as relatively cheap. So it's fair to say that we're still focused on the areas where we think we make money: the chemical industry, we've talked for years around the opportunity around upstream; additional downstream or service capabilities, we made have a small service acquisition last year. So we're going to stay focused on where we think we make money long term. There's a couple of things we need to think about. One is, we don't want anything to conflict with these restructuring activities because this is a high return on our investment, and we need to execute them very well because our customers are relying on that. The other thing to think about is just -- we need to make sure we're very thoughtful with our cash, both in terms of the restructuring and our shareholders as well. There is always opportunity to use your stock as currency, but we'd have to look at that relative to the asset that we're looking at. So we are -- clearly, opportunities may come in this type of environment, especially for a company's like ours that has a very strong operating platform.

We are seeing slower payments, in particular, Southern Europe, Latin American customers. They're continuing to pay but albeit just slower. Accounts payable is down with inventory up. Majority of those increases in inventory are in working capital. So adding cost, but not necessarily in purchased parts, is more labor and less payables associated with that inventory. Also in terms of accounts payable, negotiating the terms with suppliers, we will pay according to terms. And all through 2015, there's an emphasis directionally paying on time. We have a lot of local suppliers, so paying on time helps the timing and on-time delivery as well as directionally, pricing. We have been focused locally at the sites in terms of improving working capital. As I mentioned on the third quarter earnings release call, we are stepping back and looking at this now, going forward, on a more global perspective and really looking to implement global standardized procedures around billings in cash and collection as well as on order and purchasing. So those are the types of things we're going to look at. Those types of programs take time.

Some of that is outside of our control. What we are seeing from customers, and just remember, we didn't have a really strong pricing environment in '13 and '14. It was okay. Versus the last cycle, we had a tremendous pricing environment in '07 and '08. So -- but we're certainly seeing it down -- get competitive at that point in time. The other thing that we'll have to deal with, as the top line goes down, there's under-absorption and how quickly we can offset that with some of the restructuring as well. But the pricing environment is competitive. We saw this back in 2010 primarily because a lot of the project activity in 2010 was in the Middle East, and that is always competitive in just about any environment. Typically, you have Korean engineering and contracting firms there. They tend to be very competitive on price and demand that of their supplies, so we're starting to see a very competitive environment. The real question, Joe, is how long this is going to last. Because the late-cycle part of our business, which is the projects, which as we've talked about, has been well less than 20% of our business, it tends to -- the opportunities tend to move out quick and move back slowly."

But the fact is those savings are permanent. And also, what you saw was a lot of the initial part was what I'd call volume-related headcount reduction as opposed to permanent closures of facilities. But when you close a facility anywhere, but particularly in any OECD part of the world and particularly in Europe, it costs more than the savings. But the savings are permanent. I think the important thing to think about when you take a step back is, if you look at our business, a lot of our heritage capacity, going back 10 years, was in very expensive parts of the world, and we're changing that. And so what that will mean is even some of our OECD facilities are going to be -- have higher load levels and higher engineered equipment in them, and we're going to take more advantage of some of our low-cost manufacturing around the world. So that's what we're trying to emphasize. This is permanent. This is the kind of thing that would have address of that $150 million of under-absorption back in 2014. And not only that, would've significant improved margins once executed. So as you think about us moving through the cycle and where margins have been, this is something that will, all other things being equal, relative to last.

Well, technology to the products, some monitoring capabilities, boots on the ground, but also technology systems to track our installed base. Going back to your earlier question, the distribution channels, those are out and present there. We're not just taking full advantage of them in our Industrial Product segment. And these are distributors that can carry multiple product lines and are responsive on a 1 or 2 product basis to a customer that needs it fairly quickly. The end-user strategies are really designed around where there's substantial installed base. If you look at some of the refineries around the world, there's hundreds of pumps that are out there. And all over the world, if you look at our heritage brands going back many years, there are literally some pumps that were installed in the '70s that we're still supplying parts to in remote parts of the world. So it's really around getting our hands around that, inventorying it, making sure we're calling on the customers. So one of the things that we've done this year, and you alluded to it a little bit, is really increased our focus on our sales organization and how we get out to customers on an account basis and get more share of their wallet. Well, part of it is knowing what customer to call on and what product they have in their facilities. So we'll be the first to tell you, we can do a better job on that. And that is one of our key strategic end-user initiatives this year. So if you think about how we've rolled it out over the last couple of years, we've increased our QRC network, and we'll continue to do that. We've worked with systems and some end-user strategies to help them develop and understand how they can bring more efficiency out of an existing facility. Because even right now, they're looking for higher yields out of their processing facilities. The other element now is making sure that we have the right people calling on the right customers, not just out of a QRC, but our salespeople. And that's a separate and distinct strategy from using the distribution channel. The distribution channel has been very powerful for our valve business. We just haven't levered it on the IPD side. But your point is fair. A lot of this is OE that goes through distribution as opposed to service and repair work. But a distributor, they want to get, certainly, margin as well. But what we found, and you've seen in our valve segment, is we can still get good margin on product that goes through distribution. Because keep in mind, what the customer is looking is they're looking for that product that are very, very quickly. These aren't multimillion dollar pieces of equipment. These can be in hundreds or even in the low thousands. So time is of the essence."

And as people look for visibility around the underlying value of the resource, they may put them off at that point in time. But I think what I want to explain to you is, there's a lot of work that's done before these things are bid. So in doing that, we get pretty good visibility."

So some of these are very, very highly engineered pieces of equipment, and we don't necessarily see a lot of competition from Chinese suppliers. These are high-end control valves, actuation, highly engineered pieces of equipment. But here's the important thing: The way we do this is with the permission of our customer. So part of what we've been working on over the last couple of years through the LPO/SPO strategy is have -- working with our customers to qualify some of the manufacturing in low-cost parts of the word. And don't just mention China, because labor (H) have gone up quite a bit there. We're talking about various parts of the world: India, Mexico. But the other thing to remember with our customers is, well, is oftentimes, they want to deal with the OECD facility. So sometimes what we do, when we talk about repurposes, we'll make that facility engineering assembly and test. It'll still be the front end, but a lot of the activity around the value add to the piece of equipment will be done in a lower-cost part of the world. So I'm not suggesting customers on highly engineered pieces of critical equipment are wholesale moving everything to low-cost parts of the world. That may occur over time, and we're prepared to move with them in doing that. But I think the important thing, these aren't commodity ""sold by the pound"" type equipment that typically get fully converted over to a low-cost region of the world. And we don't expect that to occur over the short term. But we expect it to occur faster than when its occurred over the last 10 years, which is why we're taking these actions -- one of the reasons we're taking these actions."

We will quickly recap our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results this morning. Additionally, and more importantly, I will outline the actions we are taking to improve our operating and financial performance.",1629,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. We will quickly recap our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results this morning. Additionally, and more importantly, I will outline the actions we are taking to improve our operating and financial performance. Let me begin by saying that overall, I am pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance, which delivered full year results in line with our expectations discussed last quarter. The downturn in our served markets during 2015 was more severe, widespread and persistent than we and the industry at large originally anticipated a year ago. The sharp decline that began in upstream oil and gas spread across the industrial complex as the year progressed. Compounding the challenges in our served industries, the strong dollar was also a major headwind throughout the year. And regionally, petroleum-driven economies in most emerging markets, such as Latin America, remain more challenged.
Against this market backdrop, I am pleased with how our organization responded. Our employees remained committed to our customers and continued to deliver quality products and services through our strong operating model focused on execution. Importantly, we have taken definitive proactive measures to better competitively position Flowserve for long-term growth and value creation. While we anticipate ongoing headwinds in the coming year, we are confident that the actions we implemented in 2015 and the expanded program and growth initiatives we will discuss today provide us with a solid foundation to drive profitable growth through the market cycle. 
As we look to the future, global macro fundamentals suggest that Flowserve's end markets will continue their longer-term secular growth patterns, confirming we serve the right strategic industries. Population growth and an emerging middle class will drive energy demand. An aging infrastructure in energy, power, chemical and general industries will require refurbishment or replacement. Our end markets are inherently sound over the long run, although they are currently cyclically challenged. While we can't control the near-term cyclicality, Flowserve is well-equipped to weather periods of volatility, and our track record demonstrates that we are well positioned to capitalize on long-term industry growth drivers, even as we plan for a lower-for-longer environment in the near term.
Let me dive into some of the actions and opportunities we are pursuing. While leadership in technology products and services are fundamental tenets of our competitive model, the markets we compete in demand that we are also competitive with our cost structure. In 2015 and continuing into 2016, the actions we are taking are transformational for Flowserve. In essence, we are structurally repositioning Flowserve for the future. 
First, we're aggressively taking actions to align our SG&A cost structure to market realities. These decisions are difficult, and we consider options thoughtfully before acting. We are not taking these actions lightly as they impact our most valuable asset, namely Flowserve's associates. In addition, we believe the current cycle creates the right environment to accelerate the structural changes we have addressed in prior calls. These actions are critical to leveraging our global operating model and establishing a flexible, responsive manufacturing network that addresses the needs of our markets and customers.
Against both of these objectives, we have made significant progress against our previously announced $125 million realignment plan. In the fourth quarter, we executed over $50 million of activities, bringing the full year 2015 year investment to approximately $80 million. This investment includes the closure or repurposing of 7 manufacturing facilities and a few redundant QRCs, while reducing over 5% of our workforce since the first quarter of 2015. Beyond this announced program, we also made significant strides in integrating SIHI and achieving the synergies we expected to date as part of our transaction economics. 
Our ability to execute on our diverse set of initiatives during 2015 has provided us the confidence and the ability to accelerate even more of our longer-term plans. We developed these actions over a number of years and initially expected an extended time line to implement. However, current market conditions provide the opportunity to act now. As such, we are now expanding the previous $125 million realignment initiative, which we expect to execute over a 2-year period. We now envision a total investment of around $350 million, including about $50 million of expense that is below the operating income line, with expected annualized savings of approximately $215 million once completed. With approximately $80 million of realignment expense realized in 2015, excluding SIHI initiatives, this leaves us $270 million remaining to execute over the next 2 years. 
While some of our initiatives are in response to volume reductions in the current market, a majority of the actions we are taking are structural in nature, focused on capacity optimization, product rationalization, supply chain optimization and developing a low-cost manufacturing base for competitive positioning. Together, this will fundamentally change our engineered business. We have demonstrated proven success in our ability to transfer manufacturing capacity and permanently reduce costs. During 2016, we plan to accelerate the closure or repurposing of 8 facilities that were part of our longer-term plans. Additionally, we will further delever the organization, which is intended to increase accountability and performance.
In summary, when our expanded program is complete, we expect to reduce our manufacturing footprint by approximately 30%, improve plant and machine utilization, and significantly increase our manufacturing capabilities and labor hours in low-cost regions. We expect to realize savings of approximately $125 million in 2016 and $185 million next year. We have a proven record of reducing cost and are confident that we can deliver on this plan. 
In addition to our ability to drive further costs out of the system, I am equally encouraged by growth opportunities that are available to Flowserve. For instance, we see significant upside for growth in aftermarket and MRO. We have a QRC network that is well positioned globally. Our core aftermarket activities of parts, repairs and service have shown the resiliency we expect even in 2015. And while we won't predict the timing, we do realize there is a building aftermarket tailwind coming from last year's deferred maintenance activities. As we had seen in the past, the longer facilities continuously run, the greater the workload is available to us when customers do catch up. And while much of our MRO sales are classified as run rate OE, this activity demonstrates substantial aftermarket attributes. 
In short, a significant majority of our annual revenue is brownfield in nature, serving existing infrastructure that is permanent and needs regular attention, which we believe provides opportunities to improve our share of the customer's operational spending. For Flowserve and our shareholders, this work forms an attractive recurring revenue stream created from decades of our installed base, and we intend to increase our focus on this aspect of our business with a number of initiatives.
We're also committed to remaining a significant competitive supplier into new large project opportunities that make sense for our business. The logic is simple, project work absorbs cost in our manufacturing facilities and keeps Flowserve as a technological leader and innovator in our industry. Additionally, custom and highly engineered products inherent in our EPD segment, create a new installed base and provide a competitive advantage for future aftermarket and MRO opportunities. We believe with the manufacturing and product optimization strategies we are implementing that Flowserve will remain a strong competitor in the marketplace, while the quality of our products, brands and operational excellence remain key selling points.
We also see sizable opportunities in our industrial business. IPD has done an admirable job of lowering cost to drive margin performance in recent years, but the priority ahead is growth. We have recently named a new leader for this segment that brings a proven track record of success to drive IPD forward. 
One of the unique opportunities available to us is to drive increased sales through the distribution channel. Our valves business recognizes about 40% of its revenue through distributors. IPD has a number of products that are applicable to this avenue, and we are pursuing it aggressively. Additionally, our acquisition of SIHI has enabled alternative go-to-market methods with a greater focus on run-rate business, which we can incorporate with existing IPD products. Additionally, we now have a more extensive portfolio that we can better leverage as a result of the Innomag and SIHI acquisitions, both of which primarily serve the chemical industry. Even in a challenged market, we believe IPD is positioned for stronger growth long term.
In fact, we see opportunity to gain share in the marketplace across our strategic product lines. With the depth and breadth of our unparalleled flow control product and service offerings, Flowserve is well positioned to continue adding value for our customers. Likewise, as frame agreements, multiyear performance contracts and preferred supplier arrangements gain traction in the industry, Flowserve competes very effectively as we currently have over 400 such programs predominantly with substantial customers. And we believe there is still opportunity in our customer-focused initiatives and end-user strategies.
Lastly, Flowserve continues to demonstrate operational excellence and a continuous improvement culture that drives results. We continue to lower the cost of work quality, pursue outsourcing opportunities and leverage our supply chain and logistics, all in an effort to drive out cost. At the same time, we're committed to producing innovative products and enhancements for the industry and will continue to demonstrate discipline in our pursuit of new work.
Before turning it over to Karyn, who will cover our recent financials in detail, let me finish by saying that while our end markets remain challenged, and may be for some time, we are on top of it. Flowserve is and will remain a strong competitor with the ability and culture to drive performance. 
Let me now turn it over to Karyn, and I will return afterwards for my final comments."
267555,324325992,937241,"Flowserve Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2016",2016-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Flowserve Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mark. As we indicated in our preliminary release several weeks ago, 2015 fourth quarter adjusted earnings were in line with the expectations we conveyed during the third quarter call. Our stronger performance this quarter leveraged strong shipment",1146,"Thanks, Mark. As we indicated in our preliminary release several weeks ago, 2015 fourth quarter adjusted earnings were in line with the expectations we conveyed during the third quarter call. Our stronger performance this quarter leveraged strong shipment levels consistent with our traditional seasonality. Our adjusted fourth quarter EPS of $0.89 excludes realignment expenses of $0.31, negative below-the-line currency impact of $0.06, $0.02 for the noncash valuation allowance on the Latin American deferred tax asset and SIHI impact of $0.01. Firstly offsetting these items is a $0.05 benefit from the reduction of contingent consideration related to a 2013 acquisition. All in, reported EPS was $0.54. 
In our preliminary release early this month, we indicated our fourth quarter adjusted EPS would exclude the reserves established for an at-risk customer. As we've shown today, we did not add back the $0.06 incurred since we view this as part of our business and wanted to be consistent with prior quarters. But to compare on an apples-to-apples basis with our preliminary release, our results were at the high end of our expectations.
The reserve in question is related to an at-risk customer and includes the write-down of inventory, work in process and receivables from a European company that has formally indicated it needs to rework its liabilities, and if unsuccessful, is at risk for insolvency. When market conditions get challenging, we recognize we will see these occurrences periodically. While Flowserve generally does not have customer concentration issues, we do strive to take all the steps we can to protect Flowserve's assets
Turning to our bookings. On a constant currency basis, they declined 24.8% in the quarter, excluding SIHI's contribution of $54 million. As a reminder, both the 2014 fourth quarter and full year had record levels of bookings, which created tough comparisons. Looking further at our bookings profile, original equipment orders were down 32.4% while organic aftermarket bookings declined 13.6% constant currency. As Mark mentioned, our core parts, services and repairs aftermarket business has largely shown the resiliency we expect during 2015. While we have experienced some maintenance delays, the larger headwinds we face come from reduced levels of CapEx-driven aftermarket budgets, such as efficiency upgrades as well as fewer parts tied to new units. 
Similar to all of 2015, our end markets during the fourth quarter continue to be impacted by low and volatile oil and gas prices, a strong U.S. dollar and emerging market weakness. Certain end markets even deteriorated further in the quarter, as oil drifted lower and uncertainty increased. For instance, during the first 3 quarters of 2015, our bookings in power, chemical and general industries held up better than we experienced in our oil and gas markets. The trend changed a bit in the fourth quarter as we saw these markets take an additional step down as customers deferred capital investment and pulled in their maintenance budgets, conserving cash.
Likewise on a regional basis, the Middle East and North America were better performers during much of 2015, but this trend did not continue in the fourth quarter. However, Europe produced some relative improvement in activity levels versus the first 3 quarters of the year. Latin America, our most challenged region throughout 2015, remains extremely soft with delays occurring in nearly all projects with our important customers in Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. Considering the quarterly volatility in our served end markets and regions we experienced this year, our visibility heading into 2016 remains limited. 
From a sales perspective, we generated $1.3 billion in the 2015 fourth quarter, an increase of 1.2% on a constant currency basis, including $76 million from SIHI. This was also a 17.4% increase sequentially, again, reflecting Flowserve's normal seasonality. Excluding SIHI's contribution, sales declined 4.3% in constant currency compared to last year. Again, our aftermarket business held up better as sales increased 2.2% on an organic constant currency basis. For the full year 2015, Flowserve's constant currency revenues increased 2.4%, including $294 million from SIHI. 
Looking at our margins. Even with Q4 revenue declines of over 12% and a tough pricing environment, adjusted gross and operating margins declined only modestly, demonstrating Flowserve's strong operating performance, our shareholder alignment and focus on costs. Additionally, the increased mix of aftermarket sales and some savings from our realignment actions also contributed.
Considering we're at a challenging part of the cycle, we are focused on effectively managing our SG&A expenses. Our fourth quarter SG&A declined $23 million year-over-year or 9.1%, excluding the impact of SIHI, realignment and the benefit associated with the reduction and acquisition-related contingent consideration. The decline is primarily due to lower variable compensation and modest realignment benefits. Our fourth quarter and full year adjusted tax rates of approximately 29.3% and 29.1% were in line with our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. On a reported basis, the fourth quarter and full year tax rate is elevated as a result of accrued exit taxes for site closures and a noncash valuation allowance we took on certain deferred tax assets in Latin America.
Turning to cash flow. Flowserve generated total operating cash flow of $286 million in the 2015 fourth quarter or approximately $2.18 per share. Capital expenditures were $43 million in the quarter, as we continued to make disciplined investments in our business to support long-term growth. We also repurchased approximately $1.2 million Flowserve shares during the quarter. And for full year 2015, we returned almost $400 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. Approximately $160 million remained available under our current share repurchase program at year-end.
Turning to our 2016 outlook and EPS guidance. We are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.40 to $2.75 a share, which includes approximately $0.10 of above-the-line currency headwinds. Our 2016 adjusted EPS target range expects total revenues to decline 7% to 14%, including a 2% currency headwind. Additionally, it reflects year-end 2015 foreign currency rates, current commodity prices and market conditions. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the $63 million to $66 million range, and a tax rate of 30% to 31%. We also expect the quarterly phasing of our guidance to follow our typical seasonal trends, although the first quarter is likely to be slightly more pronounced after challenged Q4 bookings, then improvement should follow.
Our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of SIHI while it excludes realignment expenses, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration costs, below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other discrete items. We also expect that 2016 capital expenditures will be reduced versus an elevated 2015 level, where we increased manufacturing capacity in Asia Pacific and purchased a license, enabling increased aftermarket opportunities. We also plan to continue contributing to our pension plans to cover service costs even as the U.S. plan is largely fully funded currently.
With that review, let me turn the call back to Mark for his remain comments."

So a lot of cuts that you talked about have typically been with the multinationals. We do still see project activities with some of the state-owned companies around the world, particularly in the Middle East. But to your point, a portion of our business, primarily in EPD, is what you call late cycle. And as we talked about before, and you started to see this happen in the middle part of 2014, they start to curtail their CapEx expenditures. You've seen this with the multinationals trying to protect their dividend. And the fact is, is those things can go off the drawing board, get pushed a little bit, and they don't come back real quick from -- primarily from the multinationals. So they don't decide necessarily overnight to bring it back online. But typically, these are in their long-term plans. So this is part of the reason -- if you take a step back and look why we primarily focused on our engineered business with some of these realignment activities. We've been looking at these for years. If you look at what has occurred over time -- and it's important that people understand this. We came through a strong cycle in 2008. And in 2009, we adjusted to markets, and they picked up relatively quickly. There were still quite a bit of activity in the Middle East. But more importantly, what we did is we started setting up a lot of our SPO facilities in India, China and enhanced the one we had in Mexico, build out more capabilities. And our LPO/SPO strategy is designed start to qualify these so that ultimately, we can move the product and work to those locations. So we've had these things on the drawing board for a while. What this late-cycle component does is gives us in time to go ahead and execute the backlog that we had for the last year, 1.5 years, and we still have backlog. And there are projects that will still come in the backlog. But for the most part, we execute that and then start moving those capabilities to these low-cost regions of the world. If you look at around some of the pipeline and other activities, some of those are on some of our run rate business. And that's not as late cycle. And a lot of that, as we talked about earlier, some brownfield activity. So there still is some good brownfield activity, because what happens is a lot of these facilities continue to run and they still need repair and upgrade. So kind of walking through it, what the market environment does allow us to do, and this is why we're doing it, is it allows us to plan and execute and accelerate some of our, what we call transformational activities around restructuring, primarily in our engineered segment."

But it came back within the year, back at towards the end of 2009, some of the spend activity. First of all, you talked about Q4. In the year-over-year compare, we had about $550 million of bookings in Q4 2014. That was a very, very strong quarter. That had a lot of parts tied to new units. It also had a lot of upgrade projects. So those are small projects within the aftermarket portfolio. If you strip that down, and you look and you see that our run rate-based maintenance was down only slightly year-over-year, both on a quarter basis and on a year-over-year basis, consistent with what we saw back in 2009. So we'd expect that to stabilize, unless there's any kind of disruptive event that occurs out there. I mean, what our industry saw across the board was very little activity in Q4, particularly on the project and even on the run rate side. That was reflected in our bookings. But we have seen some stability in the aftermarket business. My comments earlier is some of them -- deferred maintenance will need to come back and come back online. What we're looking for is to see where the efficiency upgrades come back in. And while they're rationalizing CapEx, that may take some time. So that's market driven. From our standpoint, what we need to do is continue to execute on some of our end-user strategies. I've talked about this before. But frankly, we don't know where all of our installed base is. We're working with some of our teams to increase and inventory where that is, so we can call on those customers. They want us to help them. We just need to know they're there and to call on them. So we're going to continue to execute end-user strategies like that in an attempt to grow the aftermarket business in any environment. And in fact, if you look over the last 7 to 10 years, you've seen a fairly consistent strong growth through these cycles. Most of that is not the net incremental installed base. A lot -- there was a base amount of net installed base that went in, but the fact is the growth rates were higher than that. And that was primarily from executing these end-user strategies. But when you look at our business, when you have volatile moves in oil, it takes everything with it. Everything tends to move in tandem when things tend to stabilize and normalize out, even at lower levels, then you can get what I'd say is differentiation in your end-user strategies and any other strategy you want to execute."

They're always going to look to absorb their fixed cost in good times and in bad. So the trends that are occurring is the equipment is becoming more complex. That is certainly one. Also, a lot of the resources internally to our customers are aging and retiring. And they would prefer to outsource that work. And then you add to that some of the capabilities we have around the end user, and this is going to be an opportunity. It's not just amount. It's not just maintaining repair and servicing, but it's how do we get more efficiency out of those products. We haven't seen a lot of that recently, but that will -- that trend will continue. But short term, Mike, in fairness, everybody looks to cover any of their fixed cost, so I can't say that didn't happen on the margin.

But some of my comments earlier were, this group broke out of the engineered business, and we have a real opportunity to improve how they go to market. Various channels. Configure to order on -- electronically in terms of being able to respond. Some of these pieces of equipment are a couple hundred dollars, $500, $600, $1,000, $1,500. The customers aren't as price sensitive. They just want it, and they want it now.

With low-level bookings in the project business, you'll have an absorption issue, which can get pretty expensive. And part of the reason -- not necessarily just the Q4 bookings, but part of the reason we're addressing that in that segment, Charley, we had -- looking back to '14 -- and folks would have considered that a decent market and a good year for us. We had about $150 million of under-absorption in our business, and a lot of that was in that engineered segment. That's what put us on the path towards what we -- at that time, it was going to be about a 5- or 6-year transformation of that business. Now you never get your under-absorption down to 0, but you certainly can get it to run $50 million to $70 million in your business. So I just want to make that point around that engineered segment, because that's a lot of the reason we're taking those actions is to help it variablize and be much more competitive and not have to deal with under-absorption. It had an overhang coming into this downturn. And so part of that is we need to attack that. Once we attack that, I think you're going to need to see higher levels of project bookings. In Q4, there were a lot of projects that were right there in front of us, and they got pushed. That's not atypical because the customer can wait a couple of quarters and see where markets settle out. And it's very, very competitive, and it's to their advantage to wait over a short period of time. So I think what you're going to see is, as we start to address that, we'll deal with the under-absorption. The aftermarket mix will help. But there's a lot of large, expensive facilities in this division. So it's going to need project work. But we'll offset that by starting to take cost out. That's also some of the facilities we took out last year. So I don't have the exact math because part of it is, how we get at the costs, both in terms of the gross margin line under-absorption, in the fixed cost as well. As we mentioned earlier, we're taking action in some of those areas as well. And then where the aftermarket business comes in."

Well, let me tell you, one of our biggest cash M&A opportunities is this restructuring. It's got a great return. But Charley, no. We've had our line of sight on certain industries, which we find attractive. And the real question is at what time do they make sense? I think what you don't want is for us to decide all of a sudden to go in a left-hand turn direction into some area that's not core to us just because it may be viewed as relatively cheap. So it's fair to say that we're still focused on the areas where we think we make money: the chemical industry, we've talked for years around the opportunity around upstream; additional downstream or service capabilities, we made have a small service acquisition last year. So we're going to stay focused on where we think we make money long term. There's a couple of things we need to think about. One is, we don't want anything to conflict with these restructuring activities because this is a high return on our investment, and we need to execute them very well because our customers are relying on that. The other thing to think about is just -- we need to make sure we're very thoughtful with our cash, both in terms of the restructuring and our shareholders as well. There is always opportunity to use your stock as currency, but we'd have to look at that relative to the asset that we're looking at. So we are -- clearly, opportunities may come in this type of environment, especially for a company's like ours that has a very strong operating platform. But we need to always balance that against other priorities. And what I'll tell you is when we can return $215 million, a lot of it is going to be permanent in our business. With $350 million of spend, that's pretty compelling."

We are seeing slower payments, in particular, Southern Europe, Latin American customers. They're continuing to pay but albeit just slower. Accounts payable is down with inventory up. Majority of those increases in inventory are in working capital. So adding cost, but not necessarily in purchased parts, is more labor and less payables associated with that inventory. Also in terms of accounts payable, negotiating the terms with suppliers, we will pay according to terms. And all through 2015, there's an emphasis directionally paying on time. We have a lot of local suppliers, so paying on time helps the timing and on-time delivery as well as directionally, pricing. We have been focused locally at the sites in terms of improving working capital. As I mentioned on the third quarter earnings release call, we are stepping back and looking at this now, going forward, on a more global perspective and really looking to implement global standardized procedures around billings in cash and collection as well as on order and purchasing. So those are the types of things we're going to look at. Those types of programs take time. I think in addition, with the realignment going on, we will see improvements, ultimately, when we get through this process. It will take a couple of years. But as we consolidate and streamline our sites, we should see improvement in working capital. But in the near term, don't expect any significant swings."

So if you -- and a lot of them were up in the gross margin line. But in general, we are actually pleased that our margins held up relatively well. But what you will see in the gross margin line is the pricing environment. And to the extent we can offset by some of the restructuring activities, because a lot of those sit in the gross margin lines to the extent they impact manufacturing facilities, it's just going to be the timing in terms of when we can execute them. Some of that is outside of our control. What we are seeing from customers, and just remember, we didn't have a really strong pricing environment in '13 and '14. It was okay. Versus the last cycle, we had a tremendous pricing environment in '07 and '08. So but we're certainly seeing it down -- get competitive at that point in time. The other thing that we'll have to deal with, as the top line goes down, is under-absorption and how quickly we can offset that with some of the restructuring as well. But the pricing environment is competitive. We saw this back in 2010 primarily because a lot of the project activity in 2010 was in the Middle East, and that is always competitive in just about any environment. Typically, you have Korean engineering and contracting firms there. They tend to be very competitive on price and demand out of their supplies, so we're starting to see a very competitive environment. The real question, Joe, is how long this is going to last. Because the late-cycle part of our business, which is the projects, which as we've talked about, has been well less than 20% of our business, it tends to -- the opportunities tend to move out quick and move back slowly."

I mean, when you -- $125 million for $125 million is pretty much a 1 for 1 payback or a 1-year payback. You don't typically see that in Europe. It costs more. But the fact is those savings are permanent. And also, what you saw was a lot of the initial part was what I'd call volume-related headcount reduction as opposed to permanent closures of facilities. But when you close a facility anywhere, but particularly in any OECD part of the world and particularly in Europe, it costs more than the savings. But the savings are permanent. I think the important thing to think about when you take a step back is, if you look at our business, a lot of our heritage capacity, going back 10 years, was in very expensive parts of the world, and we're changing that. And so what that'll mean is even some of our OECD facilities are going to be -- have higher load levels and higher engineered equipment in them, and we're going to take more advantage of some of our low-cost manufacturing around the world. So that's why we're trying to emphasize, this is permanent. This is the kind of thing that would have address of that $150 million of under-absorption back in 2014. And not only that, would've significant improved margins once executed. So as you think about us moving through the cycle and where margins have been, this is something that will, all other things being equal, relative to last. And we think that things are going to -- some things are going to change. But the fact is, if we had this type of manufacturing profile 4 or 5 years ago, our margins would have been a lot higher."

Well, technology to the products, some monitoring capabilities, boots on the ground, but also technology systems to track our installed base. Going back to your earlier question, the distribution channels, those are out and present there. We're not just taking full advantage of them in our Industrial Product segment. And these are distributors that can carry multiple product lines and are responsive on a 1 or 2 product basis to a customer that needs it fairly quickly. The end-user strategies are really designed around where there's substantial installed base. If you look at some of the refineries around the world, there's hundreds of pumps that are out there. And all over the world, if you look at our heritage brands going back many years, there are literally some pumps that were installed in the '70s that we're still supplying parts to in remote parts of the world. So it's really around getting our hands around that, inventorying it, making sure we're calling on the customers. So one of the things that we've done this year, and you alluded to it a little bit, is really increased our focus on our sales organization and how we get out to customers on an account basis and get more share of their wallet. Well, part of it is knowing what customer to call on and what product they have in their facilities. So we'll be the first to tell you, we can do a better job on that. And that is one of our key strategic end-user initiatives this year. So if you think about how we've rolled it out over the last couple of years, we've increased our QRC network, and we'll continue to do that. We've worked with systems and some end-user strategies to help them develop and understand how they can bring more efficiency out of an existing facility. Because even right now, they're looking for higher yields out of their processing facilities. The other element now is making sure that we have the right people calling on the right customers, not just out of a QRC, but our salespeople. And that's a separate and distinct strategy from using the distribution channel. The distribution channel has been very powerful for our valve business. We just haven't levered it on the IPD side. But your point is fair. A lot of this is OE that goes through distribution as opposed to service and repair work. But a distributor, they want to get, certainly, margin as well. But what we found, and you've seen in our valve segment, is we can still get good margin on product that goes through distribution. Because keep in mind, what the customer is looking is they're looking for that product there very, very quickly. These aren't multimillion dollar pieces of equipment. These can be in hundreds or even in the low thousands. So time is of the essence."

We saw that last year, some projects that we thought really were going to go forward, that got canceled. It was by a multinational, that was very focused on short-term capital. But where we see projects drop off are the ones that are in the ideation phase, that are going on the drawing board. And as people look for visibility around the underlying value of the resource, they may put them off at that point in time.

So some of these are very, very highly engineered pieces of equipment, and we don't necessarily see a lot of competition from Chinese suppliers. These are high-end control valves, actuation, highly engineered pieces of equipment. But here's the important thing: The way we do this is with the permission of our customer. So part of what we've been working on over the last couple of years through the LPO/SPO strategy is have -- working with our customers to qualify some of the manufacturing in low-cost parts of the word. And don't just mention China, because labor rates have gone up quite a bit there. We're talking about various parts of the world: India, Mexico. But the other thing to remember with our customers is, well, is oftentimes, they want to deal with the OECD facility. So sometimes what we do, when we talk about repurposes, we'll make that facility engineering assembly and test. It'll still be the front end, but a lot of the activity around the value add to the piece of equipment will be done in a lower-cost part of the world. So I'm not suggesting customers on highly engineered pieces of critical equipment are wholesale moving everything to low-cost parts of the world. That may occur over time, and we're prepared to move with them in doing that. But I think the important thing, these aren't commodity ""sold by the pound"" type equipment that typically get fully converted over to a low-cost region of the world. And we don't expect that to occur over the short term. But we expect it to occur faster than when its occurred over the last 10 years, which is why we're taking these actions -- one of the reasons we're taking these actions."

Flowserve's first quarter results were largely as expected and in line with our cautious outlook discussed on last quarter's call. I will cover a few highlights, then Karyn will take you through our financials",1629,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Flowserve's first quarter results were largely as expected and in line with our cautious outlook discussed on last quarter's call. I will cover a few highlights, then Karyn will take you through our financials in detail. 
Let me begin by stating that despite the current challenging macroenvironment, we remain on pace for the year with our adjusted EPS of $0.39, which included the increased seasonality impact that we expected, as well as approximately $0.07 of distinct expenses in the SG&A line. 
Our adjusted operating margin fell to below 10% for the first time in a while and included the 140 basis point impact from the distinct SG&A expenses. This margin performance demonstrates the cost efforts lag in a declining revenue environment and the loss of fixed cost leverage results in increased underabsorption in addition to the normal decrementals. We do, however, expect our margin profile to improve for the full year, particularly in the back half, as a result of the expected increase in volume as implied in our full year revenue guidance, as well as the building cost savings from our realignment and integration efforts. 
In the current market environment, we are focused on controlling what we can. As we previously discussed, we are taking aggressive action through the acceleration of our plant's structural cost initiatives to optimize our global manufacturing presence, as well as adjusting to current levels of customer capital spending. Considering the size of our overall investment in this program, let me review some of our efforts. 
To begin, to simplify the tracking of our realignment programs, we have now combined our $350 million accelerated manufacturing optimization strategy announced last quarter and the nearly complete $50 million SIHI realignment effort into a single initiative. So we will now refer to a $400 million investment expected to generate $230 million in annualized cost reductions once completed at the end of 2017. 
We made solid progress on the realignment initiatives in 2015 and continued this trend in the first quarter. While some disruption and delays are expected in pursuit of a program this size, I am pleased with the focus demonstrated by our employees to minimize customer impact and to deliver on Flowserve's commitments. 
During the first quarter, we achieved approximately $16 million of realignment savings compared to our year ago cost structure and we remain on track for the planned full year 2016 savings of $125 million. Some of the major developments of the program include: to date, we have notified 13 plants of our intent to close, downsize, sell or repurpose those facilities, 9 were notified last year with 2 of the smaller ones completed in 2015 and the other is expected to be completed later this year. 
This year, we have also notified 4 additional plants, including beginning discussions with the appropriate parties on the proposed closure of a French facility and our plan to relocate those capabilities to other Flowserve facilities. The closure of the U.S. plant, whose capabilities will be moved to our Pasadena, Texas location with expanded manufacturing capabilities and synergy benefits. Consolidation of 2 Chinese facilities into 1 to generate cost reductions and to leverage capabilities in our newer Suzhou location. And early in the second quarter, we announced the planned closure of the former SIHI Colombian location, whose capabilities will be moved to other facilities in Latin America. 
As you can hear, since the initiation of our realignment efforts, we've addressed numerous facilities and aggressively focused on aligning SG&A to current market conditions. We also recognized that these decisions affect our people, and therefore, are never easy. So each action we take is thoughtfully and carefully considered. 
Our facilities, however, are not the only area affected, as we also continue to delayer, simplify and upgrade Flowserve's leadership organization, which include some realignment severance expenses. While it takes time to take these costs out largely due to the regions where most of the actions are occurring, we are proceeding with the sense of urgency. 
At the completion of our $400 million program, we ultimately expect a 15% to 20% reduction in our global workforce relative to early 2015 levels. All in, these actions will help Flowserve to become a leaner and more streamlined organization, enabling us to expand our competitive advantages and ensure our ongoing leadership role within our industry.
Turning now to the current market and bookings within our served industries. The recent increases in and stability of crude oil prices is generally a positive development for our markets, but macro uncertainty continues to impact our customer spending patterns, particularly as it relates to decisions concerning and the timing of capital investment. However, we fully expect the longer-term growth patterns in our served industries to continue to rise. 
The world's population, urbanization trends and the resulting demand for energy of all types all demonstrate a solid growth forecast and give us confidence that Flowserve is targeting the right markets. We are increasingly encouraged by the improved aftermarket activity we saw towards the end of the first quarter. And we believe that our core aftermarket activities of parts, services and repairs are stabilizing at these levels. 
As our markets return to their regular maintenance schedules, we expect to benefit. Now looking at our served end markets and bookings trends. While the market challenges of 2015 persist with many of our customers tightly managing their budgets, we were generally pleased with our book to bill of almost 1 and holding backlog at year-end levels. Project bidding activity has picked up as of late in some areas. And after a slow start to the year, March bookings demonstrated improvement. 
We do, however, continue to expect project opportunities to remain limited and competitive. So we will remain disciplined in our pursuit. 
Overall for the quarter, constant currency bookings declined approximately 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower project awards. Sequentially, however, our bookings declined only 4%, which is significantly better than the typical sequential decline we experienced in the first quarter. We are encouraged by essentially flat constant currency aftermarket bookings as compared to both last year's first and fourth quarters, demonstrating the resiliency we expect in our core aftermarket franchise. 
Project awards were down significantly year-over-year and particularly in IPD, but partially offsetting this were some of the benefits we've delivered from our commercial initiatives and activities that we have discussed. 
Our view remains that the maintenance deferral environment we've experienced since early last year provides a building opportunity since much of this work cannot be pushed indefinitely. We also expect that the longer delays in deferrals will result in a greater level of work required when facilities are actually brought down. 
While we did see some of our customers that deferred in 2015 move forward in the first quarter, we continue to expect some 2016 plan takedowns to defer until next year. Large project opportunities remain limited.,, Although we have seen some pockets of improved bidding activity. However, we expect that those progressing will see an extended timeline to final investment decision and the bidding environment will be competitive. 
Looking at specific end markets. We delivered solid growth in power bookings, which were offset by lower oil and gas bookings, and to a lesser extent, chemical declines. Power bookings increased nearly 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by a strong combined cycle of investment in North America and elsewhere in addition to meaningful desalination project wins. This quarter, we benefited from our ability to successfully shift certain products traditionally focused on oil and gas markets towards our power customers. 
In our General Industries segment, constant currency bookings increased 3% on strong pulp and paper activity in FCD, including greenfield projects in emerging regions and capacity modernization of existing facilities. GI also benefited from some progress in IPD's distributor initiatives to utilize this channel to target previously unserved markets. Broadly speaking, we believe destocking has largely occurred and distributors are now maintaining inventory at lower levels. And ultimately, we expect restocking to be a tailwind. 
Oil and gas markets generally remain under significant pressure. However, pockets of bidding activity continue in the Gulf Coast region, particularly as it relates to LNG export facilities. These LNG projects are at various phases and approval stages with some developers pursuing offtake sales agreements before moving forward. 
Refining maintenance spend appears to have stabilized, and we expect some improvement in the second half of 2016. Middle East activity has slowed in the last few quarters, following its relative outperformance in 2015, particularly in the first half of last year. Chemical markets continue to be impacted by project delays on new ethane crackers, even as the they are supported by low-cost feedstock in North America and the Middle East. 
And the downstream derivative facilities are also being slowed. Similar to our refining customers, maintenance deferrals appear to have stabilized, and we are now beginning to see some benefit from part spend on new facilities brought online in the last several years. 
To wrap up, our outlook for the remainder of this year is one of the expected market stability. Our first quarter results were largely in line with our expectations, and we began to see signs of improvement in certain markets. We expect limited project activity, and for those progressing, increased price competition. 
We are pleased with the early results on some of our growth initiatives and the progress in our industrial activities. This, together with Flowserve's proven track record of navigating challenging conditions and reacting quickly on the cost front, while maintaining financial flexibility and a disciplined focus on investing for the long term profitable growth, gives us confidence in our ability to drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders. 
Let me now turn the call over to Karyn."

As we've highlighted, first quarter results kept us on pace with our full year expectations outlined in February. We discussed at a time that our 2016 first quarter would be challenged beyond our normal seasonality due to industry headwinds",1019,"Thanks, Mark. As we've highlighted, first quarter results kept us on pace with our full year expectations outlined in February. We discussed at a time that our 2016 first quarter would be challenged beyond our normal seasonality due to industry headwinds experienced in the 2015 the fourth quarter, which continued into the first months of the quarter. 
First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.39 was driven by a solid level of shipments and continued operational performance. Our adjusted results included approximately $0.07 of distinct SG&A expenses primarily related to accelerated noncash SG&A accruals of the quarter from modifications to new long-term incentive plan grants. 
We also saw negative currency translation of approximately $0.03. Following our announced definition, adjusted EPS excluded $0.07 of realignment expense, $0.02 of negative below-the-line currency effects and $0.01 of SIHI purchase price accounting and integration charges. Adjusted SG&A expenses appear elevated during the 
first quarter, but we do not believe this represents a trend. 
First, we are including the $13.1 million of distinct SG&A expenses primarily related to the noncash accruals I mentioned, which will not reoccur in the remaining quarters of this year. We also had some nonrelevant severance in the quarter as we look to upgrade certain wells. There's also timing related impact associated with our cost reduction efforts, where we've identified comp savings but they haven't been fully realize in the quarter. As Mark discussed, many of our actions are in high-cost regions and will take longer to achieve. So as the year progresses, we expect our adjusted SG&A expenses to be below the 24% we saw in the first quarter. 
Turning to margins. First quarter adjusted gross margins were 33.3%, which excluded realignment charges of $7.2 million. Gross margins were negatively impacted by lower volumes, increased underabsorption and a beginning backlog that reflected the pricing environment of work in 2015. 
Adjusted operating margin of 9.4% excludes $13.5 million of realignment and $1.3 million of SIHI purchase price accounting and integration charges. If we further excluded this think corporate expenses, adjusted operating margin would improve to 10.8%. 
Our IPD segment was particularly affected this quarter. A sales decline of nearly 12% with many of its facilities and high cost regions increase our underabsorption. We are attacking this headwind, however, through our realignment initiatives. We also saw about $4 million of noncomparable cost this quarter. 
Finally, while we continue to be pleased with SIHI's revenue and gross margin profile, incorporating its business performance into IPD was dilutive to the segment's operating margins this quarter, as reducing SIHI's SG&A has been pursued methodically and will be more back half weighted. 
Our first quarter tax rate of approximately 31.6% was slightly above our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. On a constant currency basis, our bookings in the first quarter declined 7.8% year-over-year and 4.3% sequentially. Constant currency original equipment bookings declined 14.6%, as customers continue to delay and defer capital projects. And as previously mentioned, aftermarket bookings were essentially flat. 
Regionally, we saw good constant currency growth of 11.5% in Asia Pacific and a modest 1.4% increase in the still struggling Latin American region. Middle East and Africa experienced the largest drop, both in terms of dollars and percentage. While North America and Europe were down single-digit percentages. 
First quarter sales of $947 million were down 6.6% or 2.1%, excluding negative currency effects, primarily on strong EPD OE shipments. Constant currency aftermarket sales were flat. By geography, we saw significant sales improvement of nearly 35% in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting solid bookings there in 2015. North America and Europe both declined single-digit percentages, while Latin America and Asia Pacific sales declined above 10% on an FX neutral basis. 
We've discussed some highlights of our realignment actions and noted the combination of our manufacturing optimization program with the SIHI realignment efforts to simplify reporting. To be clear, the overall size of our program has not changed versus last quarter. To cover some numbers. Since initiation of our realignment efforts in early 2015, we have expensed approximately $130 million, including the 2016 first quarter charge of $13.5 million. For full year 2016, we expect total charges of approximately $160 million with the chief savings of approximately $125 million, including approximately $60 million achieved in the first quarter. 
In total, we expect our $400 million investment to drive total savings of $195 million in 2017 before achieving full annualized program savings of $230 million in 2018. Turning to cash flow. 
First quarter operating cash flow improved $85 million as compared to a year ago. Free cash flow increased roughly $150 million or over $1 per share for the benefiting from $64 million of reduced CapEx. Our realignment program used approximately $24 million of our cash during the first quarter, and we also returned $23.4 million to shareholders through dividends. Turning to our 2016 outlook and EPS guidance. 
We are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.40 to $2.75 a share following the first quarter in line performance. Our 2016 adjusted EPS target range expects total revenues to decline 7% to 14%, including a 2% currency headwind or roughly $0.10 of above the line impact. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the $63 million to $66 million range and a tax rate of 30% to 31%. 
We also Wilson expect the second half rating of our earnings to be more pronounced in 2016. As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of SIHI and excludes realignment expenses, SIHI purchase price again and integration costs, below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other discrete items. 
We also expect that 2016 capital expenditures will decline compared to the elevated 2015 level when we increase manufacturing capacity in Asia Pacific and purchased a license, enabling increased aftermarket opportunities. We expect cash expenditures associated with our realignment program of approximately $150 million during the year. We also plan to continue can shipping to our pension plans to cover service costs even as the U.S. plan is largely fully funded. 
With that review, let me turn the call back to Jay."

So you typically see a trend up in March as particularly in some of the emerging parts of the world that get their budgets approved and everything. But for us, we saw a kind of not back to what I'd say normal levels, but certainly some improvement particularly on the aftermarket today and I've seen it continue into April as well. So I would say, it was stabilization reflecting kind of the current market environment. What we saw towards the end of the year last year and really in the first 6 weeks of this year was something more akin to what you saw in 2009 in parts. And there was not a lot of visibility. So process operations have to continue to run. And as long as things are flowing through, and they have to do that, but there are still time where people kind of stop and wait and see. And we saw that in '09, and we saw it really the last month of the end of last year and the fist 6 to 8 weeks of this year as well. So we're keeping an eye on it. As I made my comments, you've seen oil certainly stabilize. Remember, at the beginning of the year, they were concerned about oversupply, lack of storage and demand disruption in China. So some of those things have the set only abated. You see the price kind of stabilize. It'll still move around. But as of this staircase, than people can kind of get back to life, so to speak."

And we talked about that a little bit. But some of that coming back online. And then executing on our aftermarket strategies, keeping in mind that over the last 7 to 8 years, the growth that we've seen has not been -- it's been market-driven to a certain extent, but more so around our strategies. When you look at the run-rate business, I think there's a couple of things to that. Executing our industrial strategies, we did see some good improvement and some traction in Q1 versus where we were last year. So executing our distribution, focusing on our channels market, our e-commerce to drive growth in that business. Also, some brownfield activity. If you look at it, maybe some destocking has, for the most part, occurred. May be there stock levels that come in at a little more activity around brownfield, both direct and through our distribution channel. And I think the last piece, Mike, that what we need to keep an eye on is a larger project activity. While typically, the lowest margin business, the something that can move your top line of the most. What we've seen is projects -- there are some projects that are still out there, some that we have an opportunity to bid on in Q1. We just didn't like the terms and conditions. But they are out there. It's really keeping an eye on what goes on the drawing board in terms of next year, maybe come to bid, that's where we're still trying to get some visibility. And I wouldn't have expected that to snap back after will you went through in the last 6 months. But that's what we need to keep an eye on is, are they going to put some of these projects on the drawing board and start to work them up?"

In the general industry, there's certainly been some self help around our focus on our distribution channel. That typically is reported in our General Industry segment. Also, as you saw a couple of years ago, there was investment in the agricultural industry. Pulp and paper is kind of having its moment right now. So these things do tend to cycle through and come around. In general, what you'll see the GI is going to track the distribution channel.

We expect that ratio to kind of range between 50% to 60% as you go through it cost of sales and 40% to 50% into SG&A. So as we indicated in our comments previously if such the expenses about $130 million. So that remaining $270 million, about 55% to 60% and for the reminder of 2016 and the rest will be in 2017. So it can continue to expect that split between cost of sales and SG&A. So year-to-date savings in '16, about $60 million. And we expect that savings to increase over 2016. So definitely weighted heavy in the back half of the year. And then the run rate savings expected to be around $230 million by the end of 2017 or early 2018.

On the projects side, as I mentioned earlier, there is some activity, these things have been on the drawing board for a while. We expect them to be very competitive. We'll need to be selective because we definitely can compete. We want to position ourselves to, but we need to be disciplined. I do want to express just my concern is with oil and gas the way it's been, we just haven't seen things going on the drawing board that we want to see. They can come back online. But that area, we're still definitely cautious about. From a pricing standpoint on the projects, we expect that to be competitive. Look, we've taken that approach for the last 9 months to 1 year plus as we saw this market. This is why we're taking the aggressive action in our cost. A big part of our cost reductions are in our custom engineered business, which addresses these projects. We want to participate in these projects. That's what creates installed base. That's what gets you in front of your customers. But we know that we need to really drive cost out of our business so we can remain competitive, not only in this environment, but we can drive good profitability as pricing improves in the projects. So it's -- that's kind of our outlook. Generally, as you've seen with the integrated, they're all focused -- they continue to be focused on the dividend. They've gotten a little more, I think, tailwind to them. But they're focused on prices. Well, so are we. Keep in mind, these projects are competitive. But if you look across the rest of our business, we're turning our supply base as well. So we're passing through a lot of that on the smaller business down to our supply base."

What you have in the IPD segment this quarter is a good portion of those discrete expenses were in that segment. And also, you have the SG&A burden from SIHI, which will drive those cost out in the back half of the year. So it's not really reflective. Also, if you look year-over-year, the revenue decline, we need to get those SG&A cost out. Part of those were in high cost. So there's a lot of things working. The revenue decline, the impact of the discrete SG&A items in the Q1, and as Karyn talked about, those don't occur in the other quarters; and also, the impact of SIHI. All of those things, in a sense, impacted margins during the quarter. But if you look underneath in the business, the gross margins held in there fairly well. The underlying SIHI business was strong. We were able to offset some of the significant oil and gas project declines. So that's really representative of how that business looks. We expect it to improve."

But the degree of the bookings declined even there would suggest that, really, the next couple of quarters, we could see a pretty significant reversion in sales there.

But it's just start generally with the way to think about it. First, you look at the volumes. The volumes in '15 in terms of project activity were lower than in '14. The pricing environment in '15 was more competitive than it was in '14. Not to the extent of what we saw in 2008 and 2009 because the pricing didn't get near those levels. So those things flowed through the -- started flowing through the P&L last year and are reflected in our compares. So you'll have absorption, which you address with some of your restructuring activities and also, the pricing environment, which you also addressed with your restructuring activities. But that's working its way through. So the marginal impact or the incremental impact starts to abate because you don't have as much project activities sitting in backlog. As we look forward in terms of the profile there, we do need to get at the absorption issue. So the cost savings will focus on addressing the pricing environment and also, the volume environment that we're in, and we're designing it to be very, very long-term. The other thing then is you start looking at mix. If we start driving growth in the aftermarket business, start getting traction in the run-rate business, then that considerably support margins. Those are the levers and those are really the dynamics we're at our margin profile. But we've seen quite a bit of our project activity certainly from '14 go through the P&L. And we're seeing '15 now go through the P&L. There wasn't a lot of project activity at the end of last year, by the way."

But this is really designed to position the company long-term in the industry. Things we've been really had on the drawing board now for 2.5 years, we just accelerated it."

Flowserve's first quarter results were largely as expected and in line with our cautious outlook discussed on last quarter's call.

Flowserve's first quarter results were largely as expected and in line with our cautious outlook discussed on last quarter's call. I will cover a few highlights, then Karyn will take you through our financials in detail. 
Let me begin by stating that despite the current challenging macro environment, we remain on pace for the year with our adjusted EPS of $0.39, which included the increased seasonality impact that we expected, as well as approximately $0.07 of distinct expenses in the SG&A line. 
Our adjusted operating margin fell to below 10% for the first time in a while and included the 140 basis point impact from the distinct SG&A expenses. This margin performance demonstrates that cost efforts lag in a declining revenue environment, and the loss of fixed cost leverage results in increased underabsorption in addition to the normal decrementals. 
We do, however, expect our margin profile to improve for the full year, particularly in the back half, as a result of the expected increase in volume as implied in our full year revenue guidance as well as the building cost savings from our realignment and integration efforts. 
In the current market environment, we are focused on controlling what we can. As we previously discussed, we are taking aggressive action through the acceleration of our planned structural cost initiatives to optimize our global manufacturing presence, as well as adjusting to current levels of customer capital spending. 
Considering the size of our overall investment in this program, let me review some of our efforts. To begin, to simplify the tracking of our realignment programs, we have now combined our $350 million accelerated manufacturing optimization strategy announced last quarter and the nearly complete $50 million SIHI realignment effort into a single initiative. So we will now refer to a $400 million investment expected to generate $230 million in annualized cost reductions once completed at the end of 2017. 
We made solid progress on our realignment initiatives in 2015 and continued this trend in the first quarter. While some disruption and delays are expected in pursuit of a program this size, I am pleased with the focus demonstrated by our employees to minimize customer impact and to deliver on Flowserve's commitments. 
During the first quarter, we achieved approximately $16 million of realignment savings compared to our year ago cost structure, and we remain on track for the planned full year 2016 savings of $125 million. Some of the major developments of the program include: to date, we have notified 13 plants of our intent to close, downsize, sell or repurpose those facilities. Nine were notified last year, with 2 of the smaller ones completed in 2015, and the others expected to be completed later this year. This year, we have also notified 4 additional plants, including beginning discussions with the appropriate parties on the proposed closure of a French facility and our plan to relocate those capabilities to other Flowserve facilities. The closure of a U.S. plant, whose capabilities will be moved to our Pasadena, Texas location with expanded manufacturing capabilities and synergy benefits. Consolidation of 2 Chinese facilities into 1 to generate cost reductions and to leverage capabilities in our newer Suzhou location. And early in the second quarter, we announced the planned closure of the former SIHI Colombian location, whose capabilities will be moved to other facilities in Latin America. 
As you can hear, since the initiation of our realignment efforts, we have addressed numerous facilities and aggressively focused on aligning SG&A to current market conditions. We also recognize that these decisions affect our people and therefore are never easy. So each action we take is thoughtfully and carefully considered. 
Our facilities, however, are not the only area affected as we also continue to delayer, simplify and upgrade Flowserve's leadership organization, which include some non-realignment severance expenses. While it takes time to take these costs out largely due to the regions where most of the actions are occurring, we are proceeding with a sense of urgency. 
At the completion of our $400 million program, we ultimately expect a 15% to 20% reduction in our global workforce relative to early 2015 levels. All in, these actions will help Flowserve to become a leaner and more streamlined organization, enabling us to expand our competitive advantages and ensure our ongoing leadership role within our industry.
Turning now to the current market and bookings within our served industries. The recent increases in and stability of crude oil prices is generally a positive development for our markets, but macro uncertainty continues to impact our customer spending patterns particularly as it relates to decisions concerning and the timing of capital investment. However, we fully expect the longer-term growth patterns in our served industries to continue to rise. 
The world's population, urbanization trends and the resulting demand for energy of all types all demonstrate a solid growth forecast and give us confidence that Flowserve is targeting the right markets. We are increasingly encouraged by the improved aftermarket activity we saw towards the end of the first quarter, and we believe that our core aftermarket activities of parts, services and repairs are stabilizing at these levels. As our markets return to their regular maintenance schedules, we expect to benefit. 
Now looking at our served end markets and bookings trends. While the market challenges of 2015 persist, with many of our customers tightly managing their budgets, we were generally pleased with our book to bill of almost 1 and holding backlog at year-end levels. Project bidding activity has picked up as of late in some areas, and after a slow start to the year, March bookings demonstrated improvement. We do, however, continue to expect project opportunities to remain limited and competitive. So we will remain disciplined in our pursuit. 
Overall for the quarter, constant-currency bookings declined approximately 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower project awards. Sequentially, however, our bookings declined only 4%, which is significantly better than the typical sequential decline we experienced in the first quarter. We are encouraged by essentially flat constant-currency aftermarket bookings as compared to both last year's first and fourth quarters, demonstrating the resiliency we expect in our core aftermarket franchise. 
Project awards were down significantly year-over-year and particularly in IPD, but partially offsetting this were some of the benefits we've delivered from our commercial initiatives and activities that we have discussed. 
Our view remains that the maintenance deferral environment we've experienced since early last year provides a building opportunity since much of this work cannot be pushed indefinitely. We also expect that the longer delays and deferrals will result in a greater level of work required when facilities are actually brought down. 
While we did see some of our customers that deferred in 2015 move forward in the first quarter, we continue to expect some 2016 planned takedowns to defer until next year. Large project opportunities remain limited although we have seen some pockets of improved bidding activity. However, we expect that those progressing will see an extended time line to final investment decision and the bidding environment will be competitive. 
Looking at specific end markets. We delivered solid growth in power bookings, which were offset by lower oil and gas bookings and, to a lesser extent, chemical declines. Power bookings increased nearly 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong combined-cycle investment in North America and elsewhere in addition to meaningful desalination project wins. This quarter, we benefited from our ability to successfully shift certain products traditionally focused on oil and gas markets towards our power customers. 
In our general industries segment, constant-currency bookings increased 3% on strong pulp and paper activity in FCD, including greenfield projects in emerging regions and capacity modernization of existing facilities. GI also benefited from some progress in IPD's distributor initiatives to utilize this channel to target previously unserved markets. Broadly speaking, we believe destocking has largely occurred and distributors are now maintaining inventory at lower levels. And ultimately, we expect restocking to be a tailwind. 
Oil and gas markets generally remain under significant pressure. However, pockets of bidding activity continue in the Gulf Coast region particularly as it relates to LNG export facilities. These LNG projects are at various phases and approval stages, with some developers pursuing offtake sales agreements before moving forward. 
Refining maintenance spend appears to have stabilized, and we expect some improvement in the second half of 2016. Middle East activity has slowed in the last few quarters, following its relative outperformance in 2015, particularly in the first half of last year. Chemical markets continue to be impacted by project delays on new ethane crackers even as they are supported by low-cost feedstock in North America and the Middle East. And the downstream derivative facilities are also being slowed. 
Similar to our refining customers, maintenance deferrals appear to have stabilized, and we are now beginning to see some benefit from part spend on new facilities brought online in the last several years. 
To wrap up, our outlook for the remainder of this year is one of expected market stability. Our first quarter results were largely in line with our expectations, and we began to see signs of improvement in certain markets. We expect limited project activity and, for those progressing, increased price competition. 
We are pleased with the early results on some of our growth initiatives and the progress in our industrial activities. This, together with Flowserve's proven track record of navigating challenging conditions and reacting quickly on the cost front while maintaining financial flexibility and a disciplined focus on investing for the long-term profitable growth, gives us confidence in our ability to drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders. 
Let me now turn the call over to Karyn."
267555,331451133,967816,"Flowserve Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Flowserve Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mark. As we've highlighted, first quarter results kept us on pace with our full year expectations outlined in February. We discussed at the time that our 2016 first quarter would be challenged beyond our normal seasonality due to industry headwind",1005,"Thanks, Mark. As we've highlighted, first quarter results kept us on pace with our full year expectations outlined in February. We discussed at the time that our 2016 first quarter would be challenged beyond our normal seasonality due to industry headwinds experienced in the 2015 fourth quarter, which continued into the first months of the quarter. 
First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.39 was driven by a solid level of shipments and continued operational performance. Our adjusted results included approximately $0.07 of distinct SG&A expenses primarily related to accelerated noncash SG&A accruals in the quarter from modifications to new long-term incentive plan grants. We also saw negative currency translation of approximately $0.03. 
Following our announced definition, adjusted EPS excluded $0.07 of realignment expense, $0.02 of negative below-the-line currency effects and $0.01 of SIHI purchase price accounting and integration charges. Adjusted SG&A expenses appear elevated during the first quarter, but we do not believe this represents the trend. 
First, we are including the $13.1 million of distinct SG&A expenses primarily related to the noncash accruals I mentioned, which will not reoccur in the remaining quarters this year. We also had some non-realignment severance in the quarter as we look to upgrade certain roles. There is also a timing-related impact associated with our cost reduction efforts where we've identified company savings, but they haven't been fully realized in the quarter. As Mark discussed, many of our actions are in high-cost regions and will take longer to achieve. So as the year progresses, we expect our adjusted SG&A percentage to be below the 24% we saw in the first quarter. 
Turning to margins. First quarter adjusted gross margins were 33.3%, which excluded realignment charges of $7.2 million. Gross margins were negatively impacted by lower volumes, increased underabsorption and a beginning backlog that reflected the pricing environment of work booked in 2015. 
Adjusted operating margin of 9.4% excludes $13.5 million of realignment and $1.3 million of SIHI purchase price accounting and integration charges. If we further excluded the distinct corporate expenses, adjusted operating margin would improve to 10.8%. 
Our IPD segment was particularly affected this quarter as sales decline of nearly 12%, with many of its facilities in high-cost regions, increased our underabsorption. We are attacking this headwind, however, through our realignment initiatives. We also saw about $4 million of noncomparable costs this quarter. 
Finally, while we continue to be pleased with SIHI's revenue and gross margin profile, incorporating its business performance into IPD was dilutive to the segment's operating margins this quarter as reducing SIHI's SG&A has been pursued methodically and will be more back half-weighted. 
Our first quarter tax rate of approximately 31.6% was slightly above our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. On a constant currency basis, our bookings in the first quarter declined 7.8% year-over-year and 4.3% sequentially. Constant-currency original equipment bookings declined 14.6% as customers continue to delay and defer capital projects. And as previously mentioned, aftermarket bookings were essentially flat. 
Regionally, we saw good constant-currency growth of 11.5% in Asia Pacific and a modest 1.4% increase in the still struggling Latin American region. Middle East and Africa experienced the largest drop both in terms of dollars and percentage, while North America and Europe were down single-digit percentages. 
First quarter sales of $947 million were down 6.6% or 2.1% excluding negative currency effects, primarily on strong EPD OE shipments. Constant-currency aftermarket sales were flat. 
By geography, we saw significant sales improvement of nearly 35% in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting solid bookings there in 2015. North America and Europe both declined single-digit percentages, while Latin America and Asia Pacific sales declined above 10% on an FX-neutral basis. 
We've discussed some highlights of our realignment actions and noted the combination of our manufacturing optimization program with the SIHI realignment efforts to simplify reporting. To be clear, the overall size of our program has not changed versus last quarter. 
To cover some numbers. Since initiation of our realignment efforts in early 2015, we have expensed approximately $130 million, including the 2016 first quarter charge, $13.5 million. For full year 2016, we expect total charges of approximately $160 million with achieved savings of approximately $125 million, including approximately $16 million achieved in the first quarter. 
In total, we expect our $400 million investment to drive total savings of $195 million in 2017 before achieving full annualized program savings of $230 million in 2018. 
Turning to cash flow. First quarter operating cash flow improved $85 million as compared to a year ago. Free cash flow increased roughly $150 million or over $1 per share, further benefiting from $64 million of reduced CapEx. Our realignment program used approximately $24 million of our cash during the first quarter, and we also returned $23.4 million to shareholders through dividends. 
Turning to our 2016 outlook and EPS guidance. We are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.40 to $2.75 a share following the first quarter's in-line performance. Our 2016 adjusted EPS target range expects total revenues to decline 7% to 14%, including a 2% currency headwind or roughly $0.10 of above-the-line impact. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the $63 million to $66 million range and a tax rate of 30% to 31%. We also expect the second half weighting of our earnings to be more pronounced in 2016. 
As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of SIHI and excludes realignment expenses, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration costs, below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other discrete items. 
We also expect that 2016 capital expenditures will decline compared to the elevated 2015 level when we increase manufacturing capacity in Asia Pacific and purchased a license enabling increased aftermarket opportunities. We expect cash expenditures associated with our realignment program of approximately $150 million during the year. We also plan to continue contributing to our pension plans to cover service costs even as the U.S. plan is largely fully funded. 
With that review, let me turn the call back to Jay."

Mike, what -- if you remember, mid-February, look what happened in the markets and in the price of oil. There was just a complete lack of visibility the first part of the year. So you typically see a trend up in March as particularly in some of the emerging parts of the world that get their budgets approved and everything. But for us, we saw a kind of -- not back to what I'd say normal levels but certainly some improvement particularly on the aftermarket side and have seen it continue into April as well. So I would say it was stabilization reflecting kind of the current market environment. What we saw towards the end of the year last year and really in the first 6 weeks of this year was something more akin to what you saw in 2009 in parts, and there was not a lot of visibility. So it -- process operations have to continue to run. And as long as things are flowing through them, they have to do that, but there are still times where people kind of stop and wait and see. And we saw that in '09, and we saw it really the last month of the end of last year and the first 6 to 8 weeks of this year as well. So we're keeping an eye on it. As I made my comments, you've seen oil certainly stabilize. Remember, at the beginning of the year, they were concerned about oversupply, lack of storage and demand disruption in China. So some of those things have certainly abated. You see the price kind of stabilize. It'll still move around. But as this occurs, then people can kind of get back to life, so to speak."

And we talked about that a little bit, but some of that coming back online and then executing on our aftermarket strategies, keeping in mind that over the last 7 to 8 years, the growth that we've seen has not been -- it's been market-driven to a certain extent, but more so around our strategies. When you look at the run rate business, I think there's a couple of things to that. Executing our industrial strategies, we did see some good improvement and some traction in Q1 versus where we were last year. So executing our distribution, focusing on our channels to market, our e-commerce to drive growth in that business. Also, some brownfield activity. If you look at it, maybe some destocking has, for the most part, occurred. Maybe there's some stock levels that come in and a little more activity around brownfield, both direct and through our distribution channel. And I think the last piece, Mike, that what we need to keep an eye on is the larger project activity. While typically the lowest-margin business, that's something that can move your top line the most. What we have seen is projects -- there are some projects that are still out there, some that we had an opportunity to bid on in Q1. We just didn't like the terms and conditions. But they are out there. It's really keeping an eye on what goes on the drawing board. And in terms of next year, they maybe come to bid. That's where we're still trying to get some visibility. And I wouldn't have expected that to snap back after what we went through in the last 6 months, but that's what we need to keep an eye on is, are they going to put some of these projects on the drawing board and start to work them up?"

In the general industry, there's certainly been some self-help around our focus on our distribution channel. That typically is reported in our general industry segment. Also, as you saw a couple of years ago, there was investment in the agricultural industry. Pulp and paper is kind of having its moment right now. So these things do tend to cycle through and come around.

Let me give you a little more granularity around how this will flow through. So $400 million cost, approximately 80% of that relates to closures or capacity reductions, and that will represent about half of those run rate savings, and then the headcount reductions, which really are less than 1 year-type paybacks. That's about 20% of that overall cost and about half of those savings. So Q1, just to roll through here, Q1, $13 million. 50% of that cost of sales, 50% of that SG&A. We'd expect that ratio to kind of range between 50% to 60%, as you go through it, into cost of sales and 40% to 50% into SG&A. So as we indicated in our comments previously, inception to date, expenses about $130 million. So of that remaining $270 million, about 55% to 60%, and -- for the reminder of 2016, and the rest will be in 2017. So you can continue to expect that split between cost of sales and SG&A. So year-to-date savings in '16, about $16 million, and we expect that savings to increase over 2016, so definitely weighted heavy in the back half of the year. And the run rate savings expected to be around $230 million by the end of 2017 or early 2018, and expect savings of a little bit more than half that amount in 2016, $130 million, and that's all growing to about 85% to 90% in 2017."

I think, Nathan, when we were together, we talked about that a little bit. But I do want to make it clear, on the projects side, as I mentioned earlier, there is some activity -- these things have been on the drawing board for a while. We expect them to be very competitive. We'll need to be selective because we definitely can compete. We want to position ourselves to, but we need to be disciplined. I do want to express just my concern is with oil and gas, the way it's been, we just haven't seen things going on the drawing board that we want to see. They can come back online. But that area, we're still definitely cautious about. From a pricing standpoint on the projects, we expect that to be competitive. Look, we've taken that approach for the last 9 months to a year plus as we saw this market. This is why we're taking the aggressive action in our costs. A big part of our cost reductions are in our custom engineered business, which addresses these projects. We want to participate in these projects. That's what creates installed base. That's what gets you in front of your customers. But we know that we need to really drive cost out of our business so we can remain competitive not only in this environment, but we can drive good profitability as pricing improves in the projects. So it's -- that's kind of our outlook. Generally, as you've seen with the integrated, they're all focused -- they continue to be focused on the dividend. They've gotten a little more, I think, tailwind to them. But they're focused on price as well. So are we. Keep in mind, these projects are competitive.

We saw -- but half of that decline was offset by traction in our industrial initiatives. And also, we've been very pleased with what we've seen from SIHI. The top line has held up well.

Where we found that we've struggled, particularly in our IPD segment going back to 5, 6 years ago, it's when we haven't really taken good care of the customer. So that's really the opportunity that we and our competitors look for, and that's why we're so focused on these initiatives."

I wanted to ask you a question about some of the dynamics of the bookings. In both flow control and particularly in EPD, there were some pretty rough-and-tumble organic bookings numbers in the last 4 quarters and if -- maybe we start with EPD. Despite that, we've had organic sales growth in each of the last 2 quarters and not organic sales growth in the last 2 quarters in flow control, obviously down. But the degree of the bookings decline even there would suggest that really, the next couple of quarters, we could see a pretty significant reversion in sales there. Is that the right way to look at it there? I mean, because it would seem that the booking -- that the shipments are going to have to catch up to the weak bookings at some point in both businesses."

First, you look at the volumes. The volumes in '15 in terms of project activity were lower than in '14. The pricing environment in '15 was more competitive than it was in '14. Not to the extent of what we saw in 2008 and 2009 because the pricing didn't get near those levels. So those things flowed through the -- started flowing through the P&L and -- last year and are reflective in our compares. So you'll have absorption, which you address with some of your restructuring activities and also the pricing environment, which you also address with your restructuring activities. But that's working its way through. So the marginal impact or the incremental impact starts to abate because you don't have as much project activity sitting in backlog. As we look forward in terms of the profile there, we do need to get at the absorption issue. So the cost savings will focus on addressing the pricing environment and also the volume environment that we're in, and we're designing it to be very, very long-term. The other thing then is you start looking at mix. If we start driving growth in the aftermarket business, start getting traction in the run rate business, then that can certainly support margins. Those are the levers, and those are really the dynamics around our margin profile. But we've seen quite a bit of our project activity certainly from '14 go through the P&L. And we're seeing '15 now go through the P&L. There wasn't a lot of project activity at the end of last year, by the way."

Flowserve's first quarter results were largely as expected and in line with our cautious outlook discussed on last quarter's call. I will cover a few highlights, then Karyn will take you through our financials in detail. 
Let me begin by stating that despite the current challenging macro environment, we remain on pace for the year with our adjusted EPS of $0.39, which included the increased seasonality impact that we expected, as well as approximately $0.07 of distinct expenses in the SG&A line. 
Our adjusted operating margin fell to below 10% for the first time in a while and included the 140 basis point impact from the distinct SG&A expenses. This margin performance demonstrates that cost efforts lag in a declining revenue environment, and the loss of fixed cost leverage results in increased underabsorption in addition to the normal decrementals. 
We do, however, expect our margin profile to improve for the full year, particularly in the back half, as a result of the expected increase in volume as implied in our full year revenue guidance as well as the building cost savings from our realignment and integration efforts. 
In the current market environment, we are focused on controlling what we can. As we previously discussed, we are taking aggressive action through the acceleration of our planned structural cost initiatives to optimize our global manufacturing presence, as well as adjusting to current levels of customer capital spending. 
Considering the size of our overall investment in this program, let me review some of our efforts. To begin, to simplify the tracking of our realignment programs, we have now combined our $350 million accelerated manufacturing optimization strategy announced last quarter and the nearly complete $50 million SIHI realignment effort into a single initiative. So we will now refer to a $400 million investment expected to generate $230 million in annualized cost reductions once completed at the end of 2017. 
We made solid progress on our realignment initiatives in 2015 and continued this trend in the first quarter. While some disruption and delays are expected in pursuit of a program this size, I am pleased with the focus demonstrated by our employees to minimize customer impact and to deliver on Flowserve's commitments. 
During the first quarter, we achieved approximately $16 million of realignment savings compared to our year ago cost structure, and we remain on track for the planned full year 2016 savings of $125 million. Some of the major developments of the program include: to date, we have notified 13 plants of our intent to close, downsize, sell or repurpose those facilities. Nine were notified last year, with 2 of the smaller ones completed in 2015, and the others expected to be completed later this year. This year, we have also notified 4 additional plants, including beginning discussions with the appropriate parties on the proposed closure of a French facility and our plan to relocate those capabilities to other Flowserve facilities. The closure of a U.S. plant, whose capabilities will be moved to our Pasadena, Texas location with expanded manufacturing capabilities and synergy benefits. Consolidation of 2 Chinese facilities into 1 to generate cost reductions and to leverage capabilities in our newer Suzhou location. And early in the second quarter, we announced the planned closure of the former SIHI Colombian location, whose capabilities will be moved to other facilities in Latin America. 
As you can hear, since the initiation of our realignment efforts, we have addressed numerous facilities and aggressively focused on aligning SG&A to current market conditions. We also recognize that these decisions affect our people and therefore are never easy. So each action we take is thoughtfully and carefully considered. 
Our facilities, however, are not the only area affected as we also continue to delayer, simplify and upgrade Flowserve's leadership organization, which include some non-realignment severance expenses. While it takes time to take these costs out largely due to the regions where most of the actions are occurring, we are proceeding with a sense of urgency. 
At the completion of our $400 million program, we ultimately expect a 15% to 20% reduction in our global workforce relative to early 2015 levels. All in, these actions will help Flowserve to become a leaner and more streamlined organization, enabling us to expand our competitive advantages and ensure our ongoing leadership role within our industry.
Turning now to the current market and bookings within our served industries. The recent increases in and stability of crude oil prices is generally a positive development for our markets, but macro uncertainty continues to impact our customer spending patterns, particularly as it relates to decisions concerning and the timing of capital investments. However, we fully expect the longer-term growth patterns in our served industries to continue to rise. 
The world's population, urbanization trends and the resulting demand for energy of all types all demonstrate a solid growth forecast and give us confidence that Flowserve is targeting the right markets. We are increasingly encouraged by the improved aftermarket activity we saw towards the end of the first quarter, and we believe that our core aftermarket activities of parts, services and repairs are stabilizing at these levels. As our markets return to their regular maintenance schedules, we expect to benefit. 
Now looking at our served end markets and bookings trends. While the market challenges of 2015 persist, with many of our customers tightly managing their budgets, we were generally pleased with our book to bill of almost 1 and holding backlog at year-end levels. Project bidding activity has picked up as of late in some areas, and after a slow start to the year, March bookings demonstrated improvement. We do, however, continue to expect project opportunities to remain limited and competitive. So we will remain disciplined in our pursuit. 
Overall for the quarter, constant-currency bookings declined approximately 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower project awards. Sequentially, however, our bookings declined only 4%, which is significantly better than the typical sequential decline we experienced in the first quarter. We are encouraged by essentially flat constant-currency aftermarket bookings as compared to both last year's first and fourth quarters, demonstrating the resiliency we expect in our core aftermarket franchise. 
Project awards were down significantly year-over-year and particularly in IPD, but partially offsetting this were some of the benefits we've delivered from our commercial initiatives and activities that we have discussed. 
Our view remains that the maintenance deferral environment we've experienced since early last year provides a building opportunity since much of this work cannot be pushed indefinitely. We also expect that the longer delays and deferrals will result in a greater level of work required when facilities are actually brought down. 
While we did see some of our customers that deferred in 2015 move forward in the first quarter, we continue to expect some 2016 planned takedowns to defer until next year. Large project opportunities remain limited although we have seen some pockets of improved bidding activity. However, we expect that those progressing will see an extended time line to final investment decision and the bidding environment will be competitive. 
Looking at specific end markets. We delivered solid growth in power bookings, which were offset by lower oil and gas bookings and, to a lesser extent, chemical declines. Power bookings increased nearly 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong combined-cycle investment in North America and elsewhere, in addition to meaningful desalination project wins. This quarter, we benefited from our ability to successfully shift certain products traditionally focused on oil and gas markets towards our power customers. 
In our general industries segment, constant-currency bookings increased 3% on strong pulp and paper activity in FCD, including greenfield projects in emerging regions and capacity modernization of existing facilities. GI also benefited from some progress in IPD's distributor initiatives to utilize this channel to target previously unserved markets. Broadly speaking, we believe destocking has largely occurred and distributors are now maintaining inventory at lower levels. And ultimately, we expect restocking to be a tailwind. 
Oil and gas markets generally remain under significant pressure. However, pockets of bidding activity continue in the Gulf Coast region particularly as it relates to LNG export facilities. These LNG projects are at various phases and approval stages, with some developers pursuing offtake sales agreements before moving forward. 
Refining maintenance spend appears to have stabilized, and we expect some improvement in the second half of 2016. Middle East activity has slowed in the last few quarters, following its relative outperformance in 2015, particularly in the first half of last year. Chemical markets continue to be impacted by project delays on new ethane crackers even as they are supported by low-cost feedstock in North America and the Middle East. And the downstream derivative facilities are also being slowed. 
Similar to our refining customers, maintenance deferrals appear to have stabilized, and we are now beginning to see some benefit from part spend on new facilities brought online in the last several years. 
To wrap up, our outlook for the remainder of this year is one of expected market stability. Our first quarter results were largely in line with our expectations, and we began to see signs of improvement in certain markets. We expect limited project activity and, for those progressing, increased price competition. 
We are pleased with the early results on some of our growth initiatives and the progress in our industrial activities. This, together with Flowserve's proven track record of navigating challenging conditions and reacting quickly on the cost front while maintaining financial flexibility and a disciplined focus on investing for the long-term profitable growth, gives us confidence in our ability to drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders. 
Let me now turn the call over to Karyn."
267555,331451133,968049,"Flowserve Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Flowserve Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mark. As we've highlighted, first quarter results kept us on pace with our full year expectations outlined in February. We discussed at the time that our 2016 first quarter would be challenged beyond our normal seasonality due to industry headwind",1005,"Thanks, Mark. As we've highlighted, first quarter results kept us on pace with our full year expectations outlined in February. We discussed at the time that our 2016 first quarter would be challenged beyond our normal seasonality due to industry headwinds experienced in the 2015 fourth quarter, which continued into the first months of the quarter. 
First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.39 was driven by a solid level of shipments and continued operational performance. Our adjusted results included approximately $0.07 of distinct SG&A expenses primarily related to accelerated noncash SG&A accruals in the quarter from modifications to new long-term incentive plan grants. We also saw negative currency translation of approximately $0.03. 
Following our announced definition, adjusted EPS excluded $0.07 of realignment expense, $0.02 of negative below-the-line currency effects and $0.01 of SIHI purchase price accounting and integration charges. Adjusted SG&A expenses appear elevated during the first quarter, but we do not believe this represents the trend. 
First, we are including the $13.1 million of distinct SG&A expenses primarily related to the noncash accruals I mentioned, which will not reoccur in the remaining quarters this year. We also had some non-realignment severance in the quarter as we look to upgrade certain roles. There is also a timing-related impact associated with our cost reduction efforts where we've identified company savings, but they haven't been fully realized in the quarter. As Mark discussed, many of our actions are in high-cost regions and will take longer to achieve. So as the year progresses, we expect our adjusted SG&A percentage to be below the 24% we saw in the first quarter. 
Turning to margins. First quarter adjusted gross margins were 33.3%, which excluded realignment charges of $7.2 million. Gross margins were negatively impacted by lower volumes, increased underabsorption and a beginning backlog that reflected the pricing environment of work booked in 2015. 
Adjusted operating margin of 9.4% excludes $13.5 million of realignment and $1.3 million of SIHI purchase price accounting and integration charges. If we further excluded the distinct corporate expenses, adjusted operating margin would improve to 10.8%. 
Our IPD segment was particularly affected this quarter as sales decline of nearly 12%, with many of its facilities in high-cost regions, increased our underabsorption. We are attacking this headwind, however, through our realignment initiatives. We also saw about $4 million of noncomparable costs this quarter. 
Finally, while we continue to be pleased with SIHI's revenue and gross margin profile, incorporating its business performance into IPD was dilutive to the segment's operating margins this quarter as reducing SIHI's SG&A has been pursued methodically and will be more back half-weighted. 
Our first quarter tax rate of approximately 31.6% was slightly above our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. On a constant currency basis, our bookings in the first quarter declined 7.8% year-over-year and 4.3% sequentially. Constant-currency original equipment bookings declined 14.6% as customers continue to delay and defer capital projects. And as previously mentioned, aftermarket bookings were essentially flat. 
Regionally, we saw good constant-currency growth of 11.5% in Asia Pacific and a modest 1.4% increase in the still struggling Latin American region. Middle East and Africa experienced the largest drop both in terms of dollars and percentage, while North America and Europe were down single-digit percentages. 
First quarter sales of $947 million were down 6.6% or 2.1% excluding negative currency effects, primarily on strong EPD OE shipments. Constant-currency aftermarket sales were flat. 
By geography, we saw significant sales improvement of nearly 35% in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting solid bookings there in 2015. North America and Europe both declined single-digit percentages, while Latin America and Asia Pacific sales declined above 10% on an FX-neutral basis. 
We've discussed some highlights of our realignment actions and noted the combination of our manufacturing optimization program with the SIHI realignment efforts to simplify reporting. To be clear, the overall size of our program has not changed versus last quarter. 
To cover some numbers. Since initiation of our realignment efforts in early 2015, we have expensed approximately $130 million, including the 2016 first quarter charge, $13.5 million. For full year 2016, we expect total charges of approximately $160 million with achieved savings of approximately $125 million, including approximately $16 million achieved in the first quarter. 
In total, we expect our $400 million investment to drive total savings of $195 million in 2017 before achieving full annualized program savings of $230 million in 2018. 
Turning to cash flow. First quarter operating cash flow improved $85 million as compared to a year ago. Free cash flow increased roughly $150 million or over $1 per share, further benefiting from $64 million of reduced CapEx. Our realignment program used approximately $24 million of our cash during the first quarter, and we also returned $23.4 million to shareholders through dividends. 
Turning to our 2016 outlook and EPS guidance. We are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.40 to $2.75 a share following the first quarter's in-line performance. Our 2016 adjusted EPS target range expects total revenues to decline 7% to 14%, including a 2% currency headwind or roughly $0.10 of above-the-line impact. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the $63 million to $66 million range and a tax rate of 30% to 31%. We also expect the second half weighting of our earnings to be more pronounced in 2016. 
As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of SIHI and excludes realignment expenses, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration costs, below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other discrete items. 
We also expect that 2016 capital expenditures will decline compared to the elevated 2015 level when we increase manufacturing capacity in Asia Pacific and purchased a license enabling increased aftermarket opportunities. We expect cash expenditures associated with our realignment program of approximately $150 million during the year. We also plan to continue contributing to our pension plans to cover service costs, even as the U.S. plan is largely fully funded. 
With that review, let me turn the call back to Jay."

So you typically see a trend up in March as particularly in some of the emerging parts of the world that get their budgets approved and everything. But for us, we saw a kind of -- not back to what I'd say normal levels but certainly some improvement particularly on the aftermarket side and have seen it continue into April as well. So I would say it was stabilization reflecting kind of the current market environment. What we saw towards the end of the year last year and really in the first 6 weeks of this year was something more akin to what you saw in 2009 in parts, and there was not a lot of visibility. So it -- process operations have to continue to run. And as long as things are flowing through them, they have to do that, but there are still times where people kind of stop and wait and see. And we saw that in '09, and we saw it really the last month of the end of last year and the first 6 to 8 weeks of this year as well. So we're keeping an eye on it. As I made my comments, you've seen oil certainly stabilize. Remember, at the beginning of the year, they were concerned about oversupply, lack of storage and demand disruption in China. So some of those things have certainly abated. You see the price kind of stabilize. It'll still move around. But as this occurs, then people can kind of get back to life, so to speak."

And we talked about that a little bit, but some of that coming back online and then executing on our aftermarket strategies, keeping in mind that over the last 7 to 8 years, the growth that we've seen has not been -- it's been market-driven to a certain extent, but more so around our strategies. When you look at the run rate business, I think there's a couple of things to that. Executing our industrial strategies, we did see some good improvement and some traction in Q1 versus where we were last year. So executing our distribution, focusing on our channels market, our e-commerce to drive growth in that business. Also, some brownfield activity. If you look at it, maybe some destocking has, for the most part, occurred. Maybe there's some stock levels that come in and a little more activity around brownfield, both direct and through our distribution channel. And I think the last piece, Mike, that what we need to keep an eye on is the larger project activity. While typically the lowest-margin business, that's something that can move your top line the most. What we have seen is projects -- there are some projects that are still out there, some that we had an opportunity to bid on in Q1. We just didn't like the terms and conditions. But they are out there. It's really keeping an eye on what goes on the drawing board. And in terms of next year, they maybe come to bid. That's where we're still trying to get some visibility. And I wouldn't have expected that to snap back after what we went through in the last 6 months, but that's what we need to keep an eye on is, are they going to put some of these projects on the drawing board and start to work them up?"

In the general industry, there's certainly been some self-help around our focus on our distribution channel. That typically is reported in our general industry segment. Also, as you saw a couple of years ago, there was investment in the agricultural industry. Pulp and paper is kind of having its moment right now. So these things do tend to cycle through and come around. In general, what you'll see, the GI is going to track the distribution channel and then also certain other markets as well that will tend to see investment from time to time.

Let me give you a little more granularity around how this will flow through.

That's about 20% of that overall cost and about half of those savings. So Q1, just to roll through here, Q1, $13 million. 50% of that cost of sales, 50% of that SG&A. We'd expect that ratio to kind of range between 50% to 60%, as you go forward, into cost of sales and 40% to 50% into SG&A. So as we indicated in our comments previously, inception to date, expenses about $130 million. So of that remaining $270 million, about 55% to 60%, and -- for the reminder of 2016, and the rest will be in 2017. So you can continue to expect that split between cost of sales and SG&A. So year-to-date savings in '16, about $16 million, and we expect that savings to increase over 2016, so definitely weighted heavy in the back half of the year. And the run rate savings expected to be around $230 million by the end of 2017 or early 2018, and expect savings of a little bit more than half that amount in 2016, $130 million, and that's all growing to about 85% to 90% in 2017."

I think, Nathan, when we were together, we talked about that a little bit. But I do want to make it clear, on the projects side, as I mentioned earlier, there is some activity -- these things have been on the drawing board for a while. We expect them to be very competitive. We'll need to be selective because we definitely can compete. We want to position ourselves to, but we need to be disciplined. I do want to express just my concern is with oil and gas, the way it's been, we just haven't seen things going on the drawing board that we want to see. They can come back online. But that area, we're still definitely cautious about. From a pricing standpoint on the projects, we expect that to be competitive. Look, we've taken that approach for the last 9 months to a year plus as we saw this market. This is why we're taking the aggressive action in our costs. A big part of our cost reductions are in our custom engineered business, which addresses these projects. We want to participate in these projects. That's what creates installed base. That's what gets you in front of your customers. But we know that we need to really drive cost out of our business so we can remain competitive not only in this environment, but we can drive good profitability as pricing improves in the projects. So it's -- that's kind of our outlook. Generally, as you've seen with the integrated, they're all focused -- they continue to be focused on the dividend. They've gotten a little more, I think, tailwind to them. But they're focused on price as well. So are we. Keep in mind, these projects are competitive.

We saw -- but half of that decline was offset by traction in our industrial initiatives. And also, we've been very pleased with what we've seen from SIHI. The top line has held up well.

So the underlying aftermarket business year-over-year and sequentially, the sales were relatively stable. But you saw the project activity that we booked in 2014, those compares across it. On the FCD, it tends to be shorter-cycle businesses. And so you feel the impact of the bookings quicker, much more -- I mean, quicker in terms of book to ship.

First, you look at the volumes. The volumes in '15 in terms of project activity were lower than in '14. The pricing environment in '15 was more competitive than it was in '14. Not to the extent of what we saw in 2008 and 2009 because the pricing didn't get near those levels. So those things flowed through the -- started flowing through the P&L and -- last year and are reflective in our compares. So you'll have absorption, which you address with some of your restructuring activities and also the pricing environment, which you also address with your restructuring activities. But that's working its way through. So the marginal impact or the incremental impact starts to abate because you don't have as much project activity sitting in backlog. As we look forward in terms of the profile there, we do need to get at the absorption issue. So the cost savings will focus on addressing the pricing environment and also the volume environment that we're in, and we're designing it to be very, very long-term. The other thing then is you start looking at mix. If we start driving growth in the aftermarket business, start getting traction in the run rate business, then that can certainly support margins. Those are the levers, and those are really the dynamics around our margin profile. But we've seen quite a bit of our project activity certainly from '14 go through the P&L. And we're seeing '15 now go through the P&L. There wasn't a lot of project activity at the end of last year, by the way."

First, Flowserve delivered solid financial and operating results in the second quarter. This performance, including our adjusted EPS of $0.57 per share, was generally in line with our expectations and kept us on pace to deliver within our prior guidance range for the full year, although we did tighten our range this quarter by modestly lowering the upper end.
We continue to make significant progress in our transformational realignment program to optimize our manufacturing platform and reduce our cost structure. Additionally, we are seeing early traction from some of our growth initiatives. I will review a few key highlights and then Karyn will discuss our financial results in greater detail.
From an operational standpoint, our continuing focus remains to improve our on-time delivery, reduce past-due backlog, ensure best-in-class quality, enhance our sales process and project management capabilities, minimize the impact of restructuring on day-to-day activities and further leverage our supplier relationships. 
Our employees have supported these efforts, and I'm generally pleased with the operational execution we've delivered, even while undertaking our realignment efforts and facing a challenging market backdrop. 
During the quarter, we saw less volatility in some commodity prices, most notably, crude oil. While this stability is encouraging, we still expect our customers will remain cautious with our capital and operating budgets in the near term. Considering the multiyear nature of infrastructure original equipment investments, the more important criteria for our customers is stability, and it will likely require several quarters of consistency before investment spending actively resumes. 
Despite the headwinds in many of our sectors and changing end market dynamics, our primary efforts remain on structurally improving our company, controlling our cost and positioning Flowserve for profitable growth and increased shareholder value creation. These efforts include strategically repositioning our capabilities, aggressively aligning our manufacturing presence with our served industries for the long term and responding to current market environment while permanently reducing underabsorption in our system, pursuing our growth initiatives and enhancing our value proposition for our customers.
As noted earlier, we continue to make solid progress on a realignment program, delivering approximately $27 million of savings in the second quarter. To date, we've initiated actions on 2/3 of the facilities we expect to either be closed, repurposed or sold. 
Importantly, we remain on track to meet our goal of reaching approximately $100 million of incremental savings, which is expected in 2016. In terms of specific locations, we have seized manufacturing and completed the product transfer at an IPD facility in the U.K. And in Canada, we closed an EPD facility and also divested a nonstrategic foundry. We also have initiated the process to transfer capabilities from our Dubai operations to another location in the Middle East and are earning completion on closing a Dutch location, where manufacturing has now ceased.
During the third and fourth quarters, we plan to address additional manufacturing sites and continue to expect about $160 million in charges for the year. While we identify most realignment cost incurred for urinalysis, it's important to recognize that our reported and adjusted numbers do include the expected negative impact on revenues and profits that have been delayed during the transition, which should materialize as the receiving sites come up to speed on the new lines. We should also see the benefit of eliminating all the duplicative costs resulting from the transition. With each site undergoing restructuring, we obtained valuable lessons learned and applied them to subsequent locations.
Overall, the pace and progress of our restructuring is on track, and we're confident that this realignment program will position our business for long-term success. Looking further at the market bookings within our served industries, overall, for the quarter, constant currency bookings declined approximately 10% against last year's strongest quarter, as lower OE bookings and project awards more than offset the 2.3% growth in aftermarket bookings. Sequentially, our bookings increased 4%,, reflecting both our resilient aftermarket franchise and normal seasonality.
I spoke about the challenges of the Original Equipment business already, but we're pleased with this quarter's year-over-year increase in constant currency aftermarket bookings, which is the second consecutive quarter of this growth. Our aftermarket franchise largely demonstrated the kind of resiliency we expect even in these tough markets. And while operating budgets have remain constrained, this quarter's level was also supported by increased emergency response, break fix type activity and the return of a few small upgrade projects, which were notably absent during 2015.
Overall, we remain in a period of rolling deferred maintenance, where many of our customers are catching up on the 2015 deferrals, but delaying activity previously scheduled for 2016. This practice will not likely continue indefinitely, and we expect to benefit as operating budgets normalize. 
We've also recently seen more customers inquire about new or extended long-term lifecycle agreements or LCAs. We view this activity as positive. In these agreements, we seek to add considerable value to our customers while driving volume for Flowserve. From a segment perspective, we are particularly pleased with IPD's bookings growth of 3.4% on a constant currency basis. For some time, this business had largely leverage EPD's oil and gas project work. 
Under new leadership, IPD is returning to its industrial roots and demonstrated some early traction in our commercial initiatives for the segment, including increasing our exposure in the profitable chemical sector and other general industries, and better leveraging the distribution channel and growing its run rate in small project activity.
Additionally, IPD has benefited from the ongoing integration of SIHI's products across Flowserve's selling platform, including product pull-through across Flowserve's broad portfolio. In fact, this enabled the former SIHI entity to achieve one of its highest levels of quarterly bookings to date in the second quarter.
Turning now to specific end markets and looking at bookings on a constant currency basis. Oil and gas declined 20% in the quarter, which impacted each of our segments and reflected the broad-based pressure on our oil and gas customer's budgets. Oil and gas is our largest served market, and this industry has been challenge for over 1.5 year now. 
Power bookings decreased approximately 9% driven by declines in the IPD and FCD segments. EPD's bookings were essentially flat, including strong nuclear aftermarket orders in North America and Europe, and our success in shifting certain products traditionally focused on oil and gas markets towards our power customers. Going forward, we continue to expect a combined cycle investment in North America while China continues to invest in nuclear, where we participate in both the Western and Chinese designs.
In our general industries, constant currency bookings decreased approximately 4%. Solid IPD bookings partially offset EPD's 18% decline. As previously mentioned, IPD's distributor initiatives showed progress, and we intend to utilize this channel to target previously unserved markets. 
Flat FCD bookings were supported by solid defense-related orders in Europe and global pulp and paper activity. Broadly speaking, distributors remain challenged. While we believe the stocking's is largely complete in this channel, they are now maintaining inventory at lower levels and often ordering only when they have a customer order in hand. 
Chemical bookings were essentially flat in the second quarter, supported by strong increase in SIHI bookings. We continue to see some delays in the expected ethylene driven derivative plants, as well as the second wave of crackers, but we expect this development to progress in North America and the Middle East supported by low-cost feedstock.
To wrap up, we are confident that we are taking the right actions to position Flowserve for the future and we are encouraged by the progress made this quarter. Although our served markets remain volatile and challenging, our first half results were largely in line with our expectations, and we expect a stronger second half of the year with seasonality, cost takeout and backlog shipments as the key drivers. 
Aftermarket is showing resiliency during this time. And if extended market stability occurs, we do expect growth in the original equipment orders to ultimately follow. Nevertheless, we expect our customers will remain deliberate near term and early projects to be very competitive. In this environment, we will remain disciplined.
I would like to leave you with a final thought. While we are very much internally focused on cost reduction and structurally rightsizing our operations in this environment and making good progress, we are also positioning Flowserve for the eventual improvement in our markets. We continue to invest for long-term profitable growth, including in the distribution channel and other industrial opportunities, as well as new product development and improvements through our disciplined R&D process. 
I am confident in our ability to execute our strategic vision and the extended outlook for our served markets, as well as our capabilities to drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders.
Let me now turn the call over to Karyn."

Turning to our 2016 second quarter financials. Our results were largely in line with our expectations. Bookings were highlighted by growth in our aftermarket business, albeit still at low levels, and we also delivered sequential constant currency aftermarket and OE increases of 5.6% and 2.5%, respectively. Based on our first half 2016 results and our expectations for the year, we have tightened our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance while retaining our full year 2016 revenue outlook.
Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.57 was driven by our continued operational execution and a solid level of shipments even with the challenges that come with executing significant realignment initiatives. Our second quarter adjusted EPS excludes $0.11 of realignment expense and $0.01 associated with SIHI purchase price accounting and integration charges, which were partially offset by a gain of $0.03 from global line currency impacts. 
Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.48, which included an above-the-line negative currency translation headwind of approximately $0.01. Q2 revenues of over $1 billion decreased 11.7% or 9.7% constant currency. Year-to-date, Flowserve's constant currency revenues decreased 6.2% compared to 2015 levels. Adjusted SG&A expenses declined 4.2% in the second quarter, but remained elevated as a percent of sales due primarily to the decline in revenues and the timing impact of expected realignment savings from our ongoing cost reduction efforts in higher cost regions.
Turning to margins. Second quarter adjusted gross margins were 32.7%, down 130 basis points from prior year and excluded realignment charges of $8.9 million and SIHI charges of $2.1 million. Reported gross margins were 31.6%, which were negatively impacted by lower volumes that resulted in increased underabsorption, as well as work that reflected the challenging pricing environment booked over the last 1.5 year.
Similar to the first quarter, IPD continued to be particularly impacted by underabsorption in many of its facilities in high-cost regions due to a nearly 18% revenue decline. We continue to expect margin improvement in the segment through the year from our realignment initiatives and the continued integration of SIHI. Our second quarter tax rate of approximately 29% was slightly below our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. Looking at bookings in greater detail and on a constant currency basis, original equipment bookings declined 19.4% while aftermarket realized a 2.3% increase over the prior year.
From a regional perspective, Europe's bookings increased 9.1% constant currency while North America was down 10.6%, and Latin America and Asia Pacific were down midteens. The Middle East was particularly challenged. Last year, this region continued to invest in the downturn, but in the current environment, we see limited project activity occurring and aftermarket orders being deferred. 
Turning to revenues. We delivered modest constant currency growth in the Middle East, which was realized from the backlog built during last year's positive booking environment. North America, Asia Pacific and Europe saw constant currency sales decline in the 8% to 12% range, while National Oil Company challenges in Latin America drove a constant currency decline of nearly 32% in that region.
Shifting to our realignment program in the approximately $27 million of savings realized in the second quarter. This progress keeps us on track to achieving our goal of incremental savings of approximately $100 million in 2016. We expensed $20 million in the second quarter related to these efforts, bringing in the first half 2016 total expense to approximately $34 million, and we continue to expect an expense of roughly $160 million during 2016 as we continue to execute on a number of planned actions during the second half of the year.
For the total program, we expect our $400 million multiyear investment to drive estimated total savings of $195 million in 2017, which is $70 million incremental to total 2016 program savings of $125 million. In 2018, the full annualized program savings are expected at $230 million. 
Turning to cash flow. Through June 30, 2016, operating cash flow was down about $15 million versus a year ago, as cash outflows related to realignment exceeded our book expenses. However free cash flow improved roughly $62 million compared to the first half of 2015 due to elevated capital expenditures last year related to the purchase of an aftermarket license and carryover investment on our new Chinese valve facility. 
We returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends while our realignment program used approximately $34 million of our cash during the second quarter. As many of you know, typically, the majority of our operating cash flow is realized in the last 2 quarters of the year, and we expect that to be the case again this year like we were more waiting in the fourth quarter.
Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we see continued pricing pressure and caution in our end markets, we remain confident over the longer term that our diversified end markets, comprehensive product portfolio and geographic exposures, coupled with our strategic growth initiatives and transformation realignment plans, position us for the future. However, there are still uncertainly, given ongoing macro and political issues, including the impact of the recent Brexit vote. But we have limited direct exposure to the U.K, the potential broader impact of the event on the U.K, European and global economy is still largely unknown.
Based on performance for the first half of 2016, our backlog and its expected recognition, combined with our expectations at the current market conditions, will largely persists. we've taken our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share. Due to the expected timing and margin of scheduled backlog shipment, as well as our recognition of realignment savings, we expect our performance will be even more heavily weighted on the fourth quarter results compared to prior years. 
On the top line, our 2016 adjusted EPS target range assumes revenues declining 7% to 14% compared to the 2015 level, and this range includes a 2% currency headwind or roughly $0.10 per share of above-the-line impact. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the low- to mid-$60 million range and a tax rate of 30% to 31%. As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of our 2015 SIHI acquisition, an excellent realignment expenses. SIHI price accounting and integration costs, below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impacts of other potential discrete items.
Moving on to cash usage for the year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures in the range of $105 million to $115 million, a significant reduction over elevated 2015 levels. Cash realignment expenditures are expected in the range of approximately $125 million to $150 million for the full year. Scheduled debt payments for the remainder of the year are $30 million. And we also plan to continue contributing to our pension plans to cover service costs even as the U.S. plan remains largely fully funded.
With that review, let me turn the call back to Jeff."

And then, finally, it's transitioned over to more of the industrial -- the commercial approach. It's working through that. And what you see is it's not getting fixed cost leverage because the outflows of the project oil and gas year-over-year. So when we look at that business, we know it's going to be challenged from a margin standpoint during the course of the year, but we expect to get realignment cost and the SIHI cost out towards the back half of the year and then continue to drive and get the fixed cost leverage in the business.

I think from a market driven standpoint, and one thing that I want to make a point, a lot of our aftermarket opportunities are end-user strategies, where we go in and help people in any market improve the efficiency. We didn't see a lot of that last year because the reaction on the OpEx budget was to constrain everything. But if you look at from a market-driven activity, I made the comment earlier we're in a rolling deferral period, where you'll see an uptick there is if there's pressure that comes of the operating budgets. We don't see that over the short term. The market needs some stability. You look in the backdrop of what's occurred is the concern with the majors over having to cut their dividend is certainly abated, but they're still being fairly conservative. So from a market standpoint, I think we'll continue to see the rolling deferral, but the opportunity for us is to continue to execute on our strategies because the nice thing about installed base, it's permanent, it stays and they're always looking for efficiency. And that's what we like relative to even what we saw in '09, that they're not shedding a lot of facilities. They're running them. And the one way you can improve your profitability is to make it more efficient. But I think from a market standpoint, we don't expect the budgets to snap back your short term. But we will continue to drive our end-user strategies. We saw a little bit of benefit of that in the second quarter."

So you'll get the benefit from the market and the execution of the aftermarket strategies. Now there's no escaping the fact that one of the biggest things that move the needles is the projects. And I just want to make a distinction. While it moves the needle on revenue, keep in mind, it doesn't move the needle as much on earnings, especially now as we start to restructure that custom engineered business. Because if revenue goes down and you have a lot of under absorption, it can impact your earnings. But as we start taking these costs out, keep in mind, those projects are very competitive in good markets and bad, but it does kind of move the needle on revenues. So from our standpoint, until we see some project activity, we don't start -- we don't think that, that custom generic business is going to see an uptick trend in its revenue, which is a component of the EPD business from a revenue standpoint. And again, that does move the needle. If you look in the aftermarket, we're encouraged by what we see in stability and sequential and year-over-year increases, that is also our most profitable business and drives a substantial amount of earnings. So think of it 2 ways. 1 in terms of revenues and earnings. Also, think a third component of what we're doing with the cost structure in that project-related revenue."

Think about it, we've got ultimately low-impact, 30% of our sites. You've got sending and receiving sides. You have all type of activity that occur with that. That impacts your business negatively.

So when we look at our margin profile, we see and understand what's going on in IPD. That had an impact in terms of the integration of SIHI and the volume leverage as well. We also recognize in our custom engineered business that volumes have come down, but it takes a while to get those costs out of the business. And then generally, broad based, a lot of our other cost, structural cost, considering where they are, take time to get out. You add onto that the fact that when you make these kind of changes, there are costs in the system that we don't call out necessarily in realignment or in our otherwise results that impact your business negatively.

But however, as you mentioned, that should be potentially to offset with some of the buildup for realignment. So as we're transitioning through realignment, we would potential there to have elevated inventories throughout '16, as well as '17. From a receivable perspective, we have seen some delays, in particular in Latin America with the full disclosure in our Q there regarding particular inventories that we're looking at. And so we'll continue to work through those. Inventory, of course, is going to be reflective, only the realignments, but it's very important as we go through the transition to ensure quality service on-time to our customers during this transition. But there's others -- in terms of executing our strategies, there's others strategic initiatives that could potentially result in carrying additional inventory. But of course, there's also rate will result in higher margins. But we'll continue to work through that. We'll continue to see some delays with customers as they push out taking delivery. So market conditions are also playing there a bit. But as we go through the realignment, the expectation is that, with the reduction in the sites, by definition, we'll have more optimized product management, more optimized supply chain and of course, more optimization in terms of our inventory turns. Once we get through that realignment, we'll then really start to look at it from an enterprise level overall, from our receivables, payables and inventory, from enterprise -- enterprise processes and going through that kind of project to really focus on fine-tuning the markets and the targets there. But key right now is to get to the realignment."

First, Flowserve delivered solid financial and operating results in the second quarter. This performance, including our adjusted EPS of $0.57 per share, was generally in line with our expectations and kept us on pace to deliver within our prior guidance range for the full year, although we did tighten our range this quarter by modestly lowering the upper end.
We continue to make significant progress in our transformational realignment program to optimize our manufacturing platform and reduce our cost structure. Additionally, we are seeing early traction from some of our growth initiatives. I will review a few key highlights and then Karyn will discuss our financial results in greater detail.
From an operational standpoint, our continuing focus remains to improve our on-time delivery, reduce past-due backlog, ensure best-in-class quality, enhance our sales process and project management capabilities, minimize the impact of restructuring on day-to-day activities and further leverage our supplier relationships. 
Our employees have supported these efforts, and I'm generally pleased with the operational execution that we've delivered, even while undertaking our realignment efforts and facing a challenging market backdrop. 
During the quarter, we saw less volatility in some commodity prices, most notably, crude oil. While this stability is encouraging, we still expect our customers will remain cautious with their capital and operating budgets in the near term. Considering the multiyear nature of infrastructure original equipment investments, the more important criteria for our customers is stability, and it will likely require several quarters of consistency before investment spending actively resumes. 
Despite the headwinds in many of our sectors and changing end market dynamics, our primary efforts remain on structurally improving our company, controlling our cost and positioning Flowserve for profitable growth and increased shareholder value creation. These efforts include strategically repositioning our capabilities, aggressively aligning our manufacturing presence with our served industries for the long term and responding to current market environment while permanently reducing under absorption in our system, pursuing our growth initiatives and enhancing our value proposition for our customers.
As noted earlier, we continue to make solid progress on a realignment program, delivering approximately $27 million of savings in the second quarter. To date, we've initiated actions on 2/3 of the facilities we expect to either be closed, repurposed or sold. 
Importantly, we remain on track to meet our goal of reaching approximately $100 million of incremental savings, which is expected in 2016. In terms of specific locations, we have ceased manufacturing and completed the product transfer at an IPD facility in the U.K. And in Canada, we closed an EPD facility and also divested a nonstrategic foundry. We also have initiated the process to transfer capabilities from our Dubai operations to another location in the Middle East and are earning completion on closing a Dutch location, where manufacturing has now ceased.
During the third and fourth quarters, we plan to address additional manufacturing sites and continue to expect about $160 million in charges for the year. While we identify most realignment cost incurred for your analysis, it's important to recognize that our reported and adjusted numbers do include the expected negative impact on revenues and profits that have been delayed during the transition, which should materialize as the receiving sites come up to speed on the new lines. We should also see the benefit of eliminating all the duplicative costs resulting from the transition. With each site undergoing restructuring, we obtained valuable lessons learned and apply them to subsequent locations.
Overall, the pace and progress of our restructuring is on track, and we're confident that this realignment program will position our business for long-term success. Looking further at the market and bookings within our served industries, overall, for the quarter, constant currency bookings declined approximately 10% against last year's strongest quarter, as lower OE bookings and project awards more than offset the 2.3% growth in aftermarket bookings. Sequentially, our bookings increased 4%,, reflecting both our resilient aftermarket franchise and normal seasonality.
I spoke about the challenges of the Original Equipment business already, but we are pleased with this quarter's year-over-year increase in constant currency aftermarket bookings, which is the second consecutive quarter of this growth. Our aftermarket franchise largely demonstrated the kind of resiliency we expect even in these tough markets. And while operating budgets have remained constrained, this quarter's level was also supported by increased emergency response, break fix type activity and the return of a few small upgrade projects, which were notably absent during 2015.
Overall, we remain in a period of rolling deferred maintenance, where many of our customers are catching up on the 2015 deferrals, but delaying activity previously scheduled for 2016. This practice will not likely continue indefinitely, and we expect to benefit as operating budgets normalize. 
We have also recently seen more customers inquire about new or extended long-term lifecycle agreements or LCAs. We view this activity as positive. In these agreements, we seek to add considerable value to our customers while driving volume for Flowserve. From a segment perspective, we are particularly pleased with IPD's bookings growth of 3.4% on a constant currency basis. For some time, this business had largely leveraged EPD's oil and gas project work. 
Under new leadership, IPD is returning to its industrial roots and demonstrated some early traction in our commercial initiatives for the segment, including increasing our exposure in the profitable chemical sector and other general industries, and better leveraging the distribution channel and growing its run rate and small project activity.
Additionally, IPD has benefited from the ongoing integration of SIHI's products across Flowserve's selling platform, including product pull-through across Flowserve's broad portfolio. In fact, this enabled the former SIHI entity to achieve one of its highest levels of quarterly bookings to date in the second quarter.
Turning now to specific end markets and looking at bookings on a constant currency basis. Oil and gas declined 20% in the quarter, which impacted each of our segments and reflected the broad-based pressure on our oil and gas customer's budgets. Oil and gas is our largest served market, and this industry has been challenged for over 1.5 year now. 
Power bookings decreased approximately 9% driven by declines in the IPD and FCD segments. EPD's bookings were essentially flat, including strong nuclear aftermarket orders in North America and Europe, and our success in shifting certain products traditionally focused on oil and gas markets towards our power customers. Going forward, we continue to expect a combined cycle investment in North America while China continues to invest in nuclear, where we participate in both the Western and Chinese designs.
In our general industries, constant currency bookings decreased approximately 4%. Solid IPD bookings partially offset EPD's 18% decline. As previously mentioned, IPD's distributor initiatives showed progress, and we intend to utilize this channel to target previously unserved markets. 
Flat FCD bookings were supported by solid defense-related orders in Europe and global pulp and paper activity. Broadly speaking, distributors remain challenged. While we believe destocking is largely complete in this channel, they are now maintaining inventory at lower levels and often ordering only when they have a customer order in hand. 
Chemical bookings were essentially flat in the second quarter, supported by strong increase in SIHI bookings. We continue to see some delays in the expected ethylene driven derivative plants, as well as the second wave of crackers, but we expect this development to progress in North America and the Middle East supported by low-cost feedstock.
To wrap up, we are confident that we are taking the right actions to position Flowserve for the future and we are encouraged by the progress made this quarter. Although our served markets remain volatile and challenging, our first half results were largely in line with our expectations, and we expect a stronger second half of the year with seasonality, cost takeout and backlog shipments as the key drivers. 
Aftermarket is showing resiliency during this time. And if extended market stability occurs, we do expect growth in the original equipment orders to ultimately follow. Nevertheless, we expect our customers will remain deliberate near term and early projects to be very competitive. In this environment, we will remain disciplined.
I would like to leave you with a final thought. While we are very much internally focused on cost reduction and structurally rightsizing our operations in this environment and making good progress, we are also positioning Flowserve for the eventual improvement in our markets. We continue to invest for long-term profitable growth, including in the distribution channel and other industrial opportunities, as well as new product development and improvements through our disciplined R&D process. 
I am confident in our ability to execute our strategic vision and the extended outlook for our served markets, as well as our capabilities to drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders.
Let me now turn the call over to Karyn."
267555,375977250,1017870,"Flowserve Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Flowserve Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our 2016 second quarter financials. Our results were largely in line with our expectations.

Turning to our 2016 second quarter financials. Our results were largely in line with our expectations. Bookings were highlighted by growth in our aftermarket business, albeit still at low levels, and we also delivered sequential constant currency aftermarket and OE increases of 5.6% and 2.5%, respectively. Based on our first half 2016 results and our expectations for the year, we have tightened our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance while maintaining our full year 2016 revenue outlook.
Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.57 was driven by our continued operational execution and a solid level of shipments even with the challenges that come with executing significant realignment initiatives. Our second quarter adjusted EPS excludes $0.11 of realignment expense and $0.01 associated with SIHI purchase price accounting and integration charges, which were partially offset by a gain of $0.03 from global line currency impacts. 
Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.48, which included an above-the-line negative currency translation headwind of approximately $0.01. Q2 revenues of over $1 billion decreased 11.7% or 9.7% constant currency. Year-to-date, Flowserve's constant currency revenues decreased 6.2% compared to 2015 levels. Adjusted SG&A expenses declined 4.2% in the second quarter, but remained elevated as a percent of sales due primarily to the decline in revenues and the timing impact of expected realignment savings from our ongoing cost reduction efforts in higher cost regions.
Turning to margins. Second quarter adjusted gross margins were 32.7%, down 130 basis points from prior year and excluded realignment charges of $8.9 million and SIHI charges of $2.1 million. Reported gross margins were 31.6%, which were negatively impacted by lower volumes that resulted in increased under absorption, as well as work that reflected the challenging pricing environment booked over the last 1.5 year.
Similar to the first quarter, IPD continued to be particularly impacted by under absorption in many of its facilities in high-cost regions due to a nearly 18% revenue decline. We continue to expect margin improvement in the segment through the year from our realignment initiatives and the continued integration of SIHI. Our second quarter tax rate of approximately 29% was slightly below our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. Looking at bookings in greater detail and on a constant currency basis, original equipment bookings declined 19.4% while aftermarket realized a 2.3% increase over the prior year.
From a regional perspective, Europe's bookings increased 9.1% constant currency while North America was down 10.6%, and Latin America and Asia Pacific were down mid-teens. The Middle East was particularly challenged. Last year, this region continued to invest in the downturn, but in the current environment, we see limited project activity occurring and aftermarket orders being deferred. 
Turning to revenues. We delivered modest constant currency growth in the Middle East, which was realized from the backlog built during last year's positive booking environment. North America, Asia Pacific and Europe saw constant currency sales decline in the 8% to 12% range, while national oil company challenges in Latin America drove a constant currency decline of nearly 32% in that region.
Shifting to our realignment program and the approximately $27 million of savings realized in the second quarter. This progress keeps us on track to achieving our goal of incremental savings of approximately $100 million in 2016. We expensed $20 million in the second quarter related to these efforts, bringing in the first half 2016 total expense to approximately $34 million, and we continue to expect an expense of roughly $160 million during 2016 as we continue to execute on a number of planned actions during the second half of the year.
For the total program, we expect our $400 million multiyear investment to drive estimated total savings of $195 million in 2017, which is $70 million incremental to total 2016 program savings of $125 million. In 2018, the full annualized program savings are expected at $230 million. 
Turning to cash flow. Through June 30, 2016, operating cash flow was down about $15 million versus a year ago, as cash outflows related to realignment exceeded our book expenses. However free cash flow improved roughly $62 million compared to the first half of 2015 due to elevated capital expenditures last year related to the purchase of an aftermarket license and carryover investment on our new Chinese valve facility. 
We returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends while our realignment program used approximately $34 million of our cash during the second quarter. As many of you know, typically, the majority of our operating cash flow is realized in the last 2 quarters of the year, and we expect that to be the case again this year, likely with more waiting on the fourth quarter.
Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we see continued pricing pressure and caution in our end markets, we remain confident over the longer term that our diversified end markets, comprehensive product portfolio and geographic exposures, coupled with our strategic growth initiatives and transformational realignment plans, position us for the future. However, there is still uncertainly, given ongoing macro and political issues, including the impact of the recent Brexit vote. But we have limited direct exposure to the U.K., the potential broader impact of the event on the U.K., European and global economy is still largely unknown.
Based on performance for the first half of 2016, our backlog and its expected recognition, combined with our expectations at the current market conditions will largely persists, we've tightened our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share. Due to the expected timing and margin of scheduled backlog shipments as well as our recognition of realignment savings we expect our performance will be even more heavily weighted on the fourth quarter results compared to prior years. 
On the top line, our 2016 adjusted EPS target range assumes revenues declining 7% to 14% compared to the 2015 level, and this range includes a 2% currency headwind or roughly $0.10 per share of above-the-line impact. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the low- to mid-$60 million range and a tax rate of 30% to 31%. As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of our 2015 SIHI acquisition and excludes realignment expenses, SIHI price accounting and integration costs, below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impacts of other potential discrete items.
Moving on to cash usage for the year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures in the range of $105 million to $115 million, a significant reduction over elevated 2015 levels. Cash realignment expenditures are expected in the range of approximately $125 million to $150 million for the full year. Scheduled debt payments for the remainder of the year are $30 million. And we also plan to continue contributing to our pension plans to cover service costs even as the U.S. plan remains largely fully funded.
With that review, let me turn the call back to Jeff."

We talked about one of the facilities that was closed in the first quarter. And also in the transition, as we take costs out during the course of this year from the SIHI acquisition a year ago. And then, finally, it's transitioned over to more of the industrial and the commercial approach. It's working through that and what you see is it's not getting fixed cost leverage because the outflows of the project oil and gas year-over-year. So when we look at that business, we know it's going to be challenged from a margin standpoint during the course of the year, but we expect to get realignment costs and the SIHI cost out towards the back half of the year and then continue to drive and get the fixed cost leverage in the business. We think we can get the margins back up in this business to good levels, but it'll be much more of an industrial type business at that point in time."

I think from a market driven standpoint and -- one thing, I want to make a point, a lot of our aftermarket opportunities are end-user strategies where we go in and help people in any market improve the efficiency. We didn't see a lot of that last year because the reaction on the OpEx budget was to constrain everything. But if you look at from a market-driven activity, I made the comment earlier we're in a rolling deferral period, where you'll see an uptick there is if there's pressure that comes of the operating budgets. We don't see that over the short term. The market needs some stability. You look in the backdrop of what's occurred is the concern with the majors over having to cut their dividend has certainly abated but they're still being fairly conservative. So from a market standpoint, I think we'll continue to see the rolling deferral, but the opportunity for us is to continue to execute on our strategies because the nice thing about installed base, it's permanent, it stays and they're always looking for efficiency. And that's what we like relative to even what we saw in '09, that they're not shedding a lot of facilities. They're running them. And the one way you can improve your profitability is to make it more efficient. But I think from a market standpoint, we don't expect the budgets to snap back here short term.

So you'll get the benefit from the market and the execution of the aftermarket strategies. Now there's no escaping the fact that one of the biggest things that move the needles is the projects. And I just want to make a distinction. While it moves the needle on revenue, keep in mind, it doesn't move the needle as much on earnings, especially now as we start to restructure that custom engineered business. Because if revenue goes down and you have a lot of under absorption, it can impact your earnings. But as we start taking these costs out, keep in mind, those projects are very competitive in good markets and bad, but it does kind of move the needle on revenues. So from our standpoint, until we see some project activity, we don't start -- we don't think that, that custom generic business is going to see an uptick trend in its revenue, which is a component of the EPD business from a revenue standpoint. And again, that does move the needle. If you look in the aftermarket, we're encouraged by what we see in stability and sequential and year-over-year increases, that is also our most profitable business and drives a substantial amount of earnings. So think of it 2 ways. One in terms of revenues and earnings. Also, think a third component of what we're doing with the cost structure in that project-related revenue."

We're not seeing or expecting or planning for a lot of big projects to come back here over the short term. We think the market needs to see some stability. If they do, they might start ordering some of the long lead time items in these large projects. But I wouldn't anticipate that we'd see that in our order book this year.

But of course, those also result in higher margins. But we'll continue to work through that. We'll continue to see some delays with customers as they push out taking delivery. So market conditions are also playing there a bit. But as we go through the realignment, the expectation is that, with the reduction in the sites, by definition, we'll have more optimized product management, more optimized supply chain and of course, more optimization in terms of our inventory turns.

Let me start with a quick overview of the quarter. First, Flowserve delivered solid financial and operating results in the second quarter.

First, Flowserve delivered solid financial and operating results in the second quarter. This performance, including our adjusted EPS of $0.57 per share, was generally in line with our expectations and kept us on pace to deliver within our prior guidance range for the full year, although we did tighten our range this quarter by modestly lowering the upper end.
We continue to make significant progress in our transformational realignment program to optimize our manufacturing platform and reduce our cost structure. Additionally, we are seeing early traction from some of our growth initiatives. I will review a few key highlights and then Karyn will discuss our financial results in greater detail.
From an operational standpoint, our continuing focus remains to improve our on-time delivery, reduce past-due backlog, ensure best-in-class quality, enhance our sales process and project management capabilities, minimize the impact of restructuring on day-to-day activities and further leverage our supplier relationships. 
Our employees have supported these efforts, and I'm generally pleased with the operational execution that we've delivered, even while undertaking our realignment efforts and facing a challenging market backdrop. 
During the quarter, we saw less volatility in some commodity prices, most notably, crude oil. While this stability is encouraging, we still expect our customers will remain cautious with their capital and operating budgets in the near term. Considering the multiyear nature of infrastructure original equipment investments, the more important criteria for our customers is stability, and it will likely require several quarters of consistency before investment spending actively resumes. 
Despite the headwinds in many of our sectors and changing end market dynamics, our primary efforts remain on structurally improving our company, controlling our cost and positioning Flowserve for profitable growth and increased shareholder value creation. These efforts include strategically repositioning our capabilities, aggressively aligning our manufacturing presence with our served industries for the long term and responding to current market environment while permanently reducing under absorption in our system, pursuing our growth initiatives and enhancing our value proposition for our customers.
As noted earlier, we continue to make solid progress on a realignment program, delivering approximately $27 million of savings in the second quarter. To date, we've initiated actions on 2/3 of the facilities we expect to either be closed, repurposed or sold. 
Importantly, we remain on track to meet our goal of reaching approximately $100 million of incremental savings, which is expected in 2016. In terms of specific locations, we have ceased manufacturing and completed the product transfer at an IPD facility in the U.K. And in Canada, we closed an EPD facility and also divested a nonstrategic foundry. We also have initiated the process to transfer capabilities from our Dubai operations to another location in the Middle East and are nearing completion on closing a Dutch location, where manufacturing has now ceased.
During the third and fourth quarters, we plan to address additional manufacturing sites and continue to expect about $160 million in charges for the year. While we identify most realignment cost incurred for your analysis, it's important to recognize that our reported and adjusted numbers do include the expected negative impact on revenues and profits that have been delayed during the transition, which should materialize as the receiving sites come up to speed on the new lines. We should also see the benefit of eliminating all the duplicative costs resulting from the transition. With each site undergoing restructuring, we obtained valuable lessons learned and apply them to subsequent locations.
Overall, the pace and progress of our restructuring is on track, and we're confident that this realignment program will position our business for long-term success. Looking further at the market and bookings within our served industries, overall, for the quarter, constant currency bookings declined approximately 10% against last year's strongest quarter, as lower OE bookings and project awards more than offset the 2.3% growth in aftermarket bookings. Sequentially, our bookings increased 4%,, reflecting both our resilient aftermarket franchise and normal seasonality.
I spoke about the challenges of the Original Equipment business already, but we are pleased with this quarter's year-over-year increase in constant currency aftermarket bookings, which is the second consecutive quarter of this growth. Our aftermarket franchise largely demonstrated the kind of resiliency we expect even in these tough markets. And while operating budgets have remained constrained, this quarter's level was also supported by increased emergency response, brake fix type activity and the return of a few small upgrade projects, which were notably absent during 2015.
Overall, we remain in a period of rolling deferred maintenance, where many of our customers are catching up on the 2015 deferrals, but delaying activity previously scheduled for 2016. This practice will not likely continue indefinitely, and we expect to benefit as operating budgets normalize. 
We have also recently seen more customers inquire about new or extended long-term lifecycle agreements or LCAs. We view this activity as positive. In these agreements, we seek to add considerable value to our customers while driving volume for Flowserve. From a segment perspective, we are particularly pleased with IPD's bookings growth of 3.4% on a constant currency basis. For some time, this business had largely leveraged EPD's oil and gas project work. 
Under new leadership, IPD is returning to its industrial roots and demonstrated some early traction in our commercial initiatives for the segment, including increasing our exposure in the profitable chemical sector and other general industries, and better leveraging the distribution channel and growing its run rate and small project activity.
Additionally, IPD has benefited from the ongoing integration of SIHI's products across Flowserve's selling platform, including product pull-through across Flowserve's broad portfolio. In fact, this enabled the former SIHI entity to achieve one of its highest levels of quarterly bookings to date in the second quarter.
Turning now to specific end markets and looking at bookings on a constant currency basis. Oil and gas declined 20% in the quarter, which impacted each of our segments and reflected the broad-based pressure on our oil and gas customer's budgets. Oil and gas is our largest served market, and this industry has been challenged for over 1.5 year now. 
Power bookings decreased approximately 9% driven by declines in the IPD and FCD segments. EPD's bookings were essentially flat, including strong nuclear aftermarket orders in North America and Europe, and our success in shifting certain products traditionally focused on oil and gas markets towards our power customers. Going forward, we continue to expect a combined cycle investment in North America while China continues to invest in nuclear, where we participate in both the Western and Chinese designs.
In our general industries, constant currency bookings decreased approximately 4%. Solid IPD bookings partially offset EPD's 18% decline. As previously mentioned, IPD's distributor initiatives showed progress, and we intend to utilize this channel to target previously unserved markets. 
Flat FCD bookings were supported by solid defense-related orders in Europe and global pulp and paper activity. Broadly speaking, distributors remain challenged. While we believe destocking is largely complete in this channel, they are now maintaining inventory at lower levels and often ordering only when they have a customer order in hand. 
Chemical bookings were essentially flat in the second quarter, supported by strong increase in SIHI bookings. We continue to see some delays in the expected ethylene driven derivative plants, as well as the second wave of crackers, but we expect this development to progress in North America and the Middle East supported by low-cost feedstock.
To wrap up, we are confident that we are taking the right actions to position Flowserve for the future and we are encouraged by the progress made this quarter. Although our served markets remain volatile and challenging, our first half results were largely in line with our expectations, and we expect a stronger second half of the year with seasonality, cost takeout and backlog shipments as the key drivers. 
Aftermarket is showing resiliency during this time. And if extended market stability occurs, we do expect growth in the original equipment orders to ultimately follow. Nevertheless, we expect our customers will remain deliberate near term and early projects to be very competitive. In this environment, we will remain disciplined.
I would like to leave you with a final thought. While we are very much internally focused on cost reduction and structurally rightsizing our operations in this environment and making good progress, we are also positioning Flowserve for the eventual improvement in our markets. We continue to invest for long-term profitable growth, including in the distribution channel and other industrial opportunities, as well as new product development and improvements through our disciplined R&D process. 
I am confident in our ability to execute our strategic vision and the extended outlook for our served markets, as well as our capabilities to drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders.
Let me now turn the call over to Karyn."

Turning to our 2016 second quarter financials. Our results were largely in line with our expectations.

Turning to our 2016 second quarter financials. Our results were largely in line with our expectations. Bookings were highlighted by growth in our aftermarket business, albeit still at low levels, and we also delivered sequential constant currency aftermarket and OE increases of 5.6% and 2.5%, respectively. Based on our first half 2016 results and our expectations for the year, we have tightened our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance while maintaining our full year 2016 revenue outlook.
Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.57 was driven by our continued operational execution and a solid level of shipments even with the challenges that come with executing significant realignment initiatives. Our second quarter adjusted EPS excludes $0.11 of realignment expense and $0.01 associated with SIHI purchase price accounting and integration charges, which were partially offset by a gain of $0.03 from below-the-line currency impacts. 
Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.48, which included an above-the-line negative currency translation headwind of approximately $0.01. Q2 revenues of over $1 billion decreased 11.7% or 9.7% constant currency. Year-to-date, Flowserve's constant currency revenues decreased 6.2% compared to 2015 levels. Adjusted SG&A expenses declined 4.2% in the second quarter, but remained elevated as a percent of sales due primarily to the decline in revenues and the timing impact of expected realignment savings from our ongoing cost reduction efforts in higher cost regions.
Turning to margins. Second quarter adjusted gross margins were 32.7%, down 130 basis points from prior year and excluded realignment charges of $8.9 million and SIHI charges of $2.1 million. Reported gross margins were 31.6%, which were negatively impacted by lower volumes that resulted in increased under absorption, as well as work that reflected the challenging pricing environment booked over the last 1.5 year.
Similar to the first quarter, IPD continued to be particularly impacted by under absorption in many of its facilities in high-cost regions due to a nearly 18% revenue decline. We continue to expect margin improvement in the segment through the year from our realignment initiatives and the continued integration of SIHI. Our second quarter tax rate of approximately 29% was slightly below our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. Looking at bookings in greater detail and on a constant currency basis, original equipment bookings declined 19.4% while aftermarket realized a 2.3% increase over the prior year.
From a regional perspective, Europe's bookings increased 9.1% constant currency while North America was down 10.6%, and Latin America and Asia Pacific were down mid-teens. The Middle East was particularly challenged. Last year, this region continued to invest in the downturn, but in the current environment, we see limited project activity occurring and aftermarket work is being deferred. 
Turning to revenues. We delivered modest constant currency growth in the Middle East, which was realized from the backlog built during last year's positive booking environment. North America, Asia Pacific and Europe saw constant currency sales decline in the 8% to 12% range, while national oil company challenges in Latin America drove a constant currency decline of nearly 32% in that region.
Shifting to our realignment program and the approximately $27 million of savings realized in the second quarter. This progress keeps us on track to achieving our goal of incremental savings of approximately $100 million in 2016. We expensed $20 million in the second quarter related to these efforts, bringing in the first half 2016 total expense to approximately $34 million, and we continue to expect an expense of roughly $160 million during 2016 as we continue to execute on a number of planned actions during the second half of the year.
For the total program, we expect our $400 million multiyear investment to drive estimated total savings of $195 million in 2017, which is $70 million incremental to total 2016 program savings of $125 million. In 2018, the full annualized program savings are expected at $230 million. 
Turning to cash flow. Through June 30, 2016, operating cash flow was down about $15 million versus a year ago, as cash outflows related to realignment exceeded our book expenses. However free cash flow improved roughly $62 million compared to the first half of 2015 due to elevated capital expenditures last year related to the purchase of an aftermarket license and carryover investment on our new Chinese valve facility. 
We returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends while our realignment program used approximately $34 million of our cash during the second quarter. As many of you know, typically, the majority of our operating cash flow is realized in the last 2 quarters of the year, and we expect that to be the case again this year, likely with more weighting on the fourth quarter.
Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we see continued pricing pressure and caution in our end markets, we remain confident over the longer term that our diversified end markets, comprehensive product portfolio and geographic exposures, coupled with our strategic growth initiatives and transformational realignment plans, position us for the future. However, there is still uncertainty, given ongoing macro and political issues, including the impact of the recent Brexit vote. But we have limited direct exposure to the U.K., the potential broader impact of the event on the U.K., European and global economy is still largely unknown.
Based on performance for the first half of 2016, our backlog and its expected recognition, combined with our expectations that the current market conditions will largely persist, we've tightened our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share. Due to the expected timing and margin of scheduled backlog shipments as well as our recognition of realignment savings, we expect our performance will be even more heavily weighted on the fourth quarter results compared to prior years. 
On the top line, our 2016 adjusted EPS target range assumes revenues declining 7% to 14% compared to the 2015 level, and this range includes a 2% currency headwind or roughly $0.10 per share of above-the-line impact. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the low- to mid-$60 million range and a tax rate of 30% to 31%. As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of our 2015 SIHI acquisition and excludes realignment expenses, SIHI price accounting and integration costs, below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impacts of other potential discrete items.
Moving on to cash usage for the year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures in the range of $105 million to $115 million, a significant reduction over elevated 2015 levels. Cash realignment expenditures are expected in the range of approximately $125 million to $150 million for the full year. Scheduled debt payments for the remainder of the year are $30 million. And we also plan to continue contributing to our pension plans to cover service costs even as the U.S. plan remains largely fully funded.
With that review, let me turn the call back to Jay."

We talked about one of the facilities that was closed in the first quarter. And also in the transition, as we take costs out during the course of this year from the SIHI acquisition a year ago. And then, finally, it's transitioned over to more of the industrial and the commercial approach. It's working through that and what you see is it's not getting fixed cost leverage because the outflows of the project oil and gas year-over-year. So when we look at that business, we know it's going to be challenged from a margin standpoint during the course of the year, but we expect to get realignment costs and the SIHI cost out towards the back half of the year and then continue to drive and get the fixed cost leverage in the business. We think we can get the margins back up in this business to good levels, but it'll be much more of an industrial type business at that point in time."

I think from a market driven standpoint and -- one thing, I want to make a point, a lot of our aftermarket opportunities are end-user strategies where we go in and help people in any market improve the efficiency. We didn't see a lot of that last year because the reaction on the OpEx budget was to constrain everything. But if you look at from a market-driven activity, I made the comment earlier we're in a rolling deferral period, where you'll see an uptick there is if there's pressure that comes off the operating budgets. We don't see that over the short term. The market needs some stability. You look in the backdrop of what's occurred is the concern with the majors over having to cut their dividend has certainly abated but they're still being fairly conservative. So from a market standpoint, I think we'll continue to see the rolling deferral, but the opportunity for us is to continue to execute on our strategies because the nice thing about installed base, it's permanent, it stays and they're always looking for efficiency. And that's what we like relative to even what we saw in '09, that they're not shutting a lot of facilities. They're running them. And the one way you can improve your profitability is to make it more efficient. But I think from a market standpoint, we don't expect the budgets to snap back here short term.

So you'll get the benefit from the market and the execution of the aftermarket strategies. Now there's no escaping the fact that one of the biggest things that move the needles is the projects. And I just want to make a distinction. While it moves the needle on revenue, keep in mind, it doesn't move the needle as much on earnings, especially now as we start to restructure that custom engineered business. Because if revenue goes down and you have a lot of under absorption, it can impact your earnings. But as we start taking these costs out, keep in mind, those projects are very competitive in good markets and bad, but it does kind of move the needle on revenues. So from our standpoint, until we see some project activity, we don't start -- we don't think that, that custom generic business is going to see an uptick trend in its revenue, which is a component of the EPD business from a revenue standpoint. And again, that does move the needle. If you look in the aftermarket, we're encouraged by what we see in stability and sequential and year-over-year increases, that is also our most profitable business and drives a substantial amount of earnings. So think of it 2 ways. One in terms of revenues and earnings. Also, think a third component of what we're doing with the cost structure in that project-related revenue."

What you're seeing is fixed cost leverage, and it's mainly volume-related. And it's the fact that we, I think we made this point last time, particularly in areas where we're taking cost out, we can't take it out as quickly as volume declined.  The other thing, and I alluded this to in my comments, is in the margin business. When you restructure a business and all the activity that's going on -- think about it, we've got -- ultimately it will impact 30% of our sites. You have sending and receiving sites. You have all types of activities that occur with that. That impacts your business negatively. That's why we want to get through this quickly. Because when you do that, you naturally get a lift because you have -- you don't have the distractions you have in the business. So when we look at our margin profile, we see and understand what's going on in IPD. That had an impact in terms of the integration of SIHI and the volume leverage as well. We also recognize in our custom engineered business that volumes have come down, but it takes a while to get those costs out of the business. And then generally, broad based, a lot of our other cost, structural cost, considering where they are, take time to get out. You add onto that the fact that when you make these kind of changes, there are costs in the system that we don't call out necessarily in realignment or in our otherwise results that impact your business negatively. Anybody that goes through a major restructuring like this and we're executing very well, has those knock-on costs. We expect them, we deal with them and we know we'll get through them."

And you also talked about the realignment taking out some of those absorption issues. So all of those 4 impacts should be relatively transitory? I mean, all of this stuff is planned to be finished by the end of 2017. If we held everything else constant, where do you think the margins in IPD should be in that timeframe, in say 18 months, once all of this stuff is behind you?"

Brazil has certainly, been impacted for a period of time. But a lot of the large ones around the world are well-capitalized.

Let me start with a quick overview of the quarter. First, Flowserve delivered solid financial and operating results in the second quarter.

First, Flowserve delivered solid financial and operating results in the second quarter. This performance, including our adjusted EPS of $0.57 per share, was generally in line with our expectations and kept us on pace to deliver within our prior guidance range for the full year, although we did tighten our range this quarter by modestly lowering the upper end.
We continue to make significant progress in our transformational realignment program to optimize our manufacturing platform and reduce our cost structure. Additionally, we are seeing early traction from some of our growth initiatives. I will review a few key highlights and then Karyn will discuss our financial results in greater detail.
From an operational standpoint, our continuing focus remains to improve our on-time delivery, reduce past-due backlog, ensure best-in-class quality, enhance our sales process and project management capabilities, minimize the impact of restructuring on day-to-day activities and further leverage our supplier relationships. 
Our employees have supported these efforts, and I'm generally pleased with the operational execution that we've delivered, even while undertaking our realignment efforts and facing a challenging market backdrop. 
During the quarter, we saw less volatility in some commodity prices, most notably, crude oil. While this stability is encouraging, we still expect our customers will remain cautious with their capital and operating budgets in the near term. Considering the multiyear nature of infrastructure original equipment investments, the more important criteria for our customers is stability, and it will likely require several quarters of consistency before investment spending actively resumes. 
Despite the headwinds in many of our sectors and changing end market dynamics, our primary efforts remain on structurally improving our company, controlling our cost and positioning Flowserve for profitable growth and increased shareholder value creation. These efforts include strategically repositioning our capabilities, aggressively aligning our manufacturing presence with our served industries for the long term and responding to current market environment while permanently reducing under absorption in our system, pursuing our growth initiatives and enhancing our value proposition for our customers.
As noted earlier, we continue to make solid progress on a realignment program, delivering approximately $27 million of savings in the second quarter. To date, we've initiated actions on 2/3 of the facilities we expect to either be closed, repurposed or sold. 
Importantly, we remain on track to meet our goal of reaching approximately $100 million of incremental savings, which is expected in 2016. In terms of specific locations, we have ceased manufacturing and completed the product transfer at an IPD facility in the U.K. And in Canada, we closed an EPD facility and also divested a nonstrategic foundry. We also have initiated the process to transfer capabilities from our Dubai operations to another location in the Middle East and are nearing completion on closing a Dutch location, where manufacturing has now ceased.
During the third and fourth quarters, we plan to address additional manufacturing sites and continue to expect about $160 million in charges for the year. While we identify most realignment cost incurred for your analysis, it's important to recognize that our reported and adjusted numbers do include the expected negative impact on revenues and profits that have been delayed during the transition, which should materialize as the receiving sites come up to speed on the new lines. We should also see the benefit of eliminating all the duplicative costs resulting from the transition. With each site undergoing restructuring, we obtained valuable lessons learned and apply them to subsequent locations.
Overall, the pace and progress of our restructuring is on track, and we're confident that this realignment program will position our business for long-term success. Looking further at the market and bookings within our served industries, overall, for the quarter, constant currency bookings declined approximately 10% against last year's strongest quarter, as lower OE bookings and project awards more than offset the 2.3% growth in aftermarket bookings. Sequentially, our bookings increased 4%,, reflecting both our resilient aftermarket franchise and normal seasonality.
I spoke about the challenges of the Original Equipment business already, but we are pleased with this quarter's year-over-year increase in constant currency aftermarket bookings, which is the second consecutive quarter of this growth. Our aftermarket franchise largely demonstrated the kind of resiliency we expect even in these tough markets. And while operating budgets have remained constrained, this quarter's level was also supported by increased emergency response, brake fix type activity and the return of a few small upgrade projects, which were notably absent during 2015.
Overall, we remain in a period of rolling deferred maintenance, where many of our customers are catching up on the 2015 deferrals, but delaying activity previously scheduled for 2016. This practice will not likely continue indefinitely, and we expect to benefit as operating budgets normalize. 
We have also recently seen more customers inquire about new or extended long-term lifecycle agreements or LCAs. We view this activity as positive. In these agreements, we seek to add considerable value to our customers while driving volume for Flowserve. From a segment perspective, we are particularly pleased with IPD's bookings growth of 3.4% on a constant currency basis. For some time, this business had largely leveraged EPD's oil and gas project work. 
Under new leadership, IPD is returning to its industrial roots and demonstrated some early traction in our commercial initiatives for the segment, including increasing our exposure in the profitable chemical sector and other general industries, and better leveraging the distribution channel and growing its run rate and small project activity.
Additionally, IPD has benefited from the ongoing integration of SIHI's products across Flowserve's selling platform, including product pull-through across Flowserve's broad portfolio. In fact, this enabled the former SIHI entity to achieve one of its highest levels of quarterly bookings to date in the second quarter.
Turning now to specific end markets and looking at bookings on a constant currency basis. Oil and gas declined 20% in the quarter, which impacted each of our segments and reflected the broad-based pressure on our oil and gas customer's budgets. Oil and gas is our largest served market, and this industry has been challenged for over 1.5 year now. 
Power bookings decreased approximately 9% driven by declines in the IPD and FCD segments. EPD's bookings were essentially flat, including strong nuclear aftermarket orders in North America and Europe, and our success in shifting certain products traditionally focused on oil and gas markets towards our power customers. Going forward, we continue to expect a combined cycle investment in North America while China continues to invest in nuclear, where we participate in both the Western and Chinese designs.
In our general industries, constant currency bookings decreased approximately 4%. Solid IPD bookings partially offset EPD's 18% decline. As previously mentioned, IPD's distributor initiatives showed progress, and we intend to utilize this channel to target previously unserved markets. 
Flat FCD bookings were supported by solid defense-related orders in Europe and global pulp and paper activity. Broadly speaking, distributors remain challenged. While we believe destocking is largely complete in this channel, they are now maintaining inventory at lower levels and often ordering only when they have a customer order in hand. 
Chemical bookings were essentially flat in the second quarter, supported by strong increase in SIHI bookings. We continue to see some delays in the expected ethylene driven derivative plants, as well as the second wave of crackers, but we expect this development to progress in North America and the Middle East supported by low-cost feedstock.
To wrap up, we are confident that we are taking the right actions to position Flowserve for the future and we are encouraged by the progress made this quarter. Although our served markets remain volatile and challenging, our first half results were largely in line with our expectations, and we expect a stronger second half of the year with seasonality, cost takeout and backlog shipments as the key drivers. 
Aftermarket is showing resiliency during this time. And if extended market stability occurs, we do expect growth in the original equipment orders to ultimately follow. Nevertheless, we expect our customers will remain deliberate near term and early projects to be very competitive. In this environment, we will remain disciplined.
I would like to leave you with a final thought. While we are very much internally focused on cost reduction and structurally rightsizing our operations in this environment and making good progress, we are also positioning Flowserve for the eventual improvement in our markets. We continue to invest for long-term profitable growth, including in the distribution channel and other industrial opportunities, as well as new product development and improvements through our disciplined R&D process. 
I am confident in our ability to execute our strategic vision and the extended outlook for our served markets, as well as our capabilities to drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders.
Let me now turn the call over to Karyn."
267555,375977250,1018686,"Flowserve Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Flowserve Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our 2016 second quarter financials. Our results were largely in line with our expectations.

Turning to our 2016 second quarter financials. Our results were largely in line with our expectations. Bookings were highlighted by growth in our aftermarket business, albeit still at low levels, and we also delivered sequential constant currency aftermarket and OE increases of 5.6% and 2.5%, respectively. Based on our first half 2016 results and our expectations for the year, we have tightened our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance while maintaining our full year 2016 revenue outlook.
Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.57 was driven by our continued operational execution and a solid level of shipments even with the challenges that come with executing significant realignment initiatives. Our second quarter adjusted EPS excludes $0.11 of realignment expense and $0.01 associated with SIHI purchase price accounting and integration charges, which were partially offset by a gain of $0.03 from below-the-line currency impacts. 
Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.48, which included an above-the-line negative currency translation headwind of approximately $0.01. Q2 revenues of over $1 billion decreased 11.7% or 9.7% constant currency. Year-to-date, Flowserve's constant currency revenues decreased 6.2% compared to 2015 levels. Adjusted SG&A expenses declined 4.2% in the second quarter, but remained elevated as a percent of sales due primarily to the decline in revenues and the timing impact of expected realignment savings from our ongoing cost reduction efforts in higher cost regions.
Turning to margins. Second quarter adjusted gross margins were 32.7%, down 130 basis points from prior year and excluded realignment charges of $8.9 million and SIHI charges of $2.1 million. Reported gross margins were 31.6%, which were negatively impacted by lower volumes that resulted in increased under absorption, as well as work that reflected the challenging pricing environment booked over the last 1.5 year.
Similar to the first quarter, IPD continued to be particularly impacted by under absorption in many of its facilities in high-cost regions due to a nearly 18% revenue decline. We continue to expect margin improvement in the segment through the year from our realignment initiatives and the continued integration of SIHI. Our second quarter tax rate of approximately 29% was slightly below our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. Looking at bookings in greater detail and on a constant currency basis, original equipment bookings declined 19.4% while aftermarket realized a 2.3% increase over the prior year.
From a regional perspective, Europe's bookings increased 9.1% constant currency while North America was down 10.6%, and Latin America and Asia Pacific were down mid-teens. The Middle East was particularly challenged. Last year, this region continued to invest in the downturn, but in the current environment, we see limited project activity occurring and aftermarket work is being deferred. 
Turning to revenues. We delivered modest constant currency growth in the Middle East, which was realized from the backlog built during last year's positive booking environment. North America, Asia Pacific and Europe saw constant currency sales decline in the 8% to 12% range, while national oil company challenges in Latin America drove a constant currency decline of nearly 32% in that region.
Shifting to our realignment program and the approximately $27 million of savings realized in the second quarter. This progress keeps us on track to achieving our goal of incremental savings of approximately $100 million in 2016. We expensed $20 million in the second quarter related to these efforts, bringing in the first half 2016 total expense to approximately $34 million, and we continue to expect an expense of roughly $160 million during 2016 as we continue to execute on a number of planned actions during the second half of the year.
For the total program, we expect our $400 million multiyear investment to drive estimated total savings of $195 million in 2017, which is $70 million incremental to total 2016 program savings of $125 million. In 2018, the full annualized program savings are expected at $230 million. 
Turning to cash flow. Through June 30, 2016, operating cash flow was down about $15 million versus a year ago, as cash outflows related to realignment exceeded our book expenses. However free cash flow improved roughly $62 million compared to the first half of 2015 due to elevated capital expenditures last year related to the purchase of an aftermarket license and carryover investment on our new Chinese valve facility. 
We returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends while our realignment program used approximately $34 million of our cash during the second quarter. As many of you know, typically, the majority of our operating cash flow is realized in the last 2 quarters of the year, and we expect that to be the case again this year, likely with more weighting on the fourth quarter.
Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we see continued pricing pressure and caution in our end markets, we remain confident over the longer term that our diversified end markets, comprehensive product portfolio and geographic exposures, coupled with our strategic growth initiatives and transformational realignment plans, position us for the future. However, there is still uncertainty, given ongoing macro and political issues, including the impact of the recent Brexit vote. But we have limited direct exposure to the U.K., the potential broader impact of the event on the U.K., European and global economy is still largely unknown.
Based on performance for the first half of 2016, our backlog and its expected recognition, combined with our expectations that the current market conditions will largely persist, we've tightened our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share. Due to the expected timing and margin of scheduled backlog shipments as well as our recognition of realignment savings, we expect our performance will be even more heavily weighted on the fourth quarter results compared to prior years. 
On the top line, our 2016 adjusted EPS target range assumes revenues declining 7% to 14% compared to the 2015 level, and this range includes a 2% currency headwind or roughly $0.10 per share of above-the-line impact. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the low- to mid-$60 million range and a tax rate of 30% to 31%. As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of our 2015 SIHI acquisition and excludes realignment expenses, SIHI price accounting and integration costs, below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impacts of other potential discrete items.
Moving on to cash usage for the year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures in the range of $105 million to $115 million, a significant reduction over elevated 2015 levels. Cash realignment expenditures are expected in the range of approximately $125 million to $150 million for the full year. Scheduled debt payments for the remainder of the year are $30 million. And we also plan to continue contributing to our pension plans to cover service costs even as the U.S. plan remains largely fully funded.
With that review, let me turn the call back to Jay."

We talked about one of the facilities that was closed in the first quarter. And also in the transition, as we take costs out during the course of this year from the SIHI acquisition a year ago. And then, finally, it's transitioned over to more of the industrial and the commercial approach. It's working through that and what you see is it's not getting fixed cost leverage because the outflows of the project oil and gas year-over-year. So when we look at that business, we know it's going to be challenged from a margin standpoint during the course of the year, but we expect to get realignment costs and the SIHI cost out towards the back half of the year and then continue to drive and get the fixed cost leverage in the business. We think we can get the margins back up in this business to good levels, but it'll be much more of an industrial type business at that point in time."

We didn't see a lot of that last year because the reaction on the OpEx budget was to constrain everything. But if you look at from a market-driven activity, I made the comment earlier we're in a rolling deferral period, where you'll see an uptick there is if there's pressure that comes off the operating budgets. We don't see that over the short term. The market needs some stability. You look in the backdrop of what's occurred is the concern with the majors over having to cut their dividend has certainly abated but they're still being fairly conservative. So from a market standpoint, I think we'll continue to see the rolling deferral, but the opportunity for us is to continue to execute on our strategies because the nice thing about installed base, it's permanent, it stays and they're always looking for efficiency. And that's what we like relative to even what we saw in '09, that they're not shutting a lot of facilities. They're running them. And the one way you can improve your profitability is to make it more efficient. But I think from a market standpoint, we don't expect the budgets to snap back here short term.

So you'll get the benefit from the market and the execution of the aftermarket strategies. Now there's no escaping the fact that one of the biggest things that move the needles is the projects. And I just want to make a distinction. While it moves the needle on revenue, keep in mind, it doesn't move the needle as much on earnings, especially now as we start to restructure that custom engineered business. Because if revenue goes down and you have a lot of under absorption, it can impact your earnings. But as we start taking these costs out, keep in mind, those projects are very competitive in good markets and bad, but it does kind of move the needle on revenues. So from our standpoint, until we see some project activity, we don't start -- we don't think that, that custom generic business is going to see an uptick trend in its revenue, which is a component of the EPD business from a revenue standpoint. And again, that does move the needle. If you look in the aftermarket, we're encouraged by what we see in stability and sequential and year-over-year increases, that is also our most profitable business and drives a substantial amount of earnings. So think of it 2 ways. One in terms of revenues and earnings. Also, think a third component of what we're doing with the cost structure in that project-related revenue."

And it's the fact that we, I think we made this point last time, particularly in areas where we're taking cost out, we can't take it out as quickly as volume declined.  The other thing, and I alluded this to in my comments, is in the margin business. When you restructure a business and all the activity that's going on -- think about it, we've got -- ultimately it will impact 30% of our sites. You have sending and receiving sites. You have all types of activities that occur with that. That impacts your business negatively. That's why we want to get through this quickly. Because when you do that, you naturally get a lift because you have -- you don't have the distractions you have in the business. So when we look at our margin profile, we see and understand what's going on in IPD. That had an impact in terms of the integration of SIHI and the volume leverage as well. We also recognize in our custom engineered business that volumes have come down, but it takes a while to get those costs out of the business. And then generally, broad based, a lot of our other cost, structural cost, considering where they are, take time to get out. You add onto that the fact that when you make these kind of changes, there are costs in the system that we don't call out necessarily in realignment or in our otherwise results that impact your business negatively. Anybody that goes through a major restructuring like this and we're executing very well, has those knock-on costs. We expect them, we deal with them and we know we'll get through them."

And that is one that customers tend -- want to tend to make sure in this environment they go with very, very solid suppliers. Suppliers that can deliver on time and a good quality product and meet the engineering specs. Another thing that's important is there looking for cost efficiencies as well.

Let me begin by reviewing some of the key headlines from the third quarter, which we will cover in greater detail as the call continues. First, on the positive side. We were pleased to achieve a book-to-bill g",1766,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reviewing some of the key headlines from the third quarter, which we will cover in greater detail as the call continues. 
First, on the positive side. We were pleased to achieve a book-to-bill greater than one for the first time in over a year. This is a particularly positive development, given that our customers continue to remain cautious and deliberate with their budgets and spending patterns. As a result of these bookings, our backlog grew modestly and higher margin aftermarket bookings now represent over 30% of our work under contract for the first time. 
We're also seeing some early signs of pre-FEED and FEED opportunities building in the pipeline. We're particularly pleased with the bookings resiliency and performance of our aftermarket franchise throughout 2016, producing modest constant currency bookings growth for the year. We continue to make significant progress on our ongoing realignment program, which will drive cost out of our platform and position Flowserve to enhanced profitability as a leaner and more efficient company.
Finally, while our third quarter earnings were lower than expected, the company continues to be well-positioned, and we are actively pursuing opportunities for further improvement as we execute on our cost reduction initiatives and long-term strategic growth opportunities.
With regard to market and company-specific challenges this quarter, we continue to experience challenging global macro conditions and as I noted earlier, our customers have remained cautious and deliberate in their investment decisions. Reflecting this environment, project delays, rolling maintenance deferrals and extended timelines for both order placement and delivery acceptance have become the norm. 
We were particularly surprised in September with the slow pace of industrial short cycle and aftermarket revenues. But the good news is these orders remain largely in backlog, and we expect to deliver on them in future periods.
There is also additional political uncertainty in many regions around the world, including the United States. We continue to see some operational and cost issues in our receiving sites as we shift manufacturing and implement our structural realignment program. However, we are actively addressing these issues. 
While we are pleased with the progress in our aftermarket bookings, the lower backlog associated with our OE facilities will increase under absorption in the short run, which occurs faster than we can realign or take costs out. As we execute and complete our realignment plans, our new cost structure should catch up to the current workload and alleviate this timing issue and position Flowserve when the cycle improves.
Finally, we incurred some significant noncash reserves during the quarter related to Latin America. As we have previously discussed, this region has been and remains challenged. While we have collected about $5.5 million year-to-date and will continue to actively pursue collections on these accounts, which are not in dispute, we believe that fully reserving for certain receivables balances and work in process is the most prudent course of action.
On an adjusted basis, EPS this quarter was $0.52. And while we indicated on our last call that we expected this quarter to be light due to the timing of shipments, given the magnitude of this impact, along with the continuation of challenging market conditions, we are revising our full year guidance. Karyn will cover our financials in more detail, but operationally, we will continue to focus on a disciplined approach, cost management, and improving our efficiency across the business, and addressing all of these with a sense of urgency.
Despite the challenges this quarter, it is important to note that we have successfully navigated previous cycles and are actively leveraging this experience as we manage our business through the current market environment. Further, I am confident that our current strategic direction and ongoing cost reduction initiatives will position Flowserve competitively for the eventual recovery in our energy end markets. 
Our primary near-term challenge remains transforming our manufacturing platform quickly enough to reduce under absorption while enhancing our operational flexibility to meet customer expectations, a better value for their investment dollar. This situation particularly impacts EPD and IPD in the near term as pumped OE backlog continued to decline during the period. 
With the recent operating issues in financial performance in our IPD segment, I have asked Tom Pajonas to assume interim leadership of the segment's day-to-day operations. Tom was instrumental in turning FCD into the stronger performer it is today, and I am confident he will drive the necessary actions and accountabilities to improve the business. 
Key initiatives include: accelerating the pace in execution of the realignment program and embedding sustainable process improvements to drive differentiated value for our customers, such as reduced lead times, automated order process through e-commerce, enhanced supply chain management and improving on-time deliveries. 
Ultimately, we are driving towards an operating platform and culture in IPD similar to that of our FCD segment. I have complete confidence Tom will improve IPD's performance with time.
Next, I'd like to update you on the significant progress we are making as we execute our realignment program. Though we continue to have some operational issues in some of our receiving sites, we are continuing to focus on the structural transformation of our business platform. 
During the third quarter, we initiated actions to close 2 additional manufacturing facilities, including an Australian IPD facility, which will be consolidated into another Flowserve site in that country. And we are transferring EPD's Lawrence operations based in Massachusetts to other U.S. and Latin American facilities. During the fourth quarter, we plan to address additional manufacturing sites, including recently announced initiatives to close a German manufacturing facility and the consolidation of Middle East QRCs.
We continue to expect about $160 million in charges for the year. From a savings perspective, we delivered approximately $37 million in the third quarter, $80 million year-to-date, and importantly, we remain on track to deliver $100 million of incremental savings for the full year of 2016.
While we identify most realignment costs incurred for your analysis, I'll remind you that our reported and adjusted numbers do not include the expected negative impact on revenues and profits that have been delayed during the transition, which should materialize as the receiving sites come up to speed on the new lines. We are improving our manufacturing transitions with dedicated resources and teams to minimize bottlenecks and implement processes to apply lessons learned from completed actions as we continued to execute on our realignment program.
Turning to our markets and bookings within our served industries. Overall, we believe the relative stability of oil around the $45 to $50 range over the past 6 months has been a positive development for many of our customers. Nevertheless, we still anticipate that our customers will remain cautious with their capital and operating budgets in the near term. Considering the multiyear nature of infrastructure, original equipment investments, it will likely require several quarters of this level of stability before investment spending actively resumes, and we expect the opportunities that arise will be competitive.
Overall for the quarter, constant currency bookings declined approximately 7%, primarily due to an OE bookings decline of approximately 11%. As expected, aftermarket bookings continued to demonstrate resiliency, but did decline approximately 2% this quarter. 
While aftermarket bookings have increased constant currency year-to-date, third quarter aftermarket sales saw a sharp drop off sequentially during the quarter. We believe this is just a timing issue as it is rare for aftermarket orders to cancel and was mainly because our first half 2016 bookings included a few upgrade projects that will not ship until 2017. 
Additionally, some customers have been slow to accept shipment, but we do continue to see elevated levels of emergency response aftermarket opportunities. While pricing pressure has been a significant issue on larger CapEx-driven Greenfield and Brownfield projects, we are pleased that we've maintained fairly consistent pricing levels in our aftermarket bookings.
Turning now to specific end markets and looking at bookings on a constant currency basis, coming off a low base. Bookings in our largest served market, oil and gas, increased 10% in the quarter. European orders and an ebulator job for Asia were key drivers of this growth. 
While we were pleased with this improved level of bookings, we're certainly not calling a bottom yet. However, we do view our downstream and midstream focus as a long-term asset for the company. 
Power bookings decreased approximately 21% on a tough prior year compare. Going forward, we expect steady combined cycle investment in North America and fossil projects in Asia, which tend to be very competitive. China continues to invest in nuclear, where we participate in both the Western and Chinese designs. 
In our general industries, constant currency bookings decreased approximately 4%. The distribution channel remained depressed in the quarter. While we continue to believe destocking across many of our distributors is largely complete, distributors overall are maintaining lower inventory levels, placing smaller orders, often only when they have a customer order in hand. So quick response time will be a priority for us.
Chemical bookings were down 18% in the quarter, with low levels of new project releases. We continued to see delays in the expected ethylene driven derivative plants as well as the second wave of crackers. We expect this development to progress in North America and the Middle East, supported by low-cost feedstock.
To summarize the quarter, we remain focused on rapidly transforming our cost structure for these uncertain markets, while positioning Flowserve for enhanced growth and profitability. We've seen cycles before and fully expect our markets will recover. Importantly, we are confident that our investments to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of our global operating platform will lead us through current challenges and enhance the value that Flowserve can deliver to our customers and shareholders. 
Finishing up on a personal note. As most of you know, about a month ago, we announced my intention to retire from the company at the end of March 2017. After over a decade at Flowserve, and as the company begins its next phase of growth and development, now is the right time for the company and me to begin this transition process. I am confident that Flowserve has the right strategic plans and the right team in place to achieve our objectives.
Flowserve is a great company with a solid operating and financial foundation and is on the right path forward. Importantly, until the Board names my successor, it remains business as usual, and I remain fully committed to the success of the company, our employees and shareholders. 
With that's, let me turn the call over to Karyn."

Turning to our 2016 third quarter financials. As Mark noted, our operating results were primarily impacted by the continued challenging market environment and various associated factors, including Latin America",1054,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our 2016 third quarter financials. As Mark noted, our operating results were primarily impacted by the continued challenging market environment and various associated factors, including Latin America, our realignment initiatives and our performance of the OE business, which I will detail.
Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.52 excludes $0.47 of noncash charges related to Latin American activity, including a $63.2 million charge to reserve certain undisputed accounts receivable, which we will continue to pursue, and a $15.9 million charge to reserve for inventory exposures in the region. Additionally, adjustments include $0.21 per share of realignment expense, $0.01 associated with SIHI purchase price adjustments and integration charges and a gain of $0.01 on below-the-line FX.
Reported loss per share for the quarter was $0.16, which included an above-the-line negative currency translation headwind of approximately $0.02 in both reported and adjusted EPS. Q3 revenues of $943 million decreased 14% or 12.1% constant currency. Year-to-date, Flowserve's constant currency revenues decreased 8.2% compared to 2015 levels. Regionally, and on a constant currency basis, North America was roughly flat, while the Middle East and Africa, Europe and Asia Pac were down low to mid-teens. Latin America remains our most challenged region with a decline of nearly 39%. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses declined 10% in the third quarter, but remained elevated as a percentage of sales due primarily to the decline of revenues and the timing of expected realignment savings from our ongoing realignment program and our paced approach to SIHI cost reduction. Additionally, we have continued to invest in aftermarket and distribution initiatives as we focus on long-term growth in the business. 
Turning to margins. Third quarter adjusted gross margins decreased 350 basis points to 32.4% versus prior year and excluded $15.9 million of noncash charges related to our Latin American activity and realignment charges of $24.5 million. Reported gross margins were 28.1%, negatively impacted by increased underabsorption on lower volumes, the adjusted items and further challenged by shipments that reflected the pricing environment booked over the last 1.5 year. 
Adjusted operating margin of 11.7% excludes noncash Latin American charges, $79.1 million, $31.5 million of realignment and $2.6 million of SIHI charges, partially offset by realignment savings and lower compensation expense. 
Both gross and adjusted margins benefited in the quarter due to lower variable incentive compensation in the 2016 quarter as compared to a year ago. In total, we had over 100 basis point operating margin tailwind year-over-year during the third quarter as a result of this line item. On a year-to-date basis, however, a variable incentive comp is and is currently expected to remain a slight headwind to our results.
Our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 29.3% was slightly below our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%, due primarily to the jurisdictions where earnings occurred. 
Turning to our bookings. Constant currency original equipment bookings declined 11.4%, while our aftermarket franchise remained relatively stable, down 2.1% over the prior year, but still showed modest growth year-to-date. From a regional perspective, Europe and Latin America constant currency bookings increased 7.9% and 7%, respectively. north America was down 6.4%, while Asia Pacific and the Middle East and Africa were down in the midteens.
Shifting to our realignment program. We realized approximately $37 million of savings in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $80 million. With our continued progress this quarter, we remain on track to achieve our goal of incremental savings of approximately $100 million in 2016. 
We expensed $37 million in the third quarter related to these efforts, bringing the first 9 months 2016 total expense to approximately $70 million, and we continue to expect total program savings of $230 million at a total program cost of $400 million. We further expect total 2016 cost of $160 million.
We continue to strive for efficiency in our investments, and as we progress in our efforts, we will continue to assess individual projects within the program to adjust or replace initiatives within the framework to which we have been externally guiding. We continue to estimate total savings of $195 million in 2017, which is $70 million incremental to total 2016 program savings of $125 million. In 2018, the full annualized program savings are expected at $230 million.
Turning to cash flow. Through September 30, 2016, operating cash flow is down about $73 million versus a year ago, primarily due to decreased earnings, partially offset by working capital improvement. In the third quarter, we returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends, while our realignment program used approximately $30 million of cash. As many of you know, the fourth quarter typically accounts for a substantial portion of the year's operating cash flow and we expect to see similar trend to occur again in 2016.
Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our first 9 months 2016 results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we have updated our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance to $2.05 per share to $2.25 per share. Unexpected revenue declines of 11% to 14%, including a 2% currency headwind or roughly $0.10 per share of above-the-line impact. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the low- to mid-$60 million, a tax rate of 30% to 31% and reduced variable compensation expense.
As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of our 2015 SIHI acquisition and excludes realignment expenses. In addition, the Latin America noncash charges recorded in the third quarter, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration costs, below the line foreign currency effects, and the impact of other potential discrete items, are also excluded.
Moving on to cash uses for the year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures in the range of $105 million to $150 million, a significant reduction over elevated 2015 levels. Cash realignment expenditures are expected in the range of approximately $125 million to $150 million for the full year. We have $15 million in scheduled debt payments in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year debt reduction total to $60 million. We contributed $20 million to our fully funded U.S. pension plan through the first 9 months of the year, and we anticipate no further contributions in the fourth quarter. 
With that overview, let me turn the call back to Jay."

So it works somewhat in parallel as we work off that backlog, and that's primarily what you've seen in our bookings decline that those costs start coming out of the business. To your first question, I think the general comments were, you always plan for some inefficiencies when you're moving product. It's not like moving simple widget manufacturing. There's a lot of know-how. There's product movement. There's a lot of planning that goes into it. So there is going to be some slippage. And it's not insignificant, but you plan for it. In Furnace, and I think we've been very upfront, in the IPD segment, we've seen more than we anticipated. And what that does, is that impacts a couple of things. It'll impact results. it'll also impacts bookings as well because if the plant isn't operating efficiency, you can't book into it. So in my comments earlier, that's why I said Tom has taken over. So your question is what the answer? It's proven in the past, it's Tom. He assumed the responsibility for that and getting these things results, and I'm confident that he will. But clearly, the -- in general, the realignment is going as planned, but we've seen some impact beyond what we anticipated, not insignificant in the IPD segment, and we will fix it."

Just remember in 2013 and '14, factories weren't full in our industry. So you didn't have the kind of near the kind of '07, '08 time of pricing environment that you have -- you had at that point in time. But if you look at these custom engineered facilities, our industry is taking capacity out. So if what you'll see is that capacity that is reminding will become -- it'll become taxed quicker, but you need to start to see the pickup in the custom engineered in the large projects. And as I've talked about before and in my comment, you see some early FEED work that's being done. But as we've commented before, we don't anticipate that, that would come into our industry's bookings until the end of next year or 2018. Now when you look at the other parts of our business, and this is why we talk a lot about e-commerce, on-time delivering, a lot of pricing there is about being able to respond to the customer because these aren't large, highly competitively bid type projects. This is about getting the product that the customer needs to run as quickly as they can and making it easy to do business with them. So that's -- we see that as an opportunity. For example, I talked earlier about IPD. If we can respond and run respond quicker, you can get price. You cannot only get price but you can get volumes of that represents an opportunity for us. And then in the aftermarket business, I think we've commented. Everybody is looking at their OpEx budgets. We're, in this oil and gas, we're in the ninth quarter. So folks have gotten fairly focused on their OpEx budgets and continue to do that. But again, a lot of that is about being able to respond very, very quickly. So we've been pleased to see somewhat that there's been stability or reasonable fair stability in the pricing in aftermarket business. So the way I'd look at it is, the projects I think are going to remain competitive until you start seeing some more robust bidding activity. Keep in mind that the industry capacity will be less than it was in 2014. And as to the other ones, I think a lot of the pricing is in our hands."

That's one of the components to the book to bill. But it's fair to say you're right in what you've talked about. Where we've seen the primary bookings decline are in the larger projects. That also correlates to where we're taking a lot of our aggressive realignment actions to address that. So as we look into next year, it is going to be more of the short cycle and the aftermarket. And the things, as I look into next year, that are going to impact that is obviously, the work Tom is going to do in the IPD business because I'll will remind you, bookings in that business have not been insignificantly impacted with some of the challenges that it's had this year and particularly in over the last 2 quarters. And then, getting back to the earlier comment about where we are in terms of maintenance cycles that'll impact the aftermarket business where companies are on the OpEx budgets to do some small upgrades and efficiency repairs, which were sorely needed out in the industry right now. So if you think about our business, there are levers certainly we can pull, both from what I'd say a commercial sales standpoint around e-commerce, making easier to order our products, which customers want to do and they want to do quickly and they have -- we have fairly good pricing power to the operational improvements. So we'll have the market response in terms of the OpEx budgets. But we're -- the one thing with time in being in the down cycle is that brings you one day closer to when you start to move out of it. And we're pretty far into this. If you think about our industry had a relatively strong cycle for on and off, but for the most part on for about a 10-year period. We've been in a 2 plus year downturn in the industry. That's quite a while. And while that's not great from a retrospective standpoint, if you look forward, it does bring us closer to when this will start to abate and we'll move out of it. I think one thing I'll remind you, we've taken a conservative approach in our future in terms of our actions. We don't think pricing is going to go come back to '07, '08 levels. If it does, we're be all the better off for it."

You're worried about getting that piece of equipment under the process conditions that you need, spec to orders quickly as you can. Again, the plan to respond to you quickly. So I think the point is no. We actually anticipate pricing power because part of the issues when you're not delivering, you don't have any pricing power, and price correlates to your ability to deliver on time. So they make take your product with a longer lead time, but they're going to come in price reductions for it. When you can deliver quickly, you can come in at a higher price. So what I'd say is look over the next 2 quarters, have a lot of confidence in Tom. And from a pricing side, we actually think it will really start to FEED on itself in terms of price and volume once we can execute because we have very good products. It's just we're having trouble getting them to our customers and making them -- making is easy for them to do business with. And we got to fix that."

So can you maybe comment on that a bit? And is there a need for larger scale consolidation within the industry? Is it really to achieve more of a balance?"

As I think that what you comment on is we will have less footprint, 30% less facilities. And I'm confident that we would be able to execute on back -- any of the backlogs we've had in the last 5 to 10 years for the exact reason you've talked about. And that is we had a lot of under absorption in the most recent peak in our cycle in 2014. So we'll eliminate a lot of that. But then the comment earlier around sub manufacturing, our LPO/SPO, the ability to move work. Our focus on more highly engineered products. And what that does is that obviously gives you better disruption of the business. So I think that, as I look at our business of specifically in terms of what we've done over the last, particularly in the last 5 years, we will have less square feet and equal or more manufacturing capability and throughput capability in our business. In terms of industry consolidation, yes and no. All manufacturing is not equal. So you need to keep that in mind is that some of our facilities have the ability to manufacture certain or specific products. So when I think about our SIHI acquisition, that wasn't -- there was very little consolidation in that and it was more around adding product and product capably's to our portfolio. Now we can move some of their products into some of our facilities, which we've done. And by the way, we move some of our products into one of their facilities. So there is the opportunity to do that, but I'd caution you not to think of our capacity as ubiquitous. It's just a matter of square footage. We've got to have the know-how, the capabilities, the right machining, the right experience in those locations. Clearly, though, our efforts are going to make us much more efficient."

But generally, they're taking the capacity up. The industry knows how to rightsize itself. It's had plenty of time to do that. So I'm confident that the industry -- it's not going to be perfect on capacity. If anything, they'll be a little extra. But just keep in mind, we're one of the ones that are more capable about moving products around our facilities around the world. Just because 80% of your plants are full, doesn't me that 20% of them won't be under absorbed even in good times. Because I think it's readily remember to say not all capacity is equal. Our industry is responding by taking capacity out, particularly players like Flowserve tend to be on higher end products. There's -- they've rationalized that capacity. So I don't think there's going to be a big capacity overhang when we go into the next uptick."

Let me begin by reviewing some of the key headlines from the third quarter, which we will cover in greater detail as the call continues. First, on the positive side. We were pleased to achieve a book-to-bill g",1766,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reviewing some of the key headlines from the third quarter, which we will cover in greater detail as the call continues. 
First, on the positive side. We were pleased to achieve a book-to-bill greater than one for the first time in over a year. This is a particularly positive development, given that our customers continue to remain cautious and deliberate with their budgets and spending patterns. As a result of these bookings, our backlog grew modestly and higher margin aftermarket bookings now represent over 30% of our work under contract for the first time. 
We're also seeing some early signs of pre-FEED and FEED opportunities building in the pipeline. We're particularly pleased with the bookings resiliency and performance of our aftermarket franchise throughout 2016, producing modest constant currency bookings growth for the year. We continue to make significant progress on our ongoing realignment program, which will drive cost out of our platform and position Flowserve to enhanced profitability as a leaner and more efficient company.
Finally, while our third quarter earnings were lower than expected, the company continues to be well-positioned, and we are actively pursuing opportunities for further improvement as we execute on our cost reduction initiatives and long-term strategic growth opportunities.
With regard to market and company-specific challenges this quarter, we continue to experience challenging global macro conditions and as I noted earlier, our customers have remained cautious and deliberate in their investment decisions. Reflecting this environment, project delays, rolling maintenance deferrals and extended timelines for both order placement and delivery acceptance have become the norm. 
We were particularly surprised in September with the slow pace of industrial short cycle and aftermarket revenues. But the good news is these orders remain largely in backlog, and we expect to deliver on them in future periods.
There is also additional political uncertainty in many regions around the world, including the United States. We continue to see some operational and cost issues in our receiving sites as we shift manufacturing and implement our structural realignment program. However, we are actively addressing these issues. 
While we are pleased with the progress in our aftermarket bookings, the lower backlog associated with our OE facilities will increase under absorption in the short run, which occurs faster than we can realign or take costs out. As we execute and complete our realignment plans, our new cost structure should catch up to the current workload and alleviate this timing issue and position Flowserve when the cycle improves.
Finally, we incurred some significant noncash reserves during the quarter related to Latin America. As we have previously discussed, this region has been and remains challenged. While we have collected about $5.5 million year-to-date and will continue to actively pursue collections on these accounts, which are not in dispute, we believe that fully reserving for certain receivables balances and work in process is the most prudent course of action.
On an adjusted basis, EPS this quarter was $0.52. And while we indicated on our last call that we expected this quarter to be light due to the timing of shipments, given the magnitude of this impact, along with the continuation of challenging market conditions, we are revising our full year guidance. Karyn will cover our financials in more detail, but operationally, we will continue to focus on a disciplined approach, cost management, and improving our efficiency across the business, and addressing all of these with a sense of urgency.
Despite the challenges this quarter, it is important to note that we have successfully navigated previous cycles and are actively leveraging this experience as we manage our business through the current market environment. Further, I am confident that our current strategic direction and ongoing cost reduction initiatives will position Flowserve competitively for the eventual recovery in our energy end markets. 
Our primary near-term challenge remains transforming our manufacturing platform quickly enough to reduce under absorption while enhancing our operational flexibility to meet customer expectations, a better value for their investment dollar. This situation particularly impacts EPD and IPD in the near term as pumped OE backlog continued to decline during the period. 
With the recent operating issues in financial performance in our IPD segment, I have asked Tom Pajonas to assume interim leadership of the segment's day-to-day operations. Tom was instrumental in turning FCD into the stronger performer it is today, and I am confident he will drive the necessary actions and accountabilities to improve the business. 
Key initiatives include: accelerating the pace in execution of the realignment program and embedding sustainable process improvements to drive differentiated value for our customers, such as reduced lead times, automated order process through e-commerce, enhanced supply chain management and improving on-time deliveries. 
Ultimately, we are driving towards an operating platform and culture in IPD similar to that of our FCD segment. I have complete confidence Tom will improve IPD's performance with time.
Next, I'd like to update you on the significant progress we are making as we execute our realignment program. Though we continue to have some operational issues in some of our receiving sites, we are continuing to focus on the structural transformation of our business platform. 
During the third quarter, we initiated actions to close 2 additional manufacturing facilities, including an Australian IPD facility, which will be consolidated into another Flowserve site in that country. And we are transferring EPD's Lawrence operations based in Massachusetts to other U.S. and Latin American facilities. During the fourth quarter, we plan to address additional manufacturing sites, including recently announced initiatives to close a German manufacturing facility and the consolidation of Middle East QRCs.
We continue to expect about $160 million in charges for the year. From a savings perspective, we delivered approximately $37 million in the third quarter, $80 million year-to-date, and importantly, we remain on track to deliver $100 million of incremental savings for the full year of 2016.
While we identify most realignment costs incurred for your analysis, I'll remind you that our reported and adjusted numbers do not include the expected negative impact on revenues and profits that have been delayed during the transition, which should materialize as the receiving sites come up to speed on the new lines. We are improving our manufacturing transitions with dedicated resources and teams to minimize bottlenecks and implement processes to apply lessons learned from completed actions as we continued to execute on our realignment program.
Turning to our markets and bookings within our served industries. Overall, we believe the relative stability of oil around the $45 to $50 range over the past 6 months has been a positive development for many of our customers. Nevertheless, we still anticipate that our customers will remain cautious with their capital and operating budgets in the near term. Considering the multiyear nature of infrastructure, original equipment investments, it will likely require several quarters of this level of stability before investment spending actively resumes, and we expect the opportunities that arise will be competitive.
Overall for the quarter, constant currency bookings declined approximately 7%, primarily due to an OE bookings decline of approximately 11%. As expected, aftermarket bookings continued to demonstrate resiliency, but did decline approximately 2% this quarter. 
While aftermarket bookings have increased constant currency year-to-date, third quarter aftermarket sales saw a sharp drop off sequentially during the quarter. We believe this is just a timing issue as it is rare for aftermarket orders to cancel and was mainly because our first half 2016 bookings included a few upgrade projects that will not ship until 2017. 
Additionally, some customers have been slow to accept shipment, but we do continue to see elevated levels of emergency response aftermarket opportunities. While pricing pressure has been a significant issue on larger CapEx-driven Greenfield and Brownfield projects, we are pleased that we've maintained fairly consistent pricing levels in our aftermarket bookings.
Turning now to specific end markets and looking at bookings on a constant currency basis, coming off a low base. Bookings in our largest served market, oil and gas, increased 10% in the quarter. European orders and an ebulator job for Asia were key drivers of this growth. 
While we were pleased with this improved level of bookings, we're certainly not calling a bottom yet. However, we do view our downstream and midstream focus as a long-term asset for the company. 
Power bookings decreased approximately 21% on a tough prior year compare. Going forward, we expect steady combined cycle investment in North America and fossil projects in Asia, which tend to be very competitive. China continues to invest in nuclear, where we participate in both the Western and Chinese designs. 
In our general industries, constant currency bookings decreased approximately 4%. The distribution channel remained depressed in the quarter. While we continue to believe destocking across many of our distributors is largely complete, distributors overall are maintaining lower inventory levels, placing smaller orders, often only when they have a customer order in hand. So quick response time will be a priority for us.
Chemical bookings were down 18% in the quarter, with low levels of new project releases. We continued to see delays in the expected ethylene driven derivative plants as well as the second wave of crackers. We expect this development to progress in North America and the Middle East, supported by low-cost feedstock.
To summarize the quarter, we remain focused on rapidly transforming our cost structure for these uncertain markets, while positioning Flowserve for enhanced growth and profitability. We've seen cycles before and fully expect our markets will recover. Importantly, we are confident that our investments to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of our global operating platform will lead us through current challenges and enhance the value that Flowserve can deliver to our customers and shareholders. 
Finishing up on a personal note. As most of you know, about a month ago, we announced my intention to retire from the company at the end of March 2017. After over a decade at Flowserve, and as the company begins its next phase of growth and development, now is the right time for the company and me to begin this transition process. I am confident that Flowserve has the right strategic plans and the right team in place to achieve our objectives.
Flowserve is a great company with a solid operating and financial foundation and is on the right path forward. Importantly, until the Board names my successor, it remains business as usual, and I remain fully committed to the success of the company, our employees and shareholders. 
With that's, let me turn the call over to Karyn."

Turning to our 2016 third quarter financials. As Mark noted, our operating results were primarily impacted by the continued challenging market environment and various associated factors, including Latin America",1053,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our 2016 third quarter financials. As Mark noted, our operating results were primarily impacted by the continued challenging market environment and various associated factors, including Latin America, our realignment initiatives and our performance of the OE business, which I will detail.
Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.52 excludes $0.47 of noncash charges related to Latin American activity, including a $63.2 million charge to reserve certain undisputed accounts receivable, which we will continue to pursue, and a $15.9 million charge to reserve for inventory exposures in the region. Additionally, adjustments include $0.21 per share of realignment expense, $0.01 associated with SIHI purchase price adjustments and integration charges and a gain of $0.01 on below-the-line FX.
Reported loss per share for the quarter was $0.16, which included an above-the-line negative currency translation headwind of approximately $0.02 in both reported and adjusted EPS. Q3 revenues of $943 million decreased 14% or 12.1% constant currency. Year-to-date, Flowserve's constant currency revenues decreased 8.2% compared to 2015 levels. Regionally, and on a constant currency basis, North America was roughly flat, while the Middle East and Africa, Europe and Asia Pac were down low to mid-teens. Latin America remains our most challenged region with a decline of nearly 39%. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses declined 10% in the third quarter, but remained elevated as a percentage of sales due primarily to the decline of revenues and the timing of expected realignment savings from our ongoing realignment program and our paced approach to SIHI cost reduction. Additionally, we have continued to invest in aftermarket and distribution initiatives as we focus on long-term growth in the business. 
Turning to margins. Third quarter adjusted gross margins decreased 350 basis points to 32.4% versus prior year and excluded $15.9 million of noncash charges related to our Latin American activity and realignment charges of $24.5 million. Reported gross margins were 28.1%, negatively impacted by increased underabsorption on lower volumes, the adjusted items and further challenged by shipments that reflected the pricing environment booked over the last 1.5 year. 
Adjusted operating margin of 11.7% excludes noncash Latin American charges, $79.1 million, $31.5 million of realignment and $2.6 million of SIHI charges, partially offset by realignment savings and lower compensation expense. 
Both gross and adjusted margins benefited in the quarter due to lower variable incentive compensation in the 2016 quarter as compared to a year ago. In total, we had over 100 basis point operating margin tailwind year-over-year during the third quarter as a result of this line item. On a year-to-date basis, however, variable incentive comp is and is currently expected to remain a slight headwind to our results.
Our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 29.3% was slightly below our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%, due primarily to the jurisdictions where earnings occurred. 
Turning to our bookings. Constant currency original equipment bookings declined 11.4%, while our aftermarket franchise remained relatively stable, down 2.1% over the prior year, but still showed modest growth year-to-date. From a regional perspective, Europe and Latin America constant currency bookings increased 7.9% and 7%, respectively. north America was down 6.4%, while Asia Pacific and the Middle East and Africa were down in the mid-teens.
Shifting to our realignment program. We realized approximately $37 million of savings in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $80 million. With our continued progress this quarter, we remain on track to achieve our goal of incremental savings of approximately $100 million in 2016. 
We expensed $37 million in the third quarter related to these efforts, bringing the first 9 months 2016 total expense to approximately $70 million, and we continue to expect total program savings of $230 million at a total program cost of $400 million. We further expect total 2016 cost of $160 million.
We continue to strive for efficiency in our investments, and as we progress in our efforts, we will continue to assess individual projects within the program to adjust or replace initiatives within the framework to which we have been externally guiding. We continue to estimate total savings of $195 million in 2017, which is $70 million incremental to total 2016 program savings of $125 million. In 2018, the full annualized program savings are expected at $230 million.
Turning to cash flow. Through September 30, 2016, operating cash flow is down about $73 million versus a year ago, primarily due to decreased earnings, partially offset by working capital improvement. In the third quarter, we returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends, while our realignment program used approximately $30 million of cash. As many of you know, the fourth quarter typically accounts for a substantial portion of the year's operating cash flow and we expect to see similar trend to occur again in 2016.
Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our first 9 months 2016 results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we have updated our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance to $2.05 per share to $2.25 per share. Unexpected revenue declines of 11% to 14%, including a 2% currency headwind or roughly $0.10 per share of above-the-line impact. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the low- to mid-$60 million, a tax rate of 30% to 31% and reduced variable compensation expense.
As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of our 2015 SIHI acquisition and excludes realignment expenses. In addition, the Latin America noncash charges recorded in the third quarter, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration costs, below the line foreign currency effects, and the impact of other potential discrete items, are also excluded.
Moving on to cash uses for the year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures in the range of $105 million to $150 million, a significant reduction over elevated 2015 levels. Cash realignment expenditures are expected in the range of approximately $125 million to $150 million for the full year. We have $15 million in scheduled debt payments in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year debt reduction total to $60 million. We contributed $20 million to our fully funded U.S. pension plan through the first 9 months of the year, and we anticipate no further contributions in the fourth quarter. 
With that overview, let me turn the call back to Jay."

First, you talked about accelerating some of the efforts that are going on there. And I guess, my question really is, there's currently some inefficiencies going on with the realignment and moving factories from one place to another. Is there -- does accelerating this program in your mind, increase the operational risk? Or what are you doing to mitigate that? And I guess, my second question related to that would be you talked about the absorption, the realignment savings not really overtaking the absorption right now. Is there a time you can provide us when you think kind of ballpark, when you think that switchover might happen where you kind of -- and I know it depends on the volumes, obviously, as you go into '17. But maybe some idea, in your mind, of when you kind of get that crossover threshold to where you're making up to the absorption on the overall volumes."

And those are also the ones that take time to effect the realignment. Primarily, Charley, because you have backlog that you need to work off. You need to carefully transfer those product because they're very highly engineered. there's A whole skill set that needs to move. A lot of capabilities. So we anticipate a lot of those benefits from the custom engineered to come through next year. And this was anticipated at all times as we worked off the backlog. So we expect that efficiency to start to work its way through in 2017. And that will help offset because a lot of the backlog decrease that you're seeing is in these large projects. So it works somewhat in parallel as we work off that backlog, and that's primarily what you've seen in our bookings decline that those costs start coming out of the business. To your first question, I think the general comments were, you always plan for some inefficiencies when you're moving product. It's not like moving simple widget manufacturing. There's a lot of know-how. There's product movement. There's a lot of planning that goes into it. So there is going to be some slippage. And it's not insignificant, but you plan for it. In fairness, and I think we've been very upfront, in the IPD segment, we've seen more than we anticipated. And what that does, is that impacts a couple of things. It'll impact results. it'll also impact bookings as well, because if a plant isn't operating efficiently, you can't book into it. So in my comments earlier, that's why I said Tom has taken over. So your question is what's the answer? And it's proven in the past, it's Tom. He's assumed the responsibility for that in getting these things resolved, and I'm confident that he will. But clearly, the -- in general, the realignment is going as planned, but we've seen some impact beyond what we anticipated, not insignificant in the IPD segment, and we will fix it."

And just remember, in 2013 and '14, factories weren't full in our industry. So you didn't have the kind of -- near the kind of '07, '08 time of pricing environment that you have -- you had at that point in time. But if you look at these custom engineered facilities, our industry is taking capacity out. So if what you'll see is that capacity that is remaining will become -- it'll become taxed quicker, but you need to start to see the pickup in the custom engineered in the large projects. And as I've talked about before and in my comment, you see some early FEED work that's being done. But as we've commented before, we don't anticipate that, that would come into our industry's bookings until the end of next year or 2018. Now when you look at the other parts of our business, and this is why we talk a lot about e-commerce, on-time delivering, a lot of pricing there is about being able to respond to the customer because these aren't large, highly-competitively bid type projects. This is about getting the product that the customer needs to them as quickly as they can and making it easy to do business with them. And so that's -- we see that as an opportunity. For example, I talked earlier about IPD. If we can respond and respond quicker, you can get price. You can not only get price, but you can get volume. So that represents an opportunity for us. And then, in the aftermarket business, I think we've commented. Everybody is looking at their OpEx budgets. We're, in this oil and gas, we're in the ninth quarter. So folks have gotten fairly focused on their OpEx budgets and continue to do that. But again, a lot of that is about being able to respond very, very quickly. So we've been pleased to see somewhat that there's been stability or reasonable fair stability in the pricing in the aftermarket business. So the way I'd look at it is, the projects I think are going to remain competitive until you start seeing some more robust bidding activity. Keep in mind that the industry capacity will be less than it was in 2014. And as to the other ones, I think a lot of the pricing is in our hands."

In that, you're also seeing the mix of aftermarket run rate become a higher mix. Aftermarket backlog represented 30% plus for the first time really ever in our business. Also, as you look forward, I mean, the -- you talked about the IPD getting to work on that. There is good opportunity there. Just look at its historical performance, SIHI is a good business.

So if you think about our business, there are levers certainly we can pull, both from what I'd say a commercial sales standpoint around e-commerce, making it easier to order our products, which customers want to do and they want to do quickly and they have -- we have fairly good pricing power to the operational improvements. So we'll have the market response in terms of the OpEx budgets. But we're -- the one thing with time in being in the down cycle is that brings you one day closer to when you start to move out of it. And we're pretty far into this. If you think about our industry had a relatively strong cycle for on and off, but for the most part on for about a 10-year period. We've been in a 2-plus-year downturn in the industry. That's quite a while. And while that's not great from a retrospective standpoint, if you look forward, it does bring us closer to when this will start to abate and we'll move out of it. I think one thing I'll remind you, we've taken a conservative approach on our future in terms of our actions. We don't think pricing is going to come back to '07, '08 levels. If it does, we'll be all the better off for it."

How can we drive our realignment efforts that are on the table in the other areas as well, improvement in our business, particularly in the IPD business, continue looks for efficiency. And then, just dealing with inflation and that all companies deal with in the variable comp, how we said it. Probably a good high-level way of thinking of it.

On pricing pressure, no, because that is about taking care of your customer. If you think about a $1,500 pump, a $8,000 pump, a $10,000 pump, particularly a $1,500 one you order online, you're not worried about 5%, 10%. You're worried about getting that piece of equipment under the process conditions that you need, spec to order as quickly as you can, by getting the plant to respond to you quickly. And so I think the point is no. We actually anticipate pricing power because part of the issue is, when you're not delivering, you don't have any pricing power, and price correlates to your ability to deliver on time. So they may take your product with a longer lead time, but they're going to command price reductions for it. When you can deliver quickly, you can command a higher price. So what I'd say is, look over the next 2 quarters. Have a lot of confidence in Tom. And from the pricing side, we actually think it will really start to feed on itself in terms of price and volume once we can execute because we have very good products. It's just, we're having trouble getting them to our customers and making them -- making us easy for them to do business with, and we've got to fix that."

So don't think about these products, especially some of the more highly engineered, are going to necessarily just be picked up by local Chinese suppliers, where we've traditionally seen Chinese competition are on the lower end products. But one of our key strategies is to develop capabilities like in the China power business, because we're well aware that not only are those Chinese EPCs going to serve their local markets, but they're going to regions like Africa, and we want to go with them. I'm trying to think -- oh, your comment around additive manufacturing. Yes, in terms of some sub-manufacturing, a lot of our LPO, SPO strategy is designed to have that internal capability, and as part of the realignment, we're moving some of that manufacturing, base manufacturing, out to our supply base as is our industry.

But in general, what you saw was typically, you expect July and August to be somewhat slower with you have Ramadan in the Middle East. You have vacations in Europe. Vacations even in the United States, it tends to be a little bit slower in pick up. We just -- we started out slower than originally anticipated in July and August, but just didn't see the ramp-up in September. So my comment is more general around the quarter. And I think you've heard that from our industry. I just wanted to provide you our color on it. If you look at specific bookings, we did have an ebulator, not huge, but an ebulator opportunity booking that came in. So there's going to be a lot of moving parts. But in general, my commentary around the month of December -- September was, excuse me, was that we just didn't see the ramp-up that we normally saw in the month of September. But also, as you think about September, there was a lot of uncertainty in the market then. So you look back and you go, ""Yes, I guess, that wasn't really a surprise."" But we just didn't see the ramp-up."

And what you saw with our relationship with Honeywell, you've seen them with other providers before, is part of the value chain in terms of how we deliver that capability to the customers. But keep in mind, lot of the predictive algorithms and everything come from the product manufacturer because they know the product, they know the process conditions, they know the hydraulics, they're the ones that can actually make the machine smart.

And I'm confident that we would be able to execute on back -- any of the backlogs we've had in the last 5 to 10 years for the exact reason you've talked about. And that is we had a lot of under absorption in the most recent peak in our cycle in 2014. So we'll eliminate a lot of that. But then the comment earlier around sub manufacturing, our LPO/SPO, the ability to move work. Our focus on more highly engineered products. And what that does is that obviously gives you better absorption in the business. So I think that, as I look at our business, specifically in terms of what we've done over the last, particularly in the last 5 years, we will have less square feet and equal or more manufacturing capability and throughput capability in our business. In terms of industry consolidation, yes and no. All manufacturing is not equal. So you need to keep that in mind is that some of our facilities have the ability to manufacture certain or specific products. So when I think about our SIHI acquisition, that wasn't -- there was very little consolidation in that and it was more around adding product and product capabilities to our portfolio. Now you can move some of their products into some of our facilities, which we've done. And by the way, we move some of our products into one of their facilities. So there is the opportunity to do that, but I'd caution you not to think of our capacity as ubiquitous. And it's just a matter of square footage. You've got to have the know-how, the capabilities, the right machining, the right experience in those locations. Clearly, though, our efforts are going to make us much more efficient."

It's had plenty of time to do that. So I'm confident that the industry -- it's not going to be perfect on capacity. If anything, there'll be a little extra. But just keep in mind, we're one of the ones that are more capable about moving products around our facilities around the world. Just because 80% of your plants are full, doesn't mean that 20% of them won't be under-absorbed even in good times. So I think it's -- probably remember to say not all capacity is equal. Our industry is responding by taking capacity out, particularly players like Flowserve that tend to be on higher end products. There's -- they've rationalized that capacity. So I don't think there's going to be a big capacity overhang when we go into the next uptick."

Let me begin by reviewing some of the key headlines from the third quarter, which we will cover in greater detail as the call continues. First, on the positive side. We were pleased to achieve a book-to-bill g",1767,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reviewing some of the key headlines from the third quarter, which we will cover in greater detail as the call continues. 
First, on the positive side. We were pleased to achieve a book-to-bill greater than one for the first time in over a year. This is a particularly positive development, given that our customers continue to remain cautious and deliberate with their budgets and spending patterns. As a result of these bookings, our backlog grew modestly and higher margin aftermarket bookings now represent over 30% of our work under contract for the first time. 
We're also seeing some early signs of pre-FEED and FEED opportunities building in the pipeline. We're particularly pleased with the bookings resiliency and performance of our aftermarket franchise throughout 2016, producing modest constant currency bookings growth for the year. We continue to make significant progress on our ongoing realignment program, which will drive cost out of our platform and position Flowserve to enhanced profitability as a leaner and more efficient company.
Finally, while our third quarter earnings were lower than expected, the company continues to be well-positioned, and we are actively pursuing opportunities for further improvement as we execute on our cost reduction initiatives and long-term strategic growth opportunities.
With regard to market and company-specific challenges this quarter, we continue to experience challenging global macro conditions and as I noted earlier, our customers have remained cautious and deliberate in their investment decisions. Reflecting this environment, project delays, rolling maintenance deferrals and extended timelines for both order placement and delivery acceptance have become the norm. 
We were particularly surprised in September with the slow pace of industrial short cycle and aftermarket revenues. But the good news is these orders remain largely in backlog, and we expect to deliver on them in future periods.
There is also additional political uncertainty in many regions around the world, including the United States. We continue to see some operational and cost issues in our receiving sites as we shift manufacturing and implement our structural realignment program. However, we are actively addressing these issues. 
While we are pleased with the progress in our aftermarket bookings, the lower backlog associated with our OE facilities will increase under absorption in the short run, which occurs faster than we can realign or take costs out. As we execute and complete our realignment plans, our new cost structure should catch up to the current workload and alleviate this timing issue and position Flowserve when the cycle improves.
Finally, we incurred some significant noncash reserves during the quarter related to Latin America. As we have previously discussed, this region has been and remains challenged. While we have collected about $5.5 million year-to-date and will continue to actively pursue collections on these accounts, which are not in dispute, we believe that fully reserving for certain receivables balances and work in process is the most prudent course of action.
On an adjusted basis, EPS this quarter was $0.52. And while we indicated on our last call that we expected this quarter to be light due to the timing of shipments, given the magnitude of this impact, along with the continuation of challenging market conditions, we are revising our full year guidance. Karyn will cover our financials in more detail, but operationally, we will continue to focus on a disciplined approach, cost management, and improving our efficiency across the business, and addressing all of these with a sense of urgency.
Despite the challenges this quarter, it is important to note that we have successfully navigated previous cycles and are actively leveraging this experience as we manage our business through the current market environment. Further, I am confident that our current strategic direction and ongoing cost reduction initiatives will position Flowserve competitively for the eventual recovery in our energy end markets. 
Our primary near-term challenge remains transforming our manufacturing platform quickly enough to reduce under absorption while enhancing our operational flexibility to meet customer expectations, a better value for their investment dollar. This situation particularly impacts EPD and IPD in the near term as pumped OE backlog continued to decline during the period. 
With the recent operating issues in financial performance in our IPD segment, I have asked Tom Pajonas to assume interim leadership of the segment's day-to-day operations. Tom was instrumental in turning FCD into the stronger performer it is today, and I am confident he will drive the necessary actions and accountabilities to improve the business. 
Key initiatives include: accelerating the pace in execution of the realignment program and embedding sustainable process improvements to drive differentiated value for our customers, such as reduced lead times, automated order process through e-commerce, enhanced supply chain management and improving on-time deliveries. 
Ultimately, we are driving towards an operating platform and culture in IPD similar to that of our FCD segment. I have complete confidence Tom will improve IPD's performance with time.
Next, I'd like to update you on the significant progress we are making as we execute our realignment program. Though we continue to have some operational issues in some of our receiving sites, we are continuing to focus on the structural transformation of our business platform. 
During the third quarter, we initiated actions to close 2 additional manufacturing facilities, including an Australian IPD facility, which will be consolidated into another Flowserve site in that country. And we are transferring EPD's Lawrence operations based in Massachusetts to other U.S. and Latin American facilities. During the fourth quarter, we plan to address additional manufacturing sites, including recently announced initiatives to close a German manufacturing facility and the consolidation of Middle East QRCs.
We continue to expect about $160 million in charges for the year. From a savings perspective, we delivered approximately $37 million in the third quarter, $80 million year-to-date, and importantly, we remain on track to deliver $100 million of incremental savings for the full year of 2016.
While we identify most realignment costs incurred for your analysis, I'll remind you that our reported and adjusted numbers do not include the expected negative impact on revenues and profits that have been delayed during the transition, which should materialize as the receiving sites come up to speed on the new lines. We are improving our manufacturing transitions with dedicated resources and teams to minimize bottlenecks and implement processes to apply lessons learned from completed actions as we continued to execute on our realignment program.
Turning to our markets and bookings within our served industries. Overall, we believe the relative stability of oil around the $45 to $50 range over the past 6 months has been a positive development for many of our customers. Nevertheless, we still anticipate that our customers will remain cautious with their capital and operating budgets in the near term. Considering the multiyear nature of infrastructure, original equipment investments, it will likely require several quarters of this level of stability before investment spending actively resumes, and we expect the opportunities that arise will be competitive.
Overall for the quarter, constant currency bookings declined approximately 7%, primarily due to an OE bookings decline of approximately 11%. As expected, aftermarket bookings continued to demonstrate resiliency, but did decline approximately 2% this quarter. 
While aftermarket bookings have increased constant currency year-to-date, third quarter aftermarket sales saw a sharp drop off sequentially during the quarter. We believe this is just a timing issue as it is rare for aftermarket orders to cancel and was mainly because our first half 2016 bookings included a few upgrade projects that will not ship until 2017. 
Additionally, some customers have been slow to accept shipment, but we do continue to see elevated levels of emergency response aftermarket opportunities. While pricing pressure has been a significant issue on larger CapEx-driven Greenfield and Brownfield projects, we are pleased that we've maintained fairly consistent pricing levels in our aftermarket bookings.
Turning now to specific end markets and looking at bookings on a constant currency basis, coming off a low base. Bookings in our largest served market, oil and gas, increased 10% in the quarter. European orders and an ebulator job for Asia were key drivers of this growth. 
While we were pleased with this improved level of bookings, we're certainly not calling a bottom yet. However, we do view our downstream and midstream focus as a long-term asset for the company. 
Power bookings decreased approximately 21% on a tough prior year compare. Going forward, we expect steady combined cycle investment in North America and fossil projects in Asia, which tend to be very competitive. China continues to invest in nuclear, where we participate in both the Western and Chinese designs. 
In our general industries, constant currency bookings decreased approximately 4%. The distribution channel remained depressed in the quarter. While we continue to believe destocking across many of our distributors is largely complete, distributors overall are maintaining lower inventory levels, placing smaller orders, often only when they have a customer order in hand. So quick response time will be a priority for us.
Chemical bookings were down 18% in the quarter, with low levels of new project releases. We continued to see delays in the expected ethylene driven derivative plants as well as the second wave of crackers. But we expect this development to progress in North America and the Middle East, supported by low-cost feedstock.
To summarize the quarter, we remain focused on rapidly transforming our cost structure for these uncertain markets, while positioning Flowserve for enhanced growth and profitability. We've seen cycles before and fully expect our markets will recover. Importantly, we are confident that our investments to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of our global operating platform will lead us through current challenges and enhance the value that Flowserve can deliver to our customers and shareholders. 
Finishing up on a personal note. As most of you know, about a month ago, we announced my intention to retire from the company at the end of March 2017. After over a decade at Flowserve, and as the company begins its next phase of growth and development, now is the right time for the company and me to begin this transition process. I am confident that Flowserve has the right strategic plans and the right team in place to achieve our objectives.
Flowserve is a great company with a solid operating and financial foundation and is on the right path forward. Importantly, until the Board names my successor, it remains business as usual, and I remain fully committed to the success of the company, our employees and shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Karyn."
267555,405158530,1066139,"Flowserve Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Flowserve Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our 2016 third quarter financials. As Mark noted, our operating results were primarily impacted by the continued challenging market environment and various associated factors, including Latin America",1054,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our 2016 third quarter financials. As Mark noted, our operating results were primarily impacted by the continued challenging market environment and various associated factors, including Latin America, our realignment initiatives and our performance of the OE business, which I will detail.
Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.52 excludes $0.47 of noncash charges related to Latin American activity, including a $63.2 million charge to reserve certain undisputed accounts receivable, which we will continue to pursue, and a $15.9 million charge to reserve for inventory exposures in the region. Additionally, adjustments include $0.21 per share of realignment expense, $0.01 associated with SIHI purchase price adjustments and integration charges and a gain of $0.01 on below-the-line FX.
Reported loss per share for the quarter was $0.16, which included an above-the-line negative currency translation headwind of approximately $0.02 in both reported and adjusted EPS. Q3 revenues of $943 million decreased 14% or 12.1% constant currency. Year-to-date, Flowserve's constant currency revenues decreased 8.2% compared to 2015 levels. Regionally, and on a constant currency basis, North America was roughly flat, while the Middle East and Africa, Europe and Asia Pac were down low to mid-teens. Latin America remains our most challenged region with a decline of nearly 39%. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses declined 10% in the third quarter, but remained elevated as a percent of sales due primarily to the decline in revenues and the timing of expected realignment savings from our ongoing realignment program and our paced approach to SIHI cost reduction. Additionally, we have continued to invest in aftermarket and distribution initiatives as we focus on long-term growth in the business. 
Turning to margins. Third quarter adjusted gross margins decreased 350 basis points to 32.4% versus prior year and excluded $15.9 million of noncash charges related to our Latin American activity and realignment charges of $24.5 million. Reported gross margins were 28.1%, negatively impacted by increased underabsorption on lower volumes, the adjusted items and further challenged by shipments that reflected the pricing environment booked over the last 1.5 year. 
Adjusted operating margin of 11.7% excludes noncash Latin American charges, $79.1 million, $31.5 million of realignment and $2.6 million of SIHI charges, partially offset by realignment savings and lower compensation expense. 
Both gross and adjusted margins benefited in the quarter due to lower variable incentive compensation in the 2016 quarter as compared to a year ago. In total, we had over 100 basis point operating margin tailwind year-over-year during the third quarter as a result of this line item. On a year-to-date basis, however, variable incentive comp is and is currently expected to remain a slight headwind to our results.
Our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 29.3% was slightly below our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%, due primarily to the jurisdictions where earnings occurred. 
Turning to our bookings. Constant currency original equipment bookings declined 11.4%, while our aftermarket franchise remained relatively stable, down 2.1% over the prior year, but still showed modest growth year-to-date. From a regional perspective, Europe and Latin America constant currency bookings increased 7.9% and 7%, respectively. North America was down 6.4%, while Asia Pacific and the Middle East and Africa were down in the mid-teens.
Shifting to our realignment program. We realized approximately $37 million of savings in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $80 million. With our continued progress this quarter, we remain on track to achieve our goal of incremental savings of approximately $100 million in 2016. 
We expensed $37 million in the third quarter related to these efforts, bringing the first 9 months 2016 total expense to approximately $70 million, and we continue to expect total program savings of $230 million at a total program cost of $400 million. We further expect total 2016 cost of $160 million.
We continue to strive for efficiency in our investments, and as we progress in our efforts, we will continue to assess individual projects within the program to adjust or replace initiatives within the framework to which we have been externally guiding. We continue to estimate total savings of $195 million in 2017, which is $70 million incremental to total 2016 program savings of $125 million. In 2018, the full annualized program savings are expected at $230 million.
Turning to cash flow. Through September 30, 2016, operating cash flow is down about $73 million versus a year ago, primarily due to decreased earnings, partially offset by working capital improvement. In the third quarter, we returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends, while our realignment program used approximately $30 million of cash. As many of you know, the fourth quarter typically accounts for a substantial portion of the year's operating cash flow and we expect to see similar trend to occur again in 2016.
Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our first 9 months 2016 results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we have updated our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance to $2.05 per share to $2.25 per share. Unexpected revenue declines of 11% to 14%, including a 2% currency headwind or roughly $0.10 per share of above-the-line impact. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the low- to mid-$60 million range, a tax rate of 30% to 31% and reduced variable compensation expense.
As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of our 2015 SIHI acquisition and excludes realignment expenses. In addition, the Latin America noncash charges recorded in the third quarter, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration costs, below the line foreign currency effects, and the impact of other potential discrete items, are also excluded.
Moving on to cash uses for the year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures in the range of $105 million to $150 million, a significant reduction over elevated 2015 levels. Cash realignment expenditures are expected in the range of approximately $125 million to $150 million for the full year. We have $15 million in scheduled debt payments in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year debt reduction total to $60 million. We contributed $20 million to our fully funded U.S. pension plan through the first 9 months of the year, and we anticipate no further contributions in the fourth quarter. 
With that overview, let me turn the call back to Jay."

First, you talked about accelerating some of the efforts that are going on there. And I guess, my question really is, there's currently some inefficiencies going on with the realignment and moving factories from one place to another. Is there -- does accelerating this program in your mind, increase the operational risk? Or what are you doing to mitigate that? And I guess, my second question related to that would be you talked about the absorption, the realignment savings not really overtaking the absorption right now. Is there a time you can provide us when you think kind of ballpark, when you think that switchover might happen where you kind of -- and I know it depends on the volumes, obviously, as you go into '17. But maybe some idea, in your mind, of when you kind of get that crossover threshold to where you're making up for the absorption on the overall volumes."

And those are also the ones that take time to effect the realignment. Primarily, Charley, because you have backlog that you need to work off. You need to carefully transfer those product because they're very highly engineered. There's a whole skill set that needs to move. A lot of capabilities. So we anticipate a lot of those benefits from the custom engineered to come through next year. And this was anticipated at all times as we worked off the backlog. So we expect that deficiency to start to work its way through in 2017. And that will help offset -- because a lot of the backlog decrease that you're seeing is in these large projects. So it works somewhat in parallel as we work off that backlog, and that's primarily what you've seen in our bookings decline that those costs start coming out of the business. To your first question, I think the general comments were, you always plan for some inefficiencies when you're moving product. It's not like moving simple widget manufacturing. There's a lot of know-how. There's product movement. There's a lot of planning that goes into it. So there is going to be some slippage. And it's not insignificant, but you plan for it. In fairness, and I think we've been very upfront, in the IPD segment, we've seen more than we anticipated. And what that does, is that impacts a couple of things. It'll impact results. It'll also impact bookings as well, because if a plant isn't operating efficiently, you can't book into it. So in my comments earlier, that's why I said Tom has taken over. So your question is what's the answer? And it's proven in the past, it's Tom. He's assumed the responsibility for that in getting these things resolved, and I'm confident that he will. But clearly, the -- in general, the realignment is going as planned, but we've seen some impact beyond what we anticipated, not insignificant in the IPD segment, and we will fix it."

And just remember, in 2013 and '14, factories weren't full in our industry. So you didn't have the kind of -- near the kind of '07, '08 time of pricing environment that you have -- you had at that point in time. But if you look at these custom engineered facilities, our industry is taking capacity out. So if what you'll see is that capacity that is remaining will become -- it'll become taxed quicker, but you need to start to see the pickup in the custom engineered in the large projects. And as I've talked about before and in my comment, you see some early FEED work that's being done. But as we've commented before, we don't anticipate that, that would come into our industry's bookings until the end of next year or 2018. Now when you look at the other parts of our business, and this is why we talk a lot about e-commerce, on-time delivering, a lot of pricing there is about being able to respond to the customer because these aren't large, highly-competitively bid type projects. This is about getting the product that the customer needs to them as quickly as they can and making it easy to do business with them. And so that's -- we see that as an opportunity. For example, I talked earlier about IPD. If we can respond and respond quicker, you can get price. You can not only get price, but you can get volume. So that represents an opportunity for us. And then, in the aftermarket business, I think we've commented. Everybody is looking at their OpEx budgets. We're, in this oil and gas, we're in the ninth quarter. So folks have gotten fairly focused on their OpEx budgets and continue to do that. But again, a lot of that is about being able to respond very, very quickly. So we've been pleased to see somewhat that there's been stability or reasonable fair stability in the pricing in the aftermarket business. So the way I'd look at it is, the projects I think are going to remain competitive until you start seeing some more robust bidding activity. Keep in mind that the industry capacity will be less than it was in 2014. And as to the other ones, I think a lot of the pricing is in our hands."

In that, you're also seeing the mix of aftermarket run rate become a higher mix. Aftermarket backlog represented 30% plus for the first time really ever in our business. Also, as you look forward, I mean, the -- you talked about the IPD getting to work on that. There is good opportunity there. Just look at its historical performance, SIHI is a good business.

That's one of the components to the book-to-bill. But it's fair to say you're right in what you've talked about. Where we've seen the primary bookings decline are in the larger projects. That also correlates to where we're taking a lot of our aggressive realignment actions to address that. So as we look into next year, it is going to be more of the short cycle in the aftermarket. And the things that -- as I look into next year, that are going to impact that is, obviously, the work Tom is going to do in the IPD business because I'll remind you, bookings in that business have not been insignificantly impacted by some of the challenges that it's had this year and particularly in -- over the last 2 quarters. And then, getting back to the earlier comment about where we are in terms of maintenance cycles, that'll impact the aftermarket business, where companies are on the OpEx budgets to do some small upgrades and efficiency repairs, which are sorely needed out in the industry right now. So if you think about our business, there are levers certainly we can pull, both from what I'd say a commercial sales standpoint around e-commerce, making it easier to order our products, which customers want to do and they want to do quickly and they have -- we have fairly good pricing power to the operational improvements. How the market response in terms of their OpEx budgets. But we're -- the one thing with time in being in the down cycle is that brings you one day closer to when you start to move out of it. And we're pretty far into this. If you think about our industry had a relatively strong cycle for on and off, but for the most part on for about a 10-year period. We've been in a 2-plus-year downturn in the industry. That's quite a while. And while that's not great from a retrospective standpoint, if you look forward, it does bring us closer to when this will start to abate and we'll move out of it. I think one thing I'll remind you, we've taken a conservative approach on our future in terms of our actions. We don't think pricing is going to come back to '07, '08 levels. If it does, we'll be all the better off for it."

On pricing pressure, no, because that is about taking care of your customer. If you think about a $1,500 pump, a $8,000 pump, a $10,000 pump, particularly a $1,500 one you order online, you're not worried about 5%, 10%. You're worried about getting that piece of equipment under the process conditions that you need, spec to order as quickly as you can, by getting the plant to respond to you quickly. And so I think the point is no. We actually anticipate pricing power because part of the issue is, when you're not delivering, you don't have any pricing power, and price correlates to your ability to deliver on time. So they may take your product with a longer lead time, but they're going to command price reductions for it. When you can deliver quickly, you can command a higher price. So what I'd say is, look over the next 2 quarters. Have a lot of confidence in Tom. And from the pricing side, we actually think it will really start to feed on itself in terms of price and volume once we can execute because we have very good products.

But one of our key strategies is to develop capabilities like in the China power business, because we're well aware that not only are those Chinese EPCs going to serve their local markets, but they're going to go to regions like Africa, and we want to go with them. I'm trying to think -- oh, your comment around additive manufacturing. Yes, in terms of some sub-manufacturing, a lot of our LPO, SPO strategy is designed to have that internal capability, and as part of the realignment, we're moving some of that manufacturing, base manufacturing, out to our supply base as is our industry.

Nathan, a lot of that is determined by the opportunity itself. Where is it? For example, if we were having a discussion as a management team and something came up in our custom-engineered business, you take a step back and you say, ""Wow, there's a lot going on there. Could we really integrate it?"" You'd have to risk adjust the opportunity. Flip side, and I'm not signaling anything I'm just telling you how we think about it because if you look at our valve business, you say, ""Well, those are fairly discrete operations in terms of facilities."" The ease of integration is going to be higher. So on a disciplined approach, you look at everything on a risk-adjusted basis. But my point earlier is the highest return on every dollar we have is really in our realignment area right now. But -- hopefully, that answers it, because I don't know.

And what you saw with our relationship with Honeywell, you've seen them with other providers before, is part of the value chain in terms of how we deliver that capability to the customers.

And I'm confident that we would be able to execute on back -- any of the backlogs we've had in the last 5 to 10 years for the exact reason you've talked about. And that is we had a lot of under absorption in the most recent peak in our cycle in 2014. So we'll eliminate a lot of that. But then the comment earlier around sub manufacturing, our LPO/SPO, the ability to move work. Our focus on more highly engineered products. And what that does is that obviously gives you better absorption in the business. So I think that, as I look at our business, specifically in terms of what we've done over the last, particularly in the last 5 years, we will have less square feet and equal or more manufacturing capability and throughput capability in our business. In terms of industry consolidation, yes and no. All manufacturing is not equal. So you need to keep that in mind is that some of our facilities have the ability to manufacture certain or specific products. So when I think about our SIHI acquisition, that wasn't -- there was very little consolidation in that and it was more around adding product and product capabilities to our portfolio. Now you can move some of their products into some of our facilities, which we've done. And by the way, we move some of our products into one of their facilities. So there is the opportunity to do that, but I'd caution you not to think of our capacity as ubiquitous. And it's just a matter of square footage. You've got to have the know-how, the capabilities, the right machining, the right experience in those locations. Clearly, though, our efforts are going to make us much more efficient."

So I'm confident that the industry -- it's not going to be perfect on capacity. If anything, there'll be a little extra. But just keep in mind, we're one of the ones that are more capable about moving products around our facilities around the world. Just because 80% of your plants are full, doesn't mean that 20% of them won't be under-absorbed even in good times. So I think it's -- probably to remember to say not all capacity is equal. Our industry is responding by taking capacity out, particularly players like Flowserve that tend to be on higher end products. There's -- they've rationalized that capacity. So I don't think there's going to be a big capacity overhang when we go into the next uptick."

Let me begin by reviewing some of the key headlines from the third quarter, which we will cover in greater detail as the call continues. First, on the positive side. We were pleased to achieve a book-to-bill g",1767,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reviewing some of the key headlines from the third quarter, which we will cover in greater detail as the call continues. 
First, on the positive side. We were pleased to achieve a book-to-bill greater than one for the first time in over a year. This is a particularly positive development, given that our customers continue to remain cautious and deliberate with their budgets and spending patterns. As a result of these bookings, our backlog grew modestly and higher margin aftermarket bookings now represent over 30% of our work under contract for the first time. 
We're also seeing some early signs of pre-FEED and FEED opportunities building in the pipeline. We're particularly pleased with the bookings resiliency and performance of our aftermarket franchise throughout 2016, producing modest constant currency bookings growth for the year. We continue to make significant progress on our ongoing realignment program, which will drive cost out of our platform and position Flowserve to enhanced profitability as a leaner and more efficient company.
Finally, while our third quarter earnings were lower than expected, the company continues to be well-positioned, and we are actively pursuing opportunities for further improvement as we execute on our cost reduction initiatives and long-term strategic growth opportunities.
With regard to market and company-specific challenges this quarter, we continue to experience challenging global macro conditions and as I noted earlier, our customers have remained cautious and deliberate in their investment decisions. Reflecting this environment, project delays, rolling maintenance deferrals and extended timelines for both order placement and delivery acceptance have become the norm. 
We were particularly surprised in September with the slow pace of industrial short cycle and aftermarket revenues. But the good news is these orders remain largely in backlog, and we expect to deliver on them in future periods.
There is also additional political uncertainty in many regions around the world, including the United States. We continue to see some operational and cost issues in our receiving sites as we shift manufacturing and implement our structural realignment program. However, we are actively addressing these issues. 
While we are pleased with the progress in our aftermarket bookings, the lower backlog associated with our OE facilities will increase under absorption in the short run, which occurs faster than we can realign or take costs out. As we execute and complete our realignment plans, our new cost structure should catch up to the current workload and alleviate this timing issue and position Flowserve when the cycle improves.
Finally, we incurred some significant noncash reserves during the quarter related to Latin America. As we have previously discussed, this region has been and remains challenged. While we have collected about $5.5 million year-to-date and will continue to actively pursue collections on these accounts, which are not in dispute, we believe that fully reserving for certain receivables balances and work in process is the most prudent course of action.
On an adjusted basis, EPS this quarter was $0.52. And while we indicated on our last call that we expected this quarter to be light due to the timing of shipments, given the magnitude of this impact, along with the continuation of challenging market conditions, we are revising our full year guidance. Karyn will cover our financials in more detail, but operationally, we will continue to focus on a disciplined approach, cost management, and improving our efficiency across the business, and addressing all of these with a sense of urgency.
Despite the challenges this quarter, it is important to note that we have successfully navigated previous cycles and are actively leveraging this experience as we manage our business through the current market environment. Further, I am confident that our current strategic direction and ongoing cost reduction initiatives will position Flowserve competitively for the eventual recovery in our energy end markets. 
Our primary near-term challenge remains transforming our manufacturing platform quickly enough to reduce under absorption while enhancing our operational flexibility to meet customer expectations, a better value for their investment dollar. This situation particularly impacts EPD and IPD in the near term as pumped OE backlog continued to decline during the period. 
With the recent operating issues in financial performance in our IPD segment, I have asked Tom Pajonas to assume interim leadership of the segment's day-to-day operations. Tom was instrumental in turning FCD into the stronger performer it is today, and I am confident he will drive the necessary actions and accountabilities to improve the business. 
Key initiatives include: accelerating the pace in execution of the realignment program and embedding sustainable process improvements to drive differentiated value for our customers, such as reduced lead times, automated order process through e-commerce, enhanced supply chain management and improving on-time deliveries. 
Ultimately, we are driving towards an operating platform and culture in IPD similar to that of our FCD segment. I have complete confidence Tom will improve IPD's performance with time.
Next, I'd like to update you on the significant progress we are making as we execute our realignment program. Though we continue to have some operational issues in some of our receiving sites, we are continuing to focus on the structural transformation of our business platform. 
During the third quarter, we initiated actions to close 2 additional manufacturing facilities, including an Australian IPD facility, which will be consolidated into another Flowserve site in that country. And we are transferring EPD's Lawrence operations based in Massachusetts to other U.S. and Latin American facilities. During the fourth quarter, we plan to address additional manufacturing sites, including recently announced initiatives to close a German manufacturing facility and the consolidation of Middle East QRCs.
We continue to expect about $160 million in charges for the year. From a savings perspective, we delivered approximately $37 million in the third quarter, $80 million year-to-date, and importantly, we remain on track to deliver $100 million of incremental savings for the full year of 2016.
While we identify most realignment costs incurred for your analysis, I'll remind you that our reported and adjusted numbers do not include the expected negative impact on revenues and profits that have been delayed during the transition, which should materialize as the receiving sites come up to speed on the new lines. We are improving our manufacturing transitions with dedicated resources and teams to minimize bottlenecks and implement processes to apply lessons learned from completed actions as we continued to execute on our realignment program.
Turning to our markets and bookings within our served industries. Overall, we believe the relative stability of oil around the $45 to $50 range over the past 6 months has been a positive development for many of our customers. Nevertheless, we still anticipate that our customers will remain cautious with their capital and operating budgets in the near term. Considering the multiyear nature of infrastructure, original equipment investments, it will likely require several quarters of this level of stability before investment spending actively resumes, and we expect the opportunities that arise will be competitive.
Overall for the quarter, constant currency bookings declined approximately 7%, primarily due to an OE bookings decline of approximately 11%. As expected, aftermarket bookings continued to demonstrate resiliency, but did decline approximately 2% this quarter. 
While aftermarket bookings have increased constant currency year-to-date, third quarter aftermarket sales saw a sharp drop off sequentially during the quarter. We believe this is just a timing issue as it is rare for aftermarket orders to cancel and was mainly because our first half 2016 bookings included a few upgrade projects that will not ship until 2017. 
Additionally, some customers have been slow to accept shipment, but we do continue to see elevated levels of emergency response aftermarket opportunities. While pricing pressure has been a significant issue on larger CapEx-driven Greenfield and Brownfield projects, we are pleased that we've maintained fairly consistent pricing levels in our aftermarket bookings.
Turning now to specific end markets and looking at bookings on a constant currency basis, coming off a low base. Bookings in our largest served market, oil and gas, increased 10% in the quarter. European orders and an ebulator job for Asia were key drivers of this growth. 
While we were pleased with this improved level of bookings, we're certainly not calling a bottom yet. However, we do view our downstream and midstream focus as a long-term asset for the company. 
Power bookings decreased approximately 21% on a tough prior year compare. Going forward, we expect steady combined cycle investment in North America and fossil projects in Asia, which tend to be very competitive. China continues to invest in nuclear, where we participate in both the Western and Chinese designs. 
In our general industries, constant currency bookings decreased approximately 4%. The distribution channel remained depressed in the quarter. While we continue to believe destocking across many of our distributors is largely complete, distributors overall are maintaining lower inventory levels, placing smaller orders, often only when they have a customer order in hand. So quick response time will be a priority for us.
Chemical bookings were down 18% in the quarter, with low levels of new project releases. We continued to see delays in the expected ethylene driven derivative plants as well as the second wave of crackers. But we expect this development to progress in North America and the Middle East, supported by low-cost feedstock.
To summarize the quarter, we remain focused on rapidly transforming our cost structure for these uncertain markets, while positioning Flowserve for enhanced growth and profitability. We've seen cycles before and fully expect our markets will recover. Importantly, we are confident that our investments to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of our global operating platform will lead us through current challenges and enhance the value that Flowserve can deliver to our customers and shareholders. 
Finishing up on a personal note. As most of you know, about a month ago, we announced my intention to retire from the company at the end of March 2017. After over a decade at Flowserve, and as the company begins its next phase of growth and development, now is the right time for the company and me to begin this transition process. I am confident that Flowserve has the right strategic plans and the right team in place to achieve our objectives.
Flowserve is a great company with a solid operating and financial foundation and is on the right path forward. Importantly, until the Board names my successor, it remains business as usual, and I remain fully committed to the success of the company, our employees and shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Karyn."

Turning to our 2016 third quarter financials. As Mark noted, our operating results were primarily impacted by the continued challenging market environment and various associated factors, including Latin America",1054,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our 2016 third quarter financials. As Mark noted, our operating results were primarily impacted by the continued challenging market environment and various associated factors, including Latin America, our realignment initiatives and our performance of the OE business, which I will detail.
Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.52 excludes $0.47 of noncash charges related to Latin American activity, including a $63.2 million charge to reserve certain undisputed accounts receivable, which we will continue to pursue, and a $15.9 million charge to reserve for inventory exposures in the region. Additionally, adjustments include $0.21 per share of realignment expense, $0.01 associated with SIHI purchase price adjustments and integration charges and a gain of $0.01 on below-the-line FX.
Reported loss per share for the quarter was $0.16, which included an above-the-line negative currency translation headwind of approximately $0.02 in both reported and adjusted EPS. Q3 revenues of $943 million decreased 14% or 12.1% constant currency. Year-to-date, Flowserve's constant currency revenues decreased 8.2% compared to 2015 levels. Regionally, and on a constant currency basis, North America was roughly flat, while the Middle East and Africa, Europe and Asia Pac were down low to mid-teens. Latin America remains our most challenged region with a decline of nearly 39%. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses declined 10% in the third quarter, but remained elevated as a percent of sales due primarily to the decline in revenues and the timing of expected realignment savings from our ongoing realignment program and our paced approach to SIHI cost reduction. Additionally, we have continued to invest in aftermarket and distribution initiatives as we focus on long-term growth in the business. 
Turning to margins. Third quarter adjusted gross margins decreased 350 basis points to 32.4% versus prior year and excluded $15.9 million of noncash charges related to our Latin American activity and realignment charges of $24.5 million. Reported gross margins were 28.1%, negatively impacted by increased underabsorption on lower volumes, the adjusted items and further challenged by shipments that reflected the pricing environment booked over the last 1.5 year. 
Adjusted operating margin of 11.7% excludes noncash Latin American charges, $79.1 million, $31.5 million of realignment and $2.6 million of SIHI charges, partially offset by realignment savings and lower compensation expense. 
Both gross and adjusted margins benefited in the quarter due to lower variable incentive compensation in the 2016 quarter as compared to a year ago. In total, we had over 100 basis point operating margin tailwind year-over-year during the third quarter as a result of this line item. On a year-to-date basis, however, variable incentive comp is and is currently expected to remain a slight headwind to our results.
Our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 29.3% was slightly below our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%, due primarily to the jurisdictions where earnings occurred. 
Turning to our bookings. Constant currency original equipment bookings declined 11.4%, while our aftermarket franchise remained relatively stable, down 2.1% over the prior year, but still showed modest growth year-to-date. From a regional perspective, Europe and Latin America constant currency bookings increased 7.9% and 7%, respectively. North America was down 6.4%, while Asia Pacific and the Middle East and Africa were down in the mid-teens.
Shifting to our realignment program. We realized approximately $37 million of savings in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $80 million. With our continued progress this quarter, we remain on track to achieve our goal of incremental savings of approximately $100 million in 2016. 
We expensed $37 million in the third quarter related to these efforts, bringing the first 9 months 2016 total expense to approximately $70 million, and we continue to expect total program savings of $230 million at a total program cost of $400 million. We further expect total 2016 cost of $160 million.
We continue to strive for efficiency in our investments, and as we progress in our efforts, we will continue to assess individual projects within the program to adjust or replace initiatives within the framework to which we have been externally guiding. We continue to estimate total savings of $195 million in 2017, which is $70 million incremental to total 2016 program savings of $125 million. In 2018, the full annualized program savings are expected at $230 million.
Turning to cash flow. Through September 30, 2016, operating cash flow is down about $73 million versus a year ago, primarily due to decreased earnings, partially offset by working capital improvement. In the third quarter, we returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends, while our realignment program used approximately $30 million of cash. As many of you know, the fourth quarter typically accounts for a substantial portion of the year's operating cash flow and we expect to see similar trend to occur again in 2016.
Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our first 9 months 2016 results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we have updated our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance to $2.05 per share to $2.25 per share. Unexpected revenue declines of 11% to 14%, including a 2% currency headwind or roughly $0.10 per share of above-the-line impact. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the low- to mid-$60 million range, a tax rate of 30% to 31% and reduced variable compensation expense.
As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of our 2015 SIHI acquisition and excludes realignment expenses. In addition, the Latin America noncash charges recorded in the third quarter, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration costs, below the line foreign currency effects, and the impact of other potential discrete items, are also excluded.
Moving on to cash uses for the year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures in the range of $105 million to $150 million, a significant reduction over elevated 2015 levels. Cash realignment expenditures are expected in the range of approximately $125 million to $150 million for the full year. We have $15 million in scheduled debt payments in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year debt reduction total to $60 million. We contributed $20 million to our fully funded U.S. pension plan through the first 9 months of the year, and we anticipate no further contributions in the fourth quarter. 
With that overview, let me turn the call back to Jay."

Is there -- does accelerating this program in your mind, increase the operational risk? Or what are you doing to mitigate that? And I guess, my second question related to that would be you talked about the absorption, the realignment savings not really overtaking the absorption right now. Is there a time you can provide us when you think kind of ballpark, when you think that switchover might happen where you kind of -- and I know it depends on the volumes, obviously, as you go into '17.

And those are also the ones that take time to effect the realignment. Primarily, Charley, because you have backlog that you need to work off. You need to carefully transfer those product because they're very highly engineered. There's a whole skill set that needs to move. A lot of capabilities. So we anticipate a lot of those benefits from the custom engineered to come through next year. And this was anticipated at all times as we worked off the backlog. So we expect that deficiency to start to work its way through in 2017. And that will help offset -- because a lot of the backlog decrease that you're seeing is in these large projects. So it works somewhat in parallel as we work off that backlog, and that's primarily what you've seen in our bookings decline that those costs start coming out of the business. To your first question, I think the general comments were, you always plan for some inefficiencies when you're moving product. It's not like moving simple widget manufacturing. There's a lot of know-how. There's product movement. There's a lot of planning that goes into it. So there is going to be some slippage. And it's not insignificant, but you plan for it. In fairness, and I think we've been very upfront, in the IPD segment, we've seen more than we anticipated. And what that does, is that impacts a couple of things. It'll impact results. It'll also impact bookings as well, because if a plant isn't operating efficiently, you can't book into it. So in my comments earlier, that's why I said Tom has taken over. So your question is what's the answer? And it's proven in the past, it's Tom. He's assumed the responsibility for that in getting these things resolved, and I'm confident that he will. But clearly, the -- in general, the realignment is going as planned, but we've seen some impact beyond what we anticipated, not insignificant in the IPD segment, and we will fix it."

So you didn't have the kind of -- near the kind of '07, '08 time of pricing environment that you have -- you had at that point in time. But if you look at these custom engineered facilities, our industry is taking capacity out. So if what you'll see is that capacity that is remaining will become -- it'll become taxed quicker, but you need to start to see the pickup in the custom engineered in the large projects. And as I've talked about before and in my comment, you see some early FEED work that's being done. But as we've commented before, we don't anticipate that, that would come into our industry's bookings until the end of next year or 2018. Now when you look at the other parts of our business, and this is why we talk a lot about e-commerce, on-time delivering, a lot of pricing there is about being able to respond to the customer because these aren't large, highly-competitively bid type projects. This is about getting the product that the customer needs to them as quickly as they can and making it easy to do business with them. And so that's -- we see that as an opportunity. For example, I talked earlier about IPD. If we can respond and respond quicker, you can get price. You can not only get price, but you can get volume. So that represents an opportunity for us. And then, in the aftermarket business, I think we've commented. Everybody is looking at their OpEx budgets. We're, in this oil and gas, we're in the ninth quarter. So folks have gotten fairly focused on their OpEx budgets and continue to do that. But again, a lot of that is about being able to respond very, very quickly. So we've been pleased to see somewhat that there's been stability or reasonable fair stability in the pricing in the aftermarket business. So the way I'd look at it is, the projects I think are going to remain competitive until you start seeing some more robust bidding activity. Keep in mind that the industry capacity will be less than it was in 2014. And as to the other ones, I think a lot of the pricing is in our hands."

So while that is coming down, that is where we're addressing the realignment. And if you think about our business, that doesn't -- that industry has absorption issues, but not necessarily the biggest contribution margin. But it is certainly being impacted. In that, you're also seeing the mix of aftermarket run rate become a higher mix. Aftermarket backlog represented 30% plus for the first time really ever in our business. Also, as you look forward, I mean, the -- you talked about the IPD getting to work on that. There is good opportunity there. Just look at its historical performance, SIHI is a good business. And Tom is on the matter in terms of the opportunity going forward. The benefit of the realignment. And then on the flip side is companies deal with inflation and as we talked about before, around the variable comp, but that's aligned with our shareholders.

That's one of the components to the book-to-bill. But it's fair to say you're right in what you've talked about. Where we've seen the primary bookings decline are in the larger projects. That also correlates to where we're taking a lot of our aggressive realignment actions to address that. So as we look into next year, it is going to be more of the short cycle in the aftermarket. And the things that -- as I look into next year, that are going to impact that is, obviously, the work Tom is going to do in the IPD business because I'll remind you, bookings in that business have not been insignificantly impacted by some of the challenges that it's had this year and particularly in -- over the last 2 quarters. And then, getting back to the earlier comment about where we are in terms of maintenance cycles, that'll impact the aftermarket business, where companies are on the OpEx budgets to do some small upgrades and efficiency repairs, which are sorely needed out in the industry right now. So if you think about our business, there are levers certainly we can pull, both from what I'd say a commercial sales standpoint around e-commerce, making it easier to order our products, which customers want to do and they want to do quickly and they have -- we have fairly good pricing power to the operational improvements. How the market response in terms of their OpEx budgets. But we're -- the one thing with time in being in the down cycle is that brings you one day closer to when you start to move out of it. And we're pretty far into this. If you think about our industry had a relatively strong cycle for on and off, but for the most part on for about a 10-year period. We've been in a 2-plus-year downturn in the industry. That's quite a while. And while that's not great from a retrospective standpoint, if you look forward, it does bring us closer to when this will start to abate and we'll move out of it. I think one thing I'll remind you, we've taken a conservative approach on our future in terms of our actions. We don't think pricing is going to come back to '07, '08 levels. If it does, we'll be all the better off for it."

On pricing pressure, no, because that is about taking care of your customer. If you think about a $1,500 pump, a $8,000 pump, a $10,000 pump, particularly a $1,500 one you order online, you're not worried about 5%, 10%. You're worried about getting that piece of equipment under the process conditions that you need, spec to order as quickly as you can, by getting the plant to respond to you quickly. And so I think the point is no. We actually anticipate pricing power because part of the issue is, when you're not delivering, you don't have any pricing power, and price correlates to your ability to deliver on time. So they may take your product with a longer lead time, but they're going to command price reductions for it. When you can deliver quickly, you can command a higher price. So what I'd say is, look over the next 2 quarters. Have a lot of confidence in Tom. And from the pricing side, we actually think it will really start to feed on itself in terms of price and volume once we can execute because we have very good products.

In general, the traditional competitors are taking capacity out. You're right in terms of Chinese EPCs. But keep in mind, our -- a lot of our capacity is designed to participate with those EPCs in some of their global efforts. So don't think about these products, especially some of the more highly engineered, are going to necessarily just be picked up by local Chinese suppliers, where we've traditionally seen Chinese competition are on the lower end products. But one of our key strategies is to develop capabilities like in the China power business, because we're well aware that not only are those Chinese EPCs going to serve their local markets, but they're going to go to regions like Africa, and we want to go with them. I'm trying to think -- oh, your comment around additive manufacturing. Yes, in terms of some sub-manufacturing, a lot of our LPO, SPO strategy is designed to have that internal capability, and as part of the realignment, we're moving some of that manufacturing, base manufacturing, out to our supply base as is our industry. So you're right on, but in terms of your comments, but don't view that as a negative. One is specifically a strategic area where we're addressing and another one is strategic/tactical in terms of how we're approaching our realignment."

And what you saw with our relationship with Honeywell, you've seen them with other providers before, is part of the value chain in terms of how we deliver that capability to the customers.

And that is we had a lot of under absorption in the most recent peak in our cycle in 2014. So we'll eliminate a lot of that. But then the comment earlier around sub manufacturing, our LPO/SPO, the ability to move work. Our focus on more highly engineered products. And what that does is that obviously gives you better absorption in the business. So I think that, as I look at our business, specifically in terms of what we've done over the last, particularly in the last 5 years, we will have less square feet and equal or more manufacturing capability and throughput capability in our business. In terms of industry consolidation, yes and no. All manufacturing is not equal. So you need to keep that in mind is that some of our facilities have the ability to manufacture certain or specific products. So when I think about our SIHI acquisition, that wasn't -- there was very little consolidation in that and it was more around adding product and product capabilities to our portfolio. Now you can move some of their products into some of our facilities, which we've done. And by the way, we move some of our products into one of their facilities. So there is the opportunity to do that, but I'd caution you not to think of our capacity as ubiquitous. And it's just a matter of square footage. You've got to have the know-how, the capabilities, the right machining, the right experience in those locations. Clearly, though, our efforts are going to make us much more efficient."

Just because 80% of your plants are full, doesn't mean that 20% of them won't be under-absorbed even in good times. So I think it's -- probably to remember to say not all capacity is equal.
