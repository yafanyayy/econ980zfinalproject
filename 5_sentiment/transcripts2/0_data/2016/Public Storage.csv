And we're looking around the market to look to do some development, and it's Berlin, but we don't have anything in the hopper in the moment. For Europe, Q4 revenues were up 4.7%. Income was up 1.3%. They had a fair number of R&M stuff and property tax credits last year that didn't flow through this year, so expenses were up a bit. So -- and then all the revenue growth didn't flow through to the bottom line. For the year, Europe revenues were up 4.5% and NOI was up 5.5%. So Europe had a very good year. Occupancies averaged for the year 89.8 versus 85.3 last year, and minor degradation rents. So it was a very good year in Europe operationally."

Generally, we try to underwrite where we think there's -- I'd say, on average, where 150, 200 basis points uptick in terms of NOI over 12 to 18 months. One of the things that we overcome in acquisitions is property tax reassessments. So whereas an operator may have had the property for 20 years, he's got a low tax basis. We buy it, now we've got a big tax bill. So you kind of make that up in your NOI, in your growth rate. But generally, 150 to 200 basis points. The stuff we bought in '13 and prior and even '14 is performing better than we anticipated because the industry fundamentals are better than anticipated. We underwrite things on today's rents in that marketplace. We don't do a forward forecast of what we think rents might be 2 or 3 years out.

Generally, we try to underwrite where we think there's -- I'd say, on average, where 150, 200 basis points uptick in terms of NOI over 12 to 18 months. One of the things that we overcome in acquisitions is property tax reassessments. So whereas an operator may have had the property for 20 years, he's got a low tax basis. We buy it, now we've got a big tax bill. So you got to kind of make that up in your NOI, in your growth rate. But generally, 150 to 200 basis points. The stuff we bought in '13 and prior and even '14 is performing better than we anticipated because the industry fundamentals are better than anticipated. We underwrite things on today's rents in that marketplace. We don't do a forward forecast of what we think rents might be 2 or 3 years out. And so the fact that the operating fundamentals in the marketplace across most of the U.S. have been very good in the last 24 months has helped us outperform our own expectations in terms of our last couple of years' acquisitions as well as our developments. Our developments are performing across the board better than we anticipated."

Generally, we try to underwrite where we think there's -- I'd say, on average, where 150, 200 basis points uptick in terms of NOI over 12 to 18 months. One of the things that we overcome in acquisitions is property tax reassessments. So whereas an operator may have had the property for 20 years, he's got a low tax basis. We buy it, now we've got a big tax bill. So you got to kind of make that up in your NOI, in your growth rate. But generally, 150 to 200 basis points. The stuff we bought in '13 and prior and even '14 is performing better than we anticipated because the industry fundamentals are better than anticipated. We underwrite things on today's rents in that marketplace. We don't do a forward forecast of what we think rents might be 2 or 3 years out. And so the fact that the operating fundamentals in the marketplace across most of the U.S. have been very good in the last 24 months has helped us outperform our own expectations in terms of our last couple of years' acquisitions as well as our developments.

And two, we saw the continued escalation of prices of acquisitions, which previous question I just answered just kind of come to bear and has been for the last 12 to 18 months. So pricing when acquisitions was making and get a new product in markets where we didn't have existing product is the rationale for the development platform. And to the team's credit, this quarter, we ended with $600 million in the pipeline, which is a new record for us. And most of that, about 2/3 of that, $300 million, $350 million  will be delivered this year, which is also fantastic. In terms of construction costs, land cost, David?"

And I'll have John chime in with the details. If you look at the same-store portfolio and growth year-over-year between -- in our top 20 markets, you see 2 markets that really stand out: Denver and Houston. Denver's revenue growth year-over-year declined by 8.3% and Houston year-over-year by 6.6%. So those markets declining from nearly double-digit growth last year to about 2% this year. And then you've got Washington, D.C. chugging along down there, about 2% growth as well. The big declines were in Houston and Denver. And those are also markets where occupancy degradation was probably 150, 200 basis points. So challenging markets. We have a fair amount -- there's a fair amount of new supply in the markets. We have a number of properties that fill up. So there is some cannibalization of the product, but I think Houston itself has some general economic slowdown there. The other markets, our West Coast markets are doing phenomenal, from San Francisco to L.A. to Seattle, Sacramento. And they're full. So they're not able to grow enough in terms of occupancy to offset the declining markets like Denver and Houston. So that's kind of the big picture in terms of revenue growth."

The way that my methodology is correct or not, if you extrapolate that, there's been about a 20% uptick in the volume of new supply in the last 12 months. Again, it varies, as I've continued to say, it varies by market. Certainly, the low barrier entry markets such as Dallas, Houston, parts of Florida. People don't think of New York as a low barrier entry market, but there's a lot of supply coming in New York.

So we view stabilization not only as stabilized occupancy but also the stabilization of the rental rates that the existing customers are paying. So for those properties that we acquired in 2013 that we did not put in the same stores, even though the occupancies were mid-90s, the rental rates that were being charged the existing tenant base was still far below what we think stabilized numbers should be.

I mean, I view it as the oil capital of the world. It's a great dynamic market. There's a lot of the submarkets within Houston where we have a little to no product and some markets where we do have some product, but we could penetrate those submarkets more. Same applies to Dallas. And there's a number of markets around the country, but those 2 markets in particular are very vibrant. And this does not change our program going forward. Now what may impact our program is, as rates roll down, it may adjust our ability to develop because it may not makes sense in terms of what we can get planned for in construction costs. And the returns that we want in development to build as much in Houston has, I would otherwise like. But long term, I mean, we're committed to those markets. Our development pipeline itself, I think we've delivered through June about $320 million or so. And so there's a fair amount of embedded growth on that. We're targeting stabilized yields, 8% to 10% on the development. And I think, in the second quarter, we generated about $2 million on the $320 million of investment. So you can -- going forward, as you kind of go out '17, '18, '19, those development deals will provide a substantial source of growth for us. Right now, they're a bit of a headwind. Our 2016 deliveries for the first 6 months lost about $0.5 million. So net-net, we think it's a great investment long term. As I touched on, they're filling up ahead of plan. But it's a bit of a headwind on earnings today but a great source of future growth. Does that address your question?"

If you look at the same-store portfolio and growth year-over-year between -- in our top 20 markets, you see 2 markets that really stand out: Denver and Houston. Denver's revenue growth year-over-year declined by 8.3% and Houston year-over-year by 6.6%. So those markets declining from nearly double-digit growth last year to about 2% this year. And then you've got Washington, D.C. chugging along down there at about 2% growth as well. But the big declines were in Houston and Denver. And those are also markets where occupancy degradation was probably 150, 200 basis points. So challenging markets. We have a fair amount -- there's a fair amount of new supply in the markets. We have a number of properties in fill-up. So there is some cannibalization of the product there, but I think Houston itself has some general economic slowdown there. The other markets, our West Coast markets are doing phenomenal, from San Francisco to L.A. to Seattle, Sacramento, and they're full. So they're not able to grow enough in terms of occupancy to offset the decline in markets like Denver and Houston. So that's kind of the big picture in terms of revenue growth."

The way that my methodology is correct or not, if you extrapolate that, there's been about a 20% uptick in the volume of new supply in the last 12 months. Again, it varies. As I've continued to say, it varies by market. Certainly, the lower barrier entry markets such as Dallas, Houston, parts of Florida. People don't think of New York as a low barrier entry market, but there's a lot of supply coming in New York. Those are markets that are getting, I would say, above-average growth in supply, while markets like San Francisco, Seattle, and even most of L.A. have an absence of new supply or very little."

The change in payroll is really, we had a workers' comp credit last year, I think, of $1 million, $1.5 million. And then we had an uptick in medical insurance. So that's really what's driving that line.

The reason why we didn't is because stabilization isn't just about occupancy because I mean, I could fill up a property in a year by giving it away for free, right, and then throw it into the same-store the next year and revenues would then just go skyrocketing. So we view stabilization not only as stabilized occupancy but also the stabilization of the rental rates that the existing customers are paying. So for those properties that we acquired in 2013 that we did not put in the same stores, even though the occupancies were mid-90s, the rental rates that were being charged the existing tenant base was still far below what we think stabilized numbers should be. So those properties we didn't put in, they're still growing at a much more rapid year-over-year change than the same-store properties that are operating and in those same markets.

I mean, I view it as the oil capital of the world. It's a great dynamic market.

And there's a number of markets around the country, but those 2 markets in particular are very vibrant. And this does not change our program going forward. Now what may impact our program is, as rates roll down, it may adjust our ability to develop because it may not makes sense in terms of what we can get land for and construction cost and the returns that we want on development to build as much in Houston as I would otherwise like. But long term, I mean, we're committed to those markets. Our development pipeline itself, I think we've delivered through June about $320 million or so. And so there's a fair amount of embedded growth on that. We're targeting stabilized yields, 8% to 10% on the development. And I think in the second quarter, we generated about $2 million on that $320 million of investment. So you can -- going forward, as you kind of go out '17, '18, '19, those development deals will provide a substantial source of growth for us. Right now, they're a bit of a headwind. Our 2016 deliveries for the first 6 months lost about $0.5 million. So net-net, we think it's a great investment long term. As I touched on, they're filling up ahead of plan.

And then I'll have John chime in with some details. If you look at the same-store portfolio and growth year-over-year between -- in our top 20 markets, you see 2 markets that really stand out: Denver and Houston. Denver's revenue growth year-over-year declined by 8.3% and Houston year-over-year by 6.6%. So those markets declining from nearly double-digit growth last year to about 2% this year. And then you've got Washington, D.C., chugging along down there at about 2% growth as well. But the big declines were in Houston and Denver. And those are also markets where occupancy degradation was probably 150, 200 basis points. So challenging markets. We have a fair amount -- there's a fair amount of new supply in the markets. We have a number of properties in fill-up. So there is some cannibalization of the product there, but I think Houston itself has some general economic slowdown there. The other markets, our West Coast markets are doing phenomenal, from San Francisco to L.A. to Seattle, Sacramento, and they're full. So they're not able to grow enough in terms of occupancy to offset the decline in markets like Denver and Houston. So that's kind of the big picture in terms of revenue growth."

Kind of the standout on the upside were Seattle, 2% change in the growth rate year-over-year; and Sacramento, up 3% year-over-year.

So that now that our rates are below last year, we've also turned on more discounting, the dollar special discounting as well as discounting on our website. And as Ron mentioned, much of that is coming from some of these weaker markets. So overall, that's down. But there's markets that are up like the West Coast that Ron mentioned. So I would expect, until we see this weakness -- and the weakness is coming in on the demand side, we -- our existing tenant base is not turning over any faster than it had previously. The move-ins that do come in are sticking around just as long as they have always had. I think the difficulty that we are seeing in these markets is just the lack of demand into our system, and therefore, we're having to reduce pricing and increase promotions."

And using the same methodology, it's up to about 38 million square feet. So whether my methodology is correct or not, if you extrapolate that, there's been about a 20% uptick in the volume of new supply in the last 12 months. Again, it varies. As I've continued to say, it varies by market. Certainly, the lower barrier entry markets such as Dallas, Houston, parts of Florida. People don't think of New York as a low barrier entry market, but there's a lot of supply coming in New York. Those are markets that are getting, I would say, above-average growth in supply, while markets like San Francisco, Seattle, and even most of L.A. have an absence of new supply or very little."

First quarter, Q1, we've got a big benefit of the snow removal, and obviously, that's not going to recur. Property taxes continue to drive our expense growth. They're by far the largest item and they're up to a 5% run rate. On-site payroll, wage growth was about 1%, 1.5%. The change in payroll is really, we had a workers' comp credit last year, I think, of $1 million, $1.5 million. And then we had an uptick in medical insurance. So that's really what's driving that line. Going forward, though, over the -- obviously, over the next couple of years, here in the West Coast, we're going to see an uptick in base wages due to changes in minimum wage law. Does that address kind of what you're thinking about?"

In some markets, yes, there is some cannibalization, although, we're trying -- very focused in terms of developing where we don't have existing product right near our current product.

So for those properties that we acquired in 2013 that we did not put in the same stores, even though the occupancies were mid-90s, the rental rates that were being charged the existing tenant base was still far below what we think stabilized numbers should be.

And there's a number of markets around the country, but those 2 markets in particular are very vibrant. And this does not change our program going forward. Now what may impact our program is, as rates roll down, it may adjust our ability to develop because it may not make sense in terms of what we can get land for and construction cost and the returns that we want on development to build as much in Houston as I would otherwise like. But long term, I mean, we're committed to those markets. Our development pipeline itself, I think we've delivered through June about $320 million or so. And so there's a fair amount of embedded growth on that. We're targeting stabilized yields, 8% to 10% on the development. And I think in the second quarter, we generated about $2 million on that $320 million of investment. So you can -- going forward, as you kind of go out '17, '18, '19, those development deals will provide a substantial source of growth for us. Right now, they're a bit of a headwind. Our 2016 deliveries for the first 6 months lost about $0.5 million. So net-net, we think it's a great investment long term. As I touched on, they're filling up ahead of plan. But it's a bit of a headwind on earnings today, but a great source of future growth. Does that address your question?"

And then I'll have John chime in with some details. If you look at the same-store portfolio and growth year-over-year between -- in our top 20 markets, you see 2 markets that really stand out: Denver and Houston. Denver's revenue growth year-over-year declined by 8.3% and Houston year-over-year by 6.6%. So those markets declining from nearly double-digit growth last year to about 2% this year. And then you've got Washington, D.C., chugging along down there at about 2% growth as well. But the big declines were in Houston and Denver. And those are also markets where occupancy degradation was probably 150, 200 basis points. So challenging markets. We have a fair amount -- there's a fair amount of new supply in the markets. We have a number of properties in fill-up. So there is some cannibalization of the product there, but I think Houston itself has some general economic slowdown there. The other markets, our West Coast markets are doing phenomenal, from San Francisco to L.A. to Seattle, Sacramento, and they're full. So they're not able to grow enough in terms of occupancy to offset the decline in markets like Denver and Houston. So that's kind of the big picture in terms of revenue growth."

As I've continued to say, it varies by market. Certainly, the lower barrier entry markets such as Dallas, Houston, parts of Florida.

The change in payroll is really, we had a workers' comp credit last year, I think, of $1 million, $1.5 million. And then we had an uptick in medical insurance. So that's really what's driving that line.

So I -- we continue to develop. We see attractive yields. In some markets, yes, there is some cannibalization, although, we're trying -- very focused in terms of developing where we don't have existing product right near our current product. That's not always the case. There is some cannibalization. And certainly, in smaller markets like Austin, Texas, where we put up a lot of product over the previous 2 years and we've seen a lot of other new product, there has been kind of greater-than-average cannibalization than, say, in a market like Dallas, where we're building mainly in North Dallas where we don't have much product."

The reason why we didn't is because stabilization isn't just about occupancy because I mean, I could fill up a property in a year by giving it away for free, right, and then throw it into the same-store the next year and revenues would then just go skyrocketing. So we view stabilization not only as stabilized occupancy but also the stabilization of the rental rates that the existing customers are paying. So for those properties that we acquired in 2013 that we did not put in the same stores, even though the occupancies were mid-90s, the rental rates that were being charged the existing tenant base was still far below what we think stabilized numbers should be. So those properties we didn't put in, they're still growing at a much more rapid year-over-year change than the same-store properties that are operating and in those same markets.

I mean, I view it as the oil capital of the world. It's a great dynamic market. There's a lot of submarkets within Houston where we have little to no product and some markets where we do have some product, but we could penetrate those submarkets more. Same applies to Dallas. And there's a number of markets around the country, but those 2 markets in particular are very vibrant. And this does not change our program going forward. Now what may impact our program is, as rates roll down, it may adjust our ability to develop because it may not make sense in terms of what we can get land for and construction cost and the returns that we want on development to build as much in Houston as I would otherwise like. But long term, I mean, we're committed to those markets. Our development pipeline itself, I think we've delivered through June about $320 million or so. And so there's a fair amount of embedded growth on that. We're targeting stabilized yields, 8% to 10% on the development. And I think in the second quarter, we generated about $2 million on that $320 million of investment. So you can -- going forward, as you kind of go out '17, '18, '19, those development deals will provide a substantial source of growth for us. Right now, they're a bit of a headwind. Our 2016 deliveries for the first 6 months lost about $0.5 million. So net-net, we think it's a great investment long term. As I touched on, they're filling up ahead of plan.

Our revenue growth rate obviously slowed down to 5.1%, but it's an incredible number, 5%. It's down from 6% last year but still a great number. If you look across our top 20 markets, all had positive growth year-over-year, except one, Houston. The interesting thing, though, or trend thing that, I think, you want to get after is that if you take 80% of our revenue base, the rate of change in our growth rate decelerated in the third quarter year-over-year. So you take a market like Houston, which their year-over-year growth rate was down 9.3% Q3 '15 to Q3 2016. Denver was down 8.8% Q3 '15 growth rate versus Q3 2016. So 80% of our revenue base had a decline in the rate of growth, and certainly, we were up against very tough comps from 2015. We had an incredible third quarter last year. But what did that tell me, that growth is slowing. It's not all due to new supply because not all of these markets are impacted by new supply to the same degree. But you have markets like Los Angeles and San Francisco, which are certainly supply-constraint, very hard to get new product in, I would say, relatively new low new supply, but their rate of growth slowed. The other big picture is expenses uptick this quarter. And for us, there's a couple of explanations, but overall, expenses were up. And the big change -- one of the key items, I think, you should focus on is property taxes, up 5.4%, which continues to ratchet up by year-over-year. Supply is up, and the rate of change in new supply continues to accelerate. It's different across various markets. And I think that will continue to be a headwind on pricing power going into 2017. For us, we're going to continue to build our development pipelines up to $600 million. David and the team have done an excellent job, and the product that we're building is just exceptional. It's filling up pretty much according to plan, and our acquisitions are also doing quite well. For the most part, the stuff we bought from 2013 through 2016, most of it is ahead of what we underwrote. So the fundamentals of the business are still great. It's just the rate of change in growth, especially the top line, has slowed a little bit. John, you want to add any color on pricing and what's in doing in terms of marketing?"

I would say, in general, every market is experiencing softness.

If you take the time and go back and look at our first quarter press release where we described our same stores, we give some metrics at the end of the quarter, what our square-foot operate occupancy is and what the annual contract rate for occupied square foot is. You look at the first quarter, we reported that it was a 5.9% delta year-over-year. That gives a good indicator of what second quarter might be, and second quarter turned out to be a 6.1% revenue growth. If you now go to the second quarter information that we reported, we reported that the square foot occupancy had a negative decline of about 0.5%, that the annual contract rate was up 5.4%. The net of those 2 is a 4.9%. And we -- that reported a 5.2% for the quarter. So there was a big drop from Q1 to the end of Q2. We went from 5.9% to 4.9%.

Our revenue growth rate obviously slowed down to 5.1%, but it's an incredible number, 5%. It's down from 6% last year but still a great number. If you look across our top 20 markets, all had positive growth year-over-year except one, Houston. The interesting thing though or trend [ph] thing that, I think, you want to get after is that if you take 80% of our revenue base, the rate of change in our growth rate decelerated in the third quarter year-over-year. So you take a market like Houston, which -- their year-over-year growth rate was down 9.3% Q3 '15 to Q3 2016. Denver was down 8.8% Q3 '15 growth rate versus Q3 2016. So 80% of our revenue base had a decline in the rate of growth. And certainly, we were up against very tough comps from 2015. We had an incredible third quarter last year. But what did that tell me, that growth is slowing. It's not all due to new supply because not all of these markets are impacted by new supply to the same degree. But you have markets like Los Angeles and San Francisco, which are certainly supply constrained, very hard to get new product in, I'd say, relatively new -- low new supply, but their rate of growth slowed. The other big picture is expenses uptick this quarter. And for us, there's a couple of explanations. But overall, expenses were up. And the big change -- one of the key items, I think, you should focus on is property taxes, up 5.4%, which continues to ratchet up by -- year-over-year. Supply is up, and the rate of change in new supply continues to accelerate. It's different across various markets. And I think that will continue to be a headwind on pricing power going into 2017. For us, we're going to continue to build our development pipelines up to $600 million. David and the team have done an excellent job, and the product that we're building is just exceptional. It's filling up pretty much according to plan, and our acquisitions are also doing quite well. For the most part, the stuff we bought from 2013 through 2016, most of it is ahead of what we underwrote. So the fundamentals of the business are still great. It's just the rate of change in growth, especially the top line, has slowed a little bit. John, you want to add any color on pricing and what you've been doing in terms of marketing?"

The existing tenant base that we have is pretty much staying put like they normally have. So they're not vacating any more rapidly than we've seen. So the struggle, I would say, that we are experiencing is really on the front end, getting move-ins in. Demand appears to soft around the country, not in any one particular market. I would say, in general, every market is experiencing softness. And as a result, we're having to -- we're advertising more on television, we're advertising more on the Internet, we are lowering our Street rates and we are giving away a little bit more discounts, not much more than last year, but a little bit more of this year. So -- but again, I'd like to emphasize that the existing tenant base is not vacating out any more rapidly than they have. We're continuing to send rate increase letters similar to how we did last year, with increases in the range of 8% to 10%."

About $1.6 million of that was cost attributable to our annual sales conference, which we held in Q3 this year versus Q4 last year. So just over $1 million of that will flip back around in Q4 as we expensed it in Q4 last year, Q3 this year."

And so at the end of June, they paid off a $250 million mortgage. And so they had nominal interest expense Q3 versus having cash and the interest expense last year. So half of the improvement of Business Parks was due to reduced interest, and half of it was due to improved operations. Shurgard Europe had good operating results, both from the same-store and nonsame-store properties.

So a declining rate environment won't do that in the near term. Also, in the near term, land prices tend to lag changes in market conditions, right? Just like on the way up, they tend to lag on moving up. When you see the market turn, you can usually get good land deals for a period of time. So they tend to lag on the way down.

And as John touched on, we'll see what we can continue to issue preferred and where debt at. But it's not out of the question as time goes forward in terms of what -- where to deploy capital. Having said that, if we're going to deploy capital in third-party acquisitions or development opportunities that provide a kind of better spread yield or better overall earnings yield to the company, then we will do that vis-à-vis our share repurchases.

          Sure, Jeff. I think, big picture, a couple of items. Our revenue growth rate obviously slowed down to 5.1%, but it's an incredible number, 5%. It's down from 6% last year but still a great number. If you look across our top 20 markets, all had positive growth year-over-year except one, Houston. The interesting thing though or trend thing that, I think, you want to get after is that if you take 80% of our revenue base, the rate of change in our growth rate decelerated in the third quarter year-over-year. So you take a market like Houston, which -- their year-over-year growth rate was down 9.3% Q3 '15 to Q3 2016. Denver was down 8.8% Q3 '15 growth rate versus Q3 2016. So 80% of our revenue base had a decline in the rate of growth. And certainly, we were up against very tough comps from 2015. We had an incredible third quarter last year. But what does that tell me? That growth is slowing. It's not all due to new supply because not all of these markets are impacted by new supply to the same degree. But you have markets like Los Angeles and San Francisco, which are certainly supply constrained, very hard to get new product in, I'd say, relatively new -- low new supply, but their rate of growth slowed. The other big picture is expenses uptick this quarter. And for us, there's a couple of explanations. But overall, expenses were up. And the big change -- one of the key items, I think, you should focus on is property taxes, up 5.4%, which continues to ratchet up by year-over-year. Supply is up, and the rate of change in new supply continues to accelerate. It's different across various markets. And I think that will continue to be a headwind on pricing power going into 2017. For us, we're going to continue to build. Our development pipelines up to $600 million. David and the team have done an excellent job, and the product that we're building is just exceptional. It's filling up pretty much according to plan, and our acquisitions are also doing quite well. For the most part, the stuff we bought from 2013 through 2016, most of it is ahead of what we underwrote. So the fundamentals of the business are still great. It's just the rate of change in growth, especially the top line, has slowed a little bit. John, you want to add any color on pricing and what you've been doing in terms of marketing?"

          Yes. I would say that what we're experiencing is mostly a softness in demand. The existing tenant base that we have is pretty much staying put like they normally have. So they're not vacating any more rapidly than we've seen. So the struggle, I would say, that we are experiencing is really on the front end, getting move-ins in. Demand appears to be soft around the country, not in any one particular market. I would say, in general, every market is experiencing softness. And as a result, we're having to -- we're advertising more on television, we're advertising more on the Internet, we are lowering our Street rates and we are giving away a little bit more discounts, not much more than last year, but a little bit more of this year. So -- but again, I'd like to emphasize that the existing tenant base is not vacating out any more rapidly than they have. We're continuing to send rate increase letters similar to how we did last year, with increases in the range of 8% to 10%."

So half of the improvement of Business Parks was due to reduced interest, and half of it was due to improved operations.

We did do a little television in Q3 and into Q4. Wasn't real thrilled with the response that we were getting, but we have been getting some pretty good response on the web. More and more of our customers, as you know, are moving to the web, whether they're using their desktop or mobile device, we're there, we're in both channels.

          Steve, let me see if I can answer the question a little bit. If you take the time and go back and look at our first quarter press release where we described our same stores, we give some metrics at the end of the quarter, what our square foot operate occupancy is and what the annual contract rate for occupied square foot is. You look at the first quarter, we reported that it was a 5.9% delta year-over-year. That gives a good indicator of what second quarter might be, and second quarter turned out to be a 6.1% revenue growth. If you now go to the second quarter information that we reported, we reported that the square foot occupancy had a negative decline of about 0.5%, that the annual contract rate was up 5.4%, the net of those 2 is a 4.9%. And we, in fact, reported a 5.2% for the quarter. So there was a big drop from Q1 to the end of Q2. We went from 5.9% to 4.9%. If you now look -- fast forward to the end of the third quarter, those same numbers are now at 4.7% versus 4.9% at the end of the second quarter. So the big drop, as I've kind of touched on, happened in Q2. We're still experiencing a decline, but the big drop happened earlier this year."

We constantly have a test group kept out of the normal group that's getting the increase to see what the reaction differential is to the rate increases. And if we do see some upticks, then we'll adjust accordingly. I can't respond to how we've done it in the past because: one, I don't remember; and two, I don't think we were smart enough to really test it as well under such circumstances. So we'll -- but we'll do that this time around and then we'll adjust, as I mentioned, as we see fit."

          Sure, Jeff. I think, big picture, a couple of items. Our revenue growth rate obviously slowed down to 5.1%, but it's an incredible number, 5%. It's down from 6% last year but still a great number. If you look across our top 20 markets, all had positive growth year-over-year except one, Houston. The interesting thing though or trend thing that, I think, you want to get after is that if you take 80% of our revenue base, the rate of change in our growth rate decelerated in the third quarter year-over-year. So you take a market like Houston, which -- their year-over-year growth rate was down 9.3% Q3 '15 to Q3 2016. Denver was down 8.8% Q3 '15 growth rate versus Q3 2016. So 80% of our revenue base had a decline in the rate of growth. And certainly, we were up against very tough comps from 2015. We had an incredible third quarter last year. But what does that tell me? That growth is slowing. It's not all due to new supply because not all of these markets are impacted by new supply to the same degree. But you have markets like Los Angeles and San Francisco, which are certainly supply constrained, very hard to get new product in, I'd say, relatively new -- low new supply, but their rate of growth slowed. The other big picture is expenses uptick this quarter. And for us, there's a couple of explanations. But overall, expenses were up. And the big change -- one of the key items, I think, you should focus on is property taxes, up 5.4%, which continues to ratchet up by year-over-year. Supply is up, and the rate of change in new supply continues to accelerate. It's different across various markets. And I think that will continue to be a headwind on pricing power going into 2017. For us, we're going to continue to build. Our development pipelines up to $600 million. David and the team have done an excellent job, and the product that we're building is just exceptional. It's filling up pretty much according to plan, and our acquisitions are also doing quite well. For the most part, the stuff we bought from 2013 through 2016, most of it is ahead of what we underwrote. So the fundamentals of the business are still great. It's just the rate of change in growth, especially the top line, has slowed a little bit. John, you want to add any color on pricing and what you've been doing in terms of marketing?"

          Yes. I would say that what we're experiencing is mostly a softness in demand. The existing tenant base that we have is pretty much staying put like they normally have. So they're not vacating any more rapidly than we've seen. So the struggle, I would say, that we are experiencing is really on the front end, getting move-ins in. Demand appears to be soft around the country, not in any one particular market. I would say, in general, every market is experiencing softness. And as a result, we're having to -- we're advertising more on television, we're advertising more on the Internet, we are lowering our Street rates and we are giving away a little bit more discounts, not much more than last year, but a little bit more of this year. So -- but again, I'd like to emphasize that the existing tenant base is not vacating out any more rapidly than they have. We're continuing to send rate increase letters similar to how we did last year, with increases in the range of 8% to 10%."

It's broad based, and a number of these markets, I mean, are -- have very dynamic economies: the Bay Area; Los Angeles; Seattle, this quarter, had a positive year-over-year rate of growth change; Sacramento; Minneapolis. So there's a lot of markets that still have some growth in them, but it's broad based in terms of slowdown. And I think, in part, it's due to just an exceptional 2015."

          Sure, Todd. Marketing costs in Q3 were up 9.5%, and that's about $670,000, and that was evenly split to between incremental TV and incremental Internet advertising. Promotional discounts were flat. So our overall customer acquisition costs were up 2.2% for the quarter. Move-ins were up 1.1% or about 2,800 incremental new customers Q3 this year versus last year. So that gives you an acquisition cost of $127 versus $126 last year. Move-in rates for the quarter were down 1.5%. Fees were up 9.1. So our net profit per customer move-in was $32 this quarter versus $33 last year. Year-to-date, Todd, net profit per customer move-in was $38 versus $33 last year. So we had a 15.2% improvement in profitability. Year-to-date, move-ins are about flat -- or I'm sorry, costs are about flat. Move-ins were down 3,200, but rates were up and fees were up. So net-net, we made 15% more per customer this year than last year."

We'll probably have another $0.5 million or so increase in Q4, smaller amount, but still a meaningful percentage increase year-over-year. Advertising, I touched on, up about $600,000, split between TV and Internet. And then the other big swing item was allocated overhead, which was up about $2 million. About $1.6 million of that was cost attributable to our annual sales conference, which we held in Q3 this year versus Q4 last year.

That's a combination of 2 things: solid same-store results, fill up with some developments, and then they -- Business Parks has been sitting on $150 million or $200 million in cash. And so at the end of June, they paid off a $250 million mortgage. And so they had nominal interest expense Q3 versus having cash and the interest expense last year. So half of the improvement of Business Parks was due to reduced interest, and half of it was due to improved operations. Shurgard Europe had good operating results, both from the same-store and nonsame-store properties. But a big chunk of their difference was $1.5 million special tax provision we made in Q3 last year that we did not make in this quarter."

We did do a little television in Q3 and into Q4. Wasn't real thrilled with the response that we were getting, but we have been getting some pretty good response on the web. More and more of our customers, as you know, are moving to the web, whether they're using their desktop or mobile device, we're there, we're in both channels. So I expect, at least in the near term, our web spend will continue to tick up. I don't think that our television will really tick up. It will probably be the same.

If you take the time and go back and look at our first quarter press release where we described our same stores, we give some metrics at the end of the quarter, what our square foot operate occupancy is and what the annual contract rate for occupied square foot is. You look at the first quarter, we reported that it was a 5.9% delta year-over-year. That gives a good indicator of what second quarter might be, and second quarter turned out to be a 6.1% revenue growth. If you now go to the second quarter information that we reported, we reported that the square foot occupancy had a negative decline of about 0.5%, that the annual contract rate was up 5.4%, the net of those 2 is a 4.9%. And we, in fact, reported a 5.2% for the quarter. So there was a big drop from Q1 to the end of Q2. We went from 5.9% to 4.9%.

During the third quarter, we were actually seeing an uptick in sales calls. Part of that's due to the increased, I think, marketing activities. The web channel was about flat, though. But the channel that, I think, gives me most concerned is that our walk-in traffic was down about 7%. So 2 of our channels were either flat or up, but the walk-in channel was down.

I don't know if we're going into that now, but it's very unusual for us to be able to issue preferred and coupons lower than our earnings yield. So we're getting close. And as John touched on, we'll see what we can continue to issue preferred and/or debt at. But it's not out of the question as time goes forward in terms of what -- where to deploy capital.

Our revenue growth rate obviously slowed down to 5.1%, but it's an incredible number, 5%. It's down from 6% last year but still a great number. If you look across our top 20 markets, all had positive growth year-over-year except one, Houston. The interesting thing though or trend thing that, I think, you want to get after is that if you take 80% of our revenue base, the rate of change in our growth rate decelerated in the third quarter year-over-year. So you take a market like Houston, which -- their year-over-year growth rate was down 9.3% Q3 '15 to Q3 2016. Denver was down 8.8% Q3 '15 growth rate versus Q3 2016. So 80% of our revenue base had a decline in the rate of growth. And certainly, we were up against very tough comps from 2015. We had an incredible third quarter last year. But what does that tell me? That growth is slowing. It's not all due to new supply because not all of these markets are impacted by new supply to the same degree. But you have markets like Los Angeles and San Francisco, which are certainly supply constrained, very hard to get new product in, I'd say, relatively new -- low new supply, but their rate of growth slowed. The other big picture is expenses uptick this quarter. And for us, there's a couple of explanations. But overall, expenses were up. And the big change -- one of the key items, I think, you should focus on is property taxes, up 5.4%, which continues to ratchet up by year-over-year. Supply is up, and the rate of change in new supply continues to accelerate. It's different across various markets. And I think that will continue to be a headwind on pricing power going into 2017. For us, we're going to continue to build. Our development pipelines up to $600 million. David and the team have done an excellent job, and the product that we're building is just exceptional. It's filling up pretty much according to plan, and our acquisitions are also doing quite well. For the most part, the stuff we bought from 2013 through 2016, most of it is ahead of what we underwrote. So the fundamentals of the business are still great. It's just the rate of change in growth, especially the top line, has slowed a little bit. John, you want to add any color on pricing and what you've been doing in terms of marketing?"

The existing tenant base that we have is pretty much staying put like they normally have. So they're not vacating any more rapidly than we've seen. So the struggle, I would say, that we are experiencing is really on the front end, getting move-ins in. Demand appears to be soft around the country, not in any one particular market. I would say, in general, every market is experiencing softness. And as a result, we're having to -- we're advertising more on television, we're advertising more on the Internet, we are lowering our Street rates and we are giving away a little bit more discounts, not much more than last year, but a little bit more of this year. So -- but again, I'd like to emphasize that the existing tenant base is not vacating out any more rapidly than they have.

If you take the time and go back and look at our first quarter press release where we described our same stores, we give some metrics at the end of the quarter, what our square foot operate occupancy is and what the annual contract rate for occupied square foot is.

That gives a good indicator of what second quarter might be, and second quarter turned out to be a 6.1% revenue growth. If you now go to the second quarter information that we reported, we reported that the square foot occupancy had a negative decline of about 0.5%, that the annual contract rate was up 5.4%, the net of those 2 is a 4.9%. And we, in fact, reported a 5.2% for the quarter. So there was a big drop from Q1 to the end of Q2. We went from 5.9% to 4.9%.
