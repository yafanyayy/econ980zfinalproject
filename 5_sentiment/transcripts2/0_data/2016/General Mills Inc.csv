Thank you for joining us today. As noted in our press release, General Mills' third quarter results were in line with our expectations.

As noted in our press release, General Mills' third quarter results were in line with our expectations. Net sales, total segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS results declined, reflecting the effects of foreign exchange and the Green Giant divestiture. 
Net sales continued to be impacted by high levels of competitive activity in U.S. yogurt and lower display merchandising for U.S. Retail. However, our effort to drive more from the core has lead to improved sales trends across a number of key U.S. Retail businesses, which Jeff will expand upon in a moment. 
We continue to maintain strong margin discipline, as evidenced by our fifth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. 
Based on our results through 9 months, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2016 growth targets. 
Slide 5 summarizes our results for the third quarter. Net sales totaled $4 billion, down 8% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. 
Total segment operating profit totaled $679 million, down 1% at constant currency basis. Net earnings increased 5% to $362 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.59 as reported. These results include $44 million in restructuring and project-related expenses and mark-to-market valuation effects. 
Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, was $0.65, down 7% from last year's third quarter.  Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS decreased 6% compared to a year ago. 
Slide 6 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Comp volume reduced sales by 5 percentage points. Positive sales mix and net price realization increased sales by 1 point, while foreign currency exchange reduced sales by 4 points. The Green Giant divestiture reduced contribution perform volume growth by 4 points and reduced net sales growth by 3 points in the quarter. 
Turning to our segment results. Slide 7 summarizes U.S. Retail performance. U.S. Retail net sales decreased 7% in the third quarter driven primarily by the Green Giant divestiture, which had a 5-point negative impact on the segment's net sales growth and accounted for the entirety of the mill's operating decline. 
Year-to-date net sales were down 2%, including the 1 point decline from the net impact of the Green Giant sale and the Annie's acquisition. 
In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, net sales declined 2% in the third quarter. Our 6 focus platforms posted combined net sales growth of 8% with the strongest growth in frozen meals and yogurt. 
Net sales declined in the remainder of the business, driven by market index pricing on bakery flour as well as the exit of some low-margin businesses in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Year-to-date net sales were down 2% with 6% growth on our 6 focus platforms. 
Slide 9 summarizes our International segment net sales results. On a constant currency basis, third quarter International segment net sales were flat to last year, driven by Latin America where sales grew 16%, including double-digit growth in Mexico, sales were up high single digits in Brazil with good performance on snacks, benefits from pricing and incremental contributions from the addition of the Carolina yogurt business. 
Net sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased 4%, including double-digit growth in India and low single digit growth in China. 
In Europe, sales were down 2% as subsidiary deflation contributed to unfavorable net price realization for our yogurt business. 
In Canada, sales were down 14% reflecting the Green Giant sale. 
In total, the Green Giant divestiture reduced International segment net sales growth by 2 points in the third quarter. 
We continue to make good progress on gross margin. Slide 10 shows that the third quarter adjusted gross margin excluding certain items increased 160 basis points. This is primarily due to cost-savings initiatives, more than offsetting modest input cost inflation. 
Our latest estimate of input cost inflation now rounds down to 1% for the full year. As of February, we're roughly 85% covered on our fiscal 2016 commodity requirements and we now expect full year gross margins to expand by approximately 100 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 11. Total segment operating profit was down 1% in constant currency. U.S. Retail third quarter profit essentially matched last year with continued cost savings more than offsetting the divestiture impact. 
Constant currency international profit declined 24% in the quarter due to currency-driven inflation by imported products in certain markets and the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. 
In Convenience Stores and Foodservice, profit was up 31%, driven by increased Green merchandising earnings, favorable product mix and our cost-savings efforts. 
After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $16 million in the quarter, up 19% in constant currency due primarily to volume growth from Häagen-Dazs Japan. Third quarter constant currency net sales decline 1% for CPW, primarily due to lower sales in developed markets. 
Häagen-Dazs Japan constant currency net sales increased 22% for the quarter, driven by excellent results on the new seasonal, Hanaogi, which combined Häagen-Dazs ice cream with the traditional Japanese rice cake dessert. 
Slide 13 summaries our noteworthy income items -- other noteworthy income items in the quarter. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability increased by $12 million in the quarter. We incurred $44 million in restructuring and project-related charge in the quarter, including $27 million recorded in cost of sales. Net interest expense decreased 4% from the prior year, driven primarily by lower average debt balances, partially offset by change in the mix of debt. We continue to expect interest expense will be down mid-single digits for the full year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31% as reported, 5.5 points higher than prior period -- prior year period. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 30.8% this year compared to 27.5% a year ago. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be comparable to last year. 
Average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% in the quarter, in line with our full year expectations. 
The one additional item to mention here. As noted in this morning's press release, we sold our Venezuela business after the close of the third quarter. The business primarily manufactures in sales canned meats under the Underwood brand. We expect to incur a noncash charge of approximately $35 million pretax in the fourth quarter related to this sale. This charge will be excluded from adjusted earnings, and we anticipate the tax loss in this transaction will unlock approximately $20 million in incremental cash flow in fiscal 2016. 
Now let me briefly summarize our 9-month financial performance stated in constant currency. Net sales were down 1%, reflecting the net impact of acquisition and divestitures; segment operating profit increased 8%; and adjusted diluted EPS were 10% above the prior year. 
Slide 15 shows that our core working capital declined 40% versus last year's third quarter. Half of the decline is due to Green Giant divestiture and foreign currency effects and the other half reflects continued operational improvements across our businesses. This is the 12th consecutive quarter we reduced our core working capital versus the prior year. 
We continue to generate healthy levels of free cash flow. Year-to-date free cash flow is $1.4 billion, up 29% versus last year. We're on track to convert at least 95% of adjusted net sales into free cash flow this year, in line with our long-term goal. 
We also continue to return significant cash to shareholders. Through 9 months, we repurchased 10.6 million shares at an aggregate price of $602 million, and we paid $795 million in dividends. 
On March 8, we announced a dividend increase of 4.5% payable on May 2. This marks the seventh time we've increased our quarterly dividend rate since 2010. 
For the full fiscal year, we expect to return at least 90% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Cost savings from Holistic Margin Management or HMM and incremental cost-reduction projects represent an important components of our earnings growth in fiscal 2016. We have good visibility to achieving $400 million in cost of goods sold HMM savings this year, and we continue to make progress toward our goal of $500 million in savings from incremental projects by fiscal 2018. 
For the full year, we're reaffirming the guidance we updated on the second quarter earnings call. Specifically, we expect a low single digit decline in net sales from the 2015 level that included a 53rd week at the full year of Green Giant. 
Total segment operating profit matching last year's levels and a low single digit growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share, all in constant currency. We now expect the impact of currency translation to result in an $0.08 headwind the full year adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2016. 
Included in this guidance is a fourth quarter where we expect low single digit comparable sales growth. Our reported results will reflect unfavorable foreign exchange, the impact of Green Giant sale and comparison to an extra week in the year ago period. We anticipate adjusted gross margin will be below last year reflecting our highest quarterly inflation rate compared to our lowest quarterly inflation rate a year ago. And we expect media expense will be up as reported and up double digits, excluding currency effects, the 53rd week compares and in Green Giant. 
With that, I'll turn the microphone over to Jeff."

On Slide 20, I have summarized three main messages I want to leave you with today. 
First, we built a strong profit growth and margin results so far this year. Second, we're continuing to experience headwinds in our yogurt business and industry merchandising that are dampening our sales results. And we're actively working to address these headwinds. And third, we're encouraged with the progress we're making with our Consumer First efforts in a number of key businesses. 
Now let me go a bit deeper on each of these areas. Through 9 months, U.S. Retail net sales of $7.8 billion are down 2%, including 1 point of decline from acquisitions and divestitures. 
Year-to-date segment operating profit of $1.7 billion is up double digits versus the prior year. 
This significant profit performance reflects our continued focus on cost savings. We're generating strong cost of goods HMM savings in addition to the benefits from incremental cost-savings projects, including Project Century. This gives us even greater confidence that our Century initiative will help unlock future HMM opportunities. 
And importantly, we're expanding our margins, while we are make Consumer First investments on our products, our brands and our capabilities to drive improved sales growth. 
We will give back margin in the fourth quarter for the reasons Don explained. But we still expect to expand U.S. Retail operating profit margin by more than 100 points for the full year. 
We continue to see growth in our categories with aggregate Nielsen measured retail sales up for the fourth consecutive quarter. We estimate that our categories grew more than 1% in the third quarter when including faster growing non-measured channels. 
Our net sales results have not yet paced with category growth. As I mentioned, our year-to-date net sales declined 2%. The Annie's acquisition and Green Giant divestiture combined to contribute 1 point of that sales decline with the impact falling most significantly on the meals [indiscernible] ,which would be up, excluding our M&A activity. 
Net sales for our yogurt operating unit have been impacted by high competitive activity, while reduced display merchandising has particularly impacted our Cereal and Snacks results. 
On Yogurt, we continue to see high levels of competitive investment as dairy prices remained near 20-year lows. Merchandise volume is up double digits for our key competition in the category with significant increase in merchandising frequency as well as lower price points in certain channels. 
In addition, we're seeing competitive advertising spending more than twice the level of a year ago. On the second quarter earnings call, we mentioned that to address these headwinds, we would increase our competitiveness in yogurt in the second half of the year, and we will. However, given the increased competitive merchandising levels, it has taken us longer than expected to secure additional in-store activity. 
We also said that we will remain disciplined and not chase unprofitable volume, and we remain committed to that principle. 
For USRO, our display merchandising was down more than 30% at a key customer in the third quarter with the impact following most significantly on our Cereals and Snacks businesses. We'll begin lapping this reductions at the end of the fourth quarter and we'll fully lap them after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. These 2 factors combined to reduce our retail sales growth by more than 2 points in the third quarter. 
Despite these headwinds, I'm encouraged the progress we're making to expand the impact of our consumer for strategy across a number of important businesses. We gain share in 5 of our top 6 categories in the third quarter. 
Let me share some quick examples starting with Cereal. Retail sales trends in the Cereal category have an improving this fiscal year, and we have returned to share growth in recent months behind Consumer First product renovation, on-trend innovation and effective messaging. Our product innovation initiatives are working in our Cereal business. Retail sales of gluten-free Cheerios varieties are up 2% since we launched after declining high single digits last year. 
As of January, 75% of our Cereals no longer include artificial flavors and colors. The 7 cereals that received recipe changes in January have posted 6% retail sales growth since launch After posting a 6% decline last year. 
And last year's largest Consumer First renovation news, more cinnamon in Cinnamon Toast Crunch. This will bring 8% retail sales growth this year on top of 8% growth a year ago. 
Nature Valley has been a key focus for our cereal innovation efforts in recent years. Initially, we launched the brand as a protein granola and have since extended it to ready-to-eat cereal, muesli, granola bites and oatmeal. Retail sales for this franchise increased 44% last year, added up 35% so far this year through a combination of new product news, media support and sampling. 
The ready-to-eat cereals that we launched in January are performing well and we will keep the momentum going next year with more news on the business. 
So I'm bullish on our prospects for cereal growth. We'll start to lap some of the display headwinds in the fourth quarter, but more importantly, we'll continue to expand the impact of our renovation and innovation news and we'll invest higher level of advertising in the fourth quarter. 
We believe that yogurt is an attractive growth category now and for the long term. We're focusing on initiatives that help drive category growth by generating news, expanding usage occasions and bringing new consumers to the shelf. 
Over time, innovation and great marketing will be the key factors to winning in this category. 
In January, we launched the whole milk organic Annie's yogurt into the fastest -- one of the fastest-growing segments in the category. We think Annie's all family appeal and strong organic brand equity will bring new consumers to the shelf and will have more news to bring to the organic yogurt segment this summer. We're expanding our usage occasions with our 1-Up Your Cup campaign, which encourages consumers to incorporate yogurt into their snacking routine. 
Nature Valley bars, our largest business and snacks, has been impacted by reduced display in merchandising in certain channels. But in a traditional grocery channel where merchandising has been were consistent, we've driven growth behind Consumer First renovation and innovation. 
Our Nature Valley Crunchy bar product renovation and our no artificial colors, flavors and sweetness advertising are working, and we've seen excellent early results on our new Nature Valley nut butter biscuit products. As a result, year-to-date retail sales for Nature Valley grain snacks are up mid-single digits in the grocery channel. 
Lärabar has delivered double-digit annual growth since we acquired the business almost 8 years ago, and we believe there's still an opportunity to broaden penetration and accelerate the brand's growth. We recently began testing Lärabar's first ever TV campaign advertising, supplemented with digital advertising, coupons and in-store merchandising. 
Since the campaign began airing, retail sales for Lärabar are up more than 40%. 
We're also maintaining positive momentum on Annie's. Retail sales were up double digits in the third quarter and distribution is up double digits this year in each of Annie's heritage categories. 
As we told you at our Investor Day, there's still a great deal of distribution upside for this brand so that that will continue to be an area of focus for our sales teams. 
Platform expansion also play a key role in growing Annie's. We entered the soup and yogurt categories earlier this year and will launch 3 new cereals in the coming months. We're encourage by early feedback from consumers and customers on these launches and we'll continue to evaluate other new platforms to further expand Annie's business. These strong results on Lärabar and Annie's have contributed to double-digit net sales growth for our U.S. Natural & Organic business in the third quarter. 
We've completed our soup and baking seasons, and we're pleased with our performance. In ready-to-serve soup, we grew 2 points of share, driven by successful merchandising, product renovation news and good advertising. 
Our refrigerated dough business had a good baking season with growth and retail space and market share up 1.8 points. These results were driven by distribution gains on our top selling products. 
And we grew dessert mix dollar share during the key baking season this year by aligning our prices more closely with our competition. Next year, we plan to bring news and innovation to help growth the dessert mixes category. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, there a number of factors that will affect our U.S. Retail performance. We'll benefit from positive momentum on our renovation efforts and from increased media investment. We'll also begin to lap display and merchandising inductions in the quarter and while we still expect yogurt to be a headwind, we expect that headwind to moderate. 
As a result, we expect improved fourth quarter sales performance on a comparable basis, although report -- although reported results will be impacted by the Green Giant sale and by a comparison, to an extra week a year ago. 
To summarize, my U.S. Retail comments, we're seeing strong year-to-date profit and margin performance, driven largely by cost-savings realization. Although we continue to experience headwinds in display and merchandising, we're encourage by positive momentum we're seeing across a number of our businesses such as cereal, grain snacks, Natural & Organic, soup, refrigerated dough and desserts. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Ken."

You just heard about our performance in our U.S. Retail segment, and so let me give you an update on our other 2 business segments, starting with Convenience Stores and Foodservice. Net sales",1089,"All right, well, thank you, Jeff, and good morning everybody. You just heard about our performance in our U.S. Retail segment, and so let me give you an update on our other 2 business segments, starting with Convenience Stores and Foodservice. 
Net sales for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segments are down 2% so far this year due to index pricing on bakery flour and business exits. However, our 6 focus platforms of cereal, snacks, biscuits, mixes, yogurt and frozen meals, continued to deliver excellent sales growth with combined net sales up 6% year-to-date. 
This sales performance combined with continued benefits from cost-savings initiatives is translating into margin expansion for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice business. Segment operating profit is up 8% so far this year, increasing this segment's profit margin to 19%. 
Frozen meals are leading our performance in Convenience Stores and Foodservice, with strong double-digit sales growth year-to-date. Mini bagels continue to grow as part of school breakfast programs, and we applied our Consumer First approach to product development in this channel when we introduced products for school lunches a year ago. Pillsbury Cheesy Pull-Aparts are our most recent introduction. Launched in November, these individually wrapped versions of cheese stuffed bread are heated and served right in their packaging, saving labor costs and waste. 
Our bowlpacks in schools are driving mid-single-digit growth for our Cereal business fiscal year-to-date as we're leveraging our no artificial colors or flavors messaging with food service operators. 
And our yogurt business also is posting mid-single-digit net sales growth so far this year on the strength of Yoplait Parfait Pro in a variety of food service channels from colleges to hospitals. 
We also saw good momentum on our Kid Yogurt in the third quarter as we gained distribution for our Simply Go-GURT products in K-12 schools. 
So we continue to like the performance we're driving for this segment by focusing on the most profitable products in the most attractive food-service channels. 
Turning to our International segment. Net sales are up 2% so far this year on a constant currency basis. The Green Giant divestiture reduced international sales growth by 1 point this fiscal year-to-date. Constant currency segment operating profit declined 1% through the first 9 months of the year, primarily due to currency-driven inflation on imported products in certain markets and a comparison to the year ago period when profit increased 8%. 
In Canada, constant currency net sales are down 2% so far this year with growth on a number of business lines, offset by the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. 
Our Grain Snacks business continue to deliver good results. Retail sales are up 11% year-to-date on a strength of new product launches like Nature Valley Nut and Seed bars and Fiber One Crumble bars and innovation on our Old El Paso Mexican meals is contributing to 2% retail sales growth for this leading brand of Mexican foods. 
In Europe, net sales are up 1% fiscal year-to-date on a constant currency basis, led by good performance on ice cream and meals. Häagen-Dazs premium ice cream bars are driving 13% retail sales growth so far this year.  We're introducing 2 new flavors this month and have plans to expand these bars into additional markets. 
Innovation also is contributing to 1% retail sales growth for Old El Paso dinner kits, driven in large part by increased in-store events and higher levels of advertising support. 
In Yogurt, retail sales are down year-to-date as dairy deflation has led to unfavorable net price realization. However, we posted modest shared growth so far this year in Europe with good performance on Yop yogurt beverages and Perle de Lait varieties in France. 
Our focus on execution on the fundamentals drove improved net sales performance in emerging markets in the third quarter. 
Year-to-date net sales in Latin America are up 11% on a constant currency basis. We posted high single digit net sales growth in Brazil in the third quarter, with good performance on our Snacks business, benefits from pricing and incremental contributions from Carolina yogurt. 
As we mentioned at CAGNY last month, we acquired the Carolina business in December, along with the manufacturing and distribution infrastructure for dairy products and we're excited about our growth prospects for yogurt in this market. 
We also continued to post excellent sales growth in Mexico, led by solid performance on snack bars, Fiber One bars, in particular. We introduced the Fiber One brand in Mexico a little over a year ago and retail sales for our wholesome snacks are up double digits so far this year. 
Now as you can see, on Slide 42, constant currency net sales for our Asia Pacific region grew 3% year-to-date. We saw improved performance in China in the third quarter with net sales up low single digit. Wanchai Ferry contributed to this growth with good performance on our new Rainbow Italian dimsum products during the Chinese New Year. And Yoplait yogurt continues to perform well with market share in Shanghai at 10% in the third quarter. We saw good growth on the Perle de Lait bonus packs launched in conjunction with the Chinese New Year, and we're increasing our marketing and promotional activities on the Yoplait brand to drive increased consumer awareness. 
Finally, we continue to generate double-digit sales growth so far this year in the Asia, Middle East and Africa region. Sweet snacking is leading that growth. This year, we launched new fruit flavors of Häagen-Dazs ice cream, which has driven high single digit net sales growth. 
Betty Crocker Cookie Cakes launched last fall contributed to double digits snacks growth in the region fiscal year-to-date. 
We're also posting strong double-digit net sales growth in India, where we've been increasing distribution on our cake mixes and recently launched a line of chocolate spreads. 
Overall, we're pleased with the improvement we saw in emerging markets this quarter, and we remain focused on innovation and fundamental execution to drive continued growth in these markets going forward. 
So that completes the highlights from our 3 business segments. I'll wrap up this morning's remarks with this summary. Our third quarter results were in line with our expectations, foreign currency exchange and the Green Giant divestiture are impacting our reported figures, our financial discipline is driving operating profit margin expansion, while still allowing us to invest in Consumer First renovation and innovation, and we're confident we will deliver our 2016 growth targets. 
Well that concludes our prepared comments this morning. I'll ask the operator now to open up the call for questions."

We also think, even though yogurt will continue to be a headwind in the fourth quarter that, that business will improve behind the merchandising we talked about in the second quarter.

In addition, there's some other things that we are lapping some of the merchandising in USRO, we had business exits in our C&F business in Q4 last year that will lap the index pricing. We talked about the bakery flour in C&F that is profit neutral because we price with the market. But the grain price is really started coming down last year in Q4, so we will begin lapping that will be less bad in Q4, which will help our comparable sales growth.

But it seems like in yogurt, it just keeps going the other way. There's so many brands out there now. It doesn't seem like they're hitting that wall.

But again, where we focus on the right innovation and the right renovation like expanding Annie's into the yogurt dairy case and other yogurt innovation initiatives that we'll announce this summer, where we have good ones, we're able to succeed because of the scale and the distribution power that we have. So we're confident that we can continue to grow there, it's an exciting space, it's a huge category globally, we have very high capability. And so, we're just going to stay focused on the kind of innovation that we're working in the category. I can come back to you, Eric. We can look and get some numbers may be how many have come in and how many have gone up. The observation that there's a lot more in yogurt I think is correct. I don't type you want to add, Jeff?"

We've driven double-digit distribution increases on Annie's over the last 2 years I the grocery trade. But even beyond that, looking at the club channel, we've grown distribution in our food service area, we're growing Annie's in our food service channels. And so broadly speaking, we see the kind of capability that General Mills can add to some of the smaller players and when they hit the wall, how much better we can do. And we were starting to see the same thing with Epic even though we've just bought that business and have a high degree of confidence that given to a lot more faster than the founders alone could have done with their limited resources."

And we've even seen the benefits of things that we discontinued. We discontinued a line on Hamburger Helper, and we've seen the distribution there decrease, but we've seen the increase on our top SKUs and as a result, we're actually starting to see our turns increase on Hamburger Helper. We've also seen the benefits of distribution on our Pillsbury dough business and one of the things that's driving growth on our Pillsbury businesses is getting out of SKUs that were relatively unproductive and getting into more SKUs that are relatively productive. And so we're really pleased with the progress we've seen we have more to do. We have -- we'll keep that on a multi-year plan to get all of our distribution on our top items, but we progressing as we thought we would. And we see more room to go.

So we feel good about the innovation we've done, but as we look ahead, we actually we see even greater potential for innovation in some faster-growing segments. I know it's building on things like Whips or getting into further into organic. There is certainly runway ahead of us for innovation. We know in a category like yogurt, just like cereal, it's going to be the innovation and marketing that drives long-term growth because dairy prices are at a 20-year low, and we'll see how long they stay there, but eventually, they'll go back up, and it will be a matter of innovation and marketing is going to win today in yogurt."

And as with other segments, we expect to strengthen in the fourth quarter. In terms of the margins, there's a couple things that are at play. One, is obviously Green Giant does impact our profit international. We sold the North American business, so Canada you're  seeing the impact of that, and that's a low to mid-single-digit drag on the earnings for international. The other you see, we mentioned this is currency driven inflation on certainly products, I mean, that's a long way to say we have transaction FX impact for businesses that we sort of cross-border, for example, much of our Canadian product is sourced from the U.S. so as the Canadian weakens, that increases the cost in Canada. We have the same thing cross-borders in Europe. And that has been a larger drag in the second half just due to currency movements and some hedge positions that we have, and that's what you're seeing in the quarter. It will continue into the fourth quarter as well. But if you strip our Green Giant transaction FX, the underlying growth profit growth we're seeing international is holding up quite well, and that's what we would expect to continue to see as we move into '17."

As noted in our press release, General Mills' third quarter results were in line with our expectations. Net sales, total segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS results declined, reflecting the effects of foreign exchange and the Green Giant divestiture. 
Net sales growth continues to be impacted by high levels of competitive activity in U.S. yogurt and lower display merchandising for U.S. Retail. However, our effort to drive more from the core is leading to improved sales trends across a number of key U.S. Retail businesses, which Jeff will expand upon in a moment. 
We continue to maintain strong margin discipline, as evidenced by our fifth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. 
Based on our results through 9 months, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2016 growth targets. 
Slide 5 summarizes our results for the third quarter. Net sales totaled $4 billion, down 8% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. 
Total segment operating profit totaled $679 million, down 1% on a constant currency basis. Net earnings increased 5% to $362 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.59 as reported. These results include $44 million of restructuring and project-related expenses and mark-to-market valuation effects. 
Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, was $0.65, down 7% from last year's third quarter. Constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS decreased 6% compared to a year ago. 
Slide 6 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Pound volume reduced sales by 5 percentage points. Positive sales mix and net price realization increased sales by 1 point, while foreign currency exchange reduced sales by 4 points. The Green Giant divestiture reduced contribution from volume growth by 4 points and reduced net sales growth by 3 points in the quarter. 
Turning to our segment results. Slide 7 summarizes U.S. Retail performance. U.S. Retail net sales decreased 7% in the third quarter driven primarily by the Green Giant divestiture, which had a 5-point negative impact on the segment's net sales growth and accounted for the entirety of the mill's operating unit decline. 
Year-to-date net sales were down 2%, including the 1-point decline from the net impact of the Green Giant sale and the Annie's acquisition. 
In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, net sales declined 2% in the third quarter. Our 6 focus platforms posted combined net sales growth of 8%, with the strongest growth in frozen meals and yogurt. 
Net sales declined in the remainder of the business, driven by market index pricing on bakery flour as well as the exit of some low-margin businesses in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Year-to-date net sales were down 2%, with 6% growth on our 6 focus platforms. 
Slide 9 summarizes our International segment net sales results. On a constant currency basis, third quarter International segment net sales were flat to last year, driven by Latin America where sales grew 16%, including double-digit growth in Mexico. Sales were up high single digits in Brazil with good performance on snacks, benefits from pricing and incremental contributions from the addition of the Carolina yogurt business. 
Net sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased 4%, including double-digit growth in India and low single-digit growth in China. 
In Europe, sales were down 2% as dairy deflation contributed to unfavorable net price realization for our yogurt business. 
In Canada, sales were down 14%, reflecting the Green Giant sale. 
In total, the Green Giant divestiture reduced International segment net sales growth by 2 points in the third quarter. 
We continue to make good progress on gross margin. Slide 10 shows that the third quarter adjusted gross margin, excluding certain items, increased 160 basis points. This is primarily due to cost savings initiatives more than offsetting modest input cost inflation. 
Our latest estimate of input cost inflation now rounds down to 1% for the full year. As of February, we're roughly 85% covered on our fiscal 2016 commodity requirements, and we now expect full year gross margins to expand by approximately 100 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 11. Total segment operating profit was down 1% in constant currency. U.S. Retail third quarter profit essentially matched last year, with continued cost savings more than offsetting the divestiture impact. 
Constant-currency international profit declined 24% in the quarter due to currency driven inflation at imported products in certain markets and the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. 
In Convenience Stores and Foodservice, profit was up 31%, driven by increased grain merchandising earnings, favorable product mix and our cost-saving efforts. 
After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $16 million in the quarter, up 19% in constant currency due primarily to volume growth from Häagen-Dazs Japan. Third quarter constant-currency net sales declined 1% for CPW, primarily due to lower sales in developed markets. 
Häagen-Dazs Japan constant-currency net sales increased 22% for the quarter, driven by excellent results on the new seasonal, hana mochi, which combines Häagen-Dazs ice cream with the traditional Japanese rice cake dessert. 
Slide 13 summaries our noteworthy income items -- other noteworthy income items in the quarter. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, increased by $12 million in the quarter. We incurred $44 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter, including $27 million recorded in cost of sales. Net interest expense decreased 4% from the prior year, driven primarily by lower average debt balances, partially offset by changes in the mix of debt. We continue to expect interest expense will be down mid-single digits for the full year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31% as reported, 5.5 points higher than prior period -- prior year period. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 30.8% this year compared to 27.5% a year ago. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be comparable to last year. 
Average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% in the quarter, in line with our full year expectations. 
The one additional item to mention here. As noted in this morning's press release, we sold our Venezuela business after the close of the third quarter. The business primarily manufactures and sells canned meats under the Underwood brand. We expect to incur a noncash charge of approximately $35 million pretax in the fourth quarter related to this sale. This charge will be excluded from adjusted earnings, and we anticipate the tax loss in this transaction will unlock approximately $20 million in incremental cash flow in fiscal 2016. 
Now let me briefly summarize our 9-month financial performance stated in constant currency. Net sales were down 1%, reflecting the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, segment operating profit increased 8%, and adjusted diluted EPS were 10% above the prior year. 
Slide 15 shows that our core working capital declined 40% versus last year's third quarter. Half of the decline is due to Green Giant divestiture and foreign currency exchange effects, and the other half reflects continued operational improvements across our businesses. This is the 12th consecutive quarter we reduced our core working capital versus the prior year. 
We continue to generate healthy levels of free cash flow. Year-to-date free cash flow is $1.4 billion, up 29% versus last year. We are on track to convert at least 95% of adjusted net sales into free cash flow this year, in line with our long-term goal. 
We also continue to return significant cash to shareholders. Through 9 months, we repurchased 10.6 million shares at an aggregate price of $602 million, and we paid $795 million in dividends. 
On March 8, we announced a dividend increase of 4.5% payable on May 2. This marks the seventh time we've increased our quarterly dividend rate since 2010. 
For the full fiscal year, we expect to return at least 90% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Cost savings from Holistic Margin Management or HMM and our incremental cost reduction projects represent an important component of our earnings growth in fiscal 2016. We have good visibility to achieving $400 million in cost of goods sold HMM savings this year, and we continue to make progress toward our goal of $500 million in savings from incremental projects by fiscal 2018. 
For the full year, we're reaffirming the guidance we updated on the second quarter earnings call. Specifically, we expect a low single-digit decline in net sales from the 2015 level that included a 53rd week and a full year of Green Giant. 
Total segment operating profit, matching last year's levels, and a low single-digit growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share, all in constant currency. We now expect the impact of currency translation to result in an $0.08 headwind to full year adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2016. 
Included in this guidance is a fourth quarter where we expect low single-digit comparable sales growth. Our reported results will reflect unfavorable foreign exchange, the impact of Green Giant sale and comparison to an extra week in the year ago period. We anticipate adjusted gross margin will be below last year, reflecting our highest quarterly inflation rate compared to our lowest quarterly inflation rate a year ago. And we expect media expense will be up as reported and up double digits, excluding currency effects, the 53rd week comparison in Green Giant. 
With that, I'll turn the microphone over to Jeff."

First, we've delivered strong profit growth and",1588,"Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to give you an update on our U.S. Retail performance. 
On Slide 20, I have summarized 3 main messages I want to leave you with today. First, we've delivered strong profit growth and margin results so far this year. Second, we're continuing to experience headwinds in our yogurt business and in display merchandising that are dampening our sales results. And we're actively working to address these headwinds. And third, we're encouraged by the progress we're making with our Consumer First efforts in a number of key businesses. 
Now let me go a bit deeper on each of these areas. Through 9 months, U.S. Retail net sales of $7.8 billion are down 2%, including 1 point of decline from acquisitions and divestitures. 
Year-to-date segment operating profit of $1.7 billion is up double digits versus the prior year. 
This significant profit performance reflects our continued focus on cost savings. We're generating strong cost of goods HMM savings in addition to the benefits from incremental cost savings projects, including Project Century. This gives us even greater confidence that our Century initiative will help unlock future HMM opportunities. 
And importantly, we're expanding our margins while we are -- make Consumer First investments on our products, our brands and our capabilities to drive improved sales growth. 
We will get back margin in the fourth quarter for the reasons Don explained, but we still expect to expand U.S. Retail operating profit margin by more than 100 points for the full year. 
We continue to see growth in our categories, with aggregate Nielsen measured retail sales up for the fourth consecutive quarter. We estimate that our categories grew more than 1% in the third quarter when including faster-growing non-measured channels. 
Our net sales results have not kept pace with category growth. As I mentioned, our year-to-date net sales declined 2%. The Annie's acquisition and Green Giant divestiture combined to contribute 1 point of that sales decline, with the impact falling most significantly on the meals 
[Audio Gap] 
which would be up, excluding our M&A activity. 
Net sales for our yogurt operating unit have been impacted by high competitive activity, while reduced display merchandising has particularly impacted our cereal and snacks results. 
On yogurt, we continue to see high levels of competitive investment as dairy prices remain near 20-year lows. Merchandise volume is up double digits for our key competition in the category with significant increases in merchandising frequency as well as lower price points in certain channels. 
In addition, we're seeing competitive advertising spending more than twice the level of a year ago. On the second quarter earnings call, we mentioned that to address these headwinds, we would increase our competitiveness in yogurt in the second half of the year, and we will. However, given the increased competitive merchandising levels, it has taken us longer than expected to secure additional in-store activity. 
We also said that we will remain disciplined and not chase unprofitable volume, and we remain committed to that principle. 
For USRO, our display merchandising was down more than 30% at a key customer in the third quarter, with the impact falling most significantly on our cereal and snacks businesses. We'll begin lapping these reductions at the end of the fourth quarter, and we'll fully lap them after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. These 2 factors combined to reduce our retail sales growth by more than 2 points in the third quarter. 
Despite these headwinds, I am encouraged by the progress we're making to expand the impact of our Consumer First strategy across a number of important businesses. We gained share in 5 of our top 6 categories in the third quarter. 
Let me share some quick examples, starting with cereal. Retail sales trends in the cereal category have been improving this fiscal year, and we have returned to share growth in recent months behind Consumer First product renovation, on-trend innovation and effective messaging. Our product renovation initiatives are working in our cereal business. Retail sales of gluten-free Cheerios varieties are up 2% since we launched after declining high single digits last year. 
As of January, 75% of our cereals no longer include artificial flavors and colors. The 7 cereals that received recipe changes in January have posted 6% retail sales growth since launch after posting a 6% decline last year. And last year's largest Consumer First renovation news, more cinnamon in Cinnamon Toast Crunch, is delivering 8% retail sales growth this year on top of 8% growth a year ago. 
Nature Valley has been a key focus for our cereal innovation efforts in recent years. Initially, we launched the brand as a protein granola and have since extended it to ready-to-eat cereal, muesli, granola bites and oatmeal. Retail sales for this franchise increased 44% last year, added up 35% so far this year through a combination of new product news, media support and sampling. The ready-to-eat cereals that we launched in January are performing well, and we will keep the momentum going next year, with more news on the business. 
So I'm bullish on our prospects for cereal growth. We'll start to lap some of the display headwinds in the fourth quarter, but more importantly, we'll continue to expand the impact of our renovation and innovation news, and we'll invest higher levels of advertising in the fourth quarter. 
We believe that yogurt is an attractive growth category now and for the long term. We're focusing on initiatives that help drive category growth by generating news, expanding usage occasions and bringing new consumers to the shelf. Over time, innovation and great marketing will be the key factors to winning in this category. 
In January, we launched the whole milk organic Annie's yogurt into the fastest -- one of the fastest-growing segments in the category. We think Annie's all-family appeal and strong organic brand equity will bring new consumers to the shelf. And we'll have more news to bring to the organic yogurt segment this summer. We're expanding our usage occasions with our 1-Up Your Cup campaign, which encourages consumers to incorporate yogurt into their snacking routine. 
Nature Valley bars, our largest business in snacks, has been impacted by reduced display merchandising in certain channels. But in a traditional grocery channel where merchandising has been were consistent, we've driven growth behind Consumer First renovation and innovation. 
Our Nature Valley Crunchy bar product renovation and our no artificial colors, flavors and sweeteners advertising are working, and we've seen excellent early results on our new Nature Valley nut butter biscuit products. As a result, year-to-date retail sales for Nature Valley grain snacks are up mid-single digits in the grocery channel. 
LÄRABAR has delivered double-digit annual growth since we acquired the business almost 8 years ago, and we believe there's still an opportunity to broaden penetration and accelerate the brand's growth. We recently began testing LÄRABAR'S first-ever TV campaign, supplemented with digital advertising, coupons and in-store merchandising. Since the campaign began airing, retail sales for LÄRABAR are up more than 40%. 
We're also maintaining positive momentum on Annie's. Retail sales were up double digits in the third quarter, and distribution is up double digits this year in each of Annie's heritage categories. As we told you at our Investor Day, there's still a great deal of distribution upside for this brand, so that will continue to be an area of focus for our sales teams. 
Platform expansions also play a key role in growing Annie's. We entered the soup and yogurt categories earlier this year and will launch 3 new cereals in the coming months. We're encourage by early feedback from consumers and customers on these launches, and we'll continue to evaluate other new platforms to further expand the Annie's business. 
These strong results on LÄRABAR and Annie's have contributed to double-digit net sales growth for our U.S. Natural & Organic business in the third quarter. 
We have completed our soup and baking seasons, and we are pleased with our performance. In ready-to-serve soup, we grew 2 points of share, driven by successful merchandising, product renovation news and good advertising. 
Our refrigerated dough business had a good baking season, with growth in retail sales and market share up 1.8 points. These results were driven by distribution gains on our top-selling products. 
And we grew dessert mix dollar share during the key baking season this year by aligning our prices more closely with our competition. Next year, we plan to bring news and innovation to help grow the dessert mixes category. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, there are a number of factors that will affect our U.S. Retail performance. We'll benefit from positive momentum on our renovation efforts and from increased media investment. We'll also begin to lap display and merchandiser inductions in the quarter, and while we still expect yogurt to be a headwind, we expect that headwind to moderate. As a result, we expect improved fourth quarter sales performance on a comparable basis although reported results will be impacted by the Green Giant sale and by a comparison to an extra week a year ago. 
To summarize my U.S. Retail comments, we are seeing strong year-to-date profit and margin performance, driven largely by cost savings realization. Although we continue to experience headwinds in the display and merchandising, we're encouraged by positive momentum we're seeing across a number of our businesses such as cereal, grain snacks, Natural & Organic, soup, refrigerated dough and desserts. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Ken."

You just heard about our performance in our U.S. Retail segment, and so let me give you an update on our other 2 business segments, starting with Convenience Stores and Foodservice. Net sale",1082,"All right, well, thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everybody. You just heard about our performance in our U.S. Retail segment, and so let me give you an update on our other 2 business segments, starting with Convenience Stores and Foodservice. 
Net sales for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment are down 2% so far this year due to index pricing on bakery flour and business exits. However, our 6 focus platforms of cereal, snacks, biscuits, mixes, yogurt and frozen meals continue to deliver excellent sales growth, with combined net sales up 6% year-to-date. 
This sales performance, combined with continued benefits from cost savings initiatives, is translating into margin expansion for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice business. Segment operating profit is up 8% so far this year, increasing this segment's profit margin to 19%. 
Frozen meals are leading our performance in Convenience Stores and Foodservice, with strong double-digit sales growth year-to-date. Mini bagels continue to grow as part of school breakfast programs, and we applied our Consumer First approach to product development in this channel when we introduced products for school lunches a year ago. Pillsbury Cheesy Pull-Aparts are our most recent introduction. Launched in November, these individually wrapped versions of cheese-stuffed bread are heated and served right in their packaging, saving labor costs and waste. 
Our bowlpacks in schools are driving mid-single-digit growth for our cereal business fiscal year-to-date as we're leveraging our no artificial colors or flavors messaging with food-service operators. 
And our yogurt business also is posting mid-single-digit net sales growth so far this year on the strength of Yoplait ParfaitPro in a variety of food-service channels, from colleges to hospitals. 
We also saw good momentum on our Kid Yogurt in the third quarter as we gained distribution for our Simply Go-Gurt products in K-12 schools. 
So we continue to like the performance we're driving for this segment by focusing on the most profitable products in the most attractive food-service channels. 
Turning to our International segment. Net sales are up 2% so far this year on a constant currency basis. The Green Giant divestiture reduced international sales growth by 1 point this fiscal year-to-date. Constant-currency segment operating profit declined 1% through the first 9 months of the year, primarily due to currency-driven inflation on imported products in certain markets and a comparison to the year ago period when profit increased 8%. 
In Canada, constant-currency net sales are down 2% this -- so far this year, with growth on a number of business lines offset by the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. 
Our grain snacks business continues to deliver good results. Retail sales are up 11% year-to-date on the strength of new product launches like Nature Valley Nut and Seed bars and Fiber One Crumble bars and innovation on our Old El Paso Mexican meals is contributing to 2% retail sales growth for this leading brand of Mexican foods. 
In Europe, net sales are up 1% fiscal year-to-date on a constant currency basis, led by good performance on ice cream and meals. Häagen-Dazs premium ice cream bars are driving 13% retail sales growth so far this year. We're introducing 2 new flavors this month and have plans to expand these bars into additional markets. 
Innovation also is contributing to 1% retail sales growth for Old El Paso dinner kits, driven in large part by increased in-store events and higher levels of advertising support. 
In yogurt, retail sales are down year-to-date as dairy deflation has led to unfavorable net price realization. However, we posted modest share growth so far this year in Europe, with good performance on Yop yogurt beverages and Perle de Lait varieties in France. 
Our focus on execution on the fundamentals drove improved net sales performance in emerging markets in the third quarter. 
Year-to-date net sales in Latin America are up 11% on a constant currency basis. We posted high single-digit net sales growth in Brazil in the third quarter, with good performance on our snacks business, benefits from pricing and incremental contributions from Carolina yogurt. As we mentioned at CAGNY last month, we acquired the Carolina business in December, along with the manufacturing and distribution infrastructure for dairy products. And we're excited about our growth prospects for yogurt in this market. 
We also continue to post excellent sales growth in Mexico, led by solid performance on snack bars, Fiber One bars in particular. We introduced the Fiber One brand in Mexico a little over a year ago, and retail sales for our wholesome snacks are up double digits so far this year. 
Now as you can see, on Slide 42, constant-currency net sales for our Asia/Pacific region grew 3% year-to-date. We saw improved performance in China in the third quarter, with net sales up low single digit. Wanchai Ferry contributed to this growth with good performance on our new Rainbow TangYuan dim sum products during the Chinese New Year. And Yoplait yogurt continues to perform well, with market share in Shanghai at 10% in the third quarter. We saw good growth on the Perle de Lait bonus packs launched in conjunction with the Chinese New Year, and we're increasing our marketing and promotional activities on the Yoplait brand to drive increased consumer awareness. 
Finally, we continue to generate double-digit sales growth so far this year in the Asia, Middle East and Africa region. Sweet snacking is leading that growth. This year, we launched new fruit flavors of Häagen-Dazs ice cream, which has driven high single-digit net sales growth. 
Betty Crocker cookie cakes launched last fall contributed to double-digit snacks growth in the region fiscal year-to-date. 
We're also posting strong double-digit net sales growth in India, where we've been increasing distribution on our cake mixes and recently launched a line of chocolate spreads. 
Overall, we're pleased with the improvement we saw in emerging markets this quarter, and we remain focused on innovation and fundamental execution to drive continued growth in these markets going forward. 
So that completes the highlights from our 3 business segments. I'll wrap up this morning's remarks with this summary. Our third quarter results were in line with our expectations. Foreign currency exchange and the Green Giant divestiture are impacting our reported figures, our financial discipline is driving operating profit margin expansion while still allowing us to invest in Consumer First renovation and innovation, and we're confident we will deliver our 2016 growth targets. 
So that concludes our prepared comments this morning. I'll ask the operator now to open up the call for questions."

And we expect that because we're starting to lap the merchandising headwind we are seeing at one of our biggest customers in the fourth quarter and because our advertising is going to be up significantly on both grain and cereal because we really believe in what we're seeing, the results from our renovation efforts. We also think, even though yogurt will continue to be a headwind in the fourth quarter, that, that business will improve behind the merchandising we talked about in the second quarter. So for us to see improved U.S. sales results, really, it is a matter of cereal and snacking behind things we understand in the merchandising area and behind great advertising."

International also, as Ken alluded to, has a number of new products, both innovation and renovation in the marketplace, that will continue to build in the quarter. In addition, there's some other things that we are lapping, some of the merchandising in USRO. We had business exits in our C&F business in Q4 last year that we'll lap. The index pricing we talked about in bakery flour in C&F, that is profit-neutral because we price with the market. But the grain price has really started coming down last year in Q4, so we will begin -- lapping that will be less bad in Q4, which will help our comparable sales growth. And then we'll have continued growth acceleration in our emerging markets, including some pricing in Latin America. And so there's a number of factors that go into improved performance in Q4."

But the additional part for us is that you got to have top line growth, and so we're very focused on innovation and being responsive to the consumer by keeping our core brands relevant, advertising that works and to drive growth. And where we're getting that formula right, we're seeing good growth in our core categories. So for us, it's finding that balance of both. We think that's the key to sustainability in this environment. And in particular, the focus on innovation and Consumer First, we think, is critically important in an environment where consumer attitudes and values about food, as you guys all know, are changing very, very rapidly. So that's really how we approach it."

The inflation, which is actually the single biggest factor because last year, Q4 was our lowest inflation of the year. This year, it's our highest inflation of the year. Last year is really when -- in the fourth quarter when dairy and grains came down, and while they're still down, they're decelerating more, so we're lapping that. And we have continued inflation in our manufacturing logistics, sugar nuts, fruit, eggs and obviously, I'd say more broadly is in the Latin American region, again, more broadly. So it is -- it's very much an inflation story in the quarter. The -- just the phasing of it is different this year than last year with a low point last year to high point this year. I wouldn't read anything into it as we look into F '17, and we'll share more full guidance with you for F '17 in a couple of months.

I guess one is a question for Ken. I've heard from a number of other CEOs, both currently in the industry and formerly in the industry, who are getting more concerned about the pressure to cut costs and the risks to food safety and quality. You guys have done a very good job over time, but even you had a recall earlier. And so I'm wondering if you could maybe speak within industry head on about the choices that are being made as the market pressures the industry to cut costs. And then second, around -- I think at CAGNY last couple of years, Ken, you've talked about kind of how some of these smaller companies get distribution. To a certain point, they hit a wall, and that wall is where the large-cap companies such as yourself can really leverage that capability. But it seems like in yogurt, it just keeps going the other way. There's so many brands out there now. It doesn't seem like they're hitting that wall. I mean, it seems like the only company that pulled back was actually the PepsiCo-Müller joint venture. Otherwise, there's just more and more brands being added to the category, and Annie's is just another example of that. And how long does it take for scale to really, I guess, win out if it does?"

It's sort of central to our mission, and that's the kind of capability that we would maintain and actually build upon even in this environment because we just think that consumer trust is sort of job 1 for us. So -- but it goes to -- your question goes to the earlier question as well about, what are we trying to do? And we're trying to do 2 things. We're very, very focused on margin expansion, and we think we have a good line of sight, and we've performed well there over the last couple of years. We have a good line of sight on other things we can do to continue to -- continue that good work. But we're equally focused on maintaining the capabilities that we need in order to drive top line growth. And so we're preserving -- we've got a very strong marketing organization in CI. We've got excellent R&D. And so those are very important things, and our product quality organization has been maintained at a very high level. So that's how we look at it. I understand the question, and I understand the concern, but that is the sort of -- we would not compromise in that area. To your comment on yogurt, there's -- I don't have the numbers in front of me on -- from what's come in and what's gone out over the last couple of years. Jeff may have those. And so there is a tremendous amount of new product activity in the yogurt area. Lots of them don't stick around for very long, so there are a lot of them that went. It's become a more competitive category. But again, where we focus on the right innovation and the right renovation, like expanding Annie's into the yogurt dairy case and other yogurt innovation initiatives that we'll announce this summer, where we have good ones, we're able to succeed because of the scale and the distribution power that we have. So we're confident that we can continue to grow there. It's an exciting space. It's a huge category globally. We have very high capability. And so we're just going to stay focused on the kind of innovation that will work in the category. I can come back to you, Eric. We can look and get some numbers maybe on how many have come in and how many have gone out. But your observation that there's a lot more in yogurt, I think, is correct. I don't know if you want to add anything, Jeff?"

I mean, it's also true that we've grown distribution over this time as well. But if we think more broadly about the kind of capabilities a big company and the scale that General Mills can bring, I don't think you have to look further than Annie's. We've driven double-digit distribution increases on Annie's over the last 2 years in the grocery trade. But even beyond that, looking at the club channel, we've grown distribution in our food-service area. We're growing Annie's in our food-service channels. And so broadly speaking, we see the kind of capability that General Mills can add to some of the smaller players and, when they hit the wall, how much better we can do. And we were starting to see the same thing with EPIC even though we've just bought that business, and we have a high degree of confidence that we'll be able to do a lot more faster than the founders alone could have done with their limited resources."

And we've even seen the benefits of things that we discontinued. We discontinued a line on Hamburger Helper, and we've seen the distribution there decrease, but we've seen the increase on our top SKUs. And as a result, we're actually starting to see our turns increase on Hamburger Helper. We've also seen the benefits of distribution on our Pillsbury dough business, and one of the things that's driving growth on our Pillsbury business is getting out of SKUs that were relatively unproductive and getting into more SKUs that are relatively productive.

And as with other segments, we expect that to strengthen in the fourth quarter. In terms of the margins, there's a couple of things that are at play. One is obviously Green Giant does impact our profit in international. We sold the North American business, so Canada, you're seeing the impact of that. And that's a low to mid-single-digit drag on the earnings for international. The other you see, we mentioned it's the currency-driven inflation on certain products. I mean, that's a long way of saying we have some transaction FX impact for businesses that we source cross-border. So for example, much of our Canadian product is sourced from the U.S. So as the Canadian dollar weakens, that increases the cost in Canada. We have the same thing across some borders in Europe. And that has been a larger drag in the second half just due to currency movements and some hedge positions that we had. And that's what you're seeing in the quarter. It will continue into the fourth quarter as well. But if you strip out Green Giant from that transaction FX, the underlying growth -- profit growth we're seeing in international is holding up quite well.

Thank you for joining us today. As noted in our press release, General Mills' third quarter results were in line with our expectations.

As noted in our press release, General Mills' third quarter results were in line with our expectations. Net sales, total segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS results declined, reflecting the effects of foreign exchange and the Green Giant divestiture. 
Net sales growth continues to be impacted by high levels of competitive activity in U.S. yogurt and lower display merchandising for U.S. Retail. However, our effort to drive more from the core is leading to improved sales trends across a number of key U.S. Retail businesses, which Jeff will expand upon in a moment. 
We continue to maintain strong margin discipline, as evidenced by our fifth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. 
Based on our results through 9 months, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2016 growth targets. 
Slide 5 summarizes our results for the third quarter. Net sales totaled $4 billion, down 8% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. 
Total segment operating profit totaled $679 million, down 1% on a constant currency basis. Net earnings increased 5% to $362 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.59 as reported. These results include $44 million of restructuring and project-related expenses and mark-to-market valuation effects. 
Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, was $0.65, down 7% from last year's third quarter. Constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS decreased 6% compared to a year ago. 
Slide 6 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Pound volume reduced sales by 5 percentage points. Positive sales mix and net price realization increased sales by 1 point, while foreign currency exchange reduced sales by 4 points. The Green Giant divestiture reduced contribution from volume growth by 4 points and reduced net sales growth by 3 points in the quarter. 
Turning to our segment results. Slide 7 summarizes U.S. Retail performance. U.S. Retail net sales decreased 7% in the third quarter driven primarily by the Green Giant divestiture, which had a 5-point negative impact on the segment's net sales growth and accounted for the entirety of the Meals operating unit decline. 
Year-to-date net sales were down 2%, including a 1-point decline from the net impact of the Green Giant sale and the Annie's acquisition. 
In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, net sales declined 2% in the third quarter. Our 6 focus platforms posted combined net sales growth of 8%, with the strongest growth in frozen meals and yogurt. 
Net sales declined in the remainder of the business, driven by market index pricing on bakery flour as well as the exit of some low-margin businesses in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Year-to-date net sales were down 2%, with 6% growth on our 6 focus platforms. 
Slide 9 summarizes our International segment net sales results. On a constant currency basis, third quarter International segment net sales were flat to last year, driven by Latin America where sales grew 16%, including double-digit growth in Mexico. Sales were up high single digits in Brazil with good performance on snacks, benefits from pricing and incremental contributions from the addition of the Carolina yogurt business. 
Net sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased 4%, including double-digit growth in India and low single-digit growth in China. 
In Europe, sales were down 2% as dairy deflation contributed to unfavorable net price realization for our yogurt business. 
In Canada, sales were down 14%, reflecting the Green Giant sale. 
In total, the Green Giant divestiture reduced International segment net sales growth by 2 points in the third quarter. 
We continue to make good progress on gross margin. Slide 10 shows that the third quarter adjusted gross margin, excluding certain items, increased 160 basis points. This is primarily due to cost savings initiatives more than offsetting modest input cost inflation. 
Our latest estimate of input cost inflation now rounds down to 1% for the full year. As of February, we're roughly 85% covered on our fiscal 2016 commodity requirements, and we now expect full year gross margins to expand by approximately 100 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 11. Total segment operating profit was down 1% in constant currency. U.S. Retail third quarter profit essentially matched last year, with continued cost savings more than offsetting the divestiture impact. 
Constant-currency international profit declined 24% in the quarter due to currency driven inflation at imported products in certain markets and the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. 
In Convenience Stores and Foodservice, profit was up 31%, driven by increased grain merchandising earnings, favorable product mix and our cost-saving efforts. 
After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $16 million in the quarter, up 19% in constant currency due primarily to volume growth from Häagen-Dazs Japan. Third quarter constant-currency net sales declined 1% for CPW, primarily due to lower sales in developed markets. 
Häagen-Dazs Japan constant-currency net sales increased 22% for the quarter, driven by excellent results on a new seasonal, hana mochi, which combines Häagen-Dazs ice cream with a traditional Japanese rice cake dessert. 
Slide 13 summaries our noteworthy income items -- other noteworthy income items in the quarter. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, increased by $12 million in the quarter. We incurred $44 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter, including $27 million recorded in cost of sales. Net interest expense decreased 4% from the prior year, driven primarily by lower average debt balances, partially offset by changes in the mix of debt. We continue to expect interest expense will be down mid-single digits for the full year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31% as reported, 5.5 points higher than prior period -- prior year period. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 30.8% this year compared to 27.5% a year ago. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be comparable to last year. 
Average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% in the quarter, in line with our full year expectations. 
And one additional item to mention here. As noted in this morning's press release, we sold our Venezuela business after the close of the third quarter. The business primarily manufactures and sells canned meats under the Underwood brand. We expect to incur a noncash charge of approximately $35 million pretax in the fourth quarter related to this sale. This charge will be excluded from adjusted earnings, and we anticipate the tax loss in this transaction will unlock approximately $20 million in incremental cash flow in fiscal 2016. 
Now let me briefly summarize our 9-month financial performance stated in constant currency. Net sales were down 1%, reflecting the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, segment operating profit increased 8%, and adjusted diluted EPS were 10% above the prior year. 
Slide 15 shows that our core working capital declined 40% versus last year's third quarter. Half of the decline is due to Green Giant divestiture and foreign currency exchange effects, and the other half reflects continued operational improvements across our businesses. This is the 12th consecutive quarter we reduced our core working capital versus the prior year. 
We continue to generate healthy levels of free cash flow. Year-to-date free cash flow is $1.4 billion, up 29% versus last year. We are on track to convert at least 95% of adjusted net sales into free cash flow this year, in line with our long-term goal. 
We also continue to return significant cash to shareholders. Through 9 months, we repurchased 10.6 million shares at an aggregate price of $602 million, and we paid $795 million in dividends. 
On March 8, we announced a dividend increase of 4.5% payable on May 2. This marks the seventh time we've increased our quarterly dividend rate since 2010. 
For the full fiscal year, we expect to return at least 90% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Cost savings from Holistic Margin Management or HMM and our incremental cost reduction projects represent an important component of our earnings growth in fiscal 2016. We have good visibility to achieving $400 million in cost of goods sold HMM savings this year, and we continue to make progress toward our goal of $500 million in savings from incremental projects by fiscal 2018. 
For the full year, we're reaffirming the guidance we updated on the second quarter earnings call. Specifically, we expect a low single-digit decline in net sales from the 2015 level that included a 53rd week and a full year of Green Giant. 
Total segment operating profit, matching last year's levels, and a low single-digit growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share, all in constant currency. We now expect the impact of currency translation to result in an $0.08 headwind to full year adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2016. 
Included in this guidance is a fourth quarter where we expect low single-digit comparable sales growth. Our reported results will reflect unfavorable foreign exchange, the impact of Green Giant sale and comparison to an extra week in the year ago period. We anticipate adjusted gross margin will be below last year, reflecting our highest quarterly inflation rate compared to our lowest quarterly inflation rate a year ago. And we expect media expense will be up as reported and up double digits, excluding currency effects, the 53rd week comparison and Green Giant. 
With that, I'll turn the microphone over to Jeff."

On Slide 20, I have summarized 3 main messages I want to leave you with today. First, we've delivered strong profit growth and margin results so far this year. Second, we're continuing to experience headwinds in our yogurt business and in display merchandising that are dampening our sales results. And we're actively working to address these headwinds. And third, we're encouraged by the progress we're making with our Consumer First efforts in a number of key businesses. 
Now let me go a bit deeper on each of these areas. Through 9 months, U.S. Retail net sales of $7.8 billion are down 2%, including 1 point of decline from acquisitions and divestitures. 
Year-to-date segment operating profit of $1.7 billion is up double digits versus the prior year. 
This significant profit performance reflects our continued focus on cost savings. We're generating strong cost of goods HMM savings in addition to the benefits from incremental cost savings projects, including Project Century. This gives us even greater confidence that our Century initiative will help unlock future HMM opportunities. 
And importantly, we're expanding our margins while we are -- make Consumer First investments on our products, our brands and our capabilities to drive improved sales growth. 
We will get back margin in the fourth quarter for the reasons Don explained, but we still expect to expand U.S. Retail operating profit margin by more than 100 points for the full year. 
We continue to see growth in our categories, with aggregate Nielsen measured retail sales up for the fourth consecutive quarter. We estimate that our categories grew more than 1% in the third quarter when including faster-growing non-measured channels. 
Our net sales results have not kept pace with category growth. As I mentioned, our year-to-date net sales declined 2%. The Annie's acquisition and Green Giant divestiture combined to contribute 1 point of that sales decline, with the impact falling most significantly on the meals 
[Audio Gap] 
which would be up, excluding our M&A activity. 
Net sales for our yogurt operating unit have been impacted by high competitive activity, while reduced display merchandising has particularly impacted our cereal and snacks results. 
On yogurt, we continue to see high levels of competitive investment as dairy prices remain near 20-year lows. Merchandise volume is up double digits for our key competition in the category with significant increases in merchandising frequency as well as lower price points in certain channels. 
In addition, we're seeing competitive advertising spending more than twice the level of a year ago. On the second quarter earnings call, we mentioned that to address these headwinds, we would increase our competitiveness in yogurt in the second half of the year, and we will. However, given the increased competitive merchandising levels, it has taken us longer than expected to secure additional in-store activity. 
We also said that we will remain disciplined and not chase unprofitable volume, and we remain committed to that principle. 
For USRO, our display merchandising was down more than 30% at a key customer in the third quarter, with the impact falling most significantly on our cereal and snacks businesses. We'll begin lapping these reductions at the end of the fourth quarter, and we'll fully lap them after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. These 2 factors combined to reduce our retail sales growth by more than 2 points in the third quarter. 
Despite these headwinds, I am encouraged by the progress we're making to expand the impact of our Consumer First strategy across a number of important businesses. We gained share in 5 of our top 6 categories in the third quarter. 
Let me share some quick examples, starting with cereal. Retail sales trends in the cereal category have been improving this fiscal year, and we have returned to share growth in recent months behind Consumer First product renovation, on-trend innovation and effective messaging. Our product renovation initiatives are working in our cereal business. Retail sales of gluten-free Cheerios varieties are up 2% since we launched after declining high single digits last year. 
As of January, 75% of our cereals no longer include artificial flavors and colors. The 7 cereals that received recipe changes in January have posted 6% retail sales growth since launch after posting a 6% decline last year. And last year's largest Consumer First renovation news, more cinnamon in Cinnamon Toast Crunch, is delivering 8% retail sales growth this year on top of 8% growth a year ago. 
Nature Valley has been a key focus for our cereal innovation efforts in recent years. Initially, we launched the brand as a protein granola and have since extended it to ready-to-eat cereal, muesli, granola bites and oatmeal. Retail sales for this franchise increased 44% last year, and are up 35% so far this year through a combination of new product news, media support and sampling. The ready-to-eat cereals that we launched in January are performing well, and we will keep the momentum going next year, with more news on the business. 
So I'm bullish on our prospects for cereal growth. We'll start to lap some of the display headwinds in the fourth quarter, but more importantly, we'll continue to expand the impact of our renovation and innovation news, and we'll invest higher levels of advertising in the fourth quarter. 
We believe that yogurt is an attractive growth category now and for the long term. We're focusing on initiatives that help drive category growth by generating news, expanding usage occasions and bringing new consumers to the shelf. Over time, innovation and great marketing will be the key factors to winning in this category. 
In January, we launched the whole milk organic Annie's Yogurt into the fastest -- one of the fastest-growing segments in the category. We think Annie's all-family appeal and strong organic brand equity will bring new consumers to the shelf. And we'll have more news to bring to the organic yogurt segment this summer. We're expanding our usage occasions with our 1-Up Your Cup campaign, which encourages consumers to incorporate yogurt into their snacking routine. 
Nature Valley bars, our largest business in snacks, has been impacted by reduced display merchandising in certain channels. But in a traditional grocery channel where merchandising has been more consistent, we've driven growth behind Consumer First renovation and innovation. 
Our Nature Valley Crunchy bar product renovation and our no artificial colors, flavors and sweeteners advertising are working, and we've seen excellent early results on our new Nature Valley nut butter biscuit products. As a result, year-to-date retail sales for Nature Valley grain snacks are up mid-single digits in the grocery channel. 
LÄRABAR has delivered double-digit annual growth since we acquired the business almost 8 years ago, and we believe there's still an opportunity to broaden penetration and accelerate the brand's growth. We recently began testing LÄRABAR'S first-ever TV campaign, supplemented with digital advertising, coupons and in-store merchandising. Since the campaign began airing, retail sales for LÄRABAR are up more than 40%. 
We're also maintaining positive momentum on Annie's. Retail sales were up double digits in the third quarter, and distribution is up double digits this year in each of Annie's heritage categories. As we told you at our Investor Day, there's still a great deal of distribution upside for this brand, so that will continue to be an area of focus for our sales teams. 
Platform expansions also play a key role in growing Annie's. We entered the soup and yogurt categories earlier this year and will launch 3 new cereals in the coming months. We're encourage by early feedback from consumers and customers on these launches, and we'll continue to evaluate other new platforms to further expand the Annie's business. 
These strong results on LÄRABAR and Annie's have contributed to double-digit net sales growth for our U.S. Natural & Organic business in the third quarter. 
We have completed our soup and baking seasons, and we are pleased with our performance. In ready-to-serve soup, we grew 2 points of share, driven by successful merchandising, product renovation news and good advertising. 
Our refrigerated dough business had a good baking season, with growth in retail sales and market share up 1.8 points. These results were driven by distribution gains on our top-selling products. 
And we grew dessert mix dollar share during the key baking season this year by aligning our prices more closely with our competition. Next year, we plan to bring news and innovation to help grow the dessert mixes category. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, there are a number of factors that will affect our U.S. Retail performance. We'll benefit from positive momentum on our renovation efforts and from increased media investment. We'll also begin to lap display and merchandiser inductions in the quarter, and while we still expect yogurt to be a headwind, we expect that headwind to moderate. As a result, we expect improved fourth quarter sales performance on a comparable basis although reported results will be impacted by the Green Giant sale and by a comparison to an extra week a year ago. 
To summarize my U.S. Retail comments, we are seeing strong year-to-date profit and margin performance, driven largely by cost savings realization. Although we continue to experience headwinds in display merchandising, we're encouraged by positive momentum we're seeing across a number of our businesses such as cereal, grain snacks, Natural & Organic, soup, refrigerated dough and desserts. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Ken."

You just heard about our performance in our U.S. Retail segment, and so let me give you an update on our other 2 business segments, starting with Convenience Stores and Foodservice. Net sale",1082,"All right, well, thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everybody. You just heard about our performance in our U.S. Retail segment, and so let me give you an update on our other 2 business segments, starting with Convenience Stores and Foodservice. 
Net sales for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment are down 2% so far this year due to index pricing on bakery flour and business exits. However, our 6 focus platforms of cereal, snacks, biscuits, mixes, yogurt and frozen meals continue to deliver excellent sales growth, with combined net sales up 6% year-to-date. 
This sales performance, combined with continued benefits from cost savings initiatives, is translating into margin expansion for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice business. Segment operating profit is up 8% so far this year, increasing this segment's profit margin to 19%. 
Frozen meals are leading our performance in Convenience Stores and Foodservice, with strong double-digit sales growth year-to-date. Mini bagels continue to grow as part of school breakfast programs, and we applied our Consumer First approach to product development in this channel when we introduced products for school lunches a year ago. Pillsbury Cheesy Pull-Aparts are our most recent introduction. Launched in November, these individually wrapped versions of cheese-stuffed bread are heated and served right in their packaging, saving labor costs and waste. 
Our bowlpacks in schools are driving mid-single-digit growth for our cereal business fiscal year-to-date as we're leveraging our no artificial colors or flavors messaging with food-service operators. 
And our yogurt business also is posting mid-single-digit net sales growth so far this year on the strength of Yoplait ParfaitPro in a variety of food-service channels, from colleges to hospitals. 
We also saw good momentum on our Kid Yogurts in the third quarter as we gained distribution for our Simply Go-Gurt products in K-12 schools. 
So we continue to like the performance we're driving for this segment by focusing on the most profitable products in the most attractive food-service channels. 
Turning to our International segment. Net sales are up 2% so far this year on a constant currency basis. The Green Giant divestiture reduced international sales growth by 1 point this fiscal year-to-date. Constant-currency segment operating profit declined 1% through the first 9 months of the year, primarily due to currency-driven inflation on imported products in certain markets and a comparison to the year ago period when profit increased 8%. 
In Canada, constant-currency net sales are down 2% this -- so far this year, with growth on a number of business lines offset by the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. 
Our grain snacks business continues to deliver good results. Retail sales are up 11% year-to-date on the strength of new product launches like Nature Valley Nut and Seed bars and Fiber One Crumble bars and innovation on our Old El Paso Mexican meals is contributing to 2% retail sales growth for this leading brand of Mexican foods. 
In Europe, net sales are up 1% fiscal year-to-date on a constant currency basis, led by good performance on ice cream and meals. Häagen-Dazs premium ice cream bars are driving 13% retail sales growth so far this year. We're introducing 2 new flavors this month and have plans to expand these bars into additional markets. 
Innovation also is contributing to 1% retail sales growth for Old El Paso dinner kits, driven in large part by increased in-store events and higher levels of advertising support. 
In yogurt, retail sales are down year-to-date as dairy deflation has led to unfavorable net price realization. However, we posted modest share growth so far this year in Europe, with good performance on Yop yogurt beverages and Perle de Lait varieties in France. 
Our focus on execution on the fundamentals drove improved net sales performance in emerging markets in the third quarter. 
Year-to-date net sales in Latin America are up 11% on a constant currency basis. We posted high single-digit net sales growth in Brazil in the third quarter, with good performance on our snacks business, benefits from pricing and incremental contributions from Carolina yogurt. As we mentioned at CAGNY last month, we acquired the Carolina business in December, along with the manufacturing and distribution infrastructure for dairy products. And we're excited about our growth prospects for yogurt in this market. 
We also continue to post excellent sales growth in Mexico, led by solid performance on snack bars, Fiber One bars in particular. We introduced the Fiber One brand in Mexico a little over a year ago, and retail sales for our wholesome snacks are up double digits so far this year. 
Now as you can see, on Slide 42, constant-currency net sales for our Asia/Pacific region grew 3% year-to-date. We saw improved performance in China in the third quarter, with net sales up low single digit. Wanchai Ferry contributed to this growth with good performance on our new Rainbow TangYuan dim sum products during the Chinese New Year. And Yoplait yogurt continues to perform well, with market share in Shanghai at 10% in the third quarter. We saw good growth on the Perle de Lait bonus packs launched in conjunction with the Chinese New Year, and we're increasing our marketing and promotional activities on the Yoplait brand to drive increased consumer awareness. 
Finally, we continue to generate double-digit sales growth so far this year in the Asia, Middle East and Africa region. Sweet snacking is leading that growth. This year, we launched new fruit flavors of Häagen-Dazs ice cream, which has driven high single-digit net sales growth. 
Betty Crocker cookie cakes launched last fall contributed to double-digit snacks growth in the region fiscal year-to-date. 
We're also posting strong double-digit net sales growth in India, where we've been increasing distribution on our cake mixes and recently launched a line of chocolate spreads. 
Overall, we're pleased with the improvement we saw in emerging markets this quarter, and we remain focused on innovation and fundamental execution to drive continued growth in these markets going forward. 
So that completes the highlights from our 3 business segments. I'll wrap up this morning's remarks with this summary. Our third quarter results were in line with our expectations. Foreign currency exchange and the Green Giant divestiture are impacting our reported figures, our financial discipline is driving operating profit margin expansion while still allowing us to invest in Consumer First renovation and innovation, and we're confident we will deliver our 2016 growth targets. 
So that concludes our prepared comments this morning. I'll ask the operator now to open up the call for questions."

We also think, even though yogurt will continue to be a headwind in the fourth quarter, that, that business will improve behind the merchandising we talked about in the second quarter.

International also, as Ken alluded to, has a number of new products, both innovation and renovation in the marketplace, that will continue to build in the quarter. In addition, there's some other things that we are lapping, some of the merchandising in USRO. We had business exits in our C&F business in Q4 last year that we'll lap. The index pricing we talked about in bakery flour in C&F, that is profit-neutral because we price with the market. But the grain price has really started coming down last year in Q4, so we will begin -- lapping that will be less bad in Q4, which will help our comparable sales growth. And then we'll have continued growth acceleration in our emerging markets, including some pricing in Latin America. And so there's a number of factors that go into improved performance in Q4."

To a certain point, they hit a wall, and that wall is where the large-cap companies such as yourself can really leverage that capability. But it seems like in yogurt, it just keeps going the other way. There's so many brands out there now. It doesn't seem like they're hitting that wall. I mean, it seems like the only company that pulled back was actually the PepsiCo-Müller joint venture. Otherwise, there's just more and more brands being added to the category, and Annie's is just another example of that. And how long does it take for scale to really, I guess, win out if it does?"

And I can't really -- I understand the observation, Eric, and the concern that you might hear. I can't speak for the industry. I can only speak for us. And clearly, we are very, very focused on product safety and product quality. It's sort of central to our mission, and that's the kind of capability that we would maintain and actually build upon even in this environment because we just think that consumer trust is sort of job 1 for us. So -- but it goes to -- your question goes to the earlier question as well about, what are we trying to do? And we're trying to do 2 things. We're very, very focused on margin expansion, and we think we have a good line of sight, and we've performed well there over the last couple of years. We have a good line of sight on other things we can do to continue to -- continue that good work. But we're equally focused on maintaining the capabilities that we need in order to drive top line growth. And so we're preserving -- we've got a very strong marketing organization in CI. We've got excellent R&D. And so those are very important things, and our product quality organization has been maintained at a very high level. So that's how we look at it. I understand the question, and I understand the concern, but that is the sort of -- we would not compromise in that area. To your comment on yogurt, there's -- I don't have the numbers in front of me on -- from what's come in and what's gone out over the last couple of years. Jeff may have those. And so there is a tremendous amount of new product activity in the yogurt area. Lots of them don't stick around for very long, so there are a lot of them that went. It's become a more competitive category. But again, where we focus on the right innovation and the right renovation, like expanding Annie's into the yogurt dairy case and other yogurt innovation initiatives that we'll announce this summer, where we have good ones, we're able to succeed because of the scale and the distribution power that we have. So we're confident that we can continue to grow there. It's an exciting space. It's a huge category globally. We have very high capability. And so we're just going to stay focused on the kind of innovation that will work in the category. I can come back to you, Eric. We can look and get some numbers maybe on how many have come in and how many have gone out. But your observation that there's a lot more in yogurt, I think, is correct. I don't know if you want to add anything, Jeff?"

I mean, it's also true that we've grown distribution over this time as well. But if we think more broadly about the kind of capabilities a big company and the scale that General Mills can bring, I don't think you have to look further than Annie's. We've driven double-digit distribution increases on Annie's over the last 2 years in the grocery trade. But even beyond that, looking at the club channel, we've grown distribution in our food-service area. We're growing Annie's in our food-service channels. And so broadly speaking, we see the kind of capability that General Mills can add to some of these smaller players and, when they hit the wall, how much better we can do. And we're starting to see the same thing with EPIC even though we've just bought that business, and we have a high degree of confidence that we'll be able to do a lot more faster than the founders alone could have done with their limited resources."

And we've even seen the benefits of things that we've discontinued. We discontinued a line on Hamburger Helper, and we've seen the distribution there decrease, but we've seen the increase on our top SKUs. And as a result, we're actually starting to see our turns increase on Hamburger Helper. We've also seen the benefits of distribution on our Pillsbury dough business, and one of the things that's driving growth on our Pillsbury business is getting out of SKUs that were relatively unproductive and getting into more SKUs that are relatively productive. And so we're really pleased with the progress we've seen. We have more to do. We'll keep at this on a multiyear plan to get all of our distribution on our top items, but we're progressing as we thought we would. And we see more room to go.

So we feel good about the innovation we've done, but as we look ahead, we -- actually, we see even greater potential for innovation in some faster-growing segments and whether that's building on things like Whips! or getting into -- even further into organic, there is certainly runway ahead of us for innovation. And we know, in a category like yogurt, just like in cereal, it is going to be the innovation and the marketing that drives long-term growth because dairy prices are at a 20-year low, and we'll see how long they stay there, but eventually, they'll go back up.

And as with other segments, we expect that to strengthen in the fourth quarter. In terms of the margins, there's a couple of things that are at play. One is obviously Green Giant does impact our profit in international. We sold the North American business, so Canada, you're seeing the impact of that. And that's a low to mid-single-digit drag on the earnings for international. The other you see, we mentioned it's the currency-driven inflation on certain products. I mean, that's a long way of saying we have some transaction FX impact for businesses that we source cross-border. So for example, much of our Canadian product is sourced from the U.S. So as the Canadian dollar weakens, that increases the cost in Canada. We have the same thing across some borders in Europe. And that has been a larger drag in the second half just due to currency movements and some hedge positions that we had. And that's what you're seeing in the quarter. It will continue into the fourth quarter as well. But if you strip out Green Giant from that transaction FX, the underlying growth -- profit growth we're seeing in international is holding up quite well.

Thank you for joining us today. As noted in our press release, General Mills' third quarter results were in line with our expectations.

As noted in our press release, General Mills' third quarter results were in line with our expectations. Net sales, total segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS results declined, reflecting the effects of foreign exchange and the Green Giant divestiture. 
Net sales growth continues to be impacted by high levels of competitive activity in U.S. yogurt and lower display merchandising for U.S. Retail. However, our effort to drive more from the core is leading to improved sales trends across a number of key U.S. Retail businesses, which Jeff will expand upon in a moment. 
We continue to maintain strong margin discipline, as evidenced by our fifth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. 
Based on our results through 9 months, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2016 growth targets. 
Slide 5 summarizes our results for the third quarter. Net sales totaled $4 billion, down 8% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. 
Total segment operating profit totaled $679 million, down 1% on a constant currency basis. Net earnings increased 5% to $362 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.59 as reported. These results include $44 million of restructuring and project-related expenses and mark-to-market valuation effects. 
Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, was $0.65, down 7% from last year's third quarter. Constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS decreased 6% compared to a year ago. 
Slide 6 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Pound volume reduced sales by 5 percentage points. Positive sales mix and net price realization increased sales by 1 point, while foreign currency exchange reduced sales by 4 points. The Green Giant divestiture reduced contribution from volume growth by 4 points and reduced net sales growth by 3 points in the quarter. 
Turning to our segment results. Slide 7 summarizes U.S. Retail performance. U.S. Retail net sales decreased 7% in the third quarter driven primarily by the Green Giant divestiture, which had a 5-point negative impact on the segment's net sales growth and accounted for the entirety of the Meals operating unit decline. 
Year-to-date net sales were down 2%, including a 1-point decline from the net impact of the Green Giant sale and the Annie's acquisition. 
In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, net sales declined 2% in the third quarter. Our 6 focus platforms posted combined net sales growth of 8%, with the strongest growth in frozen meals and yogurt. 
Net sales declined in the remainder of the business, driven by market index pricing on bakery flour as well as the exit of some low-margin businesses in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Year-to-date net sales were down 2%, with 6% growth on our 6 focus platforms. 
Slide 9 summarizes our International segment net sales results. On a constant currency basis, third quarter International segment net sales were flat to last year, driven by Latin America where sales grew 16%, including double-digit growth in Mexico. Sales were up high single digits in Brazil with good performance on snacks, benefits from pricing and incremental contributions from the addition of the Carolina yogurt business. 
Net sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased 4%, including double-digit growth in India and low single-digit growth in China. 
In Europe, sales were down 2% as dairy deflation contributed to unfavorable net price realization for our yogurt business. 
In Canada, sales were down 14%, reflecting the Green Giant sale. 
In total, the Green Giant divestiture reduced International segment net sales growth by 2 points in the third quarter. 
We continue to make good progress on gross margin. Slide 10 shows that the third quarter adjusted gross margin, excluding certain items, increased 160 basis points. This is primarily due to cost savings initiatives more than offsetting modest input cost inflation. 
Our latest estimate of input cost inflation now rounds down to 1% for the full year. As of February, we're roughly 85% covered on our fiscal 2016 commodity requirements, and we now expect full year gross margins to expand by approximately 100 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 11. Total segment operating profit was down 1% in constant currency. U.S. Retail third quarter profit essentially matched last year, with continued cost savings more than offsetting the divestiture impact. 
Constant-currency international profit declined 24% in the quarter due to currency driven inflation at imported products in certain markets and the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. 
In Convenience Stores and Foodservice, profit was up 31%, driven by increased grain merchandising earnings, favorable product mix and our cost-saving efforts. 
After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $16 million in the quarter, up 19% in constant currency due primarily to volume growth from Häagen-Dazs Japan. Third quarter constant-currency net sales declined 1% for CPW, primarily due to lower sales in developed markets. 
Häagen-Dazs Japan constant-currency net sales increased 22% for the quarter, driven by excellent results on a new seasonal, hana mochi, which combines Häagen-Dazs ice cream with a traditional Japanese rice cake dessert. 
Slide 13 summaries our noteworthy income items -- other noteworthy income items in the quarter. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, increased by $12 million in the quarter. We incurred $44 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter, including $27 million recorded in cost of sales. Net interest expense decreased 4% from the prior year, driven primarily by lower average debt balances, partially offset by changes in the mix of debt. We continue to expect interest expense will be down mid-single digits for the full year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31% as reported, 5.5 points higher than prior period -- prior year period. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 30.8% this year compared to 27.5% a year ago. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be comparable to last year. 
Average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% in the quarter, in line with our full year expectations. 
And one additional item to mention here. As noted in this morning's press release, we sold our Venezuela business after the close of the third quarter. The business primarily manufactures and sells canned meats under the Underwood brand. We expect to incur a noncash charge of approximately $35 million pretax in the fourth quarter related to this sale. This charge will be excluded from adjusted earnings, and we anticipate the tax loss in this transaction will unlock approximately $20 million in incremental cash flow in fiscal 2016. 
Now let me briefly summarize our 9-month financial performance stated in constant currency. Net sales were down 1%, reflecting the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, segment operating profit increased 8%, and adjusted diluted EPS were 10% above the prior year. 
Slide 15 shows that our core working capital declined 40% versus last year's third quarter. Half of the decline is due to Green Giant divestiture and foreign currency exchange effects, and the other half reflects continued operational improvements across our businesses. This is the 12th consecutive quarter we reduced our core working capital versus the prior year. 
We continue to generate healthy levels of free cash flow. Year-to-date free cash flow is $1.4 billion, up 29% versus last year. We are on track to convert at least 95% of adjusted net sales into free cash flow this year, in line with our long-term goal. 
We also continue to return significant cash to shareholders. Through 9 months, we repurchased 10.6 million shares at an aggregate price of $602 million, and we paid $795 million in dividends. 
On March 8, we announced a dividend increase of 4.5% payable on May 2. This marks the seventh time we've increased our quarterly dividend rate since 2010. 
For the full fiscal year, we expect to return at least 90% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Cost savings from Holistic Margin Management or HMM and our incremental cost reduction projects represent an important component of our earnings growth in fiscal 2016. We have good visibility to achieving $400 million in cost of goods sold HMM savings this year, and we continue to make progress toward our goal of $500 million in savings from incremental projects by fiscal 2018. 
For the full year, we're reaffirming the guidance we updated on the second quarter earnings call. Specifically, we expect a low single-digit decline in net sales from the 2015 level that included a 53rd week and a full year of Green Giant. 
Total segment operating profit, matching last year's levels, and a low single-digit growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share, all in constant currency. We now expect the impact of currency translation to result in an $0.08 headwind to full year adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2016. 
Included in this guidance is a fourth quarter where we expect low single-digit comparable sales growth. Our reported results will reflect unfavorable foreign exchange, the impact of Green Giant sale and comparison to an extra week in the year ago period. We anticipate adjusted gross margin will be below last year, reflecting our highest quarterly inflation rate compared to our lowest quarterly inflation rate a year ago. And we expect media expense will be up as reported and up double digits, excluding currency effects, the 53rd week comparison and Green Giant. 
With that, I'll turn the microphone over to Jeff."

On Slide 20, I have summarized 3 main messages I want to leave you with today. First, we've delivered strong profit growth and margin results so far this year. Second, we're continuing to experience headwinds in our yogurt business and in display merchandising that are dampening our sales results. And we're actively working to address these headwinds. And third, we're encouraged by the progress we're making with our Consumer First efforts in a number of key businesses. 
Now let me go a bit deeper on each of these areas. Through 9 months, U.S. Retail net sales of $7.8 billion are down 2%, including 1 point of decline from acquisitions and divestitures. 
Year-to-date segment operating profit of $1.7 billion is up double digits versus the prior year. 
This significant profit performance reflects our continued focus on cost savings. We're generating strong cost of goods HMM savings in addition to the benefits from incremental cost savings projects, including Project Century. This gives us even greater confidence that our Century initiative will help unlock future HMM opportunities. 
And importantly, we're expanding our margins while we are -- make Consumer First investments on our products, our brands and our capabilities to drive improved sales growth. 
We will get back margin in the fourth quarter for the reasons Don explained, but we still expect to expand U.S. Retail operating profit margin by more than 100 points for the full year. 
We continue to see growth in our categories, with aggregate Nielsen measured retail sales up for the fourth consecutive quarter. We estimate that our categories grew more than 1% in the third quarter when including faster-growing non-measured channels. 
Our net sales results have not kept pace with category growth. As I mentioned, our year-to-date net sales declined 2%. The Annie's acquisition and Green Giant divestiture combined to contribute 1 point of that sales decline, with the impact falling most significantly on the meals 
[Audio Gap] 
which would be up, excluding our M&A activity. 
Net sales for our yogurt operating unit have been impacted by high competitive activity, while reduced display merchandising has particularly impacted our cereal and snacks results. 
On yogurt, we continue to see high levels of competitive investment as dairy prices remain near 20-year lows. Merchandise volume is up double digits for our key competition in the category with significant increases in merchandising frequency as well as lower price points in certain channels. 
In addition, we're seeing competitive advertising spending more than twice the level of a year ago. On the second quarter earnings call, we mentioned that to address these headwinds, we would increase our competitiveness in yogurt in the second half of the year, and we will. However, given the increased competitive merchandising levels, it has taken us longer than expected to secure additional in-store activity. 
We also said that we will remain disciplined and not chase unprofitable volume, and we remain committed to that principle. 
For USRO, our display merchandising was down more than 30% at a key customer in the third quarter, with the impact falling most significantly on our cereal and snacks businesses. We'll begin lapping these reductions at the end of the fourth quarter, and we'll fully lap them after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. These 2 factors combined to reduce our retail sales growth by more than 2 points in the third quarter. 
Despite these headwinds, I am encouraged by the progress we're making to expand the impact of our Consumer First strategy across a number of important businesses. We gained share in 5 of our top 6 categories in the third quarter. 
Let me share some quick examples, starting with cereal. Retail sales trends in the cereal category have been improving this fiscal year, and we have returned to share growth in recent months behind Consumer First product renovation, on-trend innovation and effective messaging. Our product renovation initiatives are working in our cereal business. Retail sales of gluten-free Cheerios varieties are up 2% since we launched after declining high single digits last year. 
As of January, 75% of our cereals no longer include artificial flavors and colors. The 7 cereals that received recipe changes in January have posted 6% retail sales growth since launch after posting a 6% decline last year. And last year's largest Consumer First renovation news, more cinnamon in Cinnamon Toast Crunch, is delivering 8% retail sales growth this year on top of 8% growth a year ago. 
Nature Valley has been a key focus for our cereal innovation efforts in recent years. Initially, we launched the brand as a protein granola and have since extended it to ready-to-eat cereal, muesli, granola bites and oatmeal. Retail sales for this franchise increased 44% last year, and are up 35% so far this year through a combination of new product news, media support and sampling. The ready-to-eat cereals that we launched in January are performing well, and we will keep the momentum going next year, with more news on the business. 
So I'm bullish on our prospects for cereal growth. We'll start to lap some of the display headwinds in the fourth quarter, but more importantly, we'll continue to expand the impact of our renovation and innovation news, and we'll invest higher levels of advertising in the fourth quarter. 
We believe that yogurt is an attractive growth category now and for the long term. We're focusing on initiatives that help drive category growth by generating news, expanding usage occasions and bringing new consumers to the shelf. Over time, innovation and great marketing will be the key factors to winning in this category. 
In January, we launched the whole milk organic Annie's Yogurt into the fastest -- one of the fastest-growing segments in the category. We think Annie's all-family appeal and strong organic brand equity will bring new consumers to the shelf. And we'll have more news to bring to the organic yogurt segment this summer. We're expanding our usage occasions with our 1-Up Your Cup campaign, which encourages consumers to incorporate yogurt into their snacking routine. 
Nature Valley bars, our largest business in snacks, has been impacted by reduced display merchandising in certain channels. But in a traditional grocery channel where merchandising has been more consistent, we've driven growth behind Consumer First renovation and innovation. 
Our Nature Valley Crunchy bar product renovation and our no artificial colors, flavors and sweeteners advertising are working, and we've seen excellent early results on our new Nature Valley nut butter biscuit products. As a result, year-to-date retail sales for Nature Valley grain snacks are up mid-single digits in the grocery channel. 
LÄRABAR has delivered double-digit annual growth since we acquired the business almost 8 years ago, and we believe there's still an opportunity to broaden penetration and accelerate the brand's growth. We recently began testing LÄRABAR'S first-ever TV campaign, supplemented with digital advertising, coupons and in-store merchandising. Since the campaign began airing, retail sales for LÄRABAR are up more than 40%. 
We're also maintaining positive momentum on Annie's. Retail sales were up double digits in the third quarter, and distribution is up double digits this year in each of Annie's heritage categories. As we told you at our Investor Day, there's still a great deal of distribution upside for this brand, so that will continue to be an area of focus for our sales teams. 
Platform expansions also play a key role in growing Annie's. We entered the soup and yogurt categories earlier this year and will launch 3 new cereals in the coming months. We're encouraged by early feedback from consumers and customers on these launches, and we'll continue to evaluate other new platforms to further expand the Annie's business. 
These strong results on LÄRABAR and Annie's have contributed to double-digit net sales growth for our U.S. Natural & Organic business in the third quarter. 
We have completed our soup and baking seasons, and we are pleased with our performance. In ready-to-serve soup, we grew 2 points of share, driven by successful merchandising, product renovation news and good advertising. 
Our refrigerated dough business had a good baking season, with growth in retail sales and market share up 1.8 points. These results were driven by distribution gains on our top-selling products. 
And we grew dessert mix dollar share during the key baking season this year by aligning our prices more closely with our competition. Next year, we plan to bring news and innovation to help grow the dessert mixes category. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, there are a number of factors that will affect our U.S. Retail performance. We'll benefit from positive momentum on our renovation efforts and from increased media investment. We'll also begin to lap display and merchandiser inductions in the quarter, and while we still expect yogurt to be a headwind, we expect that headwind to moderate. As a result, we expect improved fourth quarter sales performance on a comparable basis although reported results will be impacted by the Green Giant sale and by a comparison to an extra week a year ago. 
To summarize my U.S. Retail comments, we are seeing strong year-to-date profit and margin performance, driven largely by cost savings realization. Although we continue to experience headwinds in display merchandising, we're encouraged by positive momentum we're seeing across a number of our businesses such as cereal, grain snacks, Natural & Organic, soup, refrigerated dough and desserts. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Ken."

You just heard about our performance in our U.S. Retail segment, and so let me give you an update on our other 2 business segments, starting with Convenience Stores and Foodservice. Net sale",1082,"All right, well, thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everybody. You just heard about our performance in our U.S. Retail segment, and so let me give you an update on our other 2 business segments, starting with Convenience Stores and Foodservice. 
Net sales for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment are down 2% so far this year due to index pricing on bakery flour and business exits. However, our 6 focus platforms of cereal, snacks, biscuits, mixes, yogurt and frozen meals continue to deliver excellent sales growth, with combined net sales up 6% year-to-date. 
This sales performance, combined with continued benefits from cost savings initiatives, is translating into margin expansion for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice business. Segment operating profit is up 8% so far this year, increasing this segment's profit margin to 19%. 
Frozen meals are leading our performance in Convenience Stores and Foodservice, with strong double-digit sales growth year-to-date. Mini bagels continue to grow as part of school breakfast programs, and we applied our Consumer First approach to product development in this channel when we introduced products for school lunches a year ago. Pillsbury Cheesy Pull-Aparts are our most recent introduction. Launched in November, these individually wrapped versions of cheese-stuffed bread are heated and served right in their packaging, saving labor costs and waste. 
Our bowlpacks in schools are driving mid-single-digit growth for our cereal business fiscal year-to-date as we're leveraging our no artificial colors or flavors messaging with food-service operators. 
And our yogurt business also is posting mid-single-digit net sales growth so far this year on the strength of Yoplait ParfaitPro in a variety of food-service channels, from colleges to hospitals. 
We also saw good momentum on our Kid Yogurts in the third quarter as we gained distribution for our Simply Go-Gurt products in K-12 schools. 
So we continue to like the performance we're driving for this segment by focusing on the most profitable products in the most attractive food-service channels. 
Turning to our International segment. Net sales are up 2% so far this year on a constant currency basis. The Green Giant divestiture reduced international sales growth by 1 point this fiscal year-to-date. Constant-currency segment operating profit declined 1% through the first 9 months of the year, primarily due to currency-driven inflation on imported products in certain markets and a comparison to the year ago period when profit increased 8%. 
In Canada, constant-currency net sales are down 2% this -- so far this year, with growth on a number of business lines offset by the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. 
Our grain snacks business continues to deliver good results. Retail sales are up 11% year-to-date on the strength of new product launches like Nature Valley Nut and Seed bars and Fiber One Crumble bars and innovation on our Old El Paso Mexican meals is contributing to 2% retail sales growth for this leading brand of Mexican foods. 
In Europe, net sales are up 1% fiscal year-to-date on a constant currency basis, led by good performance on ice cream and meals. Häagen-Dazs premium ice cream bars are driving 13% retail sales growth so far this year. We're introducing 2 new flavors this month and have plans to expand these bars into additional markets. 
Innovation also is contributing to 1% retail sales growth for Old El Paso dinner kits, driven in large part by increased in-store events and higher levels of advertising support. 
In yogurt, retail sales are down year-to-date as dairy deflation has led to unfavorable net price realization. However, we posted modest share growth so far this year in Europe, with good performance on Yop yogurt beverages and Perle de Lait varieties in France. 
Our focus on execution on the fundamentals drove improved net sales performance in emerging markets in the third quarter. 
Year-to-date net sales in Latin America are up 11% on a constant currency basis. We posted high single-digit net sales growth in Brazil in the third quarter, with good performance on our snacks business, benefits from pricing and incremental contributions from Carolina yogurt. As we mentioned at CAGNY last month, we acquired the Carolina business in December, along with the manufacturing and distribution infrastructure for dairy products. And we're excited about our growth prospects for yogurt in this market. 
We also continue to post excellent sales growth in Mexico, led by solid performance on snack bars, Fiber One bars in particular. We introduced the Fiber One brand in Mexico a little over a year ago, and retail sales for our wholesome snacks are up double digits so far this year. 
Now as you can see, on Slide 42, constant-currency net sales for our Asia/Pacific region grew 3% year-to-date. We saw improved performance in China in the third quarter, with net sales up low single digit. Wanchai Ferry contributed to this growth with good performance on our new Rainbow TangYuan dim sum products during the Chinese New Year. And Yoplait yogurt continues to perform well, with market share in Shanghai at 10% in the third quarter. We saw good growth on the Perle de Lait bonus packs launched in conjunction with the Chinese New Year, and we're increasing our marketing and promotional activities on the Yoplait brand to drive increased consumer awareness. 
Finally, we continue to generate double-digit sales growth so far this year in the Asia, Middle East and Africa region. Sweet snacking is leading that growth. This year, we launched new fruit flavors of Häagen-Dazs ice cream, which has driven high single-digit net sales growth. 
Betty Crocker cookie cakes launched last fall contributed to double-digit snacks growth in the region fiscal year-to-date. 
We're also posting strong double-digit net sales growth in India, where we've been increasing distribution on our cake mixes and recently launched a line of chocolate spreads. 
Overall, we're pleased with the improvement we saw in emerging markets this quarter, and we remain focused on innovation and fundamental execution to drive continued growth in these markets going forward. 
So that completes the highlights from our 3 business segments. I'll wrap up this morning's remarks with this summary. Our third quarter results were in line with our expectations. Foreign currency exchange and the Green Giant divestiture are impacting our reported figures, our financial discipline is driving operating profit margin expansion while still allowing us to invest in Consumer First renovation and innovation, and we're confident we will deliver our 2016 growth targets. 
So that concludes our prepared comments this morning. I'll ask the operator now to open up the call for questions."

We also think, even though yogurt will continue to be a headwind in the fourth quarter, that, that business will improve behind the merchandising we talked about in the second quarter. So for us to see improved U.S. sales results, really, it is a matter of cereal and snacking behind things we understand in the merchandising area and behind great advertising."

In addition, there's some other things that we are lapping, some of the merchandising in USRO. We had business exits in our C&F business in Q4 last year that we'll lap. The index pricing we talked about in bakery flour in C&F, that is profit-neutral because we price with the market. But the grain price has really started coming down last year in Q4, so we will begin -- lapping that will be less bad in Q4, which will help our comparable sales growth. And then we'll have continued growth acceleration in our emerging markets, including some pricing in Latin America. And so there's a number of factors that go into improved performance in Q4."

So we're very highly focused on the margin piece, and you're seeing that this year with good gains, and we expect that to continue as we go forward. But the additional part for us is that you got to have top line growth, and so we're very focused on innovation and being responsive to the consumer by keeping our core brands relevant, advertising that works and to drive growth. And where we're getting that formula right, we're seeing good growth in our core categories. So for us, it's finding that balance of both.

As we -- as the year has unfolded in the fourth quarter, we're still going to benefit obviously from strong HMM, but the merch timing that we talked about and particularly what we're lapping, a lower merch period last year was higher this year. The inflation, which is actually the single biggest factor because last year, Q4 was our lowest inflation of the year. This year, it's our highest inflation of the year. Last year is really when -- in the fourth quarter is when dairy and grains came down, and while they're still down, they're decelerating [ph] more, so we're lapping that. And we have continued inflation in our manufacturing logistics, sugar nuts, fruit, eggs and obviously, I'd say more broadly just in the Latin American region, again, more broadly. So it is -- it's very much an inflation story in the quarter. The -- just the phasing of it is different this year than last year with a low point last year and a high point this year. I wouldn't read anything into it as we look into F '17, and we'll share more full guidance with you for F '17 in a couple of months.

I guess one is a question for Ken. I've heard from a number of other CEOs, both currently in the industry and formerly in the industry, who are getting more concerned about the pressure to cut costs and the risks to food safety and quality. You guys have done a very good job over time, but even you had a recall earlier. And so I'm wondering if you could maybe speak with an industry hat on about the choices that are being made as the market pressures the industry to cut costs. And then second, around -- I think at CAGNY last couple of years, Ken, you've talked about kind of how some of these smaller companies get distribution. To a certain point, they hit a wall, and that wall is where the large-cap companies such as yourself can really leverage that capability. But it seems like in yogurt, it just keeps going the other way. There's so many brands out there now. It doesn't seem like they're hitting that wall. I mean, it seems like the only company that pulled back was actually the PepsiCo-Müller joint venture. Otherwise, there's just more and more brands being added to the category, and Annie's is just another example of that. And how long does it take for scale to really, I guess, win out if it does?"

It's sort of central to our mission, and that's the kind of capability that we would maintain and actually build upon even in this environment because we just think that consumer trust is sort of job 1 for us. So -- but it goes to -- your question goes to the earlier question as well about, what are we trying to do? And we're trying to do 2 things. We're very, very focused on margin expansion, and we think we have a good line of sight, and we've performed well there over the last couple of years. We have a good line of sight on other things we can do to continue to -- continue that good work. But we're equally focused on maintaining the capabilities that we need in order to drive top line growth. And so we're preserving -- we've got a very strong marketing organization in CI. We've got excellent R&D. And so those are very important things, and our product quality organization has been maintained at a very high level. So that's how we look at it. I understand the question, and I understand the concern, but that is the sort of -- we would not compromise in that area. To your comment on yogurt, there's -- I don't have the numbers in front of me on -- from what's come in and what's gone out over the last couple of years. Jeff may have those. And so there is a tremendous amount of new product activity in the yogurt area. Lots of them don't stick around for very long, so there are a lot of them that went. It's become a more competitive category. But again, where we focus on the right innovation and the right renovation, like expanding Annie's into the yogurt dairy case and other yogurt innovation initiatives that we'll announce this summer, where we have good ones, we're able to succeed because of the scale and the distribution power that we have. So we're confident that we can continue to grow there. It's an exciting space. It's a huge category globally. We have very high capability. And so we're just going to stay focused on the kind of innovation that will work in the category. I can come back to you, Eric. We can look and get some numbers maybe on how many have come in and how many have gone out. But your observation that there's a lot more in yogurt, I think, is correct. I don't know if you want to add anything, Jeff?"

We've driven double-digit distribution increases on Annie's over the last 2 years in the grocery trade. But even beyond that, looking at the club channel, we've grown distribution in our food-service area. We're growing Annie's in our food-service channels. And so broadly speaking, we see the kind of capability that General Mills can add to some of these smaller players and, when they hit the wall, how much better we can do. And we're starting to see the same thing with EPIC even though we've just bought that business, and we have a high degree of confidence that we'll be able to do a lot more faster than the founders alone could have done with their limited resources."

We discontinued a line on Hamburger Helper, and we've seen the distribution there decrease, but we've seen the increase on our top SKUs. And as a result, we're actually starting to see our turns increase on Hamburger Helper.

And as with other segments, we expect that to strengthen in the fourth quarter. In terms of the margins, there's a couple of things that are at play. One is obviously Green Giant does impact our profit in international. We sold the North American business, so Canada, you're seeing the impact of that. And that's a low to mid-single-digit drag on the earnings for international. The other you see, we mentioned it's the currency-driven inflation on certain products. I mean, that's a long way of saying we have some transaction FX impact for businesses that we source cross-border. So for example, much of our Canadian product is sourced from the U.S. So as the Canadian dollar weakens, that increases the cost in Canada. We have the same thing across some borders in Europe. And that has been a larger drag in the second half just due to currency movements and some hedge positions that we had. And that's what you're seeing in the quarter. It will continue into the fourth quarter as well. But if you strip out Green Giant from that transaction FX, the underlying growth -- profit growth we're seeing in international is holding up quite well. And that's what we would expect to continue to see as we move into '17."

Fiscal 2016 was an important step forward for General Mills. We're encouraged by the traction we start off Consumer First initiative on many important businesses. Our operating performance strengthened as we return",1584,"Thank you, Ken, and good morning to all. Fiscal 2016 was an important step forward for General Mills. We're encouraged by the traction we start off Consumer First initiative on many important businesses. Our operating performance strengthened as we returned to growth in organic sales and segment operating profit. We've made good progress in margin expansion, we exceeded our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. We took important strategic actions during the year to reshape our portfolio for growth, including the divestiture of the Green Giant business in North America, significant category expansion to the Annie's brand, the launch of Yoplait in China and the acquisition of EPIC Provisions meat snacks in the U.S. and the Carolina yogurt business in Brazil. 
But we didn't hit the market everywhere. We're disappointed in our performance in U.S. yogurt and our China results, excluding the Yoplait launch, finished below our expectations and the external environment in that market remains challenging. 
We also experienced merchandising headwinds in a large U.S. customer, which we should lap after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
As noted in this morning's press release, we're building on successes in fiscal 2016 to increase our fiscal 2018 cost-savings target and accelerate an increase our adjusted operating profit margin goal. Our cost-savings initiatives, which includes -- which include Project Century, Catalyst and Compass and further administrative cost savings from zero-based budgeting generated $350 million in total annual savings in fiscal 2016 ahead of our original target. 
We have good visibility to continue cost savings over the next 2 years and as a result, we're increasing our total annual savings target to $600 million by fiscal 2018, up from the previous target of $500 million. 
We're also implementing further efforts to optimize our spending, reduce complexity and streamline our operations to drive profitable growth, which will result in accelerated margin expansion. 
We now expect to achieve an adjusted operating profit margin of 20% by fiscal 2018, up from the previous target of 18% by fiscal '20. This new target represents an increase of 400 basis points over fiscal 2015 levels. 
Now let's review our fiscal 2016 results, beginning on Slide 6. Remember this quarter's results were negatively impacted by foreign exchange, the Green Giant divestiture and the comparison to the 53rd-week a year ago. 
We also aligned the Yoplait Europe with our fiscal calendar, which cost us to report an extra month for that business in the quarter. 
Net sales totaled $3.9 billion, down 9% as reported and down 8% in constant currency, driven by the impact of divestiture in the 53rd-week comparison. 
Segment operating profits totaled $654 million, down 18% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting our highest quarter of input cost inflation as well as the items I mentioned earlier. 
Net earnings more than doubled to $380 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.62 as reported. 
Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability were $0.66, down 12% from last year's fourth quarter and down 11% in constant currency. 
Slide 7 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales grew 1% in the quarter, driven [indiscernible] by volume growth. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales growth by 1 point, the 53rd-week reduced net sales growth by 6 points and the net impact of acquisition and divestitures reduced net sales growth by 3 points in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 8 summarize our results for the full year. Net sales totaled $16.6 billion, down 6% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. Full year net sales increased modestly on an organic basis. 
Total segment operating profit totaled $3 billion, up 1% in constant currency. Net earnings increased 39% to $1.7 billion and diluted EPS was $2.77 as reported. 
Adjusted diluted EPS was $2.92, up 2% from fiscal 2015. Constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 5% compared to a year ago. 
Turning to our segment results. Slide 9 summarizes U.S. Retail performance. Full year net sales were down 5%, including a 2-point decline from the net impact of the Green Giant sales and the Annie's and EPIC acquisitions. The 53rd-week comparison reduced annual net sales growth by additional 1 point. 
Excluding the extra week last year, our Cereal operating unit posted net sales growth in 2016. 
Segment operating profit increased 1% for the full year and operating profit margin increased 120 basis points to nearly 22%. 
In the Convenience and Foodservice, our 6 focus platforms posted 5% net sales growth in fiscal '16 with the strongest performance coming from frozen meals. This is the third consecutive year, our 6 focus platforms have grown at a mid-single-digit rate or better. 
Full year segment net sales declined 4%, driven by market index pricing on bakery flour and the exit of low-margin businesses in late fiscal '15. 
Full year segment operating profit was up 7%, driven by favorable product mix and our cost saving efforts. 
Slide 11 summarizes our International segment net sales results stated in constant currency. 
For the full year, international net sales grew 3%, including increases of 12% in Latin America, 3% in Europe and 1% in Asia Pacific. 
Canada net sales declined 4%, but were up low single digits, excluding the divestiture of Green Giant. 
In total, the net impact of acquisition and divestitures and the impact of 1 less week reduced full year net sales growth as reported by 2 points. 
Constant-currency international segment operating profit declined 3% in fiscal 2016, primarily due to currency-driven inflation on imported products in certain markets, the impact of the Green Giant  divestiture and the different weeks. 
As I said earlier, we made good progress on expanding margins in fiscal 2016. Full year adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points driven by cost-savings initiatives more than offsetting modest input cost inflation, which totaled 2% for the full year. 
After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $88 million in fiscal 2016, up to 12% in constant currency, primarily due to favorable input cost and volume growth for Häagen-Dazs Japan. Both JVs contributed to the strong profit growth. 
By constant-currency basis, net sales for Cereal Partners Worldwide were flat to last year with first half declines offset by growth in the second half. 
Häagen-Dazs Japan constant-currency net sales increased 5% for the full year, driven by excellent results on new products. 
Slide 14 shows that our core working capital declined 41% versus last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to continued operational improvements across our businesses, plus the onetime benefit of the Green Giant divestiture. This is the 13th consecutive quarter we've reduced our core working capital versus the prior year. 
Full year operating cash flow is $2.6 billion, up 3% versus last year. Capital expenditures totaled $729 million. Full year free cash flow is $1.9 billion, up 4% versus last year as we converted 104% of our adjusted after-tax earnings to free cash, ahead of our long-term goal of 95%. 
We paid $1.1 billion in dividends in 2016 and dividends per share were $1.78, up 7% from last year. 
Net share repurchases totaled $435 million, and we reduced average net shares outstanding by 1% in line with our guidance. 
Slide 16 highlights our key assumptions for fiscal 2017. We expect to drive organic net sales growth of low single digits for our growth businesses, which represents 3/4 of our portfolio. Net growth will be offset by mid-single-digit organic declines under the remainder of our portfolio where we're prioritizing profitable volume. The Green Giant divestiture will reduce net sales by about 1 point and EPS by approximately $0.03. 
We expect to deliver $380 million of cost of goods HMM, which was more than offset cost inflation of 2%. 
And we'll deliver an incremental $150 million a cost savings in fiscal 2017 from previously announced projects, which will bring the total annual savings figure to $500 million. 
Finally, on Slide 17, you see a summary of our fiscal 2017 guidance. We expect organic net sales growth to be in the range between down 2% and flat, reflecting the actions we're taking to reduce unprofitable volume of certain businesses.  Adjusted gross margin is targeted to be up 150 basis points driven by our margin expansion initiatives. Media investment is expected to be down by single digits. We project total segment operating profit will increase 6% to 8% on a constant-currency basis and we expect our adjusted operating margin -- operating profit margin will be 150 basis points above the 16.8% we delivered in fiscal '16. 
Interest expense is expected to be flat to last year reflecting a relatively stable rate environment, higher debt levels and changes in mix of debt. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be up 100 basis points given the phasing of foreign tax credits and favorable F '16 settlements. 
We plan to continue returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases. For fiscal 2017, we're targeting a net reduction of 1% to 2% in average diluted shares outstanding. And we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be up between 6% and 8% in constant currency. We estimate foreign currency will be a $0.01 to $0.02 headwind to full year adjusted EPS growth in 2017, although I'll note that this figure does not include the recent fluctuations in the British pound. 
Finally, we expect 2017 first quarter adjusted diluted EPS will be below last year's first quarter that grew 36% in constant currency. We expect to post adjusted diluted EPS growth in each of the remaining 3 quarters of 2017. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."

Well, thanks, Don and once again, good morning to all of you. Fiscal 2016 was an important step forward for our business. Our Consumer First renovation and innovation news gained traction on a number of businesses though we have work to do in cert",2590,"Okay. Well, thanks, Don and once again, good morning to all of you. 
Fiscal 2016 was an important step forward for our business. Our Consumer First renovation and innovation news gained traction on a number of businesses though we have work to do in certain areas to improve our trends. We reshaped our portfolio with strategic acquisitions and divestitures and we strengthened our business model and drove significant increase in our profit margin. 
Let me share some 2016 highlights across our businesses, starting with U.S. Cereal. 
The U.S. Cereal category has improved considerably since last year, returning to growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Importantly, this improvement is being driven by stronger renovation and innovation aligned with current consumer interest, supported by effective marketing investments. And General Mills has been a key contributor to the category turnaround. Our Cereal business has consistently strengthened throughout the year with retail sales up 3% in the fourth quarter and as Don mentioned, full year net sales for our Cereal business grew in fiscal 2016 on an organic basis. 
Consumer First renovation has been critical to our renewed growth. We launched gluten-free Cheerios last summer to address the needs of the many consumers who are reducing or eliminating their gluten intake. After declining 8% in fiscal 2015, retail sales on our renovated Cheerios varieties, which make up roughly 90% of the Cheerios franchise increased 5% in the second half of 2016. 
We also announced that we're removing artificial colors and flavors from our Cereal line. 75% of our cereals met disclaim by January and at that time, we began advertising behind 7 newly renovated cereals, including Trix, Golden brands and Reese's Puffs. And I'm very happy to say consumers are responding. These 7 varieties posted 8% retail sales growth in the back half of the year compared to 6% declines in 2015 and much of that growth has come from full-price baseline sales. 
Sales of our Nature Valley bars strengthened throughout the year as our product renovation news is gaining traction. We made our crunchy bars easier to bite, addressing our top consumer complaint. We also told consumers about our gluten-free options and reminded them that Nature Valley bars are free from artificial colors and flavors. Retail sales grew 4% in the second half of fiscal 2016, including 5% growth in the fourth quarter. 
LÄRABAR posted consistent double-digit growth since we acquired the business 8 years ago. We continue to look through ways to expand penetration beyond its current consumer base and accelerate the brand's growth. And to that end, LÄRABAR launches its first ever TV campaign in January and together with strong in-store merchandising and distribution support, the business has grown 40% in Nielsen measured channels. We'll continue this support in fiscal 2017. 
Net sales for our Natural & Organic portfolio, which includes LÄRABAR were up double digits in 2016. 
In January, we expanded our portfolio with the addition of EPIC Provisions meat snacks. We now have a portfolio of 9 brands that generates $750 million in pro forma net sales in 2016, and we are well on our way to achieving our goal of $1 billion in net sales by 2019. 
Now fiscal 2016 was a disappointing year for our U.S. yogurt top line and share. Dairy deflation sparked increased competition, and we were not as aggressive in reinvesting this favorability. 
In addition, our marketing and innovation efforts underperformed our expectations. However, we were able to improve our profitability to record level HMM and spending discipline. We remain very committed to winning in the U.S. yogurt category, and we recognize that we have work to do to improve our performance, and I'll share more details on these plans in just a moment. 
We posted good performance in 2016 during the soup and baking seasons. We grew ready-to-serve soups market share by 2 points during the soup season, thanks to successful merchandising and product renovation news and good advertising. 
Our Pillsbury refrigerated dough business had a good baking season with growth in retail sales and market share up 1.8 points. These results were driven by distribution gains on our top selling products. 
We grew market share for our dessert mixes during the key baking season by aligning our prices more closely with our competition. 
Turning to our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, we saw another year of good growth in 2016 for our focus 6 platforms, with net sales up 5%. Frozen meals led our performance, posting strong double-digit net sales growth behind our K-12 meals, led by mini bagels, one of our biggest product launches in recent history. We continue to see strong performance in our cereal bowl packs and these helped drive mid-single-digit net sales growth for our cereal business in 2016. And net sales for our yogurt business were up on the strength of Yoplait, Parfait Pro and our Kid Yogurt's. 
Now let's turn to our International segment and our developed market businesses. We posted low single digit retail sales growth in Canada in fiscal 2016. Growth in our snacks and Old El Paso businesses there was fueled by Consumer First innovation, including Nature Valley Nut and Seed Crisps and Old El Paso Stand n Stuff Tacos. 
Retail sales in our Europe region were also up low single digit, behind the success of our Häagen-Dazs Fit Bars launched in France and innovation-driven growth on Old El Paso. 
In emerging markets, constant currency Latin America net sales were up 12% in 2016 driven by good performance on seasonings, inflation-driven pricing and our acquisition of Carolina yogurt. 
Yoplait in Shanghai achieved 10% share in the latest quarter and has helped offset a slowdown in Häagen-Dazs shop performance in China driven by challenging economic conditions. 
Finally, net sales in India were up double-digit behind innovation and geographic expansion. 
CPW, our 50-50 joint venture with Nestlé exited fiscal 2016 with momentum, posting 3% net sales growth in the fourth quarter. This performance was driven by product innovation and renovation, including good growth on its line on gluten-free cereal. For the year, CPW constant-currency net sales matched year ago results, while profits grew double-digit. 
So overall in fiscal 2015, we made important progress to strengthen our business model and improve momentum on a number of business lines. 
In fiscal 2017, our plan is to build on last year's successes, while maintaining our strategic focus on Consumer First. We're sharpening the way we think about our portfolio by being more choiceful about our level of investment and expectations for growth across our businesses, resulting in focused growth and strong margin expansion in 2017. 
We're taking a strategic approach to define growth and foundations portfolio roles for our business in 2017, taking into consideration category and brand strength, competitive dynamics and relative return on investments. 
Our growth businesses includes cereal, snack bars, our national and organic brands, yogurt, Totino's and Old El Paso and all of these within U.S. Retail. And the focus 6 platforms in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment and finally, all of our international markets are included in the growth expectations. 
Now for most of these growth businesses, we're building off a positive net sales momentum for 2016. In some cases, for example, U.S. Yogurt and China, we see strong long-term growth potential, but we need to improve our current trajectory. 
In total, these growth businesses make up approximately 75% of our net sales and a similar proportion of operating profit, and we expect them to grow at a low single digit rate in fiscal 2017. 
Our second group of businesses is no less critical to the success of our company but play a different role. They're part of the foundation of our business and delivers strong, consistent profit that helps fund top line growth initiative and return cash to shareholders. 
In aggregate, their top line growth prospects are not as robust as the first group so we'll be very selective in our growth investments focusing where we had strong ROI. 
These foundations businesses make up the remaining 25% of our net sales and consist primarily of refrigerated dough, desserts and soup in U.S. Retail as well as bakery flour and frozen dough products in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segments. We expect 2017 net sales on these businesses to decline mid-single as we reduce unprofitable volume and drive improved margin. 
Now let me share an overview of our fiscal 2017 plans across our portfolio, beginning with our U.S. business. We exited 2016 with good momentum on both U.S. cereal and snack bars, and we plan to drive growth on these businesses, again, in 2017. We will continue our renovation efforts by converting 2 more Cheerios varieties to gluten-free and by removing artificial colors and flavors from 5 additional cereals. 
We're also launching a number of exciting new cereals, including 3 variety of Annie's cereals and 2 varieties of Tiny Toast, which are hitting shelves now. To support these efforts, we have the strong immediate plan in place with cereal investment up mid-single-digit, and we're focused on optimizing merchandising and driving positive net price realization for our Cereal business. 
We have a good lineup of news on our snack bars businesses as well. We're renovating the packaging on Nature Valley bars, launching new flavors of our popular Nature Valley Nut Butter Biscuits and introducing Nature Valley Backpacker, oatmeal snacks geared toward school-aged kids. 
On LÄRABAR, we plan to expand our strong performance into fiscal 2017 with continued media and in-store support. 
We also have a full slate of plans for Annie's, our largest Natural & Organic business. We posted double-digit growth on distribution of our core products last year, and we plan to continue to leverage the strength of our U.S. Retail sales force to drive double-digit distribution growth in 2017. 
We will also benefit from a full year of category expansion in soup, yogurt and cereal and we have even more Annie's news that Jeff Harmening will tell you about at our Investor Day event in 2 weeks. 
We believe in the long-term growth opportunity in U.S. yogurt. However, it will take us some time to restore top line growth as we shift our portfolio towards faster-growing segments like Greek, Organic and Kids. 
This month, we're rolling out new Greek Whips, a full calorie version of our successful Greek 100 Whips product. We'll expand our presence in the fast-growing organic segment by launching Annie's Tubes in large sized yogurts and by converting Liberté to premium organic line. And we have a strong lineup of kid yogurt news, which we'll  share at Investor Day. 
We'll also improve the effectiveness of our consumer messaging by refocusing on all family snacking, and we'll increase our merchandising competitiveness in 2017, securing more display at competitive price points. Some of this will be funded by shifting dollars out of consumer investment where we have, by far, the high share of voice in the category. 
Given our current rate of decline, we expect full year fiscal 2017 net sales to be down, but we expect our losses to moderate as we move through the year.
Let me also touch on a few of our foundation businesses in U.S. Retail, including soup, refrigerated dough and dessert mix. Here, we are reducing low ROI trade and consumer investment and reducing complexity by optimizing our SKU assortment. Even so, we will continue to bring important news to consumers in 2017. 
For example, on Progresso soup, we're moving our entire lead to antibiotic free chicken, a first for our mainstream soup brand. 
On Pillsbury refrigerated though, we're launching new shelf ready packaging that will increase the productivity of the aisle for our retail customers and the shopability of the aisle for our consumers. And on Betty Crocker, we're relaunching our [indiscernible] Mix to give consumers more premium ingredients and flavor variety. 
Turning to Convenience Stores and Foodservice. We'll continue growth for our focus 6 platforms in 2017 with frozen meals and snacks leading the way. We're expanding distribution of Pillsbury pancakes and bagels in schools, leveraging our no artificial colors and flavors renovation and We'll continue to grow distribution for our snacks and convenience stores leveraging the Nature Valley news from U.S. Retail, but also bringing channel specific news like Chex Mix Hot and Spicy renovation. 
In Canada, we're changing our Yoplait stores messaging, repositioning it from a diet product to great-tasting yogurt made with real fruit and no added sugar. 
We will also bring gluten-free Cheerios news to Canada in 2017 and scaling up the rollout of Annie's to capitalize on the sizable Natural & Organic segments in this market. 
In Europe, we'll introduce new flavors of Häagen-Dazs stick bars and extend the line to market beyond France. 
We're also introducing Old El Paso Stand 'N Stuff Minis, targeting younger consumers as well as the appetizer occasion and we're launching Panier Extra, a premium positioned fruit at the bottom Greeks style yogurt. 
We have exciting news plan for emerging markets in 2017 as well. In Brazil, we're launching new Yoki platform products, supporting our new Carolina yogurt business and executing pricing and managing mix to maintain our margins. 
In China, we plan to build on our successful Yoplait launch in Shanghai and just this month, we introduced Yoplait in Beijing. 
We also plan to innovate on our Häagen-Dazs Moon Cake line, launching rose shape varieties. 
In India, we'll drive strong growth for our Pillsbury business to increase distribution and new product launches in sweet snacks and meals, including new cakes and [indiscernible] mixes. 
And finally in Mexico, we'll leverage digital support, in-store marketing and event sampling to expand our successful Nature Valley franchise. 
Now as Don mentioned earlier, we see a number of opportunities to accelerate our margin expansion efforts over the next few years. We'll continue to benefit from HMM and our previously announced cost-saving projects, and we're taking additional actions to further expand our margins. These include: Sharpening the focus of our trade and consumer investments between our growth and foundation businesses; reducing complexity by streamlining our SKUs and generating more profitable mix and delivering additional savings from our supply chain and our zero-based budgeting practices. 
And in total, these efforts will help us drive our adjusted operating profit margin to 20% by fiscal 2018. 
We expect our efforts to drive focused growth in margin expansion will result in fiscal 2017 organic net sales growth to range between flat and down 2%, with 150 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin and 6% to 8% growth in constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS. 
Now looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect modest growth in organic net sales as we maintain positive momentum on many growth businesses and see improvement in others such as U.S. yogurt in China. The full benefit of our margin expansion efforts will help drive adjusted operating profit margin to 20% and will generate a low double-digit increase in constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS in 2018. 
So let me close today by summarizing our key messages. We made important progress to return our business to growth in organic sales and operating profit in 2016. We strengthened our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures as well as category and market expansions. We're taking clear action across the portfolio to drive focused growth, margin expansion and strong returns in fiscal 2017 and 2018. And these efforts will set the stage for sustainable long-term growth and value creation for General Mills shareholders. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning, so operator, you can open the call up for questions."

And so, I guess, and that's despite some organic sales decline perhaps in aggregate over the next 3 years.

The other thing that I will tell you is that we feel great about our renovation efforts, and when we started -- we saw the benefits of those that are going to back half of this year so what ever is gluten-free on Cheerios or the taste improvement in Nature Valley or no, no, no, in cereal. Those things really have only started in the back half of this year, and so those will carry forward to next year as well as some more renovation, which I'll talk in more detail about in a couple of weeks. So our renovation efforts will carry over, and we feel very positive about those and we also think we have a better new product line up next year.

So those businesses, we both have a strong base today, but we have very strong plans in place and reasons to believe that we'll see some slight acceleration to growth. And to Ken's point, the foundation that is really the stable core and if you think about those brands, the large high share scale businesses, primarily here in the U.S. or entirely here in the U.S. But they're also -- they are receptive and reactive to targeted investment. And as Ken said, we'll continue to do that, and so while there may be a onetime step down over next year to 18 months, we do expect those brands to stabilize over time.

We had to make sure that we stay even with that. We appreciate that your observation that our pace of bringing innovation and renovation to the market is accelerating because that's been our goal. We really feel that, that's the right thing to do in this environment. So I agree with your observation. We're very focused on keeping our organization here -- we're on our toes. We're very focused on the consumer. We want to bring the right kind of innovation at a higher pace because that's appropriate, and we're very, very focused. As you said on execution in that environment, and we feel good about the way, particularly the way we executed our innovation last year. Our incentive -- let me just make this comment on incentive for our operating units, so we're kind of the tip of the spear for all this innovation. Their incentive reflects very much sort of the dual mandate of what we talked about of CAGNY we've talked about today. We're focused on both growth and return and our operating units are incented on growth and return. And both the growth businesses and the foundation businesses our incented that way. So while our growth targets maybe more modest on the foundation businesses, it's just as important to the company that they hit their targets as the growth guys do. So everyone is aligned with this dual approach that we talked about. We think that we're going to benefit from that. I don't know if anyone else would want to jump in on that.

And we see accelerated growth from Annie's in this fiscal year and on the packs of distribution, which is been consistent through out the year distribution growth as well as improved merchandising and as the year has gone on. And we'll keep doing those things with the Annie's business. There's a lot of distributions we can get, we can keep doing better merchandising, and we'll add on top of that expansion to categories that we think are really viable for Annie's, namely yogurt and cereal. In terms of what we learned earlier in the year, what I would tell you is that is with any integration, there are things that don't go perfectly but there has nothing that hasn't been rectified and at the beginning of our year, really, was our merchandising plans that didn't come together the way we want them to. We were gaining good distribution, but we have seen that change in the back half of the year. Our sales force is executing really well, both from a national organic channel and traditional retail against our organic brands right now."

We're encouraged by the traction we saw at our consumer-first initiative on many important businesses. Our operating performance strengthened as we returned to growth in organic sales and segment operating profit, made good progress in margin expansion and exceeded our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. We took important strategic actions during the year to reshape our portfolio for growth, including the divestiture of the Green Giant business in North America, significant category expansion to the Annie's brand, the launch of Yoplait in China and the acquisitions of EPIC Provisions' meat snacks in the U.S. and the Carolina yogurt business in Brazil. 
But we didn't hit the market everywhere. We're disappointed in our performance in U.S. yogurt. And our China results, excluding the Yoplait launch, finished below our expectations, and the external environment in that market remains challenging. We also experienced merchandising headwinds at a large U.S. customer, which we should lap after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
As noted in this morning's press release, we're building on successes in fiscal 2016 to increase our fiscal 2018 cost savings target and accelerate and increase our adjusted operating profit margin goal. Our cost savings initiatives, which includes -- which include projects Century, Catalyst and Compass and furthered administrative cost savings from zero-based budgeting, generated $350 million in total annual savings in fiscal 2016, ahead of our original target. We have good visibility to continue strong cost savings over the next 2 years. And as a result, we're increasing our total annual savings target to $600 million by fiscal 2018, up from the previous target of $500 million. We're also implementing further efforts to optimize our spending, reduce complexity and streamline our operations to drive profitable growth, which will result in accelerated margin expansion.  We now expect to achieve an adjusted operating profit margin of 20% by fiscal 2018, up from the previous target of 18% by fiscal '20. This new target represents an increase of 400 basis points over fiscal 2015 levels. 
Now let's review fiscal 2016 results, beginning on Slide 6. Remember, this quarter's results were negatively impacted by foreign exchange, the Green Giant divestiture and the comparison to the 53rd week a year ago. We also aligned the Yoplait Europe with our fiscal calendar, which caused us to report an extra month for that business in the quarter. Net sales totaled $3.9 billion, down 9% as reported and down 8% in constant currency, driven by the impact of divestiture in the 53rd week comparison. Segment operating profit totaled $654 million, down 18% on a constant currency basis, reflecting our highest quarter of input cost inflation as well as the items I mentioned earlier. Net earnings more than doubled to $380 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.62 as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, were $0.66, down 12% from last year's fourth quarter and down 11% in constant currency. 
Slide 7 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales grew 1% in the quarter, driven by pound volume growth. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales growth by 1 point. The 53rd week reduced net sales growth by 6 points. And the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced net sales growth by 3 points in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 8 summarizes our results for the full year. Net sales totaled $16.6 billion, down 6% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. Full year net sales increased modestly on an organic basis. Total segment operating profit totaled $3 billion, up 1% in constant currency. Net earnings increased 39% to $1.7 billion and diluted EPS was $2.77 as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS was $2.92, up 2% from fiscal 2015. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 5% compared to a year ago. 
Turning to our segment results. Slide 9 summarizes U.S. Retail performance. Full year net sales were down 5%, including a 2 point decline from the net impact of the Green Giant sale and the Annie's and EPIC acquisitions. The 53rd week comparison reduced annual net sales growth by an additional 1 point. Excluding the extra week last year, our cereal operating unit posted net sales growth in 2016. Segment operating profit increased 1% for the full year, and operating profit margin increased 120 basis points to nearly 22%. 
In the Convenience and Foodservice, our 6 Focus platforms posted 5% net sales growth in fiscal '16 with the strongest performance coming from frozen meals. This is the third consecutive year our 6 Focus platforms have grown at a mid-single-digit rate or better. Full year segment net sales declined 4%, driven by market index pricing on bakery flour and the exit of low-margin businesses in late fiscal '15. Full year segment operating profit was up 7%, driven by favorable product mix and our cost saving efforts. 
Slide 11 summarizes our International segment net sales results stated in constant currency. For the full year, International net sales grew 3%, including increases of 12% in Latin America, 3% in Europe and 1% in Asia/Pacific. Canada net sales declined 4% but were up low single digits, excluding the divestiture of Green Giant. In total, the net impact of acquisition and divestitures and the impact of 1 less week reduced full year net sales growth as reported by 2 points. Constant currency International segment operating profit declined 3% in fiscal 2016, primarily due to currency-driven inflation on imported products in certain markets, the impact of the Green Giant  divestiture and the difference in weeks. 
As I said earlier, we made good progress on expanding margins in fiscal 2016. Full year adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points, driven by cost savings initiatives more than offsetting modest input cost inflation, which totaled 2% for the full year.  After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $88 million in fiscal 2016, up 12% in constant currency, primarily due to favorable input cost and volume growth for Häagen-Dazs Japan. Both JVs contributed to the strong profit growth. On a constant currency basis, net sales for Cereal Partners Worldwide were flat to last year with first half declines offset by growth in the second half. Häagen-Dazs Japan constant currency net sales increased 5% for the full year, driven by excellent results on new products. 
Slide 14 shows that our core working capital declined 41% versus last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to continued operational improvements across our businesses plus the onetime benefit of the Green Giant divestiture. This is the 13th consecutive quarter we've reduced our core working capital versus the prior year. Full year operating cash flow is $2.6 billion, up 3% versus last year. Capital expenditures totaled $729 million. Full year free cash flow is $1.9 billion, up 4% versus last year as we converted 104% of our adjusted after-tax earnings to free cash, ahead of our long-term goal of 95%. We paid $1.1 billion in dividends in 2016, and dividends per share were $1.78, up 7% from last year. Net share repurchases totaled $435 million, and we reduced average net shares outstanding by 1% in line with our guidance. 
Slide 16 highlights our key assumptions for fiscal 2017. We expect to drive organic net sales growth of low single digits for our growth businesses, which represents 3/4 of our portfolio. Net growth will be offset by mid-single-digit organic declines on the remainder of our portfolio, where we're prioritizing profitable volume. The Green Giant divestiture will reduce net sales by about 1 point and EPS by approximately $0.03. We expect to deliver $380 million of cost of goods HMM, which was more than offset cost inflation of 2%. And we'll deliver an incremental $150 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017 from previously announced projects, which will bring the total annual savings figure to $500 million. 
Finally, on Slide 17, you see a summary of our fiscal 2017 guidance. We expect organic net sales growth to be in the range between down 2% and flat, reflecting the actions we're taking to reduce unprofitable volume on certain businesses. Adjusted gross margin is targeted to be up 150 basis points, driven by our margin expansion initiatives. Media investment is expected to be down by single digits. We project total segment operating profit will increase 6% to 8% on a constant currency basis. And we expect our adjusted operating margin -- operating profit margin will be 150 basis points above the 16.8% we delivered in fiscal '16. Interest expense is expected to be flat to last year, reflecting a relatively stable rate environment, higher debt levels and changes in mix of debt. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be up 100 basis points, given the phasing of foreign tax credits and favorable F '16 settlements. 
We plan to continue returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases. For fiscal 2017, we're targeting a net reduction of 1% to 2% in average diluted shares outstanding. And we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be up between 6% and 8% in constant currency. We estimate foreign currency will be a $0.01 to $0.02 headwind to full year adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2017, although I'll note that this figure does not include the recent fluctuations in the British pound. Finally, we expect 2017 first quarter adjusted diluted EPS will be below last year's first quarter that grew 36% in constant currency. We expect to post adjusted diluted EPS growth in each of the remaining 3 quarters of 2017. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."

Well, thanks, Don, and once again, good morning to all of you. Fiscal 2016 was an important step forward for our business. Our consumer-first renovation and innovation news gained traction on a number of businesses, though we have work to do in ce",2577,"Okay. Well, thanks, Don, and once again, good morning to all of you. 
Fiscal 2016 was an important step forward for our business. Our consumer-first renovation and innovation news gained traction on a number of businesses, though we have work to do in certain areas to improve our trends. We reshaped our portfolio with strategic acquisitions and divestitures. And we strengthened our business model and drove a significant increase in our profit margin. 
Let me share some 2016 highlights across our businesses, starting with U.S. Cereal. 
The U.S. Cereal category has improved considerably since last year, returning to growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Importantly, this improvement is being driven by stronger renovation and innovation aligned with current consumer interests, supported by effective marketing investment. And General Mills has been a key contributor to the category turnaround. Our Cereal business has consistently strengthened throughout the year with retail sales up 3% in the fourth quarter. And as Don mentioned, full year net sales for our Cereal business grew in fiscal 2016 on an organic basis. 
Consumer-first renovation has been critical to our renewed growth. We launched gluten-free Cheerios last summer to address the needs of the many consumers who are reducing or eliminating their gluten intake. After declining 8% in fiscal 2015, retail sales on our renovated Cheerios varieties, which make up roughly 90% of the Cheerios franchise, increased 5% in the second half of 2016. We also announced that we're removing artificial colors and flavors from our Cereal line. 75% of our cereals met this claim by January. And at that time, we began advertising behind 7 newly renovated cereals, including Trix, Golden Grahams and Reese's Puffs. And I'm very happy to say consumers are responding. These 7 varieties posted 8% retail sales growth in the back half of the year compared to 6% declines in 2015, and much of that growth has come from full-priced baseline sales. 
Sales of our Nature Valley bars strengthened throughout the year as our product renovation news is gaining traction. We made our crunchy bars easier to bite, addressing our top consumer complaint. We also told consumers about our gluten-free options and reminded them that Nature Valley bars are free from artificial colors and flavors. Retail sales grew 4% in the second half of fiscal 2016, including 5% growth in the fourth quarter. 
LÄRABAR posted consistent double-digit growth since we acquired the business 8 years ago. We continue to look to ways to expand penetration beyond its current consumer base and accelerate the brand's growth. And to that end, LÄRABAR launched its first ever TV campaign in January. And together with strong in-store merchandising and distribution support, the business has grown 40% in Nielsen-measured channels. We'll continue this support in fiscal 2017. Net sales for our Natural & Organic portfolio, which includes LÄRABAR were up double digit in 2016. In January, we expanded our portfolio with the addition of EPIC Provisions meat snacks. We now have a portfolio of 9 brands that generate $750 million in pro forma net sales in 2016, and we are well on our way to achieving our goal of $1 billion in net sales by 2019. 
Now fiscal 2016 was a disappointing year for our U.S. yogurt top line and share. Dairy deflation sparked increased competition, and we were not as aggressive in reinvesting this favorability. In addition, our marketing and innovation efforts underperformed our expectations. However, we were able to improve our profitability to record-level HMM and spending discipline. We remain very committed to winning in the U.S. yogurt category, and we recognize that we have work to do to improve our performance. And I'll share more details on these plans in just a moment. 
We posted good performance in 2016 during the soup and baking seasons. We grew ready-to-serve soup market share by 2 points during the soup season, thanks to successful merchandising, product renovation news and good advertising. Our Pillsbury refrigerated dough business had a good baking season with growth in retail sales and market share up 1.8 points. These results were driven by distribution gains on our top selling products. And we grew market share for our dessert mixes during the key baking season by aligning our prices more closely with our competition. 
Turning to our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, we saw another year of good growth in 2016 for our Focus 6 platforms, with net sales up 5%. Frozen meals led our performance, posting strong double-digit net sales growth behind our K-12 meals, led by mini bagels, one of our biggest product launches in recent history. We continued to see strong performance on our cereal bowl packs, and these helped drive mid-single-digit net sales growth for our cereal business in 2016. And net sales for our yogurt business were up on the strength of Yoplait, Parfait Pro and our Kid Yogurt's. 
Now let's turn to our International segment and our developed market businesses. We posted low single-digit retail sales growth in Canada in fiscal 2016. Growth on our snacks and Old El Paso businesses there was fueled by consumer-first innovation, including Nature Valley Nut and Seed Crisps and Old El Paso Stand 'N Stuff tacos. Retail sales in our Europe region were also up low single digit, behind the success of our Häagen-Dazs Fit Bars launched in France and innovation-driven growth on Old El Paso. 
In emerging markets, constant currency Latin American net sales were up 12% in 2016, driven by good performance on seasonings, inflation-driven pricing and our acquisition of Carolina yogurt.  Yoplait in Shanghai achieved 10% share in the latest quarter and has helped offset a slowdown in Häagen-Dazs shop performance in China, driven by challenging economic condition. Finally, net sales in India were up double-digit behind innovation and geographic expansion. 
CPW, our 50-50 joint venture with Nestlé exited fiscal 2016 with momentum, posting 3% net sales growth in the fourth quarter. This performance was driven by product innovation and renovation, including good growth on its line on gluten-free cereal. For the year, CPW constant-currency net sales matched year-ago results, while profits grew double digit. 
So overall in fiscal 2016, we made important progress to strengthen our business model and improve momentum on a number of business lines. In fiscal 2017, our plan is to build on last year's successes, while maintaining our strategic focus on consumer-first. We're sharpening the way we think about our portfolio by being more choiceful about our level of investments and expectations for growth across our businesses, resulting in focused growth and strong margin expansion in 2017. We're taking a strategic approach to define growth and foundation portfolio roles for our business in 2017, taking into consideration category and brand strength, competitive dynamics and relative return on investments. 
Our growth businesses include cereal, snack bars, our national and organic brands, yogurt, Totino's and Old El Paso and all of these within U.S. Retail; then the Focus 6 platforms in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment; and finally, all of our international markets are included in the growth expectations. 
Now for most of these growth businesses, we're building off positive net sales momentum in 2016. In some cases, for example, U.S. Yogurt and China, we see strong long-term growth potential, but we need to improve our current trajectory. In total, these growth businesses make up approximately 75% of our net sales and a similar proportion of operating profit, and we expect them to grow at a low single-digit rate in fiscal 2017. 
Our second group of businesses is no less critical to the success of our company but play a different role. They're part of the foundation of our business and deliver strong, consistent profit that helps fund top line growth initiative and return cash to shareholders. 
In aggregate, their top line growth prospects are not as robust as the first group, so we'll be very selective in our growth investments focusing where we have strong ROIs. These foundation businesses make up the remaining 25% of our net sales and consist primarily of refrigerated dough, desserts and soup in U.S. Retail as well as bakery flour and frozen dough products in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment. We expect 2017 net sales on these businesses to decline mid-single digit as we reduce unprofitable volume and drive improved margin. 
Now let me share an overview of our fiscal 2017 plans across our portfolio, beginning with our U.S. business. We exited 2016 with good momentum on both U.S. cereal and snack bars, and we plan to drive growth on these businesses again in 2017. We will continue our renovation efforts by converting 2 more Cheerios varieties to gluten-free and by removing artificial colors and flavors from 5 additional cereals. We're also launching a number of exciting new cereals, including 3 variety of Annie's cereals and 2 varieties of Tiny Toast, which are hitting shelves now. To support these efforts, we have a strong media plan in place with cereal investment up mid-single digit, and we're focused on optimizing merchandising and driving positive net price realization for our Cereal business. 
We have a good lineup of news on our snack bars businesses as well. We're renovating the packaging on Nature Valley bars, launching new flavors of our popular Nature Valley Nut Butter Biscuits and introducing Nature Valley Backpacker, oatmeal snacks geared toward school-aged kids. 
On LÄRABAR, we plan to expand our strong performance into fiscal 2017 with continued media and in-store support. We also have a full slate of plans for Annie's, our largest Natural & Organic business. We posted double-digit growth on distribution of our core products last year, and we plan to continue to leverage the strength of our U.S. Retail sales force to drive double-digit distribution growth in 2017.  We will also benefit from a full year of category expansion in soup, yogurt and cereal, and we have even more Annie's news that Jeff Harmening will tell you about at our Investor Day event in 2 weeks. 
We believe in the long-term growth opportunity in U.S. yogurt; however, it will take us some time to restore top line growth as we shift our portfolio towards faster-growing segments like Greek, Organic and Kids. This month, we're rolling out new Greek Whips, a full calorie version of our successful Greek 100 Whips product. We'll expand our presence in the fast-growing organic segment by launching Annie's Tubes and large sized yogurts and by converting Liberté to premium organic line. And we have a strong lineup of Kid Yogurt news, which we'll  share at Investor Day. 
We'll also improve the effectiveness of our consumer messaging by refocusing on all-family snacking, and we'll increase our merchandising competitiveness in 2017, securing more display at competitive price points. Some of this will be funded by shifting dollars out of consumer investment, where we have by far the high share of voice in the category. 
Given our current rate of decline, we expect full year fiscal 2017 net sales to be down, but we expect our losses to moderate as we move through the year.
Let me also touch on a few of our foundation businesses in U.S. Retail, including soup, refrigerated dough and dessert mix. Here we are reducing low ROI trade and consumer investment and reducing complexity by optimizing our SKU assortment. Even so, we will continue to bring important news to consumers in 2017. 
For example, on Progresso soup, we're moving our entire line to antibiotic-free chicken, a first for our mainstream soup brand. On Pillsbury refrigerated though, we're launching new shelf-ready packaging that will increase the productivity of the aisle for our retail customers and the shopability of the aisle for our consumers. And on Betty Crocker, we're relaunching our brownie mix to give consumers more premium ingredients and flavor variety. 
Turning to Convenience Stores and Foodservice. We'll continue growth for our Focus 6 platforms in 2017 with frozen meals and snacks leading the way. We're expanding distribution of Pillsbury pancakes and bagels in schools, leveraging our no artificial colors and flavors renovation. And we'll continue to grow distribution for our snacks in convenience stores, leveraging the Nature Valley news from U.S. Retail, but also bringing channel-specific news like Chex Mix Hot and Spicy renovation. 
In Canada, we're changing our Yoplait stores messaging, repositioning it from a diet product to great-tasting yogurt made with real fruit and no added sugar. We will also bring gluten-free Cheerios news to Canada in 2017 and scaling up the rollout of Annie's to capitalize on the sizable Natural & Organic segment in this market. In Europe, we'll introduce new flavors of Häagen-Dazs stick bars and extend the line to markets beyond France. We're also introducing Old El Paso Stand 'N Stuff Minis, targeting younger consumers as well as the appetizer occasion, and we're launching Panier Extra, a premium positioned fruit on the bottom Greek-style yogurt. 
We have exciting news plan for emerging markets in 2017 as well. In Brazil, we're launching new Yoki popcorn products, supporting our new Carolina yogurt business and executing pricing and managing mix to maintain our margins. In China, we plan to build on our successful Yoplait launch in Shanghai. And just this month, we introduced Yoplait in Beijing. We also plan to innovate on our Häagen-Dazs mooncake line, launching row-shaped varieties. In India, we'll drive strong growth for our Pillsbury business to increase distribution and new product launches in sweet snacks and meals, including new cakes and pizza mixes. And finally, in Mexico, we'll leverage digital support, in-store marketing and event sampling to expand our successful Nature Valley franchise. 
Now as Don mentioned earlier, we see a number of opportunities to accelerate our margin expansion efforts over the next few years. We'll continue to benefit from HMM and our previously announced cost-saving projects, and we're taking additional actions to further expand our margins. These include: sharpening the focus of our trade and consumer investments between our growth and foundation businesses; reducing complexity by streamlining our SKUs and generating more profitable mix; and delivering additional savings from our supply chain and our zero-based budgeting practices. And in total, these efforts will help us drive our adjusted operating profit margin to 20% by fiscal 2018. 
We expect our efforts to drive focused growth and margin expansion will result in fiscal 2017 organic net sales growth to range between flat and down 2%, with 150-basis-point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin and 6% to 8% growth in constant currency adjusted diluted EPS. 
Now looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect modest growth in organic net sales as we maintain positive momentum on many growth businesses and see improvement in others such as U.S. yogurt in China. The full benefit of our margin expansion efforts will help drive adjusted operating profit margin to 20% and will generate a low double-digit increase in constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS in 2018. 
So let me close today by summarizing our key messages. We made important progress to return our business to growth in organic sales and operating profit in 2016. We strengthened our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures as well as category and market expansions. We're taking clear action across the portfolio to drive focused growth, margin expansion and strong returns in fiscal 2017 and 2018. And these efforts will set the stage for sustainable long-term growth and value creation for General Mills shareholders.

But obviously, you're looking for a very significant step-up, 300 basis points or so, in operating margin expansion. And so, I guess -- and that's despite, obviously, some organic sales decline perhaps in aggregate over the next 3 years. So I guess, the question is really where does that incremental margin expansion come from that you're projecting? I'm assuming it's the work that's being done around this portfolio segmentation.

But more importantly, as we look at SKU rationalization and we look at the portfolio, as you mentioned, more rigorously, there's a mix benefit to us as well.

The other thing that I will tell you is that we feel great about our renovation efforts. And when we started, we saw the benefits of those starting in the back half of this year, so whatever is gluten-free on Cheerios or the taste improvement on Nature Valley or no, no, no in cereal. Those things really have only started in the back half of this year, and so those will carry forward to next year as well as some more renovation, which I'll talk in more detail about in a couple of weeks. So our renovation efforts will carry over, and we feel very positive about those. And we also think we have a better new product line up next year. So despite the fact that our consumer spending is going to be down a little bit as well as our trade, we feel like we're putting the spending in the right places, our our renovation is working and we have increased levels of new product innovation."

So where we talk about our growth opportunities, we are seeing increased investment. The other thing not to lose sight of is that we also have invested going back into the products. It's not always in the media line. Ken mentioned about our renovation soup, for example. Obviously, the full year benefit of gluten and no, no, no, on cereal have a top line benefit. But as we talk about in F '16, there were some product costs related to that as well. So we got back -- it's sharpening where we're investing back on the media, and it's also continuing to invest back in our products."

Our original yogurt business hasn't been too bad, but our Light -- Yoplait Light business has been challenged as has been our merchandising. And importantly, as we look at this coming year, what we need to do is we need to get back to the right merchandising plan, which we will do. We'll shift some spending out of consumer spending into merchandising to make sure we get the right merchandising plan on traditional.

And we appreciate your observation that our pace of bringing innovation and renovation to the market is accelerating, because that's been our goal. We really feel that, that's the right thing to do in this environment. So I agree with your observation. We're very focused on keeping our organization here. We're on our toes. We're very focused on the consumer. We want to bring the right kind of innovation at a higher pace, because that's appropriate. And we're very, very focused, as you said, on execution in that environment. And we feel good about the way -- particularly the way we executed our innovation last year. Our incentive -- let me just make this comment on incentive for our operating units, so we're kind of the tip of the spear for all this innovation. Their incentive reflects very much sort of the dual mandate of what we talked about at CAGNY and we've talked about today. We're focused on both growth and return. And our operating units are incented on growth and return. And both the growth businesses and the foundation businesses are incented that way. So while our growth targets may be more modest on the foundation businesses, it's just as important to the company that they hit their targets as the growth guys do. So everyone is aligned with this dual approach that we've talked about, and we think that we're going to benefit from that. I don't know if anyone else would want to jump in on that. Okay.

I mean, this is not something that we discovered a couple of weeks ago. And I think as you heard from some of the other comments, much of the work and how we are approaching this is building on initiatives and things that we've been trying and developing over the last year or 2. And we just concluded after seeing the results and seeing the effectiveness of this work that it would be helpful. Frankly, it helps us a lot internally to be much more declarative and intentional about the role that we want different businesses to play. So we just decided -- I can't remember what your word, what your term was, but just to be more declarative and much more intentional about how we were going to pursue these initiatives, and I think you used the word, intensity. So even higher focus. We think that's very good for us inside the business, and it's also very helpful, I think, for investors to understand how we are looking at it. So it is, as you said, a build with more specifics. I don't know if anyone -- everyone, we're good."

Our press release on fourth quarter and year-end results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning, though admittedly not as early as we wanted. We had some issues with our press release service IT, and so thanks for bearing with us this morning.

Our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates. 
And one additional housekeeping item. Beginning in fiscal 2017, we'll report net sales growth on an organic basis, which we define as net sales adjusted for the impact of foreign currency translation as well as acquisitions, divestitures and 53rd week when applicable. We'll  do this at the segment and total company level in order to provide you with better visibility to the underlying performance of our businesses. The fiscal '17 net sales growth guidance Don will provide today will be stated on an organic basis. And for reference, we posted 3 years of organic net sales growth history on our website.

We're encouraged by the traction we saw in our Consumer First initiative on many important businesses. Our operating performance strengthened as we returned to growth in organic sales and segment operating profit, made good progress on margin expansion and exceeded our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. We took important strategic actions during the year to reshape our portfolio for growth, including the divestiture of the Green Giant business in North America, significant category expansion to the Annie's brand, the launch of Yoplait in China and the acquisitions of EPIC Provisions' meat snacks in the U.S. and the Carolina yogurt business in Brazil. 
But we didn't hit the mark everywhere. We were disappointed in our performance in U.S. yogurt. And our China results, excluding the Yoplait launch, finished below our expectations, and the external environment in that market remains challenging. We also experienced merchandising headwinds at a large U.S. customer, which we should lap after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
As noted in this morning's press release, we're building on successes in fiscal 2016 to increase our fiscal 2018 cost savings target and accelerate and increase our adjusted operating profit margin goal. Our cost savings initiatives, which includes -- which include projects Century, Catalyst and Compass and further administrative cost savings from zero-based budgeting, generated $350 million in total annual savings in fiscal 2016, ahead of our original target. We have good visibility to continued strong cost savings over the next 2 years. And as a result, we're increasing our total annual savings target to $600 million by fiscal 2018, up from the previous target of $500 million. We're also implementing further efforts to optimize our spending, reduce complexity and streamline our operations to drive profitable growth, which will result in accelerated margin expansion.  We now expect to achieve an adjusted operating profit margin of 20% by fiscal 2018, up from the previous target of 18% by fiscal '20. This new target represents an increase of 400 basis points over fiscal 2015 levels. 
Now let's review fiscal 2016 results, beginning on Slide 6. Remember, this quarter's results were negatively impacted by foreign exchange, the Green Giant divestiture and the comparison to the 53rd week a year ago. We also aligned Yoplait Europe with our fiscal calendar, which caused us to report an extra month for that business in the quarter. Net sales totaled $3.9 billion, down 9% as reported and down 8% in constant currency, driven by the impact of divestitures in the 53rd week comparison. Segment operating profit totaled $654 million, down 18% on a constant currency basis, reflecting our highest quarter of input cost inflation as well as the items I mentioned earlier. Net earnings more than doubled to $380 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.62 as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, were $0.66, down 12% from last year's fourth quarter and down 11% in constant currency. 
Slide 7 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales grew 1% in the quarter, driven by pound volume growth. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales growth by 1 point. The 53rd week reduced net sales growth by 6 points. And the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced net sales growth by 3 points in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 8 summarizes our results for the full year. Net sales totaled $16.6 billion, down 6% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. Full year net sales increased modestly on an organic basis. Total segment operating profit totaled $3 billion, up 1% in constant currency. Net earnings increased 39% to $1.7 billion and diluted EPS was $2.77 as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS was $2.92, up 2% from fiscal 2015. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 5% compared to a year ago. 
Turning to our segment results. Slide 9 summarizes U.S. Retail performance. Full year net sales were down 5%, including a 2 point decline from the net impact of the Green Giant sale and the Annie's and EPIC acquisitions. The 53rd week comparison reduced annual net sales growth by an additional 1 point. Excluding the extra week last year, our cereal operating unit posted net sales growth in 2016. Segment operating profit increased 1% for the full year, and operating profit margin increased 120 basis points to nearly 22%. 
In the Convenience and Foodservice segment, our 6 Focus platforms posted 5% net sales growth in fiscal '16 with the strongest performance coming from frozen meals. This is the third consecutive year our 6 Focus platforms have grown at a mid-single-digit rate or better. Full year segment net sales declined 4%, driven by market index pricing on bakery flour and the exit of low-margin businesses in late fiscal '15. Full year segment operating profit was up 7%, driven by favorable product mix and our cost saving efforts. 
Slide 11 summarizes our International segment net sales results stated in constant currency. For the full year, International net sales grew 3%, including increases of 12% in Latin America, 3% in Europe and 1% in Asia/Pacific. Canada net sales declined 4% but were up low single digits, excluding the divestiture of Green Giant. In total, the net impact of acquisition and divestitures and the impact of 1 less week reduced full year net sales growth as reported by 2 points. Constant currency International segment operating profit declined 3% in fiscal 2016, primarily due to currency-driven inflation on imported products in certain markets, the impact of the Green Giant divestiture and the difference in weeks. 
As I said earlier, we made good progress on expanding margins in fiscal 2016. Full year adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points, driven by cost savings initiatives more than offsetting modest input cost inflation, which totaled 2% for the full year.  After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $88 million in fiscal 2016, up 12% in constant currency, primarily due to favorable input cost and volume growth for Häagen-Dazs Japan. Both JVs contributed to the strong profit growth. On a constant currency basis, net sales for Cereal Partners Worldwide were flat to last year with first half declines offset by growth in the second half. Häagen-Dazs Japan constant currency net sales increased 5% for the full year, driven by excellent results on new products. 
Slide 14 shows that our core working capital declined 41% versus last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to continued operational improvements across our businesses plus the onetime benefit of the Green Giant divestiture. This is the 13th consecutive quarter we've reduced our core working capital versus the prior year. Full year operating cash flow is $2.6 billion, up 3% versus last year. Capital expenditures totaled $729 million. Full year free cash flow is $1.9 billion, up 4% versus last year as we converted 104% of our adjusted after-tax earnings to free cash, ahead of our long-term goal of 95%. We paid $1.1 billion in dividends in 2016, and dividends per share were $1.78, up 7% from last year. Net share repurchases totaled $435 million, and we reduced average net shares outstanding by 1%, in line with our guidance. 
Slide 16 highlights our key assumptions for fiscal 2017. We expect to drive organic net sales growth of low single digits for our growth businesses, which represent 3/4 of our portfolio. That growth will be offset by mid-single-digit organic declines on the remainder of our portfolio, where we're prioritizing profitable volume. The Green Giant divestiture will reduce net sales by about 1 point and EPS by approximately $0.03. We expect to deliver $380 million of cost of goods HMM, which will more than offset cost inflation of 2%. And we'll deliver an incremental $150 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017 from previously announced projects, which will bring the total annual savings figure to $500 million. 
Finally, on Slide 17, you can see a summary of our fiscal 2017 guidance. We expect organic net sales growth to be in the range between down 2% and flat, reflecting the actions we're taking to reduce unprofitable volume on certain businesses. Adjusted gross margin is targeted to be up 150 basis points, driven by our margin expansion initiatives. Media investment is expected to be down by single digits. We project total segment operating profit will increase 6% to 8% on a constant currency basis. And we expect our adjusted operating margin -- operating profit margin will be 150 basis points above the 16.8% we delivered in fiscal '16. Interest expense is expected to be flat to last year, reflecting a relatively stable rate environment, higher debt levels and changes in mix of debt. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be up 100 basis points, given the phasing of foreign tax credits and favorable F '16 settlements. 
We plan to continue returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases. For fiscal 2017, we're targeting a net reduction of 1% to 2% in average diluted shares outstanding. And we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be up between 6% and 8% in constant currency. We estimate foreign currency will be a $0.01 to $0.02 headwind to full year adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2017, although I'll note that this figure does not include the recent fluctuations in the British pound. Finally, we expect 2017 first quarter adjusted diluted EPS will be below last year's first quarter that grew 36% in constant currency. We expect to post adjusted diluted EPS growth in each of the remaining 3 quarters of 2017. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."

Our Consumer First renovation and innovation news gained traction on a number of businesses, though we have work to do in ce",2584,"Okay. Well, thanks, Don, and once again, good morning to all of you. 
Fiscal 2016 was an important step forward for our business. Our Consumer First renovation and innovation news gained traction on a number of businesses, though we have work to do in certain areas to improve our trends. We reshaped our portfolio with strategic acquisitions and divestitures. And we strengthened our business model and drove a significant increase in our profit margin. 
Let me share some 2016 highlights across our businesses, starting with U.S. Cereal. 
The U.S. Cereal category has improved considerably since last year, returning to growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Importantly, this improvement is being driven by stronger renovation and innovation aligned with current consumer interests, supported by effective marketing investment. And General Mills has been a key contributor to the category turnaround. Our Cereal business has consistently strengthened throughout the year with retail sales up 3% in the fourth quarter. And as Don mentioned, full year net sales for our Cereal business grew in fiscal 2016 on an organic basis. 
Consumer First renovation has been critical to our renewed growth. We launched gluten-free Cheerios last summer to address the needs of the many consumers who are reducing or eliminating their gluten intake. After declining 8% in fiscal 2015, retail sales on our renovated Cheerios varieties, which make up roughly 90% of the Cheerios franchise, increased 5% in the second half of 2016. We also announced that we're removing artificial colors and flavors from our Cereal line. 75% of our cereals met this claim by January. And at that time, we began advertising behind 7 newly renovated cereals, including Trix, Golden Grahams and Reese's Puffs. And I'm very happy to say consumers are responding. These 7 varieties posted 8% retail sales growth in the back half of the year compared to 6% declines in 2015, and much of that growth has come from full-priced baseline sales. 
Sales of our Nature Valley bars strengthened throughout the year as our product renovation news gained traction. We made our crunchy bars easier to bite, addressing our top consumer complaint. We also told consumers about our gluten-free options and reminded them that Nature Valley bars are free from artificial colors and flavors. Retail sales grew 4% in the second half of fiscal 2016, including 5% growth in the fourth quarter. 
LÄRABAR has posted consistent double-digit growth since we acquired the business 8 years ago. We continue to look for ways to expand penetration beyond its current consumer base and accelerate the brand's growth. And to that end, LÄRABAR launched its first ever TV campaign in January. And together with strong in-store merchandising and distribution support, the business has grown 40% in Nielsen-measured channels. We'll continue this support in fiscal 2017. Net sales for our Natural & Organic portfolio, which includes LÄRABAR were up double digit in 2016. In January, we expanded our portfolio with the addition of EPIC Provisions meat snacks. We now have a portfolio of 9 brands that generate $750 million in pro forma net sales in 2016, and we are well on our way to achieving our goal of $1 billion in net sales by 2019. 
Now fiscal 2016 was a disappointing year for our U.S. yogurt top line and share. Dairy deflation sparked increased competition, and we were not as aggressive in reinvesting this favorability. In addition, our marketing and innovation efforts underperformed our expectations. However, we were able to improve our profitability through record-level HMM and spending discipline. We remain very committed to winning in the U.S. yogurt category, and we recognize that we have work to do to improve our performance. And I'll share more details on these plans in just a moment. 
We posted good performance in 2016 during the soup and baking seasons. We grew ready-to-serve soup market share by 2 points during the soup season, thanks to successful merchandising, product renovation news and good advertising. Our Pillsbury refrigerated dough business had a good baking season with growth in retail sales and market share up 1.8 points. These results were driven by distribution gains on our top selling products. And we grew market share for our dessert mixes during the key baking season by aligning our prices more closely with our competition. 
Turning to our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, we saw another year of good growth in 2016 for our Focus 6 platforms, with net sales up 5%. Frozen meals led our performance, posting strong double-digit net sales growth behind our K-12 meals, led by Mini Bagels, one of our biggest product launches in recent history. We continued to see strong performance on our cereal bowl packs, and these helped drive mid-single-digit net sales growth for our cereal business in 2016. And net sales for our yogurt business were up on the strength of Yoplait, Parfait Pro and our Kid Yogurts. 
Now let's turn to our International segment and our developed market businesses. We posted low single-digit retail sales growth in Canada in fiscal 2016. Growth on our snacks and Old El Paso businesses there was fueled by Consumer First innovation, including Nature Valley Nut and Seed Crisps and Old El Paso Stand 'N Stuff tacos. Retail sales in our Europe region were also up low single digit behind the success of our Häagen-Dazs stick bars launched in France and innovation-driven growth on Old El Paso. 
In emerging markets, constant currency Latin American net sales were up 12% in 2016, driven by good performance on seasonings, inflation-driven pricing and our acquisition of Carolina yogurt.  Yoplait in Shanghai achieved 10% share in the latest quarter and has helped offset a slowdown in Häagen-Dazs shop performance in China, driven by challenging economic condition. Finally, net sales in India were up double-digit behind innovation and geographic expansion. 
CPW, our 50-50 joint venture with Nestlé, exited fiscal 2016 with momentum, posting 3% net sales growth in the fourth quarter. This performance was driven by product innovation and renovation, including good growth on its line of gluten-free cereal. For the year, CPW constant-currency net sales matched year-ago results, while profits grew double digit. 
So overall in fiscal 2016, we made important progress to strengthen our business model and improve momentum on a number of business lines. In fiscal 2017, our plan is to build on last year's successes, while maintaining our strategic focus on Consumer First. We're sharpening the way we think about our portfolio by being more choiceful about our level of investment and expectations for growth across our businesses, resulting in focused growth and strong margin expansion in 2017. We're taking a strategic approach to define growth and foundation portfolio roles for our business in 2017, taking into consideration category and brand strength, competitive dynamics and relative return on investment. 
Our growth businesses include cereal, snack bars, our national and organic brands, yogurt, Totino's and Old El Paso and all of these within U.S. Retail; then the Focus 6 platforms in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment; and finally, all of our international markets are included in the growth classifications. 
Now for most of these growth businesses, we're building off positive net sales momentum in 2016. In some cases, for example U.S. Yogurt and China, we see strong long-term growth potential, but we need to improve our current trajectory. In total, these growth businesses make up approximately 75% of our net sales and a similar proportion of operating profit, and we expect them to grow at a low single-digit rate in fiscal 2017. 
Our second group of businesses is no less critical to the success of our company but play a different role. They're part of the foundation of our business and deliver strong, consistent profit that helps fund top line growth initiative and return cash to shareholders. 
In aggregate, their top line growth prospects are not as robust as the first group, so we'll be very selective in our growth investments focusing where we have strong ROIs. These foundation businesses make up the remaining 25% of our net sales and consist primarily of refrigerated dough, desserts and soup in U.S. Retail as well as bakery flour and frozen dough products in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment. We expect 2017 net sales on these businesses to decline mid-single digit as we reduce unprofitable volume and drive improved margin. 
Now let me share an overview of our fiscal 2017 plans across our portfolio, beginning with our U.S. business. We exited 2016 with good momentum on both U.S. cereal and snack bars, and we plan to drive growth on these businesses again in 2017. We will continue our renovation efforts by converting 2 more Cheerios varieties to gluten-free and by removing artificial colors and flavors from 5 additional cereals. We're also launching a number of exciting new cereals, including 3 varieties of Annie's cereals and 2 varieties of Tiny Toast, which are hitting shelves now. To support these efforts, we have a strong media plan in place with cereal investment up mid-single digit, and we're focused on optimizing merchandising and driving positive net price realization for our cereal business. 
We have a good lineup of news on our snack bars businesses as well. We're renovating the packaging on Nature Valley bars, launching new flavors of our popular Nature Valley Nut Butter Biscuits and introducing Nature Valley Backpacker, oatmeal snacks geared toward school-aged kids. 
On LÄRABAR, we plan to extend our strong performance into fiscal 2017 with continued media and in-store support. We also have a full slate of plans for Annie's, our largest Natural & Organic business. We posted double-digit growth on distribution of our core products last year, and we plan to continue to leverage the strength of our U.S. Retail sales force to drive double-digit distribution growth in 2017.  We will also benefit from a full year of category expansion in soup, yogurt and cereal, and we have even more Annie's news that Jeff Harmening will tell you about at our Investor Day event in 2 weeks. 
We believe in the long-term growth opportunity in U.S. yogurt; however, it will take us some time to restore top line growth as we shift our portfolio towards faster-growing segments like Greek, organic and kids. This month, we're rolling out new Greek Whips!, a full calorie version of our successful Greek 100 Whips! product. We'll expand our presence in the fast-growing organic segment by launching Annie's Tubes and large sized yogurts and by converting Liberté to a premium organic line. And we have a strong lineup of Kid Yogurt news, which we'll share at Investor Day. 
We'll also improve the effectiveness of our consumer messaging by refocusing on all-family snacking, and we'll increase our merchandising competitiveness in 2017, securing more display at competitive price points. Some of this will be funded by shifting dollars out of consumer investment, where we have by far the highest share of voice in the category. 
Given our current rate of decline, we expect full year fiscal 2017 net sales to be down, but we expect our losses to moderate as we move through the year.
Let me also touch on a few of our foundation businesses in U.S. Retail, including soup, refrigerated dough and dessert mix. Here we are reducing low ROI trade and consumer investment and reducing complexity by optimizing our SKU assortment. Even so, we will continue to bring important news to consumers in 2017. 
For example, on Progresso soup, we're moving our entire line to antibiotic-free chicken, a first for a mainstream soup brand. On Pillsbury refrigerated dough, we're launching new shelf-ready packaging that will increase the productivity of the aisle for our retail customers and the shopability of the aisle for our consumers. And on Betty Crocker, we're relaunching our brownie mix to give consumers more premium ingredients and flavor variety. 
Turning to Convenience Stores and Foodservice. We'll continue growth for our Focus 6 platforms in 2017 with frozen meals and snacks leading the way. We're expanding distribution of Pillsbury pancakes and bagels in schools, leveraging our no artificial colors and flavors renovation. And we'll continue to grow distribution for our snacks in convenience stores, leveraging the Nature Valley news from U.S. Retail, but also bringing channel-specific news like Chex Mix Hot and Spicy renovation. 
In Canada, we're changing our Yoplait Source messaging, repositioning it from a diet product to a great-tasting yogurt made with real fruit and no added sugar. We will also bring gluten-free Cheerios news to Canada in 2017 and are scaling up the rollout of Annie's to capitalize on the sizable Natural & Organic segment in this market. In Europe, we'll introduce new flavors of Häagen-Dazs stick bars and extend the line to markets beyond France. We're also introducing Old El Paso Stand 'N Stuff Minis, targeting younger consumers as well as the appetizer occasion, and we're launching Panier Extra, a premium positioned fruit on the bottom Greek-style yogurt. 
We have exciting news planned for emerging markets in 2017 as well. In Brazil, we're launching new Yoki popcorn products, supporting our new Carolina yogurt business and executing pricing and managing mix to maintain our margins. In China, we plan to build on our successful Yoplait launch in Shanghai. And just this month, we introduced Yoplait in Beijing. We also plan to innovate on our Häagen-Dazs mooncake line, launching rose-shaped varieties. In India, we'll drive strong growth for our Pillsbury business to increase distribution and new product launches in sweet snacks and meals, including new cakes and pizza mixes. And finally, in Mexico, we'll leverage digital support, in-store marketing and event sampling to expand our successful Nature Valley franchise. 
Now as Don mentioned earlier, we see a number of opportunities to accelerate our margin expansion efforts over the next 2 years. We'll continue to benefit from HMM and our previously announced cost-saving projects, and we're taking additional actions to further expand our margins. These include: sharpening the focus of our trade and consumer investments between our growth and foundation businesses; reducing complexity by streamlining our SKUs and generating more profitable mix; and delivering additional savings from our supply chain and our zero-based budgeting practices. And in total, these efforts will help us drive our adjusted operating profit margin to 20% by fiscal 2018. 
We expect our efforts to drive focused growth and margin expansion will result in fiscal 2017 organic net sales growth to range between flat and down 2%, with 150-basis-point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin and 6% to 8% growth in constant currency adjusted diluted EPS. 
Now looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect modest growth in organic net sales as we maintain positive momentum on many growth businesses and see improvement in others such as U.S. yogurt in China. The full benefit of our margin expansion efforts will help drive adjusted operating profit margin to 20% and will generate a low double-digit increase in constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS in 2018. 
So let me close today by summarizing our key messages. We made important progress to return our business to growth in organic sales and operating profit in 2016. We strengthened our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures as well as category and market expansions. We're taking clear action across the portfolio to drive focused growth, margin expansion and strong returns in fiscal 2017 and 2018. And these efforts will set the stage for sustainable long-term growth and value creation for General Mills shareholders. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. So operator, you can open the call up for questions."

I think over the next 2 years you've got incremental savings of about $250 million. But obviously, you're looking for a very significant step-up, 300 basis points or so, in operating margin expansion. And so, I guess -- and that's despite, obviously, some organic sales decline perhaps in aggregate over the next 2 years. So I guess the question is really where does that incremental margin expansion come from that you're projecting? I'm assuming it's the work that's being done around this portfolio segmentation. But I'm trying to get -- you get the sense of what I'm looking for?"

So we got the value right in desserts, and we found that by optimizing some trade in Pillsbury, we could actually still grow share and the profitability of the business. And at the same time, we also found that when we focused our consumer spending on areas that had the highest returns, things like cereal and snacking, we also found out we liked the returns we got there. So we learned a lot in F '16 that has informed how we look at F '17 and beyond."

And so we really replaced our bets on the area where we think we have the best opportunities for growth. So even if advertising is down a little bit, we believe that we've refocused the spending that we do have in the areas that are going to work harder for us. The other thing that I will tell you is that we feel great about our renovation efforts. And when we started, we saw the benefits of those starting in the back half of this year, so whether it was gluten-free on Cheerios or the taste improvement on Nature Valley or no, no, no in cereal. Those things really only started in the back half of this year, and so those will carry forward to next year as well as some more renovation, which I'll talk in more detail about in a couple of weeks. So our renovation efforts will carry over, and we feel very positive about those. And we also think we have a better new product line up next year. So despite the fact that our consumer spending is going to be down a little bit as well as our trade, we feel like we're putting the spending in the right places, our renovation is working and we have increased levels of new product innovation."

So where we're talking about our growth opportunities, we are seeing increased investment. The other thing not to lose sight of is that we also have investment going back into the products. So it's not always just in the media line. Ken mentioned about our renovation in soup, for example. Obviously, the full year benefit of gluten and no, no, no, on cereal will have a top line benefit.

Because we expect our U.S. yogurt business to be improving as we get out of '18 into '19. China and emerging markets, more broadly China and Brazil, we expect to strengthen as well. So those businesses, we both have a strong base today, but we have very strong plans in place and reasons to believe that we'll see some slight acceleration in the growth. And then to Ken's point, the foundation businesses are really the stable core. And if you think about those brands, they're large high-share scaled businesses, primarily here in the U.S. or entirely here in the U.S. But they're also -- they are receptive and reactive to targeted investments. And we'll -- and as Ken said, we'll continue to do that. And so while there may be a onetime step down over the next year to 18 months, we do expect those brands to stabilize over time. And as a result, as we get through '18, into '19, we fully expect to be back on what I'd call more our normal operating model, which would be driven by low single-digit sales growth as a start point."

And we appreciate your observation that our pace of bringing innovation and renovation to the market is accelerating, because that's been our goal. We really feel that that's the right thing to do in this environment. So I agree with your observation. We're very focused on keeping our organization, here, we're on our toes. We're very focused on the consumer. We want to bring the right kind of innovation at a higher pace, because that's appropriate. And we're very, very focused, as you said, on execution in that environment. And we feel good about the way -- particularly the way we executed our innovation last year. Our incentive -- let me just make this comment on incentive for our operating units, who are kind of the tip of the spear for all this innovation. Their incentive reflects very much sort of the dual mandate that we talked about at CAGNY and we've talked about here today. We're focused on both growth and return. And our operating units are incented on growth and return. And both the growth businesses and the foundation businesses are incented that way. So while our growth targets may be more modest on the foundation businesses, it's just as important to the company that they hit their targets as the growth guys do. So everyone is aligned with this dual approach that we've talked about, and we think that we're going to benefit from that. I don't know if anyone else would want to jump in on that. Okay.

And we see accelerated growth from Annie's in this fiscal year, and on the backs of distribution, which is been consistent throughout the year -- distribution growth, as well as improved merchandising as the year has gone on. And we are going to -- we'll keep doing those things with the Annie's business. There's lots of distribution we can get. We can keep doing better merchandising. And we'll add on top of that expansion into categories that we think are really viable for Annie's, namely yogurt and cereal. In terms of what we learned earlier in the year, what I would tell you is that, as with any integration, there are things that don't go perfectly. But there's nothing that hasn't been rectified, and at the beginning of our year, really, it was our merchandising plans that didn't come together the way we wanted them to. We were gaining good distribution, but we have seen that change in the back half of the year. And our sales force is executing really well, both in the Natural & Organic channel and in traditional retail against our organic brands right now."

And doing that as brands that people trust. You can generate important news that consumers care about on brands they trust, and the results are usually pretty good. In terms of how long those can last, I guess I would go back -- the best example we have is Chex in cereal, where we grew that business on the back of gluten-free for -- double digits for like 5 years in a row. And so we believe that the long-lasting impacts of getting the products right for renovation: we believe they're long-lasting.

We're encouraged by the traction we saw in our Consumer First initiative on many important businesses. Our operating performance strengthened as we returned to growth in organic sales and segment operating profit, made good progress on margin expansion and exceeded our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. We took important strategic actions during the year to reshape our portfolio for growth, including the divestiture of the Green Giant business in North America, significant category expansion to the Annie's brand, the launch of Yoplait in China and the acquisitions of EPIC Provisions' meat snacks in the U.S. and the Carolina yogurt business in Brazil. 
But we didn't hit the mark everywhere. We were disappointed in our performance in U.S. yogurt. And our China results, excluding the Yoplait launch, finished below our expectations, and the external environment in that market remains challenging. We also experienced merchandising headwinds at a large U.S. customer, which we should lap after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
As noted in this morning's press release, we're building on successes in fiscal 2016 to increase our fiscal 2018 cost savings target and accelerate and increase our adjusted operating profit margin goal. Our cost savings initiatives, which includes -- which include projects Century, Catalyst and Compass and further administrative cost savings from zero-based budgeting, generated $350 million in total annual savings in fiscal 2016, ahead of our original target. We have good visibility to continued strong cost savings over the next 2 years. And as a result, we're increasing our total annual savings target to $600 million by fiscal 2018, up from the previous target of $500 million. We're also implementing further efforts to optimize our spending, reduce complexity and streamline our operations to drive profitable growth, which will result in accelerated margin expansion. We now expect to achieve an adjusted operating profit margin of 20% by fiscal 2018, up from the previous target of 18% by fiscal '20. This new target represents an increase of 400 basis points over fiscal 2015 levels. 
Now let's review fiscal 2016 results, beginning on Slide 6. Remember, this quarter's results were negatively impacted by foreign exchange, the Green Giant divestiture and the comparison to the 53rd week a year ago. We also aligned Yoplait Europe with our fiscal calendar, which caused us to report an extra month for that business in the quarter. Net sales totaled $3.9 billion, down 9% as reported and down 8% in constant currency, driven by the impact of divestitures in the 53rd week comparison. Segment operating profit totaled $654 million, down 18% on a constant currency basis, reflecting our highest quarter of input cost inflation as well as the items I mentioned earlier. Net earnings more than doubled to $380 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.62 as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, were $0.66, down 12% from last year's fourth quarter and down 11% in constant currency. 
Slide 7 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales grew 1% in the quarter, driven by pound volume growth. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales growth by 1 point. The 53rd week reduced net sales growth by 6 points. And the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced net sales growth by 3 points in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 8 summarizes our results for the full year. Net sales totaled $16.6 billion, down 6% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. Full year net sales increased modestly on an organic basis. Total segment operating profit totaled $3 billion, up 1% in constant currency. Net earnings increased 39% to $1.7 billion and diluted EPS was $2.77 as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS was $2.92, up 2% from fiscal 2015. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 5% compared to a year ago. 
Turning to our segment results. Slide 9 summarizes U.S. Retail performance. Full year net sales were down 5%, including a 2 point decline from the net impact of the Green Giant sale and the Annie's and EPIC acquisitions. The 53rd week comparison reduced annual net sales growth by an additional 1 point. Excluding the extra week last year, our cereal operating unit posted net sales growth in 2016. Segment operating profit increased 1% for the full year, and operating profit margin increased 120 basis points to nearly 22%. 
In the Convenience and Foodservice segment, our 6 Focus platforms posted 5% net sales growth in fiscal '16 with the strongest performance coming from frozen meals. This is the third consecutive year our 6 Focus platforms have grown at a mid-single-digit rate or better. Full year segment net sales declined 4%, driven by market index pricing on bakery flour and the exit of low-margin businesses in late fiscal '15. Full year segment operating profit was up 7%, driven by favorable product mix and our cost saving efforts. 
Slide 11 summarizes our International segment net sales results stated in constant currency. For the full year, International net sales grew 3%, including increases of 12% in Latin America, 3% in Europe and 1% in Asia/Pacific. Canada net sales declined 4% but were up low single digits, excluding the divestiture of Green Giant. In total, the net impact of acquisition and divestitures and the impact of 1 less week reduced full year net sales growth as reported by 2 points. Constant currency International segment operating profit declined 3% in fiscal 2016, primarily due to currency-driven inflation on imported products in certain markets, the impact of the Green Giant divestiture and the difference in weeks. 
As I said earlier, we made good progress on expanding margins in fiscal 2016. Full year adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points, driven by cost savings initiatives more than offsetting modest input cost inflation, which totaled 2% for the full year. After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $88 million in fiscal 2016, up 12% in constant currency, primarily due to favorable input cost and volume growth for Häagen-Dazs Japan. Both JVs contributed to the strong profit growth. On a constant currency basis, net sales for Cereal Partners Worldwide were flat to last year with first half declines offset by growth in the second half. Häagen-Dazs Japan constant currency net sales increased 5% for the full year, driven by excellent results on new products. 
Slide 14 shows that our core working capital declined 41% versus last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to continued operational improvements across our businesses plus the onetime benefit of the Green Giant divestiture. This is the 13th consecutive quarter we've reduced our core working capital versus the prior year. Full year operating cash flow is $2.6 billion, up 3% versus last year. Capital expenditures totaled $729 million. Full year free cash flow is $1.9 billion, up 4% versus last year as we converted 104% of our adjusted after-tax earnings to free cash, ahead of our long-term goal of 95%. We paid $1.1 billion in dividends in 2016, and dividends per share were $1.78, up 7% from last year. Net share repurchases totaled $435 million, and we reduced average net shares outstanding by 1%, in line with our guidance. 
Slide 16 highlights our key assumptions for fiscal 2017. We expect to drive organic net sales growth of low single digits for our growth businesses, which represent 3/4 of our portfolio. That growth will be offset by mid-single-digit organic declines on the remainder of our portfolio, where we're prioritizing profitable volume. The Green Giant divestiture will reduce net sales by about 1 point and EPS by approximately $0.03. We expect to deliver $380 million of cost of goods HMM, which will more than offset cost inflation of 2%. And we'll deliver an incremental $150 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017 from previously announced projects, which will bring the total annual savings figure to $500 million. 
Finally, on Slide 17, you can see a summary of our fiscal 2017 guidance. We expect organic net sales growth to be in the range between down 2% and flat, reflecting the actions we're taking to reduce unprofitable volume on certain businesses. Adjusted gross margin is targeted to be up 150 basis points, driven by our margin expansion initiatives. Media investment is expected to be down by single digits. We project total segment operating profit will increase 6% to 8% on a constant currency basis. And we expect our adjusted operating margin -- operating profit margin will be 150 basis points above the 16.8% we delivered in fiscal '16. Interest expense is expected to be flat to last year, reflecting a relatively stable rate environment, higher debt levels and changes in mix of debt. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be up 100 basis points, given the phasing of foreign tax credits and favorable F '16 settlements. 
We plan to continue returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases. For fiscal 2017, we're targeting a net reduction of 1% to 2% in average diluted shares outstanding. And we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be up between 6% and 8% in constant currency. We estimate foreign currency will be a $0.01 to $0.02 headwind to full year adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2017, although I'll note that this figure does not include the recent fluctuations in the British pound. Finally, we expect 2017 first quarter adjusted diluted EPS will be below last year's first quarter that grew 36% in constant currency. We expect to post adjusted diluted EPS growth in each of the remaining 3 quarters of 2017. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."

Well, thanks, Don, and once again, good morning to all of you. Fiscal 2016 was an important step forward for our business. Our Consumer First renovation and innovation news gained traction on a number of businesses, though we have work to do in ce",2584,"Okay. Well, thanks, Don, and once again, good morning to all of you. 
Fiscal 2016 was an important step forward for our business. Our Consumer First renovation and innovation news gained traction on a number of businesses, though we have work to do in certain areas to improve our trends. We reshaped our portfolio with strategic acquisitions and divestitures. And we strengthened our business model and drove a significant increase in our profit margin. 
Let me share some 2016 highlights across our businesses, starting with U.S. Cereal. 
The U.S. Cereal category has improved considerably since last year, returning to growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Importantly, this improvement is being driven by stronger renovation and innovation aligned with current consumer interests, supported by effective marketing investment. And General Mills has been a key contributor to the category turnaround. Our Cereal business has consistently strengthened throughout the year with retail sales up 3% in the fourth quarter. And as Don mentioned, full year net sales for our Cereal business grew in fiscal 2016 on an organic basis. 
Consumer First renovation has been critical to our renewed growth. We launched gluten-free Cheerios last summer to address the needs of the many consumers who are reducing or eliminating their gluten intake. After declining 8% in fiscal 2015, retail sales on our renovated Cheerios varieties, which make up roughly 90% of the Cheerios franchise, increased 5% in the second half of 2016. We also announced that we're removing artificial colors and flavors from our Cereal line. 75% of our cereals met this claim by January. And at that time, we began advertising behind 7 newly renovated cereals, including Trix, Golden Grahams and Reese's Puffs. And I'm very happy to say consumers are responding. These 7 varieties posted 8% retail sales growth in the back half of the year compared to 6% declines in 2015, and much of that growth has come from full-priced baseline sales. 
Sales of our Nature Valley bars strengthened throughout the year as our product renovation news gained traction. We made our crunchy bars easier to bite, addressing our top consumer complaint. We also told consumers about our gluten-free options and reminded them that Nature Valley bars are free from artificial colors and flavors. Retail sales grew 4% in the second half of fiscal 2016, including 5% growth in the fourth quarter. 
LÄRABAR has posted consistent double-digit growth since we acquired the business 8 years ago. We continue to look for ways to expand penetration beyond its current consumer base and accelerate the brand's growth. And to that end, LÄRABAR launched its first ever TV campaign in January. And together with strong in-store merchandising and distribution support, the business has grown 40% in Nielsen-measured channels. We'll continue this support in fiscal 2017. Net sales for our Natural & Organic portfolio, which includes LÄRABAR were up double digit in 2016. In January, we expanded our portfolio with the addition of EPIC Provisions meat snacks. We now have a portfolio of 9 brands that generate $750 million in pro forma net sales in 2016, and we are well on our way to achieving our goal of $1 billion in net sales by 2019. 
Now fiscal 2016 was a disappointing year for our U.S. yogurt top line and share. Dairy deflation sparked increased competition, and we were not as aggressive in reinvesting this favorability. In addition, our marketing and innovation efforts underperformed our expectations. However, we were able to improve our profitability through record-level HMM and spending discipline. We remain very committed to winning in the U.S. yogurt category, and we recognize that we have work to do to improve our performance. And I'll share more details on these plans in just a moment. 
We posted good performance in 2016 during the soup and baking seasons. We grew ready-to-serve soup market share by 2 points during the soup season, thanks to successful merchandising, product renovation news and good advertising. Our Pillsbury refrigerated dough business had a good baking season with growth in retail sales and market share up 1.8 points. These results were driven by distribution gains on our top selling products. And we grew market share for our dessert mixes during the key baking season by aligning our prices more closely with our competition. 
Turning to our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, we saw another year of good growth in 2016 for our Focus 6 platforms, with net sales up 5%. Frozen meals led our performance, posting strong double-digit net sales growth behind our K-12 meals, led by Mini Bagels, one of our biggest product launches in recent history. We continued to see strong performance on our cereal bowl packs, and these helped drive mid-single-digit net sales growth for our cereal business in 2016. And net sales for our yogurt business were up on the strength of Yoplait, Parfait Pro and our Kid Yogurts. 
Now let's turn to our International segment and our developed market businesses. We posted low single-digit retail sales growth in Canada in fiscal 2016. Growth on our snacks and Old El Paso businesses there was fueled by Consumer First innovation, including Nature Valley Nut and Seed Crisps and Old El Paso Stand 'N Stuff tacos. Retail sales in our Europe region were also up low single digit behind the success of our Häagen-Dazs stick bars launched in France and innovation-driven growth on Old El Paso. 
In emerging markets, constant currency Latin American net sales were up 12% in 2016, driven by good performance on seasonings, inflation-driven pricing and our acquisition of Carolina yogurt. Yoplait in Shanghai achieved 10% share in the latest quarter and has helped offset a slowdown in Häagen-Dazs shop performance in China, driven by challenging economic condition. Finally, net sales in India were up double-digit behind innovation and geographic expansion. 
CPW, our 50-50 joint venture with Nestlé, exited fiscal 2016 with momentum, posting 3% net sales growth in the fourth quarter. This performance was driven by product innovation and renovation, including good growth on its line of gluten-free cereal. For the year, CPW constant-currency net sales matched year-ago results, while profits grew double digit. 
So overall in fiscal 2016, we made important progress to strengthen our business model and improve momentum on a number of business lines. In fiscal 2017, our plan is to build on last year's successes, while maintaining our strategic focus on Consumer First. We're sharpening the way we think about our portfolio by being more choiceful about our level of investment and expectations for growth across our businesses, resulting in focused growth and strong margin expansion in 2017. We're taking a strategic approach to define growth and foundation portfolio roles for our business in 2017, taking into consideration category and brand strength, competitive dynamics and relative return on investment. 
Our growth businesses include cereal, snack bars, our national and organic brands, yogurt, Totino's and Old El Paso and all of these within U.S. Retail; then the Focus 6 platforms in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment; and finally, all of our international markets are included in the growth classifications. 
Now for most of these growth businesses, we're building off positive net sales momentum in 2016. In some cases, for example U.S. Yogurt and China, we see strong long-term growth potential, but we need to improve our current trajectory. In total, these growth businesses make up approximately 75% of our net sales and a similar proportion of operating profit, and we expect them to grow at a low single-digit rate in fiscal 2017. 
Our second group of businesses is no less critical to the success of our company but play a different role. They're part of the foundation of our business and deliver strong, consistent profit that helps fund top line growth initiative and return cash to shareholders. 
In aggregate, their top line growth prospects are not as robust as the first group, so we'll be very selective in our growth investments focusing where we have strong ROIs. These foundation businesses make up the remaining 25% of our net sales and consist primarily of refrigerated dough, desserts and soup in U.S. Retail as well as bakery flour and frozen dough products in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment. We expect 2017 net sales on these businesses to decline mid-single digit as we reduce unprofitable volume and drive improved margin. 
Now let me share an overview of our fiscal 2017 plans across our portfolio, beginning with our U.S. business. We exited 2016 with good momentum on both U.S. cereal and snack bars, and we plan to drive growth on these businesses again in 2017. We will continue our renovation efforts by converting 2 more Cheerios varieties to gluten-free and by removing artificial colors and flavors from 5 additional cereals. We're also launching a number of exciting new cereals, including 3 varieties of Annie's cereals and 2 varieties of Tiny Toast, which are hitting shelves now. To support these efforts, we have a strong media plan in place with cereal investment up mid-single digit, and we're focused on optimizing merchandising and driving positive net price realization for our cereal business. 
We have a good lineup of news on our snack bars businesses as well. We're renovating the packaging on Nature Valley bars, launching new flavors of our popular Nature Valley Nut Butter Biscuits and introducing Nature Valley Backpacker, oatmeal snacks geared toward school-aged kids. 
On LÄRABAR, we plan to extend our strong performance into fiscal 2017 with continued media and in-store support. We also have a full slate of plans for Annie's, our largest Natural & Organic business. We posted double-digit growth on distribution of our core products last year, and we plan to continue to leverage the strength of our U.S. Retail sales force to drive double-digit distribution growth in 2017. We will also benefit from a full year of category expansion in soup, yogurt and cereal, and we have even more Annie's news that Jeff Harmening will tell you about at our Investor Day event in 2 weeks. 
We believe in the long-term growth opportunity in U.S. yogurt; however, it will take us some time to restore top line growth as we shift our portfolio towards faster-growing segments like Greek, organic and kids. This month, we're rolling out new Greek Whips!, a full calorie version of our successful Greek 100 Whips! product. We'll expand our presence in the fast-growing organic segment by launching Annie's Tubes and large sized yogurts and by converting Liberté to a premium organic line. And we have a strong lineup of Kid Yogurt news, which we'll share at Investor Day. 
We'll also improve the effectiveness of our consumer messaging by refocusing on all-family snacking, and we'll increase our merchandising competitiveness in 2017, securing more display at competitive price points. Some of this will be funded by shifting dollars out of consumer investment, where we have by far the highest share of voice in the category. 
Given our current rate of decline, we expect full year fiscal 2017 net sales to be down, but we expect our losses to moderate as we move through the year.
Let me also touch on a few of our foundation businesses in U.S. Retail, including soup, refrigerated dough and dessert mix. Here we are reducing low ROI trade and consumer investment and reducing complexity by optimizing our SKU assortment. Even so, we will continue to bring important news to consumers in 2017. 
For example, on Progresso soup, we're moving our entire line to antibiotic-free chicken, a first for a mainstream soup brand. On Pillsbury refrigerated dough, we're launching new shelf-ready packaging that will increase the productivity of the aisle for our retail customers and the shopability of the aisle for our consumers. And on Betty Crocker, we're relaunching our brownie mix to give consumers more premium ingredients and flavor variety. 
Turning to Convenience Stores and Foodservice. We'll continue growth for our Focus 6 platforms in 2017 with frozen meals and snacks leading the way. We're expanding distribution of Pillsbury pancakes and bagels in schools, leveraging our no artificial colors and flavors renovation. And we'll continue to grow distribution for our snacks in convenience stores, leveraging the Nature Valley news from U.S. Retail, but also bringing channel-specific news like Chex Mix Hot and Spicy renovation. 
In Canada, we're changing our Yoplait Source messaging, repositioning it from a diet product to a great-tasting yogurt made with real fruit and no added sugar. We will also bring gluten-free Cheerios news to Canada in 2017 and are scaling up the rollout of Annie's to capitalize on the sizable Natural & Organic segment in this market. In Europe, we'll introduce new flavors of Häagen-Dazs stick bars and extend the line to markets beyond France. We're also introducing Old El Paso Stand 'N Stuff Minis, targeting younger consumers as well as the appetizer occasion, and we're launching Panier Extra, a premium positioned fruit on the bottom Greek-style yogurt. 
We have exciting news planned for emerging markets in 2017 as well. In Brazil, we're launching new Yoki popcorn products, supporting our new Carolina yogurt business and executing pricing and managing mix to maintain our margins. In China, we plan to build on our successful Yoplait launch in Shanghai. And just this month, we introduced Yoplait in Beijing. We also plan to innovate on our Häagen-Dazs mooncake line, launching rose-shaped varieties. In India, we'll drive strong growth for our Pillsbury business to increase distribution and new product launches in sweet snacks and meals, including new cakes and pizza mixes. And finally, in Mexico, we'll leverage digital support, in-store marketing and event sampling to expand our successful Nature Valley franchise. 
Now as Don mentioned earlier, we see a number of opportunities to accelerate our margin expansion efforts over the next 2 years. We'll continue to benefit from HMM and our previously announced cost-saving projects, and we're taking additional actions to further expand our margins. These include: sharpening the focus of our trade and consumer investments between our growth and foundation businesses; reducing complexity by streamlining our SKUs and generating more profitable mix; and delivering additional savings from our supply chain and our zero-based budgeting practices. And in total, these efforts will help us drive our adjusted operating profit margin to 20% by fiscal 2018. 
We expect our efforts to drive focused growth and margin expansion will result in fiscal 2017 organic net sales growth to range between flat and down 2%, with 150-basis-point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin and 6% to 8% growth in constant currency adjusted diluted EPS. 
Now looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect modest growth in organic net sales as we maintain positive momentum on many growth businesses and see improvement in others such as U.S. yogurt in China. The full benefit of our margin expansion efforts will help drive adjusted operating profit margin to 20% and will generate a low double-digit increase in constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS in 2018. 
So let me close today by summarizing our key messages. We made important progress to return our business to growth in organic sales and operating profit in 2016. We strengthened our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures as well as category and market expansions. We're taking clear action across the portfolio to drive focused growth, margin expansion and strong returns in fiscal 2017 and 2018. And these efforts will set the stage for sustainable long-term growth and value creation for General Mills shareholders.

But obviously, you're looking for a very significant step-up, 300 basis points or so, in operating margin expansion. And so, I guess -- and that's despite, obviously, some organic sales decline perhaps in aggregate over the next 2 years. So I guess the question is really where does that incremental margin expansion come from that you're projecting? I'm assuming it's the work that's being done around this portfolio segmentation.

But more importantly, as we look at SKU rationalization, as we look at the portfolio, as you mentioned, more rigorously, there's a mix benefit to us as well. And so you'll see that come through in '17 and even more so as we go into '18."

And at the same time, we also found that when we focused our consumer spending on areas that had the highest returns, things like cereal and snacking, we also found out we liked the returns we got there. So we learned a lot in F '16 that has informed how we look at F '17 and beyond."

And so we really replaced our bets on the area where we think we have the best opportunities for growth. So even if advertising is down a little bit, we believe that we've refocused the spending that we do have in the areas that are going to work harder for us. The other thing that I will tell you is that we feel great about our renovation efforts. And when we started, we saw the benefits of those starting in the back half of this year, so whether it was gluten-free on Cheerios or the taste improvement on Nature Valley or no, no, no in cereal. Those things really only started in the back half of this year, and so those will carry forward to next year as well as some more renovation, which I'll talk in more detail about in a couple of weeks. So our renovation efforts will carry over, and we feel very positive about those. And we also think we have a better new product line up next year. So despite the fact that our consumer spending is going to be down a little bit as well as our trade, we feel like we're putting the spending in the right places, our renovation is working and we have increased levels of new product innovation."

So where we're talking about our growth opportunities, we are seeing increased investment. The other thing not to lose sight of is that we also have investment going back into the products. So it's not always just in the media line. Ken mentioned about our renovation in soup, for example. Obviously, the full year benefit of gluten and no, no, no, on cereal will have a top line benefit. But as we talked about in F '16, there were some product costs related to that as well. So we've got back -- it's sharpening where we're investing back on the media, and it's also continuing to invest back in our products."

So those businesses, we both have a strong base today, but we have very strong plans in place and reasons to believe that we'll see some slight acceleration in the growth. And then to Ken's point, the foundation businesses are really the stable core. And if you think about those brands, they're large high-share scaled businesses, primarily here in the U.S. or entirely here in the U.S. But they're also -- they are receptive and reactive to targeted investments. And we'll -- and as Ken said, we'll continue to do that. And so while there may be a onetime step down over the next year to 18 months, we do expect those brands to stabilize over time. And as a result, as we get through '18, into '19, we fully expect to be back on what I'd call more our normal operating model, which would be driven by low single-digit sales growth as a start point."

Our original yogurt business hasn't been too bad, but our Light -- Yoplait Light business has been challenged as has been our merchandising. And importantly, as we look at this coming year, what we need to do is we need to get back to the right merchandising plan, which we will do. We'll shift some spending out of consumer spending into merchandising to make sure we get the right merchandising plan on traditional.

And that's really the reason why we really have changed so many things about our approach within our businesses around the world. Our super-high focus on Consumer First just to acknowledge how rapidly consumers are changing their values around food. We have to make sure that we stay even with that. And we appreciate your observation that our pace of bringing innovation and renovation to the market is accelerating, because that's been our goal. We really feel that that's the right thing to do in this environment. So I agree with your observation. We're very focused on keeping our organization, here, we're on our toes. We're very focused on the consumer. We want to bring the right kind of innovation at a higher pace, because that's appropriate. And we're very, very focused, as you said, on execution in that environment. And we feel good about the way -- particularly the way we executed our innovation last year. Our incentive -- let me just make this comment on incentive for our operating units, who are kind of the tip of the spear for all this innovation. Their incentive reflects very much sort of the dual mandate that we talked about at CAGNY and we've talked about here today. We're focused on both growth and return. And our operating units are incented on growth and return. And both the growth businesses and the foundation businesses are incented that way. So while our growth targets may be more modest on the foundation businesses, it's just as important to the company that they hit their targets as the growth guys do. So everyone is aligned with this dual approach that we've talked about, and we think that we're going to benefit from that. I don't know if anyone else would want to jump in on that. Okay. No, everyone is happy with my answer, Alexia. I guess, we're going to the follow up."

And we just concluded after seeing the results and seeing the effectiveness of this work that it would be helpful. Frankly, it helps us a lot, internally, to be much more declarative and intentional about the role that we want different businesses to play. So we just decided -- I can't remember what your word, what your term was, but just to be more declarative and much more intentional about how we were going to pursue these initiatives. And I think you used the word intensity. So even higher focus. We think that's very good for us inside the business, and it's also very helpful, I think, to investors to understand how we are looking at it. So it is, as you said, a build with more specifics.

Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal '17 results. 
General Mills' performance in the first quarter was mixed. We made good progress against our 2017 adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS growth. But as Ken will tell you, our organic net sales results did not meet our expectations. We expect our sales growth to improve in the balance of the year as we see continued growth in certain businesses as we execute a number Consumer First actions across our portfolio. 
We'll also lap easier comps, easier net sales comps in the remainder of the year. Over the course of our remarks this morning will note the businesses itself particularly challenging comparisons this quarter. 
On the bottom line, we continue to progress towards our 2 -- 20% adjusted operating profit margin goal, and we announced further margin expansion issues in July. And we are affirming full year fiscal '17 growth targets today. 
Some review our first quarter. Slide 5 summarizes the first quarter fiscal '17 financial results. Net sales totaled $3.9 billion, down 7% as reported. Organic net sales declined 4%. Total segment operating profit totaled $787 million, down 4% on a constant-currency basis. Recall that last year's first quarter, our total segment operating profit increased 23% in constant currency. 
Net earnings decreased 4% to $409 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.67 as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability was $0.78. Constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS decreased 1% compared to last year results that grew 36%. 
Slide 6 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales declined 4% in the quarter, driven by lower organic pound volume growth, partially offset by 2 points of positive organic sales mix and net price realization. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales growth by 1 point and the net impact of acquisition and divestitures reduced net sales growth by an additional 2 points in the quarter. 
Turning to first quarter segment results. Total U.S. Retail net sales declined 8%. The set's operating unit posted 2% net sales growth, driven by excellent performance on Annie's and Lärabar. This is offset by declines in the other operating units. 
Organic net sales were down 5%. From a year ago levels, they're up 1%. The difference between reported and organic net sales results in U.S. Retail primarily reflects the divestiture of Green Giant in fiscal '16. 
In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, net sales declined 7% in the first quarter. Net sales in our focus 6 businesses were down 1% versus last year, primarily due to slower trends and continued store channel, timing of customer orders for back-to-school and a comparison against 9% growth a year ago. 
Yogurt, Cereal and Biscuit posted strongest growth in the Focus 6 platforms. 
Net sales declined 12% on our non-focus 6 businesses, driven by market index pricing on bakery flour. 
Slide 9 summarizes our International segment net sales results in constant currency and on organic basis. At the recent level, constant-currency net sales in Latin America grew 3%, driven by strong snacks performance in Brazil and benefits in pricing. 
Net sales in Asia Pacific region increased 1% in constant currency, reflecting low single digit growth in China. Canned sales were down 2% in constant currency. Excluding the Green Giant divestiture, constant-currency net sales in Canada were up low single digits. 
And in Europe, sales were down 6% as we lapped 7% growth in last year's first quarter buying the Häagen-Dazs Stick Bar launch and good growth from Yoplait's anniversary news. 
On an organic basis, first quarter International segment net sales declined 1%. 
First quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 30 basis points from last year results, they were up 290 basis points. For the full year, we continue to target $380 million of cost of goods sold, HMM, which were more than offset our expectations of 2% input cost inflation. 
For the first quarter, adjusted operating profit margin expanded 80 basis points to 19.2%, due in part to double-digit reductions in media spending at our foundation businesses and in U.S. Yogurt as well as incremental benefits from our cost-savings initiatives, including zero-based budgeting. 
Slide 11 details our segment operating profit results in the first quarter. As I've mentioned, total segment operating profit is down 4% in constant currency. U.S. Retail, segment operating profit declined 6% from year ago levels, they were up 38%. Constant-currency international profit declined 11% due to currency-driven inflation on products imported to Canada and the U.K. 
In Convenience Stores and Foodservice profits were up 16%, driven by lower input costs, higher merchandising earnings and comparison against the 9% decline in last year's first quarter. 
Combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $24 million in the quarter, down 10% in constant currency, primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher promotional expense as well as comparison to a 16% growth in last year's first quarter. 
CPW net sales grew 1% in constant currency with good gain in Latin America and Asia, Africa and Middle East regions. Häagen-Dazs Japan constant currency sales essentially masked year ago results. They were up 9%. 
Slide 13 summarizes other noteworthy income statement items in the quarter. We incurred $86 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter, including $27 million recorded in cost of sales. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, decreased by $14 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased 2% from the prior year. We continue to expect full year interest expense will be flat to last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.9% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 31.4%, 90 basis points below last year due to discrete state tax benefits and favorable impacts of U.S. federal tax legislation passed in fiscal '16. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be 100 basis points higher than last year due to foreign tax credits and favorable settlements. 
Our average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% in the quarter in line with our full year expectation of 1% to 2% reduction. 
Turning to balance sheet. Slide 14 shows that our core working capital decreased 33% versus last year's first quarter, primarily due to continued operational improvements across our businesses as well as the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. First quarter operating cash flow was $299 million, down from $431 million a year ago largely driven by timing of payables. 
Capital investments in the quarter totaled $154 million. We remain on track to grow full year free cash flow mid-single digits in line with our original guidance. 
And we returned $627 million to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter. 
We continue to make progress in our margin expansion goal. In July, we announced a number of new restructuring actions that will further support this effort. We plan to close our soup factory in Vineland, New Jersey in order to eliminate excess capacity in our U.S. Retail supply chain. We expect this action will be completed by the end of fiscal '19. 
Additionally, we are eliminating excess capacity and exiting unprofitable businesses in our International segment. 
In Brazil, we'll close one of our snacks manufacturing facilities and will cease production operations on certain snacks and meals products at another facility. 
We're also restructuring our snack business in China and have plans to stop production on certain underperforming products in that market. We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal '17. 
Our progress in margin expansion in the first quarter gives us increased confidence that we can achieve our goal of 20% adjusted operating profit margin by fiscal '18. 
As we outlined at our Investor Day presentation in July, we see our margin expansion coming in 3 primary areas: First, we expect cost of goods sold HMM to outpace input cost inflation in fiscal '17. 
Second, we now expect to deliver $620 million in savings from the administrative and supply chain restructuring initiatives we've announced today as well as the implementation of zero-based budgeting. This represents an incremental $270 million of savings over the next 2 years; and third, we're implementing a number of additional initiatives, including trading consumer spending efficiency, SKU optimization and further savings from our supply chain in our ZBB efforts. 
We estimate the pre cost-savings projects and other new initiatives will combined to generate about 75% of our margin expansion in fiscal '17 and '18 in roughly equal measure with the balance coming from our cost of goods HMM savings exceeding input cost inflation in fiscal '17. 
So let me close my portion of our remarks by reiterating that we are reaffirming the fiscal '17 guidance we outlined in June, mainly we expect organic net sales growth to be between flat and down 2%. We're targeting total segment operating profit growth of 6% to 8% on a constant-currency basis with adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 150 basis points, and we expect adjusted diluted EPS will be up between 6% and 8% in constant currency. 
We also now expect foreign currency translation will be a $0.02 headwind to full year diluted EPS results. 
With that, I'll turn you over to Ken."
274715,381715253,1049219,"General Mills, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2016",2016-09-21,"Earnings Calls","General Mills, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Well, thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don described, we've made good progress in our first quarter on our operating profit margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share goals. However, our net sales performance did not meet our expec",3161,"Okay. Well, thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don described, we've made good progress in our first quarter on our operating profit margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share goals. However, our net sales performance did not meet our expectation due to the challenging macro environments, a difficult year-over-year comparison and a slower start to the year on certain businesses. 
We're taking actions to improve our net sales performance going forward, leveraging our Consumer First focus. 
At the same time, we have a number of encouraging examples across our global portfolio where our efforts to adapt to evolving consumer interest are driving positive results. Let me share with the examples of the areas where we're focused on driving improvement and the businesses leading our first quarter performance in each our segments, starting with U.S. Retail. 
There have been a good deal of discussion about retail sales trends in our industry recently. We've seen total U.S. food and beverage retail sales slow over the last few quarters. Units have held stable, but net price appreciation has decelerated from adding 2 points of growth a year ago to adding less than 50 basis points of growth in our first quarter. And Nielsen data shows deflation in certain sections on the perimeter of the store, including dairy and meat. But we are seeing good price discipline I the vast majority of our categories where average unit prices are up a little more than 2%. 
Performance for our U.S. Retail businesses in the first quarter was mixed. We had a slower start than we planned on Yoplait, Fiber One bars and in our Cereal business, and we're working to improve our performance in these categories going forward with innovation, renovation and good messaging. 
Retail sales for our foundation businesses were generally in line with our expectations. However, we start double-digit net sales declines on Progresso soup, driven by lower customer inventory levels.  And our Natural & Organic businesses are driving excellent growth on core categories and with new innovation. 
Let me share some more details on each of these businesses. We continue to see challenging trends on our U.S. Yogurt business, driven primarily by significant declines on our Yoplait Life and Greek 100 product lines. Consumers of traditional light yogurts are pivoting away from this segment in favor products that provide more satiety like Greek yogurts. 
That said, there are a number of deeply loyal consumers who are committed to this segment and to our products, so we plan to continue serving these loyal consumers, and we'll leverage our category management efforts to ensure that Yoplait Light remain the leading option within the light segment of the shelf. 
On Greek 100, we were the first the market in the light Greek segment and built a strong early position. However, with significant competition in this segment, our products have become less differentiated, so we're looking to change that by rolling out a significant product improvement over the next few months. 
Our reformulated line of Yoplait Greek 100 products will contain up to 40% more protein, but are still only 100 calories and contain just 9 grams of sugar, and we dramatically improved the taste of these products, while adding more protein, which is not an easy thing to do. Our new Yoplait Greek 100 products will be on shelf in time for weight management season in January. 
And we have yogurt renovation planned beyond Greek 100. In fact, by the end of the year, we will have renovated 60% of our yogurt portfolio. So far, we made changes to our entire kid portfolio, including new packaging and a whole milk formula on our Yoplait Kids line, larger multipacks and kid equity caps and new signs of fresh packaging on Go-Gurt, yogurt in a tube.
We're also rolling out new packaging on our original style Yoplait yogurt as well. The improved visuals better communicate the great taste of our products and we're adding a flash on the front of the package to remind consumers that original style Yoplait contains 6 grams of protein. Our testing shows these changes drive increased consumer purchases, so we're looking forward to getting this news on shelf in the second half of the year. 
We also have a strong slate of innovation rolling out in the first half in Organic, Beverages and Greek, which are the 3 fastest-growing segments in the category. We entered the organic segment with Annie's and Liberté in the first quarter. Our Annie's product is a kid-targeted yogurt made from whole milk that comes in a range of flavors and formats, including cups, tubes and large sized tubs. 
In Liberté, which is a leading brand in Canada, it has small presence in the U.S. have been relaunched as a premium organic line of yogurts targeted to adults. These launches are just rolling out into the market now and although it's still early, we're seeing good distribution gains and strong early response from consumers. 
The yogurt beverage segment is growing double-digit, and we've introduced Yoplait Licuados and smoothies to capitalize on this trend. These are highly successful products for our Yoplait franchisee in Mexico, so we're targeting this launch to cities with large Hispanic populations with plans to expand geographically in future quarters. 
Within Greek, we've added to our successful Greek 100 Whips line with more indulgent higher calorie Greek Whips varieties that rolled out in the first quarter, and we have additional yogurt slated for the second half targeted towards the desert and snacking occasions, which are also seeing good growth. 
So we're highly focused on improving our U.S. Yogurt performance, and we believe that renovation and innovation are the keys to getting this business back to growth. And that's why we have such a broad set of initiatives this year, from strengthening our existing platforms with renovation on kid and original style Yoplait, new Greek Whips and a significant product improving on Greek 100, to building the segments in organic, beverages, desserts and snacking. About half of these initiatives are in market now, and they will build over the course of the year. The remainder will come to market by January and should drive further improvement for our U.S. Yogurt business in the back half of this year. 
Don mentioned that our U.S. Cereal net sales were down 4% in the first quarter. Part of that decline was driven by reduction in customer inventory levels as our retail sales in Nielsen measured outlets were only down 2%. But we're looking at our Cereal performance on a rolling 12-month basis. We've seen market improvement from our trends a year ago with our latest 12 months retail sales down just under 1%. And when we include non-measured channels, we'd estimate that performance would be closer to flat. We think we can continue to drive improvement in our Cereal business by putting the Consumer First and consistently delivering underneath with innovation and renovation, just as we've been doing. 
We continue to be encouraged by the performance from our 2 largest renovation initiatives, gluten-free Cheerios and no artificial colors or flavors news. Gluten-free Cheerios posted its fourth consecutive quarter of growth with retail sales up 2% in the first quarter. 
Similarly, the products we featured in our no artificial colors and flavors campaign have posted consistent growth since we began airing that advertising in January. Retail sales for these cereals were up another 3% in the quarter. 
So we like the traction we've got in our Cereal renovation efforts and we're also encouraged by the early results we're seeing on Cereal innovation like Nature Valley and Annie's that is targeted squarely towards current consumer interest. Annie's cereals are certified organic and come in 3 varieties that kids will like: Berry bunnies, cocoa bunnies and frosted oat flakes. We're getting good feedback from consumers so far and retailer acceptance has been excellent. We expect Annie's cereals sales will build throughout the year as we grow distribution and get these products in front of more consumers. 
In addition to bringing meaningful renovation and innovation to our business, we're implementing an initiative we call strategic revenue management, or SRM, to help us grow our cereal top line. As we said at our Investor Day event, we're establishing a more rigorous formalized process to drive positive net price realization and we'll focus on 4 key levers within our SRM initiative. 
First, optimizing our prices to capture the full value for our brands across channels, then increasing our sophistication on price pack architecture, managing our mix to maximize profitable growth; and driving promotional spending towards the highest returning activity. We've assessed the opportunities for each U.S. operating unit and then prioritize the levers that will drive most meaningful impact for fiscal '17 and '18. 
Altogether, the combination of Consumer First renovation and innovation, meaningful levels of consumer investments and our strategic revenue management efforts, should help us deliver improved net sales performance for our U.S. Cereal business over the course of fiscal '17. 
Our renovation efforts continue to work on Nature Valley as well. Our Nature Valley consumer line of granola bars renovated last year to make them easier to bite have posted 2% retail sales growth so far this year and year-to-date, retail sales for our gluten-free Nature Valley Protein Bars are up 5%. 
We also successfully launched Nature Valley nut butter biscuits in fiscal '16 and these products are continuing to drive growth this year. Consumers love these great tasting, more filling snacks the combine protein from nut butter with whole-grain biscuits, helping drive churns in the top third of the category. 
In fiscal '17, we're looking to build on the initiatives that have been driving growth for Nature Valley grain snacks. We're bringing back a successful media campaign, reminding consumers that our Nature Valley products contain no artificial flavors and colors. And we'll expand our Nature Valley nut butter biscuits line by introducing a cocoa almond butter variety to round out our current lineup of flavors. 
I mentioned earlier that Fiber One grains snacks have been challenging trends so far this year. I think the key to stabilizing this business is to bring news that reminds consumers that Fiber One fulfills the need for permissible indulgence, better than any other product in the bar section. So we're investing in new media this year to drive home our key message of superior taste with the added benefit of fiber. 
We're also launching new products to generate news. In January, we introducing 2 verities of layered chewy bars: Salted caramel chocolate chunk and double chocolate almond. These products truly deliver on Fiber One's promise of remarkable taste. And as we've seen in the past with Fiber One Brownies and Fiber One cheesecake, delivering remarkable products to consumers usually translates to excellent growth, so we're excited to get these products on shelf in the back half. 
And finally, we're bringing compelling renovation news to the Fiber One franchise by removing artificial flavors, colors and sweeteners from our Brownies line and from our largest chewy bar varieties. We've also reduced sugar on our oats and chocolate bars by 25%, all while maintaining their great taste, of course. 
So we like the news we're bringing to Fiber One snacks, and we look forward to seeing these initiatives gain traction in the coming quarters. 
Now let's turn to our Natural & Organic portfolio, where we've seen our top line results accelerate recently behind excellent ideas and great execution. 
For the most recent 3-month period, our 9 Natural & Organic brands posted 12% retail sales growth across natural and traditional channels. Annie's and Lärabar have been leading our growth so far this year. Retail sales for the Annie's category that existed at the time of acquisition like mac & cheese, crackers and fruit snacks, were up 20% in the first quarter, driven by continued distribution expansion and progress we've made moving Annie's SKUs into the main aisle. 
In our recent category extensions like yogurt, cereal, baked goods, snack bars and soup, our building distribution and helping grow household penetration for the Annie's brand. Retail sales for all Annie's product were up 28% in natural and traditional channels for the latest 3-month period. 
Lärabar has consistently grown double digits since we purchased the brand in 2008. But we've seen a step change in growth over the past 6 months, with retail sales up more than 40%, thanks to a great new advertising campaign, solid distribution expansion and excellent in-store merchandising support. 
So now let's turn to our foundation businesses, which consist largely of refrigerated dough, soup, and baking mixes in U.S. retail. We mentioned at our Investor Day that we're working to drive efficiency on these businesses by reducing SKUs and optimizing spending, which we expect to result in the loss of someone profitable volume. But at the same time, we're bringing targeted news to consumers to ensure that they remain engaged with our brands. 
On Pillsbury refrigerated dough, this summer, we renovated the shelf set with shelf-ready packaging, a simplified assortment and a new shelf layout, making it easier for our customers to stock the products and for the consumer to shop the section. We're transitioning our entire line of soup to antibiotic free chicken, a first for mainstream soup brand, more than 50% of Progresso  soups contain chicken, so this is a significant initiative for the brand. 
And we're renovating a number of Betty Crocker dessert products, including our Brownie line, giving consumers more of what they want. We're making our products more premium by offering more caramel and fudge, and we're upsizing the package, allowing consumers to make more Brownies from the same box. 
We're now entering the key season for these businesses, where they generate a large share of the revenue and profit for the year, and we feel confident that our plans will yield good results. 
Now let's turn to the Convenience Stores and Foodservice segments. Don mentioned that net sales in this segment was down 7%, driven primarily by index pricing on bakery flour. This pricing tracks with our flower input cost, so it's profit neutral, but it does hurt our top line. Don also mentioned that results in our Focus 6 platforms were impacted by the timing of back-to-school ordering. Despite this headwind, our cereal and yogurt businesses posted good net sales growth in the first quarter, driven by continued strength on Cinnamon Toast Crunch and gluten-free Cheerios as well as Yoplait Parfait Pro and large sized yogurt tubs. Going forward, we expect this segment's net sales performance will improve behind stronger growth in our Focus 6 business -- businesses and less headwind from bakery flour pricing. 
And now let's turn to highlights from our International segment, starting with Canada. Though constant-currency net sales in Canada were down due to the Green Giant divestiture, we delivered 3 months of positive retail sales growth, with gains across almost all of our categories. Retail sales for our cereals were up 6%, driven by strong back-to-school execution and benefits from our Olympic partnership. Wholesome snack retail sales were up 5%, behind innovation and sustaining demand for better for you Nature Valley snacks and retail sales for Old El Paso Mexican foods were up 11%, thanks to Stand 'N Stuff innovation and continued distribution gains. 
Wholesome snacks in Europe are off to a strong start as well, with retail sales up 13% across the region in the latest 3 months. We've seen gains from our Nature Valley Protein Bars renovation, new packaging on Nature Valley Crunchy bars and a launch of new Fiber One 90-calorie bars in the region, which provide consumers an indulgent treat with the benefit of fiber, all at only 90 calories per serving. 
And Old El Paso posted 5% retail sales growth in Europe, behind strength across the portfolio, driven by Stand 'N Stuff taco shell innovation and distribution gains on the existing portfolio. 
Don mentioned that in total, constant-currency net sales declined in Europe this quarter due to comparisons against exceptionally strong growth for Häagen-Dazs and Yoplait a year ago. As we lap those increases, we expect to see improved net sales growth in Europe in the remainder of the year. 
Turning to our Asia Pacific region. We delivered good performance on a number of businesses in China, which was partially offset by the impact of our snacks restructuring. Yoplait is performing well in Shanghai, and we are looking to replicate that success with our recent entry into Beijing. Constant-currency net sales were up mid-single digits on Häagen-Dazs, driven by same-store sales growth in shops. 
We also saw it single-digit constant-currency net sales growth on Wanchai Ferry products, led by performance in Tier 1 cities. 
In EMEA, Häagen-Dazs is off to a strong start, thanks to the introduction of stick bars and Pillsbury mixes help drive another quarter of growth in India. 
Finally, in Latin America, our Mexico business continues to deliver strong double-digit snacks growth behind Nature Valley and Fiber One. These brands are capitalizing on Mexican consumers' desire for great testing, better-for-you snacks, and we're executing well behind good consumer marketing plans and solid in-store support. 
In Brazil, retail sales for Yoki snacks were up 5% in the latest 3 months, behind Yoki Popcorn and pricing across our portfolio. Our side dishes business is also performing well, posting 16% growth in the latest 3-month period. 
As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '17, we believe there are a number of reasons why our organic net sales performance will improve. First, our U.S. Retail comparison goes from a year ago revenue growth that was up low single digits to growth that was down low single digits in each of the next 3 quarters. Our comparisons ease in other 2 segments as well as we lap index price changes in Convenience Stores and Foodservice and Europe's strong summer performance in fiscal '16. 
Second, we're continuing to invest behind the renovation and innovation news that's working, whether that's Cereal renovation, Natural & Organic in the U.S. or Old El Paso and Nature Valley across international. 
Third, we're taking actions to improve performance on a number of businesses such as yogurt and Fiber One bars in U.S. Retail. 
And finally, we're implementing strategic revenue management to drive improved net price realization for our U.S. Retail business. 
So with that, let me summarize today's remarks. We made good progress in the first quarter against our adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS goals. We had a slower start for net sales, but we have the right plans in place to improve performance going forward.

One, I guess, could you address, Ken or Jeff, could you address the broader category you're seeing in the weight management segment of the category, I guess, particularly in Greek because it seems like the Greek 100 relaunch is a major component of your strategy to improve sales this year. And just wondering, given all of the structural headwinds we've seen with some of the other categories with the weight management proposition around them, whether it's cereal or core cup, is that something you're seeing now bleeding into Greek as well? Or is the issue really just one of competition? And then I guess, a related question for Don, you've talked about double-digit reductions in media spending on yogurt. Just curious if that's an issue of timing or whether you're seeing a lower return profile that makes you comfortable pulling back there."

Let me take on both of those questions and Don can follow as needed on the second one of the U.S.. First one as a look at broader category trends in yogurt, specifically in weight management, consumers are looking for yogurt what they're looking for across categories, which is a satiety benefit, and ways to keep them fuller for longer. And that's the fundamental difference we see between our Greek 100 offering and why we're renovating that and what we see in Yoplait Light, which is 2 entry into this market. And so that's why you see us renovating Greek 100 as we are, adding 40% more protein and making it taste better at the same time because we know consumers are looking for satiety, Greek 100 can give than that. But they only that if the product taste really good. And so the bar is pretty high. And so that's why we have a high degree of confidence and the renovation efforts we're looking for in Greek 100 and why Yoplait Light will be the leader in the light segment. We don't see the turnaround in the same way that we see Greek 100 turning around and that's why you see us doing that. And as it relates to spending, I mentioned this in our Q4 update that we'll be taking our advertising down on yogurt this year and increasing our trade spending because on our advertising, we won't see the returns that we wanted to see. And we weigh  over index in the category of advertising spending relative to our competition. And so while we are reducing our advertising spending, we will still have more than our fair share of weighed advertising in the category. So we saw some opportunity to do that, which I also mentioned, as I said in June."

Our corporate items, our tax lines, our interest as I've mentioned and those will even out in the year as the year unfolds. Our focus on delivering the year, I'll touch on a little bit on meal because Jeff touched on it talked about it with Yoplait. But given that we're coming out of the quarter with immediate spending down double digits, we now expect media to be down double digits for the full year. That's a little bit lower than we had originally anticipated and the reduction will be the same place as the foundation businesses in U.S. Yogurt and will continue to increase in our growth businesses. But that's a reality of coming a little light and our top line in the first quarter. Now that all said, we continue to look for and as you point out, we believe our strong margin performance will help provide a fuel to reinvest in high return ideas as the year unfolds. So as a Jeff alluded to, whether it's in yogurt or other businesses, as we launched new products and as we see traction of those new products, we believe some of the cost-savings initiatives, we have some of the everything leverage will be able to generate we'll help us fund those ideas as the year unfolds."

We do expect Q2 to be better than Q1 from a sales, organic sales growth standpoint, and we expect the second half to do better than Q2. And a couple of factors that taken into account as we think about the Q1, Q2 movement and this -- we talked these in this script and maybe consolidate them all. First is the comps. Again, our F '16 Q1 organic sales growth was highest of the year at plus 2 and all segment showed growth in a particular strength in Häagen-Dazs and Yoplait. In Q2, we'll begin lapping negative organic growth, which was driven to a large extent by reduced merchandising on cereal and snacks, one of our large U.S. customers. So first is the comps will ease with some very specific reasons. Second is we expect even better price depreciation in Q2 versus Q1. Q1 we had 2 points of price mix appreciation. We expect even more in Q2. We start seeing the benefit of SRM, the trade optimization actions that we're taking in our foundation businesses in the U.S. We expect to continue pricing benefits in Brazil, and we expect lower drag from the bakery food, bakery flour pricing in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice business. So the second factors that we think pricing will improve our price mix appreciation will improve in the second quarter. Pipeline plays a bit of a role. We mentioned that we saw the consumer uptake ahead of shipments for U.S. Cereal, we also side for soup. We also some inventory reductions, large customer in our C&F business, and we don't expect any one else to reoccur in Q2. But lastly, most important factor, of course, positive in Consumer First initiative that Ken and Jeff have talked about. so we expect Q2 to better than Q1. We expect the second half to be better than the first half, and we expect the full year to come in between our flat and minus 2 guidance that we have initiated -- that we initiated back in June."

So let me start big picture and work all the way back to the category initiatives you talked about. Big picture, we see in Nielsen data and certainly I have heard from a lot of our retailers over the last month with my direct conversation with them is that we see prices deflationary or the inflation reducing in the store over the course of the last quarter or so. As we look and Ken shared with you earlier, as we look at what items at grocery that continue PC code, we have about 0.5% growth, I think 0.4% growth. A big portion of that is really reduction at egg pricing from a year ago. So if you strip out the pricing on eggs, it's about 1%  inflation, which is pretty consistent with the last couple of quarters. We had avian flu last year and the price of eggs was really high and it's a lot lower now so that accounts for a lot. We've also are -- I've also heard from are a lot of retail is about deflation and other parts, non-UPC so the perimeter of the store, things like dairy and meat. But what we're seeing in our categories really is about 2.5% price appreciation in the first quarter, and that's what we're seeing in our Nielsen and our categories as well. And so we've seen quite good price discipline in the vast majority of our categories, and there's no reason that, that will not continue going forward. Certainly, as we look at our SRM initiatives, we're gaining interest confidence of going to be effective. When we talk to the retailers about our pricing and what we're going to do with our foundation brands, we find pretty receptive audience to be honest and the first factor, the 75% of our business is growth and 25%, foundational, so we start with that. And within the foundational brands, our retailers are looking for little bit of inflation. So to the extent that they see deflation in some areas, a little bit of inflation in other areas isn't is such a bad thing. And the key to that is really to bring some level of investments the category in other forms. And so I've talked about before, but it's really important in that Progresso is going to be antibiotic free chicken and Pillsbury, it's a new shelf set as well as improving the quality of our products. And so we're making investments in other ways and our retailers are really receptive to that. And so we're not just milking these businesses without managing for cash, they're really foundation businesses, and we see good opportunities for investment in things other than pricing, we're doing those."

I guess, typically, that means there's a willingness to trade up a bit of less profitable volume for better profitability, which makes sense. So, I guess, my question is, whether the General Mills capacity utilization in those categories in which some of these actions are likely to be most pronounced. May be is it at the level that can handle some of the potential volume consequences of such a strategy on things like overhead absorption and such. Or, I guess, could there be a need at some point or maybe for the supply chain actions in addition to what maybe even announced already and discussed earlier on the call?"

As regards to capacity, we've made the moves in pricing and strategic revenue management with an eye for capacity as we look forward. And so clearly if there are additional capacity will remove that we need to optimize our supply chain you see that with soup, for example, in this last quarter where we saw an opportunity to improve the profitability and viability of our soup business by closing our Vineland plant.

Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal '17 results. General Mills' performance in the first quarter was mixed. We made good progress against our 2017 adjusted operating profit margin",1569,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal '17 results. 
General Mills' performance in the first quarter was mixed. We made good progress against our 2017 adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS goals. But as Ken will tell you, our organic net sales results did not meet our expectations. We expect our sales growth to improve in the balance of the year, as we see continued growth in certain businesses as we execute a number of Consumer First actions across our portfolio. We'll also lap easier comps -- easier net sales comps in the remainder of the year. Over the course of our remarks this morning, we'll note the businesses itself, particularly challenging comparisons this quarter. 
On the bottom line, we continue to progress towards our 2 -- our 20% adjusted operating profit margin goal, and we announced further margin expansion initiatives in July. And we are reaffirming full year fiscal '17 growth targets today. 
So let me review our performance in the quarter. Slide 5 summarizes the first quarter fiscal '17 financial results. Net sales totaled $3.9 billion, down 7% as reported. Organic net sales declined 4%. Total segment operating profit totaled $787 million, down 4% on a constant currency basis. Recall that last year's first quarter, our total segment operating profit increased 23% in constant currency. 
Net earnings decreased 4% to $409 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.67 as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, was $0.78. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS decreased 1% compared to last year results that grew 36%. 
Slide 6 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales declined 4% in the quarter, driven by lower organic pound volume growth, partially offset by 2 points of positive organic sales mix and net price realization. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales growth by 1 point. And the net impact of acquisition and divestitures reduced net sales growth by an additional 2 points in the quarter. 
Turning to first quarter segment results. Total U.S. Retail net sales declined 8%. The Snacks' operating unit posted 2% net sales growth, driven by excellent performance on Annie's and Lärabar. This was offset by declines in the other operating units. Organic net sales were down 5%. From year ago levels, they were up 1%. The difference between reported and organic net sales results in U.S. Retail primarily reflects the divestiture of Green Giant in fiscal '16. 
In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, net sales declined 7% in the first quarter. Net sales on our Focus 6 businesses were down 1% versus last year, primarily due to slower trends and continued store channel, timing of customer orders for back-to-school and a comparison against 9% growth a year ago. Yogurt, Cereal and Biscuits posted the strongest growth in the Focus 6 platforms. Net sales declined 12% on our non-focus 6 businesses, driven by market index pricing on bakery flour. 
Slide 9 summarizes our International segment net sales results in constant currency and on organic basis. At the recent level, constant currency net sales in Latin America grew 3%, driven by strong snacks performance in Brazil and benefits from pricing. Net sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 1% in constant currency, reflecting low single-digit growth in China. Canada sales were down 2% in constant currency. Excluding the Green Giant divestiture, constant currency net sales in Canada were up low single digits. And in Europe, sales were down 6% as we lapped 7% growth in last year's first quarter, behind the Häagen-Dazs Stick Bar launch and good growth from Yoplait's 50th anniversary news. On an organic basis, first quarter International segment net sales declined 1%. 
First quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 30 basis points from last year's results. They were up 290 basis points. For the full year, we continue to target $380 million of cost of goods sold, HMM, which will more than offset our expectations of 2% input cost inflation. For the first quarter, adjusted operating profit margin expanded 80 basis points to 19.2%, due in part to double-digit reductions in media spending on our foundation businesses and in U.S. Yogurt as well as incremental benefits from our cost-savings initiatives, including zero-based budgeting. 
Slide 11 details our segment operating profit results in the first quarter. As I mentioned, total segment operating profit was down 4% in constant currency. The U.S. Retail, segment operating profit declined 6% from year ago levels. They were up 38%. Constant currency International profit declined 11% due to currency-driven inflation on products imported to Canada and the U.K. And Convenience Stores and Foodservice profit was up 16%, driven by lower input cost, higher grain merchandising earnings and a comparison against the 9% decline in last year's first quarter. 
Combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $24 million in the quarter, down 10% in constant currency, primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher promotional expense as well as a comparison to a 16% growth in last year's first quarter. 
CPW net sales grew 1% in constant currency with good gains in the Latin America, in Asia, Africa and Middle East regions. Häagen-Dazs Japan constant currency sales essentially matched year ago results. They were up 9%. 
Slide 13 summarizes other noteworthy income statement items in the quarter. We incurred $86 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter, including $27 million recorded in cost of sales. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, decreased by $14 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased 2% from the prior year. We continue to expect full year interest expense will be flat to last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.9% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 31.4%, 90 basis points below last year due to discrete state tax benefits and favorable impacts of U.S. federal tax legislation passed in fiscal '16. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be 100 basis points higher than last year due to foreign tax credits and favorable settlements. And average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% in the quarter, in line with our full year expectation of a 1% to 2% reduction. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 14 shows that our core working capital decreased 33% versus last year's first quarter, primarily due to continued operational improvements across our businesses as well as the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. First quarter operating cash flow was $299 million, down from $431 million a year ago, largely driven by timing of payables. Capital investments in the quarter totaled $154 million. We remain on track to grow full year free cash flow mid-single digits, in line with our original guidance. And we returned $627 million to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter. 
We continue to make progress on our margin expansion goal. In July, we announced a number of new restructuring actions that will further support this effort. We plan to close our food -- our soup factory in Vineland, New Jersey in order to eliminate excess capacity in our U.S. Retail supply chain. We expect this action will be completed by the end of fiscal '19. 
Additionally, we are eliminating excess capacity and exiting unprofitable businesses in our International segment. In Brazil, we'll close one of our snacks manufacturing facilities and will cease production operations on certain snacks and meals products at another facility. We're also restructuring our Snacks business in China and have plans to stop production on certain underperforming products in that market. We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal '17. 
Our progress on margin expansion in the first quarter gives us increased confidence that we can achieve our goal of 20% adjusted operating profit margin by fiscal '18. As we outlined at our Investor Day presentation in July, we see our margin expansion coming in 3 primary areas. First, we expect cost of goods sold HMM to outpace input cost inflation in fiscal '17. Second, we now expect to deliver $620 million in savings from the administrative and supply chain restructuring initiatives we've announced today as well as the implementation of zero-based budgeting. This represents an incremental $270 million of savings over the next 2 years. And third, we're implementing a number of additional initiatives, including trading consumer spending efficiency, SKU optimization and further savings from our supply chain in our ZBB efforts. 
We estimate the previously announced cost-savings projects and the other new initiatives will combine to generate about 75% of our margin expansion in fiscal '17 and '18 in roughly equal measure with the balance coming from our cost of goods HMM savings exceeding input cost inflation in fiscal '17. 
So let me close my portion of our remarks by reiterating that we are reaffirming the fiscal '17 guidance we outlined in June, mainly, we expect organic net sales growth to be between flat and down 2%. We're targeting total segment operating profit growth of 6% to 8% on a constant currency basis with adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 150 basis points. And we expect adjusted diluted EPS will be up between 6% and 8% in constant currency. We also now expect foreign currency translation will be a $0.02 headwind to full year diluted EPS results. 
With that, I'll turn you over to Ken."

Well, thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don described, we made good progress in the first quarter on our operating profit margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share goals. However, our net sales performance did not meet our expectat",3166,"Okay. Well, thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don described, we made good progress in the first quarter on our operating profit margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share goals. However, our net sales performance did not meet our expectations due to the challenging macro environments, a difficult year-over-year comparison and a slower start to the year on certain businesses. 
We're taking actions to improve our net sales performance going forward, leveraging our Consumer First focus. At the same time, we have a number of encouraging examples across our global portfolio, where our efforts to adapt to evolving consumer interest are driving positive results. And let me share with you examples of the areas where we're focused on driving improvement and the businesses leading our first quarter performance in each of our segments starting with U.S. Retail. 
There had been a good deal of discussion about retail sales trends in our industry recently. We've seen total U.S. food and beverage retail sales slow over the last few quarters. Units have held stable, but net price appreciation has decelerated from adding 2 points of growth a year ago to adding less than 50 basis points of growth in our first quarter. And Nielsen data shows deflation in certain sections on the perimeter of the store, including dairy and meat. But we are seeing good price discipline in the vast majority of our categories, where average unit prices are up a little more than 2%. 
Performance for our U.S. Retail businesses in the first quarter was mixed. We had a slower start than we planned on Yoplait, Fiber One bars and in our Cereal business. And we're working to improve our performance in these categories going forward with innovation, renovation and good messaging.
Retail sales for our foundation businesses were generally in line with our expectations. However, we saw double-digit net sales declines on Progresso soup, driven by lower customer inventory levels. And our Natural & Organic businesses are driving excellent growth on core categories and with new innovation. Let me share some more details on each of these businesses. 
We continue to see challenging trends on our U.S. Yogurt business, driven primarily by significant declines on our Yoplait Light and Greek 100 product lines. Consumers of traditional light yogurts are pivoting away from this segment in favor of products that provide more satiety, like Greek yogurts. That said, there are a number of deeply loyal consumers who are committed to this segment and to our products, so we plan to continue serving these loyal consumers, and we'll leverage our category management efforts to ensure that Yoplait Light remain the leading option within the light segment of the shelf. On Greek 100, we were the first to market in the light Greek segment and built a strong early position. However, with significant competition in this segment, our products have become less differentiated, so we're looking to change that by rolling out a significant product improvement over the next few months. Our reformulated line of Yoplait Greek 100 products will contain up to 40% more protein, but are still only 100 calories and contain just 9 grams of sugar. And we've dramatically improved the taste of these products, while adding more protein, which is not an easy thing to do. Our new Yoplait Greek 100 products will be on shelf in time for weight management season in January. 
And we have yogurt renovation planned beyond Greek 100. In fact, by the end of the year, we will have renovated 60% of our yogurt portfolio. So far, we've made changes to our entire Kid portfolio, including new packaging and a whole milk formula on our Yoplait Kids line, larger multipacks and kid equity caps, and new sciences and fresh packaging on Go-Gurt, yogurt in a tube.
We're also rolling out new packaging on our original style Yoplait yogurt as well. The improved visuals better communicate the great taste of our products, and we're adding a flash on the front of the package to remind consumers that original style Yoplait contains 6 grams of protein. Our testing shows these changes drive increased consumer purchases, so we're looking forward to getting this news on shelf in the second half of the year. 
We also have a strong slate of innovation rolling out in the first half in Organic, Beverages and Greek, which are the 3 fastest-growing segments in the category. We entered the organic segment with Annie's and Liberté in the first quarter. Our Annie's product is a kid-targeted yogurt made from whole milk that comes in a range of flavors and formats, including cups, tubes and large-sized tubs. In Liberté, which is a leading brand in Canada, it has a small presence in the U.S. that had been relaunched as a premium organic line of yogurts targeted to adults. These launches are just rolling out into the market now. And although it's still early, we're seeing good distribution gains and strong early response from consumers. 
The yogurt beverage segment is growing double digit, and we've introduced Yoplait Licuados and smoothies to capitalize on this trend. These are highly successful products for our Yoplait franchisee in Mexico, so we're targeting this launch to cities with large Hispanic populations with plans to expand geographically in future quarters. 
Within Greek, we've added to our successful Greek 100 Whips line with more indulgent, higher-calorie Greek Whips varieties that rolled out in the first quarter. And we have additional yogurt launches slated for the second half targeted toward the dessert and snacking occasions, which are also seeing good growth. 
So we're highly focused on improving our U.S. Yogurt performance, and we believe that renovation and innovation are the keys to getting this business back to growth. And that's why we have such a broad set of initiatives this year, from strengthening our existing platforms with renovation on kid and original style Yoplait, new Greek Whips and a significant product improving on Greek 100, to building new segments in organic, beverages, desserts and snacking. About half of these initiatives are in market now, and they will build over the course of the year. The remainder will come to market by January and should drive further improvement for our U.S. Yogurt business in the back half of this year. 
Don mentioned that our U.S. Cereal net sales were down 4% in the first quarter. Part of that decline was driven by reduction in customer inventory levels, as our retail sales in Nielsen-measured outlets were only down 2%. But when looking at our Cereal performance on a rolling 12-month basis, we've seen marked improvement from our trends a year ago with our latest 12-month retail sales down just under 1%. And when we include non-measured channels, we'd estimate that performance will be closer to flat. We think we can continue to drive improvement in our Cereal business by putting the Consumer First and consistently delivering underneath with innovation and renovation, just as we've been doing. 
We continue to be encouraged by the performance from our 2 largest renovation initiatives, gluten-free Cheerios and no artificial colors or flavors news. Gluten-free Cheerios posted its fourth consecutive quarter of growth with retail sales up 2% in the first quarter. Similarly, the products we featured in our no artificial colors and flavors campaign have posted consistent growth since we began airing that advertising in January. Retail sales for these cereals were up another 3% in the quarter, so we like the traction we've gotten on our Cereal renovation efforts. And we're also encouraged by the early results we're seeing on Cereal innovation, like Nature Valley and Annie's that is targeted squarely towards current consumer interest. 
Annie's cereals are certified organic and come in 3 varieties that kids will like: Berry Bunnies, Cocoa Bunnies and Frosted Oat Flakes. We're getting good feedback from consumers so far, and retailer acceptance has been excellent. We expect Annie's cereals sales will build throughout the year, as we grow distribution and get these products in front of more consumers. 
In addition to bringing meaningful renovation and innovation to our business, we're implementing an initiative we call strategic revenue management, or SRM, to help us grow our cereal top line. As we said at our Investor Day event, we're establishing a more rigorous, formalized process to drive positive net price realization, and we'll focus on 4 key levers within our SRM initiative. First, optimizing our prices to capture the full value for our brands across channels and then increasing our sophistication on price pack architecture; managing our mix to maximize profitable growth; and driving promotional spending towards the highest returning activities. We've assessed the opportunities for each U.S. operating unit and then prioritized the levers that will drive the most meaningful impact for fiscal '17 and '18. Altogether, the combination of Consumer First renovation and innovation, meaningful levels of consumer investment and our strategic revenue management efforts should help us deliver improved net sales performance for our U.S. Cereal business over the course of fiscal '17. 
Our renovation efforts continue to work on Nature Valley as well. Our Nature Valley crunchy line and granola bars renovated last year to make them easier to bite have posted 2% retail sales growth so far this year. And year-to-date retail sales for our gluten-free Nature Valley Protein Bars are up 5%. We also successfully launched Nature Valley nut butter biscuits in fiscal '16 and these products are continuing to drive growth this year. Consumers love these great tasting, more filling snacks that combine protein from nut butter with whole-grain biscuits, helping drive turns in the top third of the category. 
In fiscal '17, we're looking to build on the initiatives that have been driving growth for Nature Valley grain snacks. We're bringing back a successful media campaign, reminding consumers that our Nature Valley products contain no artificial flavors and colors. And we'll expand our Nature Valley nut butter biscuit line by introducing a cocoa almond butter variety to round out our current lineup of flavors. 
I mentioned earlier that Fiber One grain snacks have seen challenging trends so far this year. I think the key to stabilizing this business is to bring news that reminds consumers that Fiber One fulfills the need for permissible indulgence, better than any other product in the bar section. So we're investing in new media this year to drive home our key message of superior taste with the added benefit of fiber. We're also launching new products to generate news. In January, we introducing 2 verities of layered chewy bars, salted caramel chocolate chunk and double chocolate almond. These products truly deliver on Fiber One's promise of remarkable taste. And as we've seen in the past with Fiber One Brownies and Fiber One Cheesecake, delivering remarkable products to consumers usually translates to excellent growth, so we're excited to get these products on shelf in the back half. 
And finally, we're bringing compelling renovation news to the Fiber One franchise by removing artificial flavors, colors and sweeteners from our Brownies line and from our largest chewy bar varieties. We've also reduced sugar on our oats and chocolate bars by 25%, all while maintaining their great taste, of course. So we like the news we're bringing to Fiber One snacks, and we look forward to seeing these initiatives gain traction in the coming quarters. 
Now let's turn to our Natural & Organic portfolio, where we've seen our top line results accelerate recently behind excellent ideas and great execution. For the most recent 3-month period, our 9 Natural & Organic brands posted 12% retail sales growth across natural and traditional channels. Annie's and Lärabar have been leading our growth so far this year. Retail sales for the Annie's category that existed at the time of acquisition like mac & cheese, crackers and fruit snacks, were up 20% in the first quarter, driven by continued distribution expansion and progress we've made moving Annie's SKUs into the main aisle. 
In our recent category extensions like yogurt, cereal, baked goods, snack bars and soup, our building distribution and helping grow household penetration for the Annie's brand, retail sales for all Annie's products were up 28% in natural and traditional channels for the latest 3-month period. 
Lärabar has consistently grown double digits since we purchased the brand in 2008. But we've seen a step change in growth over the past 6 months, with retail sales up more than 40%, thanks to a great new advertising campaign, solid distribution expansion and excellent in-store merchandising support. 
So now let's turn to our foundation businesses, which consist largely of refrigerated dough, soup, and baking mixes in U.S. retail. We mentioned at our Investor Day that we are working to drive efficiency on these businesses by reducing SKUs and optimizing spending, which we expect to result in the loss of some unprofitable volume. But at the same time, we're bringing targeted news to consumers to ensure that they remain engaged with our brands. 
On Pillsbury refrigerated dough, this summer, we renovated the shelf set with shelf-ready packaging, a simplified assortment and a new shelf layout, making it easier for our customers to stock the products and for the consumer to shop the section. We're transitioning our entire line of soup to antibiotic-free chicken, a first for our mainstream soup brand. More than 50% of Progresso soups contain chicken, so this is a significant initiative for the brand. 
And we're renovating a number of Betty Crocker dessert products, including our brownie line, giving consumers more of what they want. We're making our products more premium by offering more caramel and fudge, and we're upsizing the package, allowing consumers to make more brownies from the same box. 
We're now entering the key season for these businesses, where they generate a large share of the revenue and profit for the year, and we feel confident that our plans will yield good results. 
Now let's turn to the Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment. Don mentioned that net sales in this segment was down 7%, driven primarily by index pricing on bakery flour. This pricing tracks with our flour input cost, so it's profit neutral, but it does hurt our top line. Don also mentioned that results on our Focus 6 platforms were impacted by the timing of back-to-school ordering. Despite this headwind, our cereal and yogurt businesses posted good net sales growth in the first quarter, driven by continued strength on Cinnamon Toast Crunch and gluten-free Cheerios as well as Yoplait Parfait Pro and large-sized yogurt tubs. Going forward, we expect this segment's net sales performance will improve behind stronger growth on our Focus 6 business -- businesses and less headwind from bakery flour pricing. 
And now let's turn to highlights from our International segment, starting with Canada. Though constant currency net sales in Canada were down due to the Green Giant divestiture, we delivered 3 months of positive retail sales growth, with gains across almost all our categories. Retail sales for our cereals were up 6%, driven by strong back-to-school execution and benefits from our Olympic partnership. Wholesome snack retail sales were up 5%, behind innovation and sustaining demand for better-for-you Nature Valley snacks. And retail sales for Old El Paso Mexican foods were up 11%, thanks to Stand 'N Stuff innovation and continued distribution gains. 
Wholesome snacks in Europe are off to a strong start as well, with retail sales up 13% across the region in the latest 3 months. We've seen gains from our Nature Valley Protein Bar renovation, new packaging on Nature Valley Crunchy bars and the launch of new Fiber One 90-calorie bars in the region, which provide consumers an indulgent treat with the benefit of fiber, all at only 90 calories per serving. And Old El Paso posted 5% retail sales growth in Europe behind strength across the portfolio, driven by Stand 'N Stuff taco shell innovation and distribution gains on the existing portfolio. 
Don mentioned that in total, constant currency net sales declined in Europe this quarter due to comparisons against exceptionally strong growth for Häagen-Dazs and Yoplait a year ago. As we lap those increases, we expect to see improved net sales growth in Europe in the remainder of the year. 
Turning to our Asia-Pacific region. We delivered good performance on a number of businesses in China, which was partially offset by the impact of our snacks restructuring. Yoplait is performing well in Shanghai, and we are looking to replicate that success with our recent entry into Beijing. Constant currency net sales were up mid-single digits on Häagen-Dazs, driven by same-store sales growth in shops. We also saw mid-single-digit constant currency net sales growth on Wanchai Ferry products, led by performance in Tier 1 cities. 
In AMEA, Häagen-Dazs is off to a strong start, thanks to the introduction of stick bars, and Pillsbury mixes help drive another quarter of growth in India. 
Finally, in Latin America, our Mexico business continues to deliver strong double-digit snacks growth behind Nature Valley and Fiber One. These brands are capitalizing on Mexican consumers' desire for great testing, better-for-you snacks. And we're executing well behind good consumer marketing plans and solid in-store support. In Brazil, retail sales for Yoki snacks were up 5% in the latest 3 months, behind Yoki Popcorn and pricing across our portfolio. Our side dishes business is also performing well, posting 16% growth in the latest 3-month period. 
As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '17, we believe there are a number of reasons why our organic net sales performance will improve. First, our U.S. Retail comparison goes from a year ago revenue growth that was up low single digits to growth that was down low single digits in each of the next 3 quarters. Our comparisons ease in other 2 segments as well, as we lap index price changes in Convenience Stores and Foodservice and Europe's strong summer performance in fiscal '16. 
Second, we're continuing to invest behind the renovation and innovation news that's working, whether that's Cereal renovation, Natural & Organic in the U.S. or Old El Paso and Nature Valley across International. 
Third, we're taking actions to improve performance on a number of businesses, such as yogurt and Fiber One bars in U.S. Retail. 
And finally, we're implementing strategic revenue management to drive the improved net price realization for our U.S. Retail business. 
So with that, let me summarize today's remarks. We made good progress in the first quarter against our adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS goals. We had a slower start for net sales, but we have the right plans in place to improve performance going forward. We announced additional margin expansion in each initiatives in July, which are part of our path to achieving our 20% adjusted operating profit margin. And we remain on track to deliver our full year fiscal '17 growth goals. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. I'll now ask our operator to open the call for questions."

Because it seems as if the Greek 100 relaunch is a major component of your strategy to improve sales this year. And just wondering, given all of the structural headwinds we've seen with some of the other categories with the weight management proposition around them, whether it's cereal or core cup, is that something you're seeing now bleeding into Greek as well? Or is the issue really just one of competition? And then I guess, a related question for Don, you've talked about double-digit reductions in media spending on yogurt. Just curious if that's an issue of timing or whether you're seeing a lower return profile that makes you comfortable pulling back there."

Let me take on both of those questions and Don can follow up as needed on the second one that you asked. On the first one, as we look at broader category trends in yogurt and specifically in weight management, consumers are looking for in yogurt what they're looking for across categories, which is a satiety benefit and ways to keep them fuller for longer. And that's the fundamental difference we see between our Greek 100 offering and why we're renovating that and what we see in Yoplait Light, which are 2 entries into this market. And so that's why you see us renovating Greek 100 as we are, adding 40% more protein and making it taste better at the same time because we know consumers are looking for satiety, Greek 100 can give them that. But they only do it if the product tastes really good. And so the bar is pretty high. And so that's why we have a high degree of confidence in the renovation efforts we're looking for in Greek 100 and why Yoplait Light will be the leader in the light segment. But we don't see that turning around in the same way that we see Greek 100 turning around. So that's why you see us doing that. And as it relates to spending, I mentioned this in our Q4 update that we'll be taking our advertising down on yogurt this year and increasing our trade spending because on our advertising, we weren't seeing the returns that we wanted to see. And we were way overindexed in the category of advertising spending relative to our competition. And so while we are reducing our advertising spending, we will still have more than our fair share of weight in advertising in the category. So we saw an opportunity to do that, which I also mentioned as I said in June."

One was we had very strong plant and manufacturing performance. As we referenced, our media was down double digits for the quarter, which is ahead of what our full year guidance had been. And we had some favorable timing in below-the-line items, our corporate items, our tax lines, interest, as I've mentioned. And those will even out in the year as the year unfolds. Our focus is on delivering the year. I'll touch a little bit on media because Jeff touched on it or talked about it with Yoplait. But given that we're coming out of the quarter with media spending down double digits, we now expect media to be down double digits for the full year. That's a little bit lower than we had originally anticipated. And the reduction will be in the same place, the foundation businesses in U.S. yogurt and will continue to increase in our growth businesses. But that's a reality of coming in a little light on our top line in the first quarter. Now that all said, we continue to look for, and as you point out, we believe our strong margin performance will help provide the fuel to reinvest in high return ideas as the year unfolds. So as Jeff alluded to, whether it's in yogurt or other businesses, as we launch new products and as we see traction on those new products, we believe some of the cost savings initiatives we have, some of the operating leverage we're going to be able to generate will help us fund those ideas as the year unfolds."

We do expect Q2 to be better than Q1 from an organic sales growth standpoint. And we expect the second half to be better than Q2. And a couple of factors to take into account as we think about the Q1 to Q2 movement. And these-- we talked about these in this script. It maybe good just to consolidate them all. First is the comps. Again, our F '16 Q1 organic sales growth was the highest of the year at plus 2%. And all segment showed growth and we have particular strength in Häagen-Dazs and in Yoplait. In Q2, we'll begin lapping negative organic growth, which was driven to a large extent by reduced merchandising on cereal and snacks at one of our large U.S. customers. So first out is the comps will ease for some very specific reasons. Second is we expect even better price depreciation in Q2 versus Q1. Q1, we had 2 points of price/mix appreciation. We expect even more in Q2. That's when we start seeing the benefit of SRM, the trade optimization actions that we're taking in our foundation businesses in the U.S. We expect to see continued pricing benefits in Brazil. And we expect lower drag from the bakery food -- bakery flour pricing in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice business. So the second factor is that we think pricing will improve, our price/mix appreciation will improve in the second quarter. Pipeline plays a bit of a role. We mentioned that we saw the consumer uptake ahead of shipments for U.S. cereal. We also saw it for soup. We also had some inventory reductions in a large customer in our C&F business. And we don't expect any of those to reoccur in Q2. But lastly, the most important factor, of course, is the positive impact of all the Consumer First initiatives that Ken and Jeff have talked about. So we expect Q2 to be better than Q1. We expect the second half to be better than the first half. And we expect the full year to come in between our flat and minus 2% guidance that we have initiated -- that we initiated back in June."

It stands a bit in contrast to what we're seeing from the industry at large, grocers talking about deflationary price share, promotion sort of ticking back up in the industry overall. And some conjecture that given the market share battles happen at grocers, there's going to be a fair amount of pressure put on manufacturers to help sort of fund some of that. So I was hoping that you could just give us some context of what you're seeing in the industry overall. What gives you confidence on the ability to deploy some of these initiatives? And maybe in light of that context, how the retailers have received the direction and early indications of the path you're going down so far."

So let me start big picture and work our way back to the category initiatives you talked about. Big picture, we see in Nielsen data, and certainly I have heard from a lot of our retailers over the last month in my direct conversation with them, is that we see prices deflationary or the inflation reducing in the store over the course of the last quarter or so. As we look, and Ken shared with you earlier, as we look at what the items that, I think, groceries that contain the UPC code, we have about 0.5% growth, I think it's 24%. A big portion of that is really reduction of egg pricing from a year ago. So if you strip out the pricing on eggs, it's about 1% inflation, which is pretty consistent with the last couple of quarters. And so we had the flu last year and the price of eggs was really high. And it's a lot lower now, and so that counts for a lot. We've also heard -- I've also heard from a lot of retailers about deflation in other parts, non-UPC, so the perimeter of the store in things like dairy and meat. But what we're seeing in our categories really is about 2.5% price appreciation in the first quarter. And that's what we're seeing in our Nielsen and in our categories as well. And so as we -- and we've seen quite good price discipline in the vast majority of our categories. And there's no reason for us to think that, that won't continue going forward. Certainly, as we look to our SRM initiatives, we're gaining increased confidence that those are going to be effective. When we talk to the retailers about our pricing and what we're going to do with our foundation brands, we find a pretty receptive audience to be honest. And the first fact is that 75% of our business is growth and 25%, foundational. So we start with that. And within the foundational brands, our retailers are looking for a little bit of inflation. So to the extent that they see deflation in some areas, a little bit of inflation in other areas isn't such a bad thing. And the key to that really is to bring some level of investment to the category in other forms. And so I've talked about it before, but it's really important in that on Progresso, it's going to be about antibiotic-free chicken. And on Pillsbury, it's a new shelf set as well as improving the quality of our products. And so we're making investments in other ways. And our retailers are really, really receptive to that. And so we're not just milking these businesses, managing for cash. They're really foundation businesses. And we see good opportunities for investment in things other than pricing, we're doing those."

As regards to capacity, we have made the moves in pricing and strategic revenue management with an eye for capacity as we look forward. And so clearly if there are additional capacity, we'll remove that, we need to optimize our supply chain. You see that with soup, for example, in this last quarter, where we saw an opportunity to improve the profitability and viability of our soup business by closing our Vineland plant.

Greek 100 is yet again in the weight management area.

Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal '17 results. General Mills' performance in the first quarter was mixed. We made good progress against our 2017 adjusted operating profit margin",1573,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal '17 results. 
General Mills' performance in the first quarter was mixed. We made good progress against our 2017 adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS goals. But as Ken will tell you, our organic net sales results did not meet our expectations. We expect our sales growth to improve in the balance of the year, as we see continued growth in certain businesses as we execute a number of Consumer First actions across our portfolio. We'll also lap easier comps -- easier net sales comps in the remainder of the year. Over the course of our remarks this morning, we'll note the businesses that saw particularly challenging comparisons this quarter. 
On the bottom line, we continue to progress towards our 2 -- our 20% adjusted operating profit margin goal, and we announced further margin expansion initiatives in July. And we are reaffirming full year fiscal '17 growth targets today. 
So let me review our performance in the quarter. Slide 5 summarizes the first quarter fiscal '17 financial results. Net sales totaled $3.9 billion, down 7% as reported. Organic net sales declined 4%. Total segment operating profit totaled $787 million, down 4% on a constant currency basis. Recall that in last year's first quarter, our total segment operating profit increased 23% in constant currency. 
Net earnings decreased 4% to $409 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.67 as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, was $0.78. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS decreased 1% compared to last year results that grew 36%. 
Slide 6 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales declined 4% in the quarter, driven by lower organic pound volume growth, partially offset by 2 points of positive organic sales mix and net price realization. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales growth by 1 point. And the net impact of acquisition and divestitures reduced net sales growth by an additional 2 points in the quarter. 
Turning to first quarter segment results. Total U.S. Retail net sales declined 8%. The Snacks' operating unit posted 2% net sales growth, driven by excellent performance on Annie's and Lärabar. This was offset by declines in the other operating units. Organic net sales were down 5%. From year ago levels, they were up 1%. The difference between reported and organic net sales results in U.S. Retail primarily reflects the divestiture of Green Giant in fiscal '16. 
In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, net sales declined 7% in the first quarter. Net sales on our Focus 6 businesses were down 1% versus last year, primarily due to slower trends and continued store channel, timing of customer orders for back-to-school and a comparison against 9% growth a year ago. Yogurt, Cereal and Biscuits posted the strongest growth in the Focus 6 platforms. Net sales declined 12% on our non-Focus 6 businesses, driven by market index pricing on bakery flour. 
Slide 9 summarizes our International segment net sales results in constant currency and on an organic basis. At the region level, constant currency net sales in Latin America grew 3%, driven by strong Snacks performance in Brazil and benefits from pricing. Net sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 1% in constant currency, reflecting low single-digit growth in China. Canada sales were down 2% in constant currency. Excluding the Green Giant divestiture, constant currency net sales in Canada were up low single digits. And in Europe, sales were down 6% as we lapped 7% growth in last year's first quarter, behind the Häagen-Dazs Stick Bar launch and good growth from Yoplait's 50th anniversary news. On an organic basis, first quarter International segment net sales declined 1%. 
First quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 30 basis points from last year's results. They were up 290 basis points. For the full year, we continue to target $380 million of cost of goods sold, HMM, which will more than offset our expectations of 2% input cost inflation. For the first quarter, adjusted operating profit margin expanded 80 basis points to 19.2%, due in part to double-digit reductions in media spending on our foundation businesses and in U.S. Yogurt as well as incremental benefits from our cost-savings initiatives, including zero-based budgeting. 
Slide 11 details our segment operating profit results in the first quarter. As I mentioned, total segment operating profit was down 4% in constant currency. The U.S. Retail, segment operating profit declined 6% from year ago levels. They were up 38%. Constant currency International profit declined 11% due to currency-driven inflation on products imported to Canada and the U.K. And Convenience Stores and Foodservice profit was up 16%, driven by lower input cost, higher grain merchandising earnings and a comparison against the 9% decline in last year's first quarter. 
Combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $24 million in the quarter, down 10% in constant currency, primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher promotional expense as well as a comparison to a 16% growth in last year's first quarter. 
CPW net sales grew 1% in constant currency with good gains in the Latin America, and Asia, Africa and Middle East regions. Häagen-Dazs Japan constant currency sales essentially matched year ago results. They were up 9%. 
Slide 13 summarizes other noteworthy income statement items in the quarter. We incurred $86 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter, including $27 million recorded in cost of sales. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, decreased by $14 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased 2% from the prior year. We continue to expect full year interest expense will be flat to last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.9% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 31.4%, 90 basis points below last year due to discrete state tax benefits and favorable impacts of U.S. federal tax legislation passed in fiscal '16. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be 100 basis points higher than last year due to foreign tax credits and favorable settlements. And average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% in the quarter, in line with our full year expectation of a 1% to 2% reduction. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 14 shows that our core working capital decreased 33% versus last year's first quarter, primarily due to continued operational improvements across our businesses as well as the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. First quarter operating cash flow was $299 million, down from $431 million a year ago, largely driven by timing of payables. Capital investments in the quarter totaled $154 million. We remain on track to grow full year free cash flow mid-single digits, in line with our original guidance. And we returned $627 million to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter. 
We continue to make progress on our margin expansion goal. In July, we announced a number of new restructuring actions that will further support this effort. We plan to close our food -- our soup factory in Vineland, New Jersey in order to eliminate excess capacity in our U.S. Retail supply chain. We expect this action will be completed by the end of fiscal '19. 
Additionally, we are eliminating excess capacity and exiting unprofitable businesses in our International segment. In Brazil, we'll close one of our snacks manufacturing facilities and will cease production operations on certain snacks and meals products at another facility. We're also restructuring our Snacks business in China and have plans to stop production on certain underperforming products in that market. We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal '17. 
Our progress on margin expansion in the first quarter gives us increased confidence that we can achieve our goal of 20% adjusted operating profit margin by fiscal '18. As we outlined at our Investor Day presentation in July, we see our margin expansion coming in 3 primary areas. First, we expect cost of goods sold, HMM, to outpace input cost inflation in fiscal '17. Second, we now expect to deliver $620 million in savings from the administrative and supply chain restructuring initiatives we've announced to date as well as the implementation of zero-based budgeting. This represents an incremental $270 million of savings over the next 2 years. And third, we're implementing a number of additional initiatives, including trading consumer spending efficiency, SKU optimization and further savings from our supply chain in our ZBB efforts. 
We estimate the previously announced cost-savings projects and the other new initiatives will combine to generate about 75% of our margin expansion in fiscal '17 and '18 in roughly equal measure with the balance coming from our cost of goods HMM savings exceeding input cost inflation in fiscal '17. 
So let me close my portion of our remarks by reiterating that we are reaffirming the fiscal '17 guidance we outlined in June. Mainly, we expect organic net sales growth to be between flat and down 2%. We're targeting total segment operating profit growth of 6% to 8% on a constant currency basis with adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 150 basis points. And we expect adjusted diluted EPS will be up between 6% and 8% in constant currency. We also now expect foreign currency translation will be a $0.02 headwind to full year diluted EPS results. 
With that, I'll turn you over to Ken."

However, our net sales performance did not meet our expectat",3169,"Okay. Well, thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don described, we made good progress in the first quarter on our operating profit margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share goals. However, our net sales performance did not meet our expectations due to the challenging macro environments, a difficult year-over-year comparison and a slower start to the year on certain businesses. 
We're taking actions to improve our net sales performance going forward, leveraging our Consumer First focus. At the same time, we have a number of encouraging examples across our global portfolio, where our efforts to adapt to evolving consumer interests are driving positive results. And let me share with you examples of the areas where we're focused on driving improvement and the businesses leading our first quarter performance in each of our segments, starting with U.S. Retail. 
There had been a good deal of discussion about retail sales trends in our industry recently. We've seen total U.S. food and beverage retail sales slow over the last few quarters. Units have held stable, but net price appreciation has decelerated from adding 2 points of growth a year ago to adding less than 50 basis points of growth in our first quarter. And Nielsen data shows deflation in certain sections on the perimeter of the store, including dairy and meat. But we are seeing good price discipline in the vast majority of our categories, where average unit prices are up a little more than 2%. 
Performance for our U.S. Retail businesses in the first quarter was mixed. We had a slower start than we planned on Yoplait, Fiber One bars and in our Cereal business. And we're working to improve our performance in these categories going forward with innovation, renovation and good messaging.
Retail sales for our foundation businesses were generally in line with our expectations. However, we saw double-digit net sales declines on Progresso soup, driven by lower customer inventory levels. And our Natural & Organic businesses are driving excellent growth on core categories and with new innovation. Let me share some more details on each of these businesses. 
We continue to see challenging trends on our U.S. Yogurt business, driven primarily by significant declines on our Yoplait Light and Greek 100 product lines. Consumers of traditional light yogurts are pivoting away from this segment in favor of products that provide more satiety, like Greek yogurts. That said, there are a number of deeply loyal consumers who are committed to this segment and to our products, so we plan to continue serving these loyal consumers, and we'll leverage our category management efforts to ensure that Yoplait Light remain the leading option within the light segment of the shelf. On Greek 100, we were the first to market in the light Greek segment and built a strong early position. However, with significant competition in this segment, our products have become less differentiated, so we're looking to change that by rolling out a significant product improvement over the next few months. Our reformulated line of Yoplait Greek 100 products will contain up to 40% more protein, but are still only 100 calories and contain just 9 grams of sugar. And we've dramatically improved the taste of these products, while adding more protein, which is not an easy thing to do. Our new Yoplait Greek 100 products will be on shelf in time for weight management season in January. 
And we have yogurt renovation planned beyond Greek 100. In fact, by the end of the year, we will have renovated 60% of our yogurt portfolio. So far, we've made changes to our entire Kid portfolio, including new packaging and a whole milk formula on our Yoplait Kids line, larger multipacks and kid equity cups, and new sizes and fresh packaging on Go-Gurt, yogurt in a tube.
We're also rolling out new packaging on our original style Yoplait yogurt as well. The improved visuals better communicate the great taste of our products, and we're adding a flash on the front of the package to remind consumers that original style Yoplait contains 6 grams of protein. Our testing shows these changes drive increased consumer purchases, so we're looking forward to getting this news on shelf in the second half of the year. 
We also have a strong slate of innovation rolling out in the first half in Organic, Beverages and Greek, which are the 3 fastest-growing segments in the category. We entered the organic segment with Annie's and Liberté in the first quarter. Our Annie's product is a kid-targeted yogurt made from whole milk that comes in a range of flavors and formats, including cups, tubes and large-sized tubs. In Liberté, which is a leading brand in Canada, it has a small presence in the U.S. that had been relaunched as a premium organic line of yogurts targeted to adults. These launches are just rolling out into the market now. And although it's still early, we're seeing good distribution gains and strong early response from consumers. 
The yogurt beverage segment is growing double digit, and we've introduced Yoplait Licuados and smoothies to capitalize on this trend. These are highly successful products for our Yoplait franchisee in Mexico, so we're targeting this launch to cities with large Hispanic populations with plans to expand geographically in future quarters. 
Within Greek, we've added to our successful Greek 100 Whips! line with more indulgent, higher-calorie Greek Whips! varieties that rolled out in the first quarter. And we have additional yogurt launches slated for the second half targeted toward the dessert and snacking occasions, which are also seeing good growth. 
So we're highly focused on improving our U.S. Yogurt performance, and we believe that renovation and innovation are the keys to getting this business back to growth. And that's why we have such a broad set of initiatives this year, from strengthening our existing platforms with renovation on Kid and original style Yoplait, new Greek Whips! and a significant product improvement on Greek 100, to building new segments in Organic, Beverages, Desserts and Snacking. About half of these initiatives are in market now, and they will build over the course of the year. The remainder will come to market by January and should drive further improvement for our U.S. Yogurt business in the back half of this year. 
Don mentioned that our U.S. Cereal net sales were down 4% in the first quarter. Part of that decline was driven by reduction in customer inventory levels, as our retail sales in Nielsen-measured outlets were only down 2%. But when looking at our Cereal performance on a rolling 12-month basis, we've seen marked improvement from our trends a year ago with our latest 12-month retail sales down just under 1%. And when we include non-measured channels, we'd estimate that performance will be closer to flat. We think we can continue to drive improvement in our Cereal business by putting the consumer first and consistently delivering on their needs with innovation and renovation, just as we've been doing. 
We continue to be encouraged by the performance from our 2 largest renovation initiatives, gluten-free Cheerios and no artificial colors or flavors news. Gluten-free Cheerios posted its fourth consecutive quarter of growth with retail sales up 2% in the first quarter. Similarly, the products we featured in our no artificial colors and flavors campaign have posted consistent growth since we began airing that advertising in January. Retail sales for these cereals were up another 3% in the quarter. So we like the traction we've gotten on our Cereal renovation efforts, and we're also encouraged by the early results we're seeing on Cereal innovation, like Nature Valley and Annie's that is targeted squarely towards current consumer interest. 
Annie's cereals are certified organic and come in 3 varieties that kids will like: Berry Bunnies, Cocoa Bunnies and Frosted Oat Flakes. We're getting good feedback from consumers so far, and retailer acceptance has been excellent. We expect Annie's cereals sales will build throughout the year, as we grow distribution and get these products in front of more consumers. 
In addition to bringing meaningful renovation and innovation to our business, we're implementing an initiative we call strategic revenue management, or SRM, to help us grow our cereal top line. As we said at our Investor Day event, we're establishing a more rigorous, formalized process to drive positive net price realization, and we'll focus on 4 key levers within our SRM initiative. First, optimizing our prices to capture the full value for our brands across channels and then increasing our sophistication on price pack architecture; managing our mix to maximize profitable growth; and driving promotional spending towards the highest returning activities. We've assessed the opportunities for each U.S. operating unit and then prioritized the levers that will drive the most meaningful impact for fiscal '17 and '18. Altogether, the combination of Consumer First renovation and innovation, meaningful levels of consumer investment and our strategic revenue management efforts should help us deliver improved net sales performance for our U.S. Cereal business over the course of fiscal '17. 
Our renovation efforts continue to work on Nature Valley as well. Our Nature Valley crunchy line and granola bars, renovated last year to make them easier to bite, have posted 2% retail sales growth so far this year. And year-to-date retail sales for our gluten-free Nature Valley Protein Bars are up 5%. We also successfully launched Nature Valley nut butter biscuits in fiscal '16 and these products are continuing to drive growth this year. Consumers love these great tasting, more filling snacks that combine protein from nut butter with whole-grain biscuits, helping drive turns in the top third of the category. 
In fiscal '17, we're looking to build on the initiatives that have been driving growth for Nature Valley grain snacks. We're bringing back a successful media campaign, reminding consumers that our Nature Valley products contain no artificial flavors and colors. And we'll expand our Nature Valley nut butter biscuit line by introducing a cocoa almond butter variety to round out our current lineup of flavors. 
I mentioned earlier that Fiber One grain snacks have seen challenging trends so far this year. I think the key to stabilizing this business is to bring news that reminds consumers that Fiber One fulfills the need for permissible indulgence, better than any other product in the bar section. So we're investing in new media this year to drive home our key message of superior taste with the added benefit of fiber. We're also launching new products to generate news. In January, we're introducing 2 varieties of layered chewy bars, salted caramel chocolate chunk and double chocolate almond. These products truly deliver on Fiber One's promise of remarkable taste. And as we've seen in the past with Fiber One Brownies and Fiber One Cheesecake, delivering remarkable products to consumers usually translates to excellent growth, so we're excited to get these products on shelf in the back half. 
And finally, we're bringing compelling renovation news to the Fiber One franchise by removing artificial flavors, colors and sweeteners from our Brownies line and from our largest chewy bar varieties. We've also reduced sugar on our oats and chocolate bars by 25%, all while maintaining their great taste, of course. So we like the news we're bringing to Fiber One snacks, and we look forward to seeing these initiatives gain traction in the coming quarters. 
Now let's turn to our Natural & Organic portfolio, where we've seen our top line results accelerate recently behind excellent ideas and great execution. For the most recent 3-month period, our 9 Natural & Organic brands posted 12% retail sales growth across natural and traditional channels. Annie's and Lärabar have been leading our growth so far this year. Retail sales for the Annie's category that existed at the time of acquisition like mac & cheese, crackers and fruit snacks, were up 20% in the first quarter, driven by continued distribution expansion and progress we've made moving Annie's SKUs into the main aisle. 
And our recent category extensions like yogurt, cereal, baked goods, snack bars and soup are building distribution and helping grow household penetration for the Annie's brand. Retail sales for all Annie's products were up 28% in natural and traditional channels for the latest 3-month period. 
Lärabar has consistently grown double digits since we purchased the brand in 2008. But we've seen a step change in growth over the past 6 months, with retail sales up more than 40%, thanks to a great new advertising campaign, solid distribution expansion and excellent in-store merchandising support. 
So now let's turn to our foundation businesses, which consist largely of refrigerated dough, soup, and baking mixes in U.S. retail. We mentioned at our Investor Day that we are working to drive efficiency on these businesses by reducing SKUs and optimizing spending, which we expect to result in the loss of some unprofitable volume. But at the same time, we're bringing targeted news to consumers to ensure that they remain engaged with our brands. 
On Pillsbury refrigerated dough, this summer, we renovated the shelf set with shelf-ready packaging, a simplified assortment and a new shelf layout, making it easier for our customers to stock the products and for the consumer to shop the section. We're transitioning our entire line of soup to antibiotic-free chicken, a first for a mainstream soup brand. More than 50% of Progresso soups contain chicken, so this is a significant initiative for the brand. 
And we're renovating a number of Betty Crocker dessert products, including our brownie line, giving consumers more of what they want. We're making our products more premium by offering more caramel and fudge, and we're upsizing the package, allowing consumers to make more brownies from the same box. 
We're now entering the key season for these businesses, where they generate a large share of the revenue and profit for the year, and we feel confident that our plans will yield good results. 
Now let's turn to the Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment. Don mentioned that net sales in this segment was down 7%, driven primarily by index pricing on bakery flour. This pricing tracks with our flour input cost, so it's profit neutral, but it does hurt our top line. Don also mentioned that results on our Focus 6 platforms were impacted by the timing of back-to-school ordering. Despite this headwind, our cereal and yogurt businesses posted good net sales growth in the first quarter, driven by continued strength on Cinnamon Toast Crunch and gluten-free Cheerios as well as Yoplait Parfait Pro and large-sized yogurt tubs. Going forward, we expect this segment's net sales performance will improve behind stronger growth on our Focus 6 business -- businesses and less headwind from bakery flour pricing. 
And now let's turn to highlights from our International segment, starting with Canada. Though constant currency net sales in Canada were down due to the Green Giant divestiture, we delivered 3 months of positive retail sales growth, with gains across almost all our categories. Retail sales for our cereals were up 6%, driven by strong back-to-school execution and benefits from our Olympic partnership. Wholesome snack retail sales were up 5%, behind innovation and sustaining demand for better-for-you Nature Valley snacks. And retail sales for Old El Paso Mexican foods were up 11%, thanks to Stand 'N Stuff innovation and continued distribution gains. 
Wholesome snacks in Europe are off to a strong start as well, with retail sales up 13% across the region in the latest 3 months. We've seen gains from our Nature Valley Protein Bar renovation, new packaging on Nature Valley Crunchy bars and the launch of new Fiber One 90-calorie bars in the region, which provide consumers an indulgent treat with the benefit of fiber, all at only 90 calories per serving. And Old El Paso posted 5% retail sales growth in Europe behind strength across the portfolio, driven by Stand 'N Stuff taco shell innovation and distribution gains on the existing portfolio. 
Don mentioned that in total, constant currency net sales declined in Europe this quarter due to comparisons against exceptionally strong growth for Häagen-Dazs and Yoplait a year ago. As we lap those increases, we expect to see improved net sales growth in Europe in the remainder of the year. 
Turning to our Asia-Pacific region. We delivered good performance on a number of businesses in China, which was partially offset by the impact of our snacks restructuring. Yoplait is performing well in Shanghai, and we are looking to replicate that success with our recent entry into Beijing. Constant currency net sales were up mid-single digits on Häagen-Dazs, driven by same-store sales growth in shops. We also saw mid-single-digit constant currency net sales growth on Wanchai Ferry products, led by performance in Tier 1 cities. 
In AMEA, Häagen-Dazs is off to a strong start, thanks to the introduction of stick bars, and Pillsbury mixes help drive another quarter of growth in India. 
Finally, in Latin America, our Mexico business continues to deliver strong double-digit snacks growth behind Nature Valley and Fiber One. These brands are capitalizing on Mexican consumers' desire for great testing, better-for-you snacks. And we're executing well behind good consumer marketing plans and solid in-store support. In Brazil, retail sales for Yoki snacks were up 5% in the latest 3 months, behind Yoki Popcorn and pricing across our portfolio. Our side dishes business is also performing well, posting 16% growth in the latest 3-month period. 
As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '17, we believe there are a number of reasons why our organic net sales performance will improve. First, our U.S. Retail comparison goes from a year ago revenue growth that was up low single digits to growth that was down low single digits in each of the next 3 quarters. Our comparisons ease in our other 2 segments as well, as we lap index price changes in Convenience Stores and Foodservice and Europe's strong summer performance in fiscal '16. 
Second, we're continuing to invest behind the renovation and innovation news that's working, whether that's Cereal renovation, Natural & Organic in the U.S. or Old El Paso and Nature Valley across International. 
Third, we're taking actions to improve performance on a number of businesses, such as yogurt and Fiber One bars in U.S. Retail. 
And finally, we're implementing strategic revenue management to drive the improved net price realization for our U.S. Retail business. 
So with that, let me summarize today's remarks. We made good progress in the first quarter against our adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS goals. We had a slower start for net sales, but we have the right plans in place to improve performance going forward. We announced additional margin expansion in each initiatives in July, which are part of our path to achieving our 20% adjusted operating profit margin. And we remain on track to deliver our full year fiscal '17 growth goals. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. I'll now ask our operator to open the call for questions."

Because it seems as if the Greek 100 relaunch is a major component of your strategy to improve sales this year. And just wondering, given all of the structural headwinds we've seen with some of the other categories with the weight management proposition around them, whether it's cereal or core cup, is that something you're seeing now bleeding into Greek as well? Or is the issue really just one of competition? And then I guess, a related question for Don, you've talked about double-digit reductions in media spending on yogurt. Just curious if that's an issue of timing or whether you're seeing a lower return profile that makes you comfortable pulling back there."

Let me take on both of those questions and Don can follow up as needed on the second one that you asked.

Let me take on both of those questions and Don can follow up as needed on the second one that you asked. On the first one, as we look at broader category trends in yogurt and specifically in weight management, consumers are looking for in yogurt what they're looking for across categories, which is a satiety benefit and ways to keep them fuller for longer. And that's the fundamental difference we see between our Greek 100 offering and why we're renovating that and what we see in Yoplait Light, which are 2 entries into this market. And so that's why you see us renovating Greek 100 as we are, adding 40% more protein and making it taste better at the same time because we know consumers are looking for satiety, Greek 100 can give them that. But they only do it if the product tastes really good. And so the bar is pretty high. And so that's why we have a high degree of confidence in the renovation efforts we're looking for in Greek 100 and why Yoplait Light will be the leader in the light segment. But we don't see that turning around in the same way that we see Greek 100 turning around. So that's why you see us doing that. And as it relates to spending, I mentioned this in our Q4 update that we'll be taking our advertising down on yogurt this year and increasing our trade spending because on our advertising, we weren't seeing the returns that we wanted to see. And we were way overindexed in the category on advertising spending relative to our competition. And so while we are reducing our advertising spending, we will still have more than our fair share of weight in advertising in the category. So we saw an opportunity to do that, which I also mentioned as I said in June."

One was we had very strong plant and manufacturing performance. As we referenced, our media was down double digits for the quarter, which is ahead of what our full year guidance had been. And we had some favorable timing in below-the-line items, our corporate items, our tax lines, interest, as I've mentioned. And those will even out in the year as the year unfolds. Our focus is on delivering the year. I'll touch a little bit on media because Jeff touched on it or talked about it with Yoplait. But given that we're coming out of the quarter with media spending down double digits, we now expect media to be down double digits for the full year. That's a little bit lower than we had originally anticipated. And the reduction will be in the same places, the foundation businesses in U.S. yogurt, and will continue to increase in our growth businesses. But that's a reality of coming in a little light on our top line in the first quarter. Now that all said, we continue to look for, and as you point out, we believe our strong margin performance will help provide the fuel to reinvest in high return ideas as the year unfolds. So as Jeff alluded to, whether it's in yogurt or other businesses, as we launch new products and as we see traction on those new products, we believe some of the cost savings initiatives we have, some of the operating leverage we're going to be able to generate will help us fund those ideas as the year unfolds."

And one of the things that we've seen time and again is when we focus on the things that we can control, we can have a lot of success, i.e., gluten-free is a great example of that in the cereal category. And so as we look at our first quarter, there's some things that we need to improve on our yogurt business, really around innovation and renovation. And we feel like that's up to us regardless of the macro environment. We like some things that we're seeing in cereal despite the fact that it was down 4% in the first quarter. And we think that we can probably spend more against initiatives that are working well, like gluten-free and Cheerios. And we really like our innovation coming up in Snacks in the second half of this year. And so what I would tell you is that yes, the macro environment does play a piece. But we are laser-focused on the things within our control and feel good about our ability to improve our top line trends both here in the U.S. and globally."

We do expect Q2 to be better than Q1 from an organic sales growth standpoint. And we expect the second half to be better than Q2. And a couple of factors to take into account as we think about the Q1 to Q2 movement. And these -- we talked about these in this script. It may be good just to consolidate them all. First is the comps. Again, our F '16 Q1 organic sales growth was the highest of the year at plus 2%. And all segments showed growth and we have particular strength in Häagen-Dazs and in Yoplait. In Q2, we'll begin lapping negative organic growth, which was driven to a large extent by reduced merchandising on cereal and snacks at one of our large U.S. customers. So first out is the comps will ease for some very specific reasons. Second is we expect even better price depreciation in Q2 versus Q1. Q1, we had 2 points of price/mix appreciation. We expect even more in Q2. That's when we start seeing the benefit of SRM, the trade optimization actions that we're taking in our foundation businesses in the U.S. We expect to see continued pricing benefits in Brazil. And we expect lower drag from the bakery food -- bakery flour pricing in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice business. So the second factor is that we think pricing will improve, our price/mix appreciation will improve in the second quarter. Pipeline plays a bit of a role. We mentioned that we saw the consumer offtake ahead of shipments for U.S. cereal. We also saw it for soup. We also had some inventory reductions in a large customer in our C&F business. And we don't expect any of those to reoccur in Q2. But lastly, the most important factor, of course, is the positive impact of all the Consumer First initiatives that Ken and Jeff have talked about. So we expect Q2 to be better than Q1. We expect the second half to be better than the first half. And we expect the full year to come in between our flat and minus 2% guidance that we have initiated -- that we initiated back in June."

So I was hoping that you could just give us some context of what you're seeing in the industry overall. What gives you confidence on the ability to deploy some of these initiatives? And maybe in light of that context, how the retailers have received the direction and early indications of the path you're going down so far."

So let me start big picture and work our way back to the category initiatives you talked about. Big picture, we see in Nielsen data, and certainly I have heard from a lot of our retailers over the last month in my direct conversation with them, is that we see prices deflationary or the inflation reducing in the store over the course of the last quarter or so. As we look, and Ken shared with you earlier, as we look at what the items that -- in groceries that contain the UPC code, we have about 0.5% growth, I think it's 0.4%. A big portion of that is really reduction in egg pricing from a year ago. So if you strip out the pricing on eggs, it's about 1% inflation, which is pretty consistent with the last couple of quarters. And so we had the flu last year and the price of eggs was really high. And it's a lot lower now, and so that accounts for a lot. We've also heard -- I've also heard from a lot of retailers about deflation in other parts, non-UPC, so the perimeter of the store in things like dairy and meat. But what we're seeing in our categories really is about 2.5% price appreciation in the first quarter. And that's what we're seeing in our Nielsen and in our categories as well. And so as we -- and we've seen quite good price discipline in the vast majority of our categories. And there's no reason for us to think that, that won't continue going forward. Certainly, as we look to our SRM initiatives, we're gaining increased confidence that those are going to be effective. When we talk to the retailers about our pricing and what we're going to do with our foundation brands, we find a pretty receptive audience to be honest. And the first fact is that 75% of our business is growth and 25%, foundational. So we start with that. And within the foundational brands, our retailers are looking for a little bit of inflation. So to the extent that they see deflation in some areas, a little bit of inflation in other areas isn't such a bad thing. And the key to that really is to bring some level of investment to the category in other forms. And so I've talked about it before, but it's really important in that on Progresso, it's going to be about antibiotic-free chicken. And on Pillsbury, it's a new shelf set as well as improving the quality of our products. And so we're making investments in other ways. And our retailers are really, really receptive to that. And so we're not just milking these businesses, managing for cash. They're really foundation businesses. And when we see good opportunities for investment in things other than pricing, we're doing those."

And U.S. cereal has been the farthest ahead, but it's just fast following to the rest of our category. And you'll soon see that. As regards to capacity, we have made the moves in pricing and strategic revenue management with an eye for capacity as we look forward. And so clearly if there are additional capacity, we'll remove that, we need to optimize our supply chain. You see that with soup, for example, in this last quarter, where we saw an opportunity to improve the profitability and viability of our soup business by closing our Vineland plant.

And so I have no reason to doubt that we won't be excellent in our execution of our new products in yogurt in the second half just as we have been with Liberté and Annie's and the reformulation of our Go-Gurt business here in the first quarter."

We made good progress against our 2017 adjusted operating profit margin",1573,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal '17 results. 
General Mills' performance in the first quarter was mixed. We made good progress against our 2017 adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS goals. But as Ken will tell you, our organic net sales results did not meet our expectations. We expect our sales growth to improve in the balance of the year, as we see continued growth in certain businesses as we execute a number of Consumer First actions across our portfolio. We'll also lap easier comps -- easier net sales comps in the remainder of the year. Over the course of our remarks this morning, we'll note the businesses that saw particularly challenging comparisons this quarter. 
On the bottom line, we continue to progress towards our 2 -- our 20% adjusted operating profit margin goal, and we announced further margin expansion initiatives in July. And we are reaffirming full year fiscal '17 growth targets today. 
So let me review our performance in the quarter. Slide 5 summarizes the first quarter fiscal '17 financial results. Net sales totaled $3.9 billion, down 7% as reported. Organic net sales declined 4%. Total segment operating profit totaled $787 million, down 4% on a constant currency basis. Recall that in last year's first quarter, our total segment operating profit increased 23% in constant currency. 
Net earnings decreased 4% to $409 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.67 as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, was $0.78. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS decreased 1% compared to last year results that grew 36%. 
Slide 6 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales declined 4% in the quarter, driven by lower organic pound volume growth, partially offset by 2 points of positive organic sales mix and net price realization. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales growth by 1 point. And the net impact of acquisition and divestitures reduced net sales growth by an additional 2 points in the quarter. 
Turning to first quarter segment results. Total U.S. Retail net sales declined 8%. The Snacks' operating unit posted 2% net sales growth, driven by excellent performance on Annie's and Lärabar. This was offset by declines in the other operating units. Organic net sales were down 5%. From year ago levels, they were up 1%. The difference between reported and organic net sales results in U.S. Retail primarily reflects the divestiture of Green Giant in fiscal '16. 
In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, net sales declined 7% in the first quarter. Net sales on our Focus 6 businesses were down 1% versus last year, primarily due to slower trends and continued store channel, timing of customer orders for back-to-school and a comparison against 9% growth a year ago. Yogurt, Cereal and Biscuits posted the strongest growth in the Focus 6 platforms. Net sales declined 12% on our non-Focus 6 businesses, driven by market index pricing on bakery flour. 
Slide 9 summarizes our International segment net sales results in constant currency and on an organic basis. At the region level, constant currency net sales in Latin America grew 3%, driven by strong Snacks performance in Brazil and benefits from pricing. Net sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 1% in constant currency, reflecting low single-digit growth in China. Canada sales were down 2% in constant currency. Excluding the Green Giant divestiture, constant currency net sales in Canada were up low single digits. And in Europe, sales were down 6% as we lapped 7% growth in last year's first quarter, behind the Häagen-Dazs Stick Bar launch and good growth from Yoplait's 50th anniversary news. On an organic basis, first quarter International segment net sales declined 1%. 
First quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 30 basis points from last year's results. They were up 290 basis points. For the full year, we continue to target $380 million of cost of goods sold, HMM, which will more than offset our expectations of 2% input cost inflation. For the first quarter, adjusted operating profit margin expanded 80 basis points to 19.2%, due in part to double-digit reductions in media spending on our foundation businesses and in U.S. Yogurt as well as incremental benefits from our cost-savings initiatives, including zero-based budgeting. 
Slide 11 details our segment operating profit results in the first quarter. As I mentioned, total segment operating profit was down 4% in constant currency. The U.S. Retail, segment operating profit declined 6% from year ago levels. They were up 38%. Constant currency International profit declined 11% due to currency-driven inflation on products imported to Canada and the U.K. And Convenience Stores and Foodservice profit was up 16%, driven by lower input cost, higher grain merchandising earnings and a comparison against the 9% decline in last year's first quarter. 
Combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $24 million in the quarter, down 10% in constant currency, primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher promotional expense as well as a comparison to a 16% growth in last year's first quarter. 
CPW net sales grew 1% in constant currency with good gains in the Latin America, and Asia, Africa and Middle East regions. Häagen-Dazs Japan constant currency sales essentially matched year ago results. They were up 9%. 
Slide 13 summarizes other noteworthy income statement items in the quarter. We incurred $86 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter, including $27 million recorded in cost of sales. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, decreased by $14 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased 2% from the prior year. We continue to expect full year interest expense will be flat to last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.9% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 31.4%, 90 basis points below last year due to discrete state tax benefits and favorable impacts of U.S. federal tax legislation passed in fiscal '16. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be 100 basis points higher than last year due to foreign tax credits and favorable settlements. And average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% in the quarter, in line with our full year expectation of a 1% to 2% reduction. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 14 shows that our core working capital decreased 33% versus last year's first quarter, primarily due to continued operational improvements across our businesses as well as the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. First quarter operating cash flow was $299 million, down from $431 million a year ago, largely driven by timing of payables. Capital investments in the quarter totaled $154 million. We remain on track to grow full year free cash flow mid-single digits, in line with our original guidance. And we returned $627 million to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter. 
We continue to make progress on our margin expansion goal. In July, we announced a number of new restructuring actions that will further support this effort. We plan to close our food -- our soup factory in Vineland, New Jersey in order to eliminate excess capacity in our U.S. Retail supply chain. We expect this action will be completed by the end of fiscal '19. 
Additionally, we are eliminating excess capacity and exiting unprofitable businesses in our International segment. In Brazil, we'll close one of our snacks manufacturing facilities and will cease production operations on certain snacks and meals products at another facility. We're also restructuring our Snacks business in China and have plans to stop production on certain underperforming products in that market. We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal '17. 
Our progress on margin expansion in the first quarter gives us increased confidence that we can achieve our goal of 20% adjusted operating profit margin by fiscal '18. As we outlined at our Investor Day presentation in July, we see our margin expansion coming in 3 primary areas. First, we expect cost of goods sold, HMM, to outpace input cost inflation in fiscal '17. Second, we now expect to deliver $620 million in savings from the administrative and supply chain restructuring initiatives we've announced to date as well as the implementation of zero-based budgeting. This represents an incremental $270 million of savings over the next 2 years. And third, we're implementing a number of additional initiatives, including trading consumer spending efficiency, SKU optimization and further savings from our supply chain in our ZBB efforts. 
We estimate the previously announced cost-savings projects and the other new initiatives will combine to generate about 75% of our margin expansion in fiscal '17 and '18 in roughly equal measure with the balance coming from our cost of goods HMM savings exceeding input cost inflation in fiscal '17. 
So let me close my portion of our remarks by reiterating that we are reaffirming the fiscal '17 guidance we outlined in June. Mainly, we expect organic net sales growth to be between flat and down 2%. We're targeting total segment operating profit growth of 6% to 8% on a constant currency basis with adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 150 basis points. And we expect adjusted diluted EPS will be up between 6% and 8% in constant currency. We also now expect foreign currency translation will be a $0.02 headwind to full year diluted EPS results. 
With that, I'll turn you over to Ken."

However, our net sales performance did not meet our expectat",3169,"Okay. Well, thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don described, we made good progress in the first quarter on our operating profit margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share goals. However, our net sales performance did not meet our expectations due to the challenging macro environments, a difficult year-over-year comparison and a slower start to the year on certain businesses. 
We're taking actions to improve our net sales performance going forward, leveraging our Consumer First focus. At the same time, we have a number of encouraging examples across our global portfolio, where our efforts to adapt to evolving consumer interests are driving positive results. And let me share with you examples of the areas where we're focused on driving improvement and the businesses leading our first quarter performance in each of our segments, starting with U.S. Retail. 
There had been a good deal of discussion about retail sales trends in our industry recently. We've seen total U.S. food and beverage retail sales slow over the last few quarters. Units have held stable, but net price appreciation has decelerated from adding 2 points of growth a year ago to adding less than 50 basis points of growth in our first quarter. And Nielsen data shows deflation in certain sections on the perimeter of the store, including dairy and meat. But we are seeing good price discipline in the vast majority of our categories, where average unit prices are up a little more than 2%. 
Performance for our U.S. Retail businesses in the first quarter was mixed. We had a slower start than we planned on Yoplait, Fiber One bars and in our Cereal business. And we're working to improve our performance in these categories going forward with innovation, renovation and good messaging.
Retail sales for our foundation businesses were generally in line with our expectations. However, we saw double-digit net sales declines on Progresso soup, driven by lower customer inventory levels. And our Natural & Organic businesses are driving excellent growth on core categories and with new innovation. Let me share some more details on each of these businesses. 
We continue to see challenging trends on our U.S. Yogurt business, driven primarily by significant declines on our Yoplait Light and Greek 100 product lines. Consumers of traditional light yogurts are pivoting away from this segment in favor of products that provide more satiety, like Greek yogurts. That said, there are a number of deeply loyal consumers who are committed to this segment and to our products, so we plan to continue serving these loyal consumers, and we'll leverage our category management efforts to ensure that Yoplait Light remain the leading option within the light segment of the shelf. On Greek 100, we were the first to market in the light Greek segment and built a strong early position. However, with significant competition in this segment, our products have become less differentiated, so we're looking to change that by rolling out a significant product improvement over the next few months. Our reformulated line of Yoplait Greek 100 products will contain up to 40% more protein, but are still only 100 calories and contain just 9 grams of sugar. And we've dramatically improved the taste of these products, while adding more protein, which is not an easy thing to do. Our new Yoplait Greek 100 products will be on shelf in time for weight management season in January. 
And we have yogurt renovation planned beyond Greek 100. In fact, by the end of the year, we will have renovated 60% of our yogurt portfolio. So far, we've made changes to our entire Kid portfolio, including new packaging and a whole milk formula on our Yoplait Kids line, larger multipacks and kid equity cups, and new sizes and fresh packaging on Go-Gurt, yogurt in a tube.
We're also rolling out new packaging on our original style Yoplait yogurt as well. The improved visuals better communicate the great taste of our products, and we're adding a flash on the front of the package to remind consumers that original style Yoplait contains 6 grams of protein. Our testing shows these changes drive increased consumer purchases, so we're looking forward to getting this news on shelf in the second half of the year. 
We also have a strong slate of innovation rolling out in the first half in Organic, Beverages and Greek, which are the 3 fastest-growing segments in the category. We entered the organic segment with Annie's and Liberté in the first quarter. Our Annie's product is a kid-targeted yogurt made from whole milk that comes in a range of flavors and formats, including cups, tubes and large-sized tubs. In Liberté, which is a leading brand in Canada, it has a small presence in the U.S. that had been relaunched as a premium organic line of yogurts targeted to adults. These launches are just rolling out into the market now. And although it's still early, we're seeing good distribution gains and strong early response from consumers. 
The yogurt beverage segment is growing double digit, and we've introduced Yoplait Licuados and smoothies to capitalize on this trend. These are highly successful products for our Yoplait franchisee in Mexico, so we're targeting this launch to cities with large Hispanic populations with plans to expand geographically in future quarters. 
Within Greek, we've added to our successful Greek 100 Whips! line with more indulgent, higher-calorie Greek Whips! varieties that rolled out in the first quarter. And we have additional yogurt launches slated for the second half targeted toward the dessert and snacking occasions, which are also seeing good growth. 
So we're highly focused on improving our U.S. Yogurt performance, and we believe that renovation and innovation are the keys to getting this business back to growth. And that's why we have such a broad set of initiatives this year, from strengthening our existing platforms with renovation on Kid and original style Yoplait, new Greek Whips! and a significant product improvement on Greek 100, to building new segments in Organic, Beverages, Desserts and Snacking. About half of these initiatives are in market now, and they will build over the course of the year. The remainder will come to market by January and should drive further improvement for our U.S. Yogurt business in the back half of this year. 
Don mentioned that our U.S. Cereal net sales were down 4% in the first quarter. Part of that decline was driven by reduction in customer inventory levels, as our retail sales in Nielsen-measured outlets were only down 2%. But when looking at our Cereal performance on a rolling 12-month basis, we've seen marked improvement from our trends a year ago with our latest 12-month retail sales down just under 1%. And when we include non-measured channels, we'd estimate that performance will be closer to flat. We think we can continue to drive improvement in our Cereal business by putting the consumer first and consistently delivering on their needs with innovation and renovation, just as we've been doing. 
We continue to be encouraged by the performance from our 2 largest renovation initiatives, gluten-free Cheerios and no artificial colors or flavors news. Gluten-free Cheerios posted its fourth consecutive quarter of growth with retail sales up 2% in the first quarter. Similarly, the products we featured in our no artificial colors and flavors campaign have posted consistent growth since we began airing that advertising in January. Retail sales for these cereals were up another 3% in the quarter. So we like the traction we've gotten on our Cereal renovation efforts, and we're also encouraged by the early results we're seeing on Cereal innovation, like Nature Valley and Annie's that is targeted squarely towards current consumer interest. 
Annie's cereals are certified organic and come in 3 varieties that kids will like: Berry Bunnies, Cocoa Bunnies and Frosted Oat Flakes. We're getting good feedback from consumers so far, and retailer acceptance has been excellent. We expect Annie's cereals sales will build throughout the year, as we grow distribution and get these products in front of more consumers. 
In addition to bringing meaningful renovation and innovation to our business, we're implementing an initiative we call strategic revenue management, or SRM, to help us grow our cereal top line. As we said at our Investor Day event, we're establishing a more rigorous, formalized process to drive positive net price realization, and we'll focus on 4 key levers within our SRM initiative. First, optimizing our prices to capture the full value for our brands across channels and then increasing our sophistication on price pack architecture; managing our mix to maximize profitable growth; and driving promotional spending towards the highest returning activities. We've assessed the opportunities for each U.S. operating unit and then prioritized the levers that will drive the most meaningful impact for fiscal '17 and '18. Altogether, the combination of Consumer First renovation and innovation, meaningful levels of consumer investment and our strategic revenue management efforts should help us deliver improved net sales performance for our U.S. Cereal business over the course of fiscal '17. 
Our renovation efforts continue to work on Nature Valley as well. Our Nature Valley crunchy line and granola bars, renovated last year to make them easier to bite, have posted 2% retail sales growth so far this year. And year-to-date retail sales for our gluten-free Nature Valley Protein Bars are up 5%. We also successfully launched Nature Valley nut butter biscuits in fiscal '16 and these products are continuing to drive growth this year. Consumers love these great tasting, more filling snacks that combine protein from nut butter with whole-grain biscuits, helping drive turns in the top third of the category. 
In fiscal '17, we're looking to build on the initiatives that have been driving growth for Nature Valley grain snacks. We're bringing back a successful media campaign, reminding consumers that our Nature Valley products contain no artificial flavors and colors. And we'll expand our Nature Valley nut butter biscuit line by introducing a cocoa almond butter variety to round out our current lineup of flavors. 
I mentioned earlier that Fiber One grain snacks have seen challenging trends so far this year. I think the key to stabilizing this business is to bring news that reminds consumers that Fiber One fulfills the need for permissible indulgence, better than any other product in the bar section. So we're investing in new media this year to drive home our key message of superior taste with the added benefit of fiber. We're also launching new products to generate news. In January, we're introducing 2 varieties of layered chewy bars, salted caramel chocolate chunk and double chocolate almond. These products truly deliver on Fiber One's promise of remarkable taste. And as we've seen in the past with Fiber One Brownies and Fiber One Cheesecake, delivering remarkable products to consumers usually translates to excellent growth, so we're excited to get these products on shelf in the back half. 
And finally, we're bringing compelling renovation news to the Fiber One franchise by removing artificial flavors, colors and sweeteners from our Brownies line and from our largest chewy bar varieties. We've also reduced sugar on our oats and chocolate bars by 25%, all while maintaining their great taste, of course. So we like the news we're bringing to Fiber One snacks, and we look forward to seeing these initiatives gain traction in the coming quarters. 
Now let's turn to our Natural & Organic portfolio, where we've seen our top line results accelerate recently behind excellent ideas and great execution. For the most recent 3-month period, our 9 Natural & Organic brands posted 12% retail sales growth across natural and traditional channels. Annie's and Lärabar have been leading our growth so far this year. Retail sales for the Annie's category that existed at the time of acquisition like mac & cheese, crackers and fruit snacks, were up 20% in the first quarter, driven by continued distribution expansion and progress we've made moving Annie's SKUs into the main aisle. 
And our recent category extensions like yogurt, cereal, baked goods, snack bars and soup are building distribution and helping grow household penetration for the Annie's brand. Retail sales for all Annie's products were up 28% in natural and traditional channels for the latest 3-month period. 
Lärabar has consistently grown double digits since we purchased the brand in 2008. But we've seen a step change in growth over the past 6 months, with retail sales up more than 40%, thanks to a great new advertising campaign, solid distribution expansion and excellent in-store merchandising support. 
So now let's turn to our foundation businesses, which consist largely of refrigerated dough, soup, and baking mixes in U.S. retail. We mentioned at our Investor Day that we are working to drive efficiency on these businesses by reducing SKUs and optimizing spending, which we expect to result in the loss of some unprofitable volume. But at the same time, we're bringing targeted news to consumers to ensure that they remain engaged with our brands. 
On Pillsbury refrigerated dough, this summer, we renovated the shelf set with shelf-ready packaging, a simplified assortment and a new shelf layout, making it easier for our customers to stock the products and for the consumer to shop the section. We're transitioning our entire line of soup to antibiotic-free chicken, a first for a mainstream soup brand. More than 50% of Progresso soups contain chicken, so this is a significant initiative for the brand. 
And we're renovating a number of Betty Crocker dessert products, including our brownie line, giving consumers more of what they want. We're making our products more premium by offering more caramel and fudge, and we're upsizing the package, allowing consumers to make more brownies from the same box. 
We're now entering the key season for these businesses, where they generate a large share of the revenue and profit for the year, and we feel confident that our plans will yield good results. 
Now let's turn to the Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment. Don mentioned that net sales in this segment was down 7%, driven primarily by index pricing on bakery flour. This pricing tracks with our flour input cost, so it's profit neutral, but it does hurt our top line. Don also mentioned that results on our Focus 6 platforms were impacted by the timing of back-to-school ordering. Despite this headwind, our cereal and yogurt businesses posted good net sales growth in the first quarter, driven by continued strength on Cinnamon Toast Crunch and gluten-free Cheerios as well as Yoplait Parfait Pro and large-sized yogurt tubs. Going forward, we expect this segment's net sales performance will improve behind stronger growth on our Focus 6 business -- businesses and less headwind from bakery flour pricing. 
And now let's turn to highlights from our International segment, starting with Canada. Though constant currency net sales in Canada were down due to the Green Giant divestiture, we delivered 3 months of positive retail sales growth, with gains across almost all our categories. Retail sales for our cereals were up 6%, driven by strong back-to-school execution and benefits from our Olympic partnership. Wholesome snack retail sales were up 5%, behind innovation and sustaining demand for better-for-you Nature Valley snacks. And retail sales for Old El Paso Mexican foods were up 11%, thanks to Stand 'N Stuff innovation and continued distribution gains. 
Wholesome snacks in Europe are off to a strong start as well, with retail sales up 13% across the region in the latest 3 months. We've seen gains from our Nature Valley Protein Bar renovation, new packaging on Nature Valley Crunchy bars and the launch of new Fiber One 90-calorie bars in the region, which provide consumers an indulgent treat with the benefit of fiber, all at only 90 calories per serving. And Old El Paso posted 5% retail sales growth in Europe behind strength across the portfolio, driven by Stand 'N Stuff taco shell innovation and distribution gains on the existing portfolio. 
Don mentioned that in total, constant currency net sales declined in Europe this quarter due to comparisons against exceptionally strong growth for Häagen-Dazs and Yoplait a year ago. As we lap those increases, we expect to see improved net sales growth in Europe in the remainder of the year. 
Turning to our Asia-Pacific region. We delivered good performance on a number of businesses in China, which was partially offset by the impact of our snacks restructuring. Yoplait is performing well in Shanghai, and we are looking to replicate that success with our recent entry into Beijing. Constant currency net sales were up mid-single digits on Häagen-Dazs, driven by same-store sales growth in shops. We also saw mid-single-digit constant currency net sales growth on Wanchai Ferry products, led by performance in Tier 1 cities. 
In AMEA, Häagen-Dazs is off to a strong start, thanks to the introduction of stick bars, and Pillsbury mixes help drive another quarter of growth in India. 
Finally, in Latin America, our Mexico business continues to deliver strong double-digit snacks growth behind Nature Valley and Fiber One. These brands are capitalizing on Mexican consumers' desire for great testing, better-for-you snacks. And we're executing well behind good consumer marketing plans and solid in-store support. In Brazil, retail sales for Yoki snacks were up 5% in the latest 3 months, behind Yoki Popcorn and pricing across our portfolio. Our side dishes business is also performing well, posting 16% growth in the latest 3-month period. 
As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '17, we believe there are a number of reasons why our organic net sales performance will improve. First, our U.S. Retail comparison goes from a year ago revenue growth that was up low single digits to growth that was down low single digits in each of the next 3 quarters. Our comparisons ease in our other 2 segments as well, as we lap index price changes in Convenience Stores and Foodservice and Europe's strong summer performance in fiscal '16. 
Second, we're continuing to invest behind the renovation and innovation news that's working, whether that's Cereal renovation, Natural & Organic in the U.S. or Old El Paso and Nature Valley across International. 
Third, we're taking actions to improve performance on a number of businesses, such as yogurt and Fiber One bars in U.S. Retail. 
And finally, we're implementing strategic revenue management to drive the improved net price realization for our U.S. Retail business. 
So with that, let me summarize today's remarks. We made good progress in the first quarter against our adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS goals. We had a slower start for net sales, but we have the right plans in place to improve performance going forward. We announced additional margin expansion in each initiatives in July, which are part of our path to achieving our 20% adjusted operating profit margin. And we remain on track to deliver our full year fiscal '17 growth goals. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. I'll now ask our operator to open the call for questions."

Because it seems as if the Greek 100 relaunch is a major component of your strategy to improve sales this year. And just wondering, given all of the structural headwinds we've seen with some of the other categories with the weight management proposition around them, whether it's cereal or core cup, is that something you're seeing now bleeding into Greek as well? Or is the issue really just one of competition? And then I guess, a related question for Don, you've talked about double-digit reductions in media spending on yogurt. Just curious if that's an issue of timing or whether you're seeing a lower return profile that makes you comfortable pulling back there."

Let me take on both of those questions and Don can follow up as needed on the second one that you asked. On the first one, as we look at broader category trends in yogurt and specifically in weight management, consumers are looking for in yogurt what they're looking for across categories, which is a satiety benefit and ways to keep them fuller for longer. And that's the fundamental difference we see between our Greek 100 offering and why we're renovating that and what we see in Yoplait Light, which are 2 entries into this market. And so that's why you see us renovating Greek 100 as we are, adding 40% more protein and making it taste better at the same time because we know consumers are looking for satiety, Greek 100 can give them that. But they only do it if the product tastes really good. And so the bar is pretty high. And so that's why we have a high degree of confidence in the renovation efforts we're looking for in Greek 100 and why Yoplait Light will be the leader in the light segment. But we don't see that turning around in the same way that we see Greek 100 turning around. So that's why you see us doing that. And as it relates to spending, I mentioned this in our Q4 update that we'll be taking our advertising down on yogurt this year and increasing our trade spending because on our advertising, we weren't seeing the returns that we wanted to see. And we were way overindexed in the category on advertising spending relative to our competition. And so while we are reducing our advertising spending, we will still have more than our fair share of weight in advertising in the category. So we saw an opportunity to do that, which I also mentioned as I said in June."

And we had some favorable timing in below-the-line items, our corporate items, our tax lines, interest, as I've mentioned. And those will even out in the year as the year unfolds. Our focus is on delivering the year. I'll touch a little bit on media because Jeff touched on it or talked about it with Yoplait. But given that we're coming out of the quarter with media spending down double digits, we now expect media to be down double digits for the full year. That's a little bit lower than we had originally anticipated. And the reduction will be in the same places, the foundation businesses in U.S. yogurt, and will continue to increase in our growth businesses. But that's a reality of coming in a little light on our top line in the first quarter. Now that all said, we continue to look for, and as you point out, we believe our strong margin performance will help provide the fuel to reinvest in high return ideas as the year unfolds. So as Jeff alluded to, whether it's in yogurt or other businesses, as we launch new products and as we see traction on those new products, we believe some of the cost savings initiatives we have, some of the operating leverage we're going to be able to generate will help us fund those ideas as the year unfolds."

We do expect Q2 to be better than Q1 from an organic sales growth standpoint. And we expect the second half to be better than Q2. And a couple of factors to take into account as we think about the Q1 to Q2 movement. And these -- we talked about these in this script. It may be good just to consolidate them all. First is the comps. Again, our F '16 Q1 organic sales growth was the highest of the year at plus 2%. And all segments showed growth and we have particular strength in Häagen-Dazs and in Yoplait. In Q2, we'll begin lapping negative organic growth, which was driven to a large extent by reduced merchandising on cereal and snacks at one of our large U.S. customers. So first out is the comps will ease for some very specific reasons. Second is we expect even better price depreciation in Q2 versus Q1. Q1, we had 2 points of price/mix appreciation. We expect even more in Q2. That's when we start seeing the benefit of SRM, the trade optimization actions that we're taking in our foundation businesses in the U.S. We expect to see continued pricing benefits in Brazil. And we expect lower drag from the bakery food -- bakery flour pricing in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice business. So the second factor is that we think pricing will improve, our price/mix appreciation will improve in the second quarter. Pipeline plays a bit of a role. We mentioned that we saw the consumer offtake ahead of shipments for U.S. cereal. We also saw it for soup. We also had some inventory reductions in a large customer in our C&F business. And we don't expect any of those to reoccur in Q2. But lastly, the most important factor, of course, is the positive impact of all the Consumer First initiatives that Ken and Jeff have talked about. So we expect Q2 to be better than Q1. We expect the second half to be better than the first half. And we expect the full year to come in between our flat and minus 2% guidance that we have initiated -- that we initiated back in June."

So let me start big picture and work our way back to the category initiatives you talked about. Big picture, we see in Nielsen data, and certainly I have heard from a lot of our retailers over the last month in my direct conversation with them, is that we see prices deflationary or the inflation reducing in the store over the course of the last quarter or so. As we look, and Ken shared with you earlier, as we look at what the items that -- in groceries that contain the UPC code, we have about 0.5% growth, I think it's 0.4%. A big portion of that is really reduction in egg pricing from a year ago. So if you strip out the pricing on eggs, it's about 1% inflation, which is pretty consistent with the last couple of quarters. And so we had the flu last year and the price of eggs was really high. And it's a lot lower now, and so that accounts for a lot. We've also heard -- I've also heard from a lot of retailers about deflation in other parts, non-UPC, so the perimeter of the store in things like dairy and meat. But what we're seeing in our categories really is about 2.5% price appreciation in the first quarter. And that's what we're seeing in our Nielsen and in our categories as well. And so as we -- and we've seen quite good price discipline in the vast majority of our categories. And there's no reason for us to think that, that won't continue going forward. Certainly, as we look to our SRM initiatives, we're gaining increased confidence that those are going to be effective. When we talk to the retailers about our pricing and what we're going to do with our foundation brands, we find a pretty receptive audience to be honest. And the first fact is that 75% of our business is growth and 25%, foundational. So we start with that. And within the foundational brands, our retailers are looking for a little bit of inflation. So to the extent that they see deflation in some areas, a little bit of inflation in other areas isn't such a bad thing. And the key to that really is to bring some level of investment to the category in other forms. And so I've talked about it before, but it's really important in that on Progresso, it's going to be about antibiotic-free chicken. And on Pillsbury, it's a new shelf set as well as improving the quality of our products. And so we're making investments in other ways. And our retailers are really, really receptive to that. And so we're not just milking these businesses, managing for cash. They're really foundation businesses. And when we see good opportunities for investment in things other than pricing, we're doing those."

So I guess my question is whether General Mills' capacity utilization in those categories in which some of these actions are likely to be most pronounced maybe is at a level that can handle some of the potential volume consequences of such a strategy on things like overhead absorption and such. Or I guess, could there be a need at some point for maybe further supply chain actions in addition to what maybe you've announced already and discussed earlier on the call?"

And U.S. cereal has been the farthest ahead, but it's just fast following to the rest of our category. And you'll soon see that. As regards to capacity, we have made the moves in pricing and strategic revenue management with an eye for capacity as we look forward. And so clearly if there are additional capacity, we'll remove that, we need to optimize our supply chain. You see that with soup, for example, in this last quarter, where we saw an opportunity to improve the profitability and viability of our soup business by closing our Vineland plant. And so to the extent we see opportunities like that, whether it's here or in other parts of the world, we'll certainly take advantage of that.

Greek 100 is yet again in the weight management area. And so the key to the innovation is making sure that you have innovation that's meaningful and that you're bringing in different segments that are not overlapping.

Well, thanks, Jeff, and good morning to one and all. I'll cover the key headlines for the second quarter. 
First, we feel good about the margin expansion progress and EPS growth we delivered in the quarter. And we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver on our goal of a 20% operating margin by fiscal '18. 
We remain committed to our Consumer First strategy and where we're getting the ideas right, it's driving growth, whether that's Annie's and Lärabar in the U.S., Häagen-Dazs outside North America, Old El Paso or around the world. 
Even so, our net sales performance did not meet our expectations in the second quarter. We didn't have enough marketing support, meaning the combination of trade, media and new product news to drive improved top line results. And on top of that, we saw a slowdown in food industry growth in the U.S. in recent periods. 
So we're making targeted adjustments to our plans in the back half to find the right balance of investment and return, while still driving significant margin expansion. Jeff Harmening will take you through more details on our second half business plans in a moment. 
As a result of our sales trend, we're revising down our expectations for full year net sales and segment operating profit. But we remain on track to deliver our EPS and margin expansion guidance. And we're increasing our free cash flow growth expectations, thanks to continued good financial discipline. 
Finally, we announced an important change to our organizational structure earlier this month. This change represents a significant step towards operating as a global company, allowing us to unlock global growth opportunities while continuing to drive efficiently and increased agility in our organization. 
So with that, let me turn things over to Don to provide more detail on our financial performance."
274715,411442461,1103792,"General Mills, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2016",2016-12-20,"Earnings Calls","General Mills, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ken, and good morning to everyone. With that as a backdrop, let me get into the numbers, provide a summary of our cost-savings efforts and give you some more details on our updated guidance. Slide 6 summarizes our second quarter fiscal '17 finan",1797,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning to everyone. With that as a backdrop, let me get into the numbers, provide a summary of our cost-savings efforts and give you some more details on our updated guidance. 
Slide 6 summarizes our second quarter fiscal '17 financial results. Net sales totaled $4.1 billion, down 7% as reported. Organic net sales declined 4%. Total segment operating profit totaled $830 million, comparable to last year on a constant currency basis. Net earnings decreased 9% to $482 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.80 as reported. 
Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability was $0.85. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 5% compared to last year's results. 
Slide 7 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales declined 4% in the quarter, driven by 7 points of lower organic pound volume growth, partially offset by 3 points of positive sales mix and net price realization. Foreign currency translation didn't have a material impact on net sales this quarter. And the net impact of acquisition and divestitures reduced sales growth by 3 points in the quarter. 
Turning to segment results. Total U.S. Retail net sales declined 9%, with growth in snacks offset by decline in the other operating units. Organic net sales were down 6% in the quarter. The difference being reported in organic net sales primarily reflects the divestiture of Green Giant, which impacts the meals unit results. Segment operating profit grew 2% versus last year with benefits from a margin expansion initiatives more than offsetting lower volumes. 
In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, net sales declined 4% in the second quarter. This segment's Focus 6 platforms returned to growth with net sales up 2%, driven by growth in cereal, yogurt, snacks, mixes and biscuits. As we expected, net sales declined 10% on our non-Focus 6 businesses in the quarter, primarily due to market index pricing on bakery flour. We expect headwinds from flour index pricing, which impacts sales with the profit neutral to lessen significantly in the second half. For the second quarter, segment operating profit was up 6%, driven by benefit from cost-savings initiatives, lower input cost, favorable product mix and higher grain merchandising range. 
Slide 10 summarizes our constant currency net sales and profit results for our International segment. Total international organic net sales declined 1% in the second quarter. At the region level, second quarter constant currency net sales in Asia Pacific region were comparable to last year with double-digit growth in India, offset by the restructuring of our Snacks business in China, which we announced last quarter. This action will continue to be a headwind to sales growth through the first quarter of fiscal '18. Excluding snacks, net sales for the rest of our China business were up mid-single digits in the quarter. Latin America sales declined 2% in constant currency in the second quarter, reflecting the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Organic net sales in the region were up low single digits. 
In Europe, constant currency net sales were down 3% with declines in yogurt offsetting growth for Häagen-Dazs and Old El Paso. 
In Canada, sales were down 7% in constant currency, almost entirely due to the divestiture of Green Giant. 
Constant currency international operating profit declined 18% in the quarter due to currency-driven inflation on products imported into Canada and the U.K. While we expect further headwinds from the British pound in the second half, the Canadian dollar impact should moderate significantly. 
Turning to joint venture results on Slide 11. CPW net sales grew 3% in constant currency with broad growth across Middle East, Asia, the U.K. and Australia. Häagen-Dazs Japan constant currency net sales increased 21% due to strong new seasonal product performance and double-digit growth in handheld treats. Combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $30 million in the second quarter, up 27% in constant currency, primarily driven by strong sales growth as well as lower administrative costs for CPW and lower input cost for Häagen-Dazs Japan. 
As Ken said, we made good progress on our margin expansion goals in the second quarter. Adjusted gross margins were up 130 basis points with benefits from Holistic Margin Management and our other cost-savings initiatives more than offsetting low input cost inflation. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of goods sold HMM savings to more than offset our expectation of 2% inflation. 
Adjusted operating profit margins increased 160 basis points in the quarter, slightly ahead of our full year goal. 
Slide 13 summarizes other noteworthy income statement items in the quarter. We incurred $53 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter, included $24 million reported in cost of sales. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, decreased $18 million. Net interest expense increased 2% from the prior year. We continue to expect full year interest expense will be flat to last year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.8% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 32.4% compared to 32.3% last year. We now expect our full year tax rate will be roughly in line with the year-ago rate of 29.8%.  And average diluted shares outstanding declined 2% in the quarter. We now expect a 2% reduction for the full year compared to our previous guidance of down 1% to 2%. 
Turning to our first half financial performance. Net sales of $8 billion were down 7% as reported and down 4% on an organic basis. Segment operating profit declined 2% in constant currency. And adjusted diluted EPS was up 1% as reported and up 2% in constant currency. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 15 shows our further progress on core working capital. Our core working capital decreased 20% versus 1 year ago, and we continue to drive operational improvements across our business. This is the 15th consecutive quarter that we reduced core working capital. And we have visibility to further reductions in the coming quarters by continued efforts to improved -- improvements in payables. As a result, we're raising our fiscal '17 guidance on free cash flow growth from mid-single digits to high single digits. 
First half operating cash flow was $988 million, down 15% from 1 year ago, largely driven by timing of trade and advertising accruals and taxes payable related to the Green Giant divestiture last year. 
Year-to-date capital investments totaled $318 million. And through the first half of the year, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases. 
As Ken mentioned, we're taking another step toward operating as a global company by changing our reporting structure to maximize our global scale, unlock global growth opportunities and continue to drive efficiency. We've established 4 new business groups: North America retail, which combines our current U.S. Retail segment and our Canada region in our International segment; Europe and Australia, which is currently another international region; Asia and Latin America, which combines the remaining 2 current international regions; and Convenience Stores and Foodservice. As part of this change, we anticipate eliminating 400 to 600 positions worldwide, which we estimate will drive savings of $70 million to $90 million by fiscal '18. 
We intend to begin reporting results under this new structure in the third quarter and we'll provide restated historical data at that time. This announcement is the latest in series of significant actions we've taken since fiscal '15 to streamline our structure and drive savings. 
As always, HMM is at the center of this effort and continues to deliver significant savings in our cost of goods. In fact, between fiscal '15 and fiscal '17, HMM will generate more than $1.2 billion in cost of goods sold savings, which keeps us on track to achieve our target of $4 billion of savings from HMM this decade. 
We've announced additional projects since fiscal '15 to improve our organizational effectiveness while delivering incremental cost savings. As part of our initiative to streamline our global supply chain network, we will have closed 11 plants by fiscal '18 or 17% of our 2014 factory base, including those plant closures as well as project catalysts, compass and our new global reorganization, we'll have reduced approximately 5,000 positions by fiscal '18 or roughly 12% of our global headcount. And we continue to reduce our administrative expenses and drive incremental savings through our implementation of zero-based budgeting. We estimate these projects will drive $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal '18, above and beyond HMM. 
We're progressing well on our goal to 20% adjusted operating profit margins by fiscal '18, which represents more than 300 basis points improvement over fiscal '16 levels. We continue to expect this margin expansion to come from 3 areas: First, our fiscal '17 COGS HMM savings net of inflation should make up 25% of our goal. At our Investor Day in July, we said the other 2 buckets were split roughly equally. 
Now that we provided visibility to our global reorganization, you can see that savings from our announced projects represent fully tapped of our margin expansion goal. The remaining 25% will come primarily from strategic revenue management, spending optimization efforts and other cost efficiency initiatives. 
So let me finish with our second half expectations and full year outlook. We expect modest improvement in organic net sales growth in the second half as we adjust our levels of support and continue to invest in Consumer First news [ph] that is working. We expect to deliver significant adjusted operating profit margin expansion, thanks to our cost-savings efforts. And that, in turn, will help drive double-digit growth and adjusted diluted EPS in the second half. 
Finally, we expect to accelerate our free cash flow growth behind further improvements in our core working capital. 
I'll close my section by summarizing our updated fiscal '17 guidance, which you can find on Slide 21. Given our first half performance, we now expect full year organic net sales to be down 3% to 4%. As a result, we're now targeting total segment operating profit growth of 2% to 4% on a constant currency basis versus the prior guidance of 6% to 8% growth. We continue to expect adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 150 basis points. 
As I mentioned previously, we expect interest expense and our adjusted tax rate will be flat to last year. And we anticipate average diluted shares will decline 2%. We continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS will be up between 6% and 8% in constant currency. We now expect foreign currency translation will be a $0.01 headwind to full year diluted EPS results. 
Finally, we're increasing our free cash flow guidance from mid-single-digit growth to high single-digit growth, reflecting continued strong core working capital discipline. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff."

As Don mentioned, we posted organic net sales decline in the quarter with our growth and foundation businesses down 3% and 8%, respectively. 
In some businesses, we met our expectation and in others, we fell short. We didn't deliver the top line improvement we were expecting from the U.S. Retail in the second quarter with organic sales finishing down 6%.  On the other hand, margin delivery was strong with U.S. Retail operating profit margins up 270 basis points to 24.4%. 
We also expected better net sales performance for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, and we met that expectation with our Focus 6 platforms returning to growth this quarter. 
Within our International segment, we expected improved organic net sales performance. We saw a topline improvement in Europe and in China, offset by a slowdown in Canada, leaving the total segment organic net sales growth in line with our first quarter results. 
Let me describe in more detail the drivers of our second quarter performance and discuss our operating plans for the second half this year starting with U.S. Retail. 
The operating environment here in the U.S. remains challenging. As you can see on Slide 24, the industry has experienced a slowdown in retail sales growth, including a decline in the most recent quarter as benefits from pricing have eroded and unit volume has remained weak. In other categories, average unit prices were up 3% last quarter, but volume softness drove overall category retail sales down 1%. 
For our business, it was our 5 largest categories: Cereal, yogurt, snack bars, refrigerated dough and soup that fell short of expectations. As Ken told you upfront, we did not have enough marketing support in the form of trade and consumer spending and new product news to deliver the improvement we were looking for. We also saw a bit more competitive activity in some of these categories in the quarter. 
In our other categories, our results were actually a bit better than our expectations, led by Old El Paso Mexican foods, Totino's hot snacks and our Natural & Organic portfolio. 
We're adding back some support in the second half, but we will remain disciplined in our spending. We still believe prioritized investment against the best growth opportunities, while continuing to drive margin expansion, is the right thing to do for the long-term health of our business. 
Retail sales for our Cereal brands were down 3% in the quarter. Where we had compelling Consumer First messaging, we saw a good consumer response. For example, our gluten-free Cheerios news and removal of artificial ingredients continue to drive growth in baseline or full price sales. And consumers still love great-tasting cereals. More cocoa and cocoa puffs are driving double-digit retail sales growth for this brand. And more cinnamon news continue to drive good performance on Cinnamon Toast Crunch. 
But overall, we didn't get the quality of merchandising we expected. And we didn't have enough marketing pressure to drive better results for our business in the quarter. 
In the second half, we're adding incremental consumer spending to support news that's working, like gluten-free Cheerios and the removal of artificial ingredients. We'll also improve our in-store execution, and we're securing better merchandising events with key retailers on some of our largest established brands. In total, we expect to continue to drive positive net price realization for our Cereal business in the back half of the year. 
New products will also contribute to improved second half performance. We're bringing the taste of real fruit to Cheerios with the new Very Berry variety. It contains strawberries, blueberries and raspberries with no artificial colors or flavors.  And of course, it's gluten-free, [indiscernible] stores beginning next month. 
On yogurt, we continue to see challenging performance in the second quarter with retail sales down 18%, and our Light and Greek 100 varieties driving the majority of those declines. Retail sales for the yogurt category also turned negative in the quarter as elevated levels of merchandising generated less incremental lift and as the level of new products news slowed. On a more positive note, we're seeing good initial consumer response to our Annie's and Liberté organic yogurts that we launched in the quarter. 
As we enter the second half, we'll build on our first half yogurt news. Together, the Annie's and Liberté brands already hold an 8% share of the organic yogurt segment. We expect these brands to have a more significant impact on our second half performance as we continue to expand distribution. 
We also renovated our yogurt offerings in the first half, improving the value proposition with larger [indiscernible] of individual tubes. Where we're getting the price right with retailers, it is performing quite well, so we'll look to expand that success in the remainder of the year. 
We're also introducing new and renovated yogurt offering in the second half that squarely meet consumer needs. Our renovated Greek 100 protein line appeal to consumers looking for a higher amount of protein for just 100 calories. It's made with real fruit and has a delicious thick texture that we think consumers will prefer. 
Yoplait Dippers combined creamy Greek yogurt with the crunch of pretzel [indiscernible] bites. They offer spoon-free snacking and are perfect afternoon pick-me-up. And Yoplait Custard Yogurt is a silky smooth indulgent snack or dessert made with whole milk and just a few other simple ingredients. 
We know we have a good deal of work to do to turn around our yogurt business. We expect some improvement in the second half, but won't return to growth this year. We believe the key to success will be fundamentally shifting our portfolios to renovation and innovation to give consumers what they want from their yogurt, and that's the essence of Consumer First. The product news I just shared will help us make important strides to our net goal in the second half of this year. And we have a great pipeline of innovation, including an exciting launch in early fiscal '18 that should help build a strong foundation for the future. 
On snack bars, Nature Valley retail sales were down 3% in the second quarter, so we're adding some incremental media support in the back half, and we have a good lineup of new launches. We're expanding our successful biscuit sandwiches with the cocoa almond butter variety. We're launching new XL sweet and salty bars that are 50% bigger developed with men in mind. And we're very excited about our new granola cups, which feature our crunchy whole grain shell filled with peanut or almond butter. They add an indulgent offering to the Nature Valley brand, but with just 9 grams of sugar per serving. 
Retail sales for Fiber One bars were down double digits in the second quarter consistent with the decline in the adult segment of the bars category. As you may recall, Fiber One was the first brand to do the seemingly impossible made fiber taste good. And we're making it taste even better with new layered bars that contain crisp grains, caramel and almond toppings and chocolate and 9 grams of fiber per bar. 
On Lärabar, retail sales were up more than 50% in the second quarter. In the back half, we're expanding Lärabar's offerings with the line of new fruits and grains bars. Each bar contains 1/4 cup of kale or spinach, giving Lärabar consumers 
The nutrition they're looking for in just 5 simple ingredients per bar. 
Refrigerated dough and soup round out our largest 5 categories in the U.S. and we're supporting these businesses with consumer news in the second half. We'll be adding marketing support to Pillsbury refrigerated dough and we have some news coming for each of the 2. With our new shelf set of standard [ph] cans, we continue to expand across retailers. 
Our performance on Progresso soup wasn't where we wanted to be the second quarter, as we experienced heightened competitive activity and an unusually warn weather. But winter is certainly here now, and we're ramping up our messaging behind our antibiotic-free chicken news. 
As I mentioned earlier, we saw good results in our other categories in the U.S. Retail and we'll build on that momentum in the second half. Old El Paso has been generating growth within our meals platform in recent years. Consumer First innovation, including new flavors and formats of Stand 'N Stuff shells and tortillas drove retail sales up 6% in the quarter. 
Innovation is also working for Totino's Hot Snacks with retail sales up 6% in the quarter. We saw a particularly good performance on pizza sticks, which were launched in the first quarter. And we'll introduce larger count sizes next month. We think this is a great example of knowing our consumer and reaching them with relevant products and messaging. 
The Annie's brand continues to lead our growth in Natural & Organic. Retail sales for the brand grew 46% in the second quarter. And our points of distribution are up more than 30% year-to-date in Nielsen-measured channels alone. Retail sales for Annie's established items like snacks and Mac and Cheese grew 20% in the quarter. And we continue to build distribution on our category expansions in cereals, yogurt, soup, baked goods and grain snacks. 
Next month, we'll introduce Annie's organic ready-to-eat popcorn. With the strength of this great brand, as well as the performance of our other terrific Natural & Organic brands, we are well on our way to meeting our goal of $1 billion in net sales for our Natural & Organic portfolio by 2019. 
So as we look through the second half, we have plans in place to drive improvement for our U.S. Retail businesses. We're optimizing our marketing support across our 5 largest categories. We'll continue to build on what's working by investing behind in our Natural & Organic businesses as well as Old El Paso and Totino's. We have a solid lineup of new products that are aligned with growing areas of consumer interest. And we'll continue to drive margin expansion for U.S. Retail, building on the improvement we posted in the first half. 
Let me turn briefly to our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment. As Don mentioned, net sales declined in the quarter driven, in large part, by negative impact of flour pricing. However, our Focus 6 platforms posted net sales growth, led by our yogurt platform with net sales gains for Yoplait Parfait Pro and increased cereals sales in schools. 
In the second half, we expect continued goods -- continued good growth from our Focus 6 platforms and to reduce headwind from our flour index pricing. 
We'll also bring more innovation to Foodservice customers with new artisan breads designed for K-12 schools. This includes presliced, premium quality ciabatta breads and flat panini breads that allow operators to make hot sandwiches with reduced flavor and without additional equipment. In total, these efforts should result in improved topline performance for this segment in second half. 
Now let's turn to our International segment. Sales in our developed markets were mixed in the second quarter. Retail sales for Old El Paso were up high single digits in Canada behind Stand 'N Stuff taco shell innovation. In Europe, we posted high single digit retail sales declines on yogurt, high single digit growth for wholesome snacks and high teens growth for Häagen-Dazs led by stick bars. 
In the second half, we'll build on what's working  in developed markets and also bring new product news to our categories. Our Old El Paso Stand 'N Stuff business has been a good growth driver in recent years. And we recently launched a mini shell variety in Europe. And we're expanding up successful Häagen-Dazs stick bars into new European markets and adding new flavors to the line. 
On yogurt, we're focusing on improving our in-store execution and closing distribution gaps. We're also entering the fast-growing in Belgian segment with our new Triple Sensations line. 
In Canada, we're launching Yoplait whole milk yogurt that has all family appeal and will drive growth on our expanding Natural & Organic business with the addition of items like Lärabar bites. 
China is our largest emerging market and we saw a good second quarter net sales growth there on Häagen-Dazs, Wanchai Ferry and Yoplait. Our Yoplait yogurt business continues to grow in Shanghai. And we're gaining a foothold in Beijing, which we entered this summer. As Don mentioned, our results were partially offset by our snack restructuring in China, which was a headwind to sales, but will be slightly accretive to underlying profit. 
And in the EMEA region, Häagen-Dazs stick bars launched in the first quarter are performing well. 
In the second half in China, we're launching a new Wanchai Ferry's kids line in time for the Chinese New Year. These dumplings come in colorful wrappers at a smaller size for kids and have nutritional ingredients like pork, salmon and shrimp that appeal to moms. 
On Häagen-Dazs, we're launching new fruit and flowers ice cream flavors like rose and rasberry and elderflower and blackcurrant that deliver a sweet aromatic experience. 
In EMEA, we'll continue to drive growth on Häagen-Dazs with new flavors of stick bars in our core client business. And we're launching frozen yogurt across multiple markets following its success in China. 
For our International segment in total, we expect our underlying topline trend to improve in the back half. And we're planning for operating margin expansion as transaction currency headwinds moderate. 
And now I'll turn it back to Ken for some closing remarks."

So thank you, Jeff, and let me just summarize our comments this morning. We continue to take a disciplined approach to the top line, focusing our investments behind our highest returning Consumer First ideas and eliminating activities that are not generating profitable volume. 
Our organic sales results didn't meet our expectation this quarter, so we're adding support in launching a solid lineup of new products to strengthen the second half. 
We delivered strong margin expansion and good EPS growth in the second quarter. And our HMM and other cost-savings efforts keep us on track to deliver our fiscal '18 goal of a 20% adjusted operating profit margin. 
And we updated our full year growth goals to reflect a softer topline, but we're maintaining our EPS guidance and increasing our free cash flow growth target as we continue to drive operational efficiency across our businesses.

Having said that, as we look back at the first quarter, we think there are cases where we cut too far or reduced spending too much in certain areas.

But I'll also tell you very helpful internally for us to set a very clear and important goal. I also want to tell you that the actions that are taken to achieve that have been highly positive for General Mills. And so the work that we've done over the last several years to optimize our supply chain, getting the right capacity in the right place has been extremely beneficial to the company for the long term. The base that's there now is very highly utilized, the actions that we've taken. In fact, as we said a number of times, open the door to kind of a second wave of productivity initiatives as those plants are highly utilized. So that's been extremely positive for General Mills. And the work we've done on the administrative structure just to got a lighter structure, the work that we just announced to optimize and structure for global growth with North American segment kind of Europe developed marketing segment, Asia, that segment. These are really designed enough for executional efficiency, better sharing, they're just way more efficient. So I understand the question, but I would just say that the work that we've done, and we put in place to achieve these stronger margin goals as I would say overall been very highly positive for General Mills and sets us up very well for the future. Obviously, margin and free cash flow, very important metrics for us. We talked about them repeatedly top line, of course, is also super important.

It does makes you think differently, and it brought to bear more ideas in terms of where we can find efficiencies, and we got in through our P&L and our balance sheet and as a result, it's creating flex for us to reinvest back in our business.

The first is a year ago, we had a big payable from the Green Giant sale that hit our operating cash flow. We've noted that cash came out -- or cash that came in was in the finance section or in the Investors section -- excuse me. So we had a large liability that will not obviously reoccur this year. So that is $160 million, I believe, at this point last year. So that will change the complexity of our working capital in the balance of the year. The other is our trade and advertising accruals. As we've said, our media, our trade was down in the first half even a bit more than we had planned and anticipated as we reinvest more in the back half, those accruals will come up, again, favorably impacting working capital. And the last thing, the one that's the most, I guess, sustainable that will carry forward into F '18 as well is our focus on core working capital inventory was a bit higher than we wanted to be at the end of the second quarter, and that's because volumes did not come in as anticipated. That will be even out in the -- come down as the year unfolds. And then a more importantly, as we continue to work on our payables, as we move our vendors to [indiscernible] terms, we'll see that benefit start to creep more in the second half and again more in the '18 as well. So it's all our working capital and those 3 big items, the tax payable on the Green Giant divestiture a year ago that we're rolling over, the level of advertising and trade payables that will increase as the year goes on as we increase investments in those 2 areas and then the core -- we'll continue to work on these reducing working capital."

So at full year, we'll be below our original 150 guidance, but we're in the 100 to 120 range. But it will improve in the back half for some substantial reasons. First off, we'll get better volume leverage as we see improved sales in the back half it is primarily from volume, so our gross margin will benefit from that. The comps from last year, if you look at our trend last year, our gross margin expansion was essentially all in the first half and that was due to inflation phasing, we're facing accelerated during the course of that '16. Last year, gross margins were up 170 basis points in the first half. It was actually about flat in the second half and actually Q3 was down 130 basis points. So again, I think that gross margin expansion this year on a comparable basis will skew to Q4. To your specific question on inflation, we think it's fairly stable through the course of the year, slight deceleration in the back half and fourth quarter and obviously, we'll see pretty steady contributions from HMM exceeding that inflation. Our cost actions will build during the course of the year. That will help gross margin in the back half and then transaction FX, which for the full year will be about $50 million drag for us, but 35 of that is in the first half, as I said, in my comments, the pound will continue to impact us in the back half, but we think it [indiscernible] will be less so. So we absorbed the majority of the transaction FX negative in the first half, so there will be less of a drag in the second. So really those 4 things, the volume leverage that we'll get in the second slightly better than the first half, the comps, particularly around inflation phasing will favor the back half this year, especially the fourth quarter, our cost actions will build around Project Century benefits and then transaction FX still a negative, but a lighter negative in the back half."

As a matter of fact, if you look at our growth businesses in the back half, excluding U.S. Yogurt which we've always said we're going to really right size our investment there and given how are historical share of voice, excluding U.S. yogurt, our growth businesses, advertising investment, media investment will be up low single digits in the back half. Again, fairly spread across the businesses that Jeff talked to. So we'll see that in the back half. And actually, our admin continues to be below last year both that within SOP and then on the corporate level as well, so that's actually a contributor. Obviously, what's different is the sales are lower and volumes are slower than we started the year, and that's an offset. So again, I don't exactly follow your math, but we expect to get our 150 basis points of operating margin expansion.

So -- and the integration of our Yoplait business with our European business will be largely behind so we expect improved performance from there.

I think there are a couple of occasions where we felt like we have -- we feel like we have good marketing good news and some things we could optimize. I look at cereal advertising, for example, we love the return we get from our gluten-free advertising and from no artificial colors and flavors and that advertising, we think we can spend more than we did in the second quarter because we like the returns on that, and we think we have really good news."

Well, thanks, Jeff, and good morning to one and all. I'll cover the key headlines for the second quarter. 
First, we feel good about the margin expansion progress and EPS growth we delivered in the quarter. And we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver on our goal of a 20% operating margin by fiscal '18. 
We remain committed to our Consumer First strategy and where we're getting the ideas right, it's driving growth, whether that's Annie's and Lärabar in the U.S., Häagen-Dazs outside North America, Old El Paso or around the world. 
Even so, our net sales performance did not meet our expectations in the second quarter. We didn't have enough marketing support, meaning the combination of trade, media and new product news to drive improved top line results. And on top of that, we saw a slowdown in food industry growth in the U.S. in recent periods. 
So we're making targeted adjustments to our plans in the back half to find the right balance of investment and return, while still driving significant margin expansion. Jeff Harmening will take you through more details on our second half business plans in a moment. 
As a result of our sales trend, we're revising down our expectations for full year net sales and segment operating profit. But we remain on track to deliver our EPS and margin expansion guidance. And we're increasing our free cash flow growth expectations, thanks to continued good financial discipline. 
Finally, we announced an important change to our organizational structure earlier this month. This change represents a significant step towards operating as a global company, allowing us to unlock global growth opportunities while continuing to drive efficiently and increased agility in our organization. 
So with that, let me turn things over to Don to provide more detail on our financial performance."
274715,411442461,1103906,"General Mills, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2016",2016-12-20,"Earnings Calls","General Mills, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ken, and good morning to everyone. With that as a backdrop, let me get into the numbers, provide a summary of our cost-savings efforts and give you some more details on our updated guidance. Slide 6 summarizes our second quarter fiscal '17 finan",1796,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning to everyone. With that as a backdrop, let me get into the numbers, provide a summary of our cost-savings efforts and give you some more details on our updated guidance. 
Slide 6 summarizes our second quarter fiscal '17 financial results. Net sales totaled $4.1 billion, down 7% as reported. Organic net sales declined 4%. Total segment operating profit totaled $830 million, comparable to last year on a constant currency basis. Net earnings decreased 9% to $482 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.80 as reported. 
Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability was $0.85. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 5% compared to last year's results. 
Slide 7 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales declined 4% in the quarter, driven by 7 points of lower organic pound volume growth, partially offset by 3 points of positive sales mix and net price realization. Foreign currency translation didn't have a material impact on net sales this quarter. And the net impact of acquisition and divestitures reduced sales growth by 3 points in the quarter. 
Turning to segment results. Total U.S. Retail net sales declined 9%, with growth in snacks offset by decline in the other operating units. Organic net sales were down 6% in the quarter. The difference being reported in organic net sales primarily reflects the divestiture of Green Giant, which impacts the meals unit results. Segment operating profit grew 2% versus last year with benefits from a margin expansion initiatives more than offsetting lower volumes. 
In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, net sales declined 4% in the second quarter. This segment's Focus 6 platforms returned to growth with net sales up 2%, driven by growth in cereal, yogurt, snacks, mixes and biscuits. As we expected, net sales declined 10% on our non-Focus 6 businesses in the quarter, primarily due to market index pricing on bakery flour. We expect headwinds from flour index pricing, which impacts sales with the profit neutral to lessen significantly in the second half. For the second quarter, segment operating profit was up 6%, driven by benefit from cost-savings initiatives, lower input cost, favorable product mix and higher grain merchandising range. 
Slide 10 summarizes our constant currency net sales and profit results for our International segment. Total international organic net sales declined 1% in the second quarter. At the region level, second quarter constant currency net sales in Asia Pacific region were comparable to last year with double-digit growth in India, offset by the restructuring of our Snacks business in China, which we announced last quarter. This action will continue to be a headwind to sales growth through the first quarter of fiscal '18. Excluding snacks, net sales for the rest of our China business were up mid-single digits in the quarter. Latin America sales declined 2% in constant currency in the second quarter, reflecting the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Organic net sales in the region were up low single digits. 
In Europe, constant currency net sales were down 3% with declines in yogurt offsetting growth for Häagen-Dazs and Old El Paso. 
In Canada, sales were down 7% in constant currency, almost entirely due to the divestiture of Green Giant. 
Constant currency international operating profit declined 18% in the quarter due to currency-driven inflation on products imported into Canada and the U.K. While we expect further headwinds from the British pound in the second half, the Canadian dollar impact should moderate significantly. 
Turning to joint venture results on Slide 11. CPW net sales grew 3% in constant currency with broad growth across Middle East, Asia, the U.K. and Australia. Häagen-Dazs Japan constant currency net sales increased 21% due to strong new seasonal product performance and double-digit growth in handheld treats. Combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $30 million in the second quarter, up 27% in constant currency, primarily driven by strong sales growth as well as lower administrative costs for CPW and lower input cost for Häagen-Dazs Japan. 
As Ken said, we made good progress on our margin expansion goals in the second quarter. Adjusted gross margins were up 130 basis points with benefits from Holistic Margin Management and our other cost-savings initiatives more than offsetting low input cost inflation. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of goods sold HMM savings to more than offset our expectation of 2% inflation. 
Adjusted operating profit margins increased 160 basis points in the quarter, slightly ahead of our full year goal. 
Slide 13 summarizes other noteworthy income statement items in the quarter. We incurred $53 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter, included $24 million reported in cost of sales. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, decreased $18 million. Net interest expense increased 2% from the prior year. We continue to expect full year interest expense will be flat to last year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.8% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 32.4% compared to 32.3% last year. We now expect our full year tax rate will be roughly in line with the year-ago rate of 29.8%.  And average diluted shares outstanding declined 2% in the quarter. We now expect a 2% reduction for the full year compared to our previous guidance of down 1% to 2%. 
Turning to our first half financial performance. Net sales of $8 billion were down 7% as reported and down 4% on an organic basis. Segment operating profit declined 2% in constant currency. And adjusted diluted EPS was up 1% as reported and up 2% in constant currency. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 15 shows our further progress on core working capital. Our core working capital decreased 20% versus 1 year ago, and we continue to drive operational improvements across our business. This is the 15th consecutive quarter that we reduced core working capital. And we have visibility to further reductions in the coming quarters by continued efforts to improved -- improvements in payables. As a result, we're raising our fiscal '17 guidance on free cash flow growth from mid-single digits to high single digits. 
First half operating cash flow was $988 million, down 15% from 1 year ago, largely driven by timing of trade and advertising accruals and taxes payable related to the Green Giant divestiture last year. 
Year-to-date capital investments totaled $318 million. And through the first half of the year, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases. 
As Ken mentioned, we're taking another step toward operating as a global company by changing our reporting structure to maximize our global scale, unlock global growth opportunities and continue to drive efficiency. We've established 4 new business groups: North America retail, which combines our current U.S. Retail segment and our Canada region in our International segment; Europe and Australia, which is currently another international region; Asia and Latin America, which combines the remaining 2 current international regions; and Convenience Stores and Foodservice. As part of this change, we anticipate eliminating 400 to 600 positions worldwide, which we estimate will drive savings of $70 million to $90 million by fiscal '18. 
We intend to begin reporting results under this new structure in the third quarter and we'll provide restated historical data at that time. This announcement is the latest in series of significant actions we've taken since fiscal '15 to streamline our structure and drive savings. 
As always, HMM is at the center of this effort and continues to deliver significant savings in our cost of goods. In fact, between fiscal '15 and fiscal '17, HMM will generate more than $1.2 billion in cost of goods sold savings, which keeps us on track to achieve our target of $4 billion of savings from HMM this decade. 
We've announced additional projects since fiscal '15 to improve our organizational effectiveness while delivering incremental cost savings. As part of our initiative to streamline our global supply chain network, we will have closed 11 plants by fiscal '18 or 17% of our 2014 factory base, including those plant closures as well as project catalysts, compass and our new global reorganization, we'll have reduced approximately 5,000 positions by fiscal '18 or roughly 12% of our global headcount. And we continue to reduce our administrative expenses and drive incremental savings through our implementation of zero-based budgeting. We estimate these projects will drive $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal '18, above and beyond HMM. 
We're progressing well on our goal to 20% adjusted operating profit margins by fiscal '18, which represents more than 300 basis points improvement over fiscal '16 levels. We continue to expect this margin expansion to come from 3 areas: First, our fiscal '17 COGS HMM savings net of inflation should make up 25% of our goal. At our Investor Day in July, we said the other 2 buckets were split roughly equally. 
Now that we provided visibility to our global reorganization, you can see that savings from our announced projects represent fully tapped of our margin expansion goal. The remaining 25% will come primarily from strategic revenue management, spending optimization efforts and other cost efficiency initiatives. 
So let me finish with our second half expectations and full year outlook. We expect modest improvement in organic net sales growth in the second half as we adjust our levels of support and continue to invest in Consumer First news that is working. We expect to deliver significant adjusted operating profit margin expansion, thanks to our cost-savings efforts. And that, in turn, will help drive double-digit growth and adjusted diluted EPS in the second half. 
Finally, we expect to accelerate our free cash flow growth behind further improvements in our core working capital. 
I'll close my section by summarizing our updated fiscal '17 guidance, which you can find on Slide 21. Given our first half performance, we now expect full year organic net sales to be down 3% to 4%. As a result, we're now targeting total segment operating profit growth of 2% to 4% on a constant currency basis versus the prior guidance of 6% to 8% growth. We continue to expect adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 150 basis points. 
As I mentioned previously, we expect interest expense and our adjusted tax rate will be flat to last year. And we anticipate average diluted shares will decline 2%. We continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS will be up between 6% and 8% in constant currency. We now expect foreign currency translation will be a $0.01 headwind to full year diluted EPS results. 
Finally, we're increasing our free cash flow guidance from mid-single-digit growth to high single-digit growth, reflecting continued strong core working capital discipline. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff."

In some businesses, we met our expectation and in others, we fell short",2256,"Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don mentioned, we posted organic net sales decline in the quarter with our growth and foundation businesses down 3% and 8%, respectively. 
In some businesses, we met our expectation and in others, we fell short. We didn't deliver the top line improvement we were expecting from the U.S. Retail in the second quarter with organic sales finishing down 6%.  On the other hand, margin delivery was strong with U.S. Retail operating profit margins up 270 basis points to 24.4%. 
We also expected better net sales performance for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, and we met that expectation with our Focus 6 platforms returning to growth this quarter. 
Within our International segment, we expected improved organic net sales performance. We saw a topline improvement in Europe and in China, offset by a slowdown in Canada, leaving the total segment organic net sales growth in line with our first quarter results. 
Let me describe in more detail the drivers of our second quarter performance and discuss our operating plans for the second half this year starting with U.S. Retail. 
The operating environment here in the U.S. remains challenging. As you can see on Slide 24, the industry has experienced a slowdown in retail sales growth, including a decline in the most recent quarter as benefits from pricing have eroded and unit volume has remained weak. In other categories, average unit prices were up 3% last quarter, but volume softness drove overall category retail sales down 1%. 
For our business, it was our 5 largest categories: Cereal, yogurt, snack bars, refrigerated dough and soup that fell short of expectations. As Ken told you upfront, we did not have enough marketing support in the form of trade and consumer spending and new product news to deliver the improvement we were looking for. We also saw a bit more competitive activity in some of these categories in the quarter. 
In our other categories, our results were actually a bit better than our expectations, led by Old El Paso Mexican foods, Totino's hot snacks and our Natural & Organic portfolio. 
We're adding back some support in the second half, but we will remain disciplined in our spending. We still believe prioritized investment against the best growth opportunities, while continuing to drive margin expansion, is the right thing to do for the long-term health of our business. 
Retail sales for our Cereal brands were down 3% in the quarter. Where we had compelling Consumer First messaging, we saw a good consumer response. For example, our gluten-free Cheerios news and removal of artificial ingredients continue to drive growth in baseline or full price sales. And consumers still love great-tasting cereals. More cocoa and cocoa puffs are driving double-digit retail sales growth for this brand. And more cinnamon news continue to drive good performance on Cinnamon Toast Crunch. 
But overall, we didn't get the quality of merchandising we expected. And we didn't have enough marketing pressure to drive better results for our business in the quarter. 
In the second half, we're adding incremental consumer spending to support news that's working, like gluten-free Cheerios and the removal of artificial ingredients. We'll also improve our in-store execution, and we're securing better merchandising events with key retailers on some of our largest established brands. In total, we expect to continue to drive positive net price realization for our Cereal business in the back half of the year. 
New products will also contribute to improved second half performance. We're bringing the taste of real fruit to Cheerios with the new Very Berry variety. It contains strawberries, blueberries and raspberries with no artificial colors or flavors. And of course, it's gluten-free. Watch for it in stores beginning next month. 
On yogurt, we continue to see challenging performance in the second quarter with retail sales down 18%, and our Light and Greek 100 varieties driving the majority of those declines. Retail sales for the yogurt category also turned negative in the quarter as elevated levels of merchandising generated less incremental lift and as the level of new products news slowed. On a more positive note, we're seeing good initial consumer response to our Annie's and Liberté organic yogurts that we launched in the quarter. 
As we enter the second half, we'll build on our first half yogurt news. Together, the Annie's and Liberté brands already hold an 8% share of the organic yogurt segment. We expect these brands to have a more significant impact on our second half performance as we continue to expand distribution. 
We also have innovated our yogurt offerings in the first half, improving the value proposition with larger counts of individual tubes. Where we're getting the price right with retailers, it is performing quite well, so we'll look to expand that success in the remainder of the year. 
We're also introducing new and renovated yogurt offering in the second half that squarely meet consumer needs. Our renovated Greek 100 protein line appeal to consumers looking for a higher amount of protein for just 100 calories. It's made with real fruit and has a delicious thick texture that we think consumers will prefer. 
Yoplait Dippers combined creamy Greek yogurt with the crunch of pretzels bites. They offer spoon-free snacking and are perfect afternoon pick-me-up. And Yoplait Custard Yogurt is a silky smooth indulgent snack or dessert made with whole milk and just a few other simple ingredients. 
We know we have a good deal of work to do to turn around our yogurt business. We expect some improvement in the second half, but won't return to growth this year. We believe the key to success will be fundamentally shifting our portfolios to renovation and innovation to give consumers what they want from their yogurt, and that's the essence of Consumer First. The product news I just shared will help us make important strides to our net goal in the second half of this year. And we have a great pipeline of innovation, including an exciting launch in early fiscal '18 that should help build a strong foundation for the future. 
On snack bars, Nature Valley retail sales were down 3% in the second quarter, so we're adding some incremental media support in the back half, and we have a good lineup of new launches. We're expanding our successful biscuit sandwiches with the cocoa almond butter variety. We're launching new XL sweet and salty bars that are 50% bigger developed with men in mind. And we're very excited about our new granola cups, which feature our crunchy whole grain shell filled with peanut or almond butter. They add an indulgent offering to the Nature Valley brand, but with just 9 grams of sugar per serving. 
Retail sales for Fiber One bars were down double digits in the second quarter consistent with the decline in the adult segment of the bars category. As you may recall, Fiber One was the first brand to do the seemingly impossible made fiber taste good. And we're making it taste even better with new layered bars that contain crisp grains, caramel and almond toppings and chocolate and 9 grams of fiber per bar. 
On Lärabar, retail sales were up more than 50% in the second quarter. In the back half, we're expanding Lärabar's offerings with the line of new fruits and grains bars. Each bar contains 1/4 cup of kale or spinach, giving Lärabar consumers 
The nutrition they're looking for in just 5 simple ingredients per bar. 
Refrigerated dough and soup round out our largest 5 categories in the U.S. and we're supporting these businesses with consumer news in the second half. We'll be adding marketing support to Pillsbury refrigerated dough and we have some news coming for each of the 2. With our new shelf set of [indiscernible] cans, we continue to expand across retailers. 
Our performance on Progresso soup wasn't where we wanted to be the second quarter, as we experienced heightened competitive activity and an unusually warn weather. But winter is certainly here now, and we're ramping up our messaging behind our antibiotic-free chicken news. 
As I mentioned earlier, we saw good results in our other categories in the U.S. Retail and we'll build on that momentum in the second half. Old El Paso has been generating growth within our meals platform in recent years. Consumer First innovation, including new flavors and formats of Stand 'N Stuff shells and tortillas drove retail sales up 6% in the quarter. 
Innovation is also working for Totino's Hot Snacks with retail sales up 6% in the quarter. We saw a particularly good performance on pizza sticks, which were launched in the first quarter. And we'll introduce larger count sizes next month. We think this is a great example of knowing our consumer and reaching them with relevant products and messaging. 
The Annie's brand continues to lead our growth in Natural & Organic. Retail sales for the brand grew 46% in the second quarter. And our points of distribution are up more than 30% year-to-date in Nielsen-measured channels alone. Retail sales for Annie's established items like snacks and Mac and Cheese grew 20% in the quarter. And we continue to build distribution on our category expansions in cereals, yogurt, soup, baked goods and grain snacks. 
Next month, we'll introduce Annie's organic ready-to-eat popcorn. With the strength of this great brand, as well as the performance of our other terrific Natural & Organic brands, we are well on our way to meeting our goal of $1 billion in net sales for our Natural & Organic portfolio by 2019. 
So as we look through the second half, we have plans in place to drive improvement for our U.S. Retail businesses. We're optimizing our marketing support across our 5 largest categories. We'll continue to build on what's working by investing behind in our Natural & Organic businesses as well as Old El Paso and Totino's. We have a solid lineup of new products that are aligned with growing areas of consumer interest. And we'll continue to drive margin expansion for U.S. Retail, building on the improvement we posted in the first half. 
Let me turn briefly to our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment. As Don mentioned, net sales declined in the quarter driven, in large part, by negative impact of flour pricing. However, our Focus 6 platforms posted net sales growth, led by our yogurt platform with net sales gains for Yoplait Parfait Pro and increased cereals sales in schools. 
In the second half, we expect continued goods -- continued good growth from our Focus 6 platforms and to reduce headwind from our flour index pricing. 
We'll also bring more innovation to Foodservice customers with new artisan breads designed for K-12 schools. This includes presliced, premium quality ciabatta breads and flat panini breads that allow operators to make hot sandwiches with reduced flavor and without additional equipment. In total, these efforts should result in improved topline performance for this segment in second half. 
Now let's turn to our International segment. Sales in our developed markets were mixed in the second quarter. Retail sales for Old El Paso were up high single digits in Canada behind Stand 'N Stuff taco shell innovation. In Europe, we posted high single digit retail sales declines on yogurt, high single digit growth for wholesome snacks and high teens growth for Häagen-Dazs led by stick bars. 
In the second half, we'll build on what's working  in developed markets and also bring new product news to our categories. Our Old El Paso Stand 'N Stuff business has been a good growth driver in recent years. And we recently launched a mini shell variety in Europe. And we're expanding up successful Häagen-Dazs stick bars into new European markets and adding new flavors to the line. 
On yogurt, we're focusing on improving our in-store execution and closing distribution gaps. We're also entering the fast-growing in Belgian segment with our new Triple Sensations line. 
In Canada, we're launching Yoplait whole milk yogurt that has all family appeal and will drive growth on our expanding Natural & Organic business with the addition of items like Lärabar bites. 
China is our largest emerging market and we saw a good second quarter net sales growth there on Häagen-Dazs, Wanchai Ferry and Yoplait. Our Yoplait yogurt business continues to grow in Shanghai. And we're gaining a foothold in Beijing, which we entered this summer. As Don mentioned, our results were partially offset by our snack restructuring in China, which was a headwind to sales, but will be slightly accretive to underlying profit. 
And in the EMEA region, Häagen-Dazs stick bars launched in the first quarter are performing well. 
In the second half in China, we're launching a new Wanchai Ferry's kids line in time for the Chinese New Year. These dumplings come in colorful wrappers at a smaller size for kids and have nutritional ingredients like pork, salmon and shrimp that appeal to moms. 
On Häagen-Dazs, we're launching new fruit and flowers ice cream flavors like rose and rasberry and elderflower and blackcurrant that deliver a sweet aromatic experience. 
In EMEA, we'll continue to drive growth on Häagen-Dazs with new flavors of stick bars in our core client business. And we're launching frozen yogurt across multiple markets following its success in China. 
For our International segment in total, we expect our underlying topline trend to improve in the back half. And we're planning for operating margin expansion as transaction currency headwinds moderate. 
And now I'll turn it back to Ken for some closing remarks."

So thank you, Jeff, and let me just summarize our comments this morning.

Our organic sales results didn't meet our expectation this quarter, so we're adding support in launching a solid lineup of new products to strengthen the second half. 
We delivered strong margin expansion and good EPS growth in the second quarter. And our HMM and other cost-savings efforts keep us on track to deliver our fiscal '18 goal of a 20% adjusted operating profit margin. 
And we updated our full year growth goals to reflect a softer topline, but we're maintaining our EPS guidance and increasing our free cash flow growth target as we continue to drive operational efficiency across our businesses. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you can open the line for questions."

I mean, it's been -- as we look at the environment, which has been slower growth across consumer industries and listen pretty carefully to our investor people who hold our stock, I mean, there really has been a very, very high interest in margin in this environment. And so we felt it was important to make it clear that we've heard of that interest, and it was helpful externally. But I'll also tell you very helpful internally for us to set a very clear and important goal. I also want to tell you that the actions that are taken to achieve that have been highly positive for General Mills. And so the work that we've done over the last several years to optimize our supply chain, getting the right capacity in the right place has been extremely beneficial to the company for the long term. The base that's there now is very highly utilized, the actions that we've taken. In fact, as we said a number of times, open the door to kind of a second wave of productivity initiatives as those plants are highly utilized. So that's been extremely positive for General Mills. And the work we've done on the administrative structure just to got a lighter structure, the work that we just announced to optimize and structure for global growth with North American segment kind of Europe developed marketing segment, Asia, that segment. These are really designed enough for executional efficiency, better sharing, they're just way more efficient. So I understand the question, but I would just say that the work that we've done, and we put in place to achieve these stronger margin goals as I would say overall been very highly positive for General Mills and sets us up very well for the future. Obviously, margin and free cash flow, very important metrics for us. We talked about them repeatedly top line, of course, is also super important.

And at different points in our history, we've pulled those at different strengths based on what the market can bear. And as we looked at the market over the past couple of years, at least for the near term, with less available top line growth, we want to make sure that we're still getting [ph] competitive return for our shareholders, and that meant grow the margins. That was kind of one input. The other is that setting a target -- and Ken kind of touched on this, it does makes you think differently. And it's brought to bear more ideas in terms of where we can find efficiencies, and we've got in through our P&L and our balance sheet. And as a result, it's creating flex for us to reinvest back in our business. And I think those are all good things.

So that will change the complexity of our working capital in the balance of the year. The other is our trade and advertising accruals. As we've said, our media, our trade was down in the first half even a bit more than we had planned and anticipated.

And the last thing, the one that's the most, I guess, sustainable that will carry forward into F '18 as well is our focus on core working capital. Inventory was a bit higher than we wanted to be at the end of the second quarter, and that's because volumes did not come in as anticipated. That will even out in the -- come down as the year unfolds. And then most importantly, as we continue to work on our payables and as we move our vendors to [indiscernible] terms, we'll see that benefit start to creep more in the second half, and again, more in the '18 as well. So it's all on working capital and those 3 big items, the tax payable on the Green Giant divestiture a year ago that we're rolling over; the level of advertising and trade payables that will increase as the year goes on, as we increase investments in those 2 areas; and then the core -- continue to work on reducing core working capital."

We think it will be up closer to 200 basis points in the back half of the year. So at full year, we'll be below our original 150 guidance, probably more in the 100 to 120 range. But it will improve in the back half for some substantial reasons. First off, we'll get better volume leverage as we see improved sales in the back half, which is primarily from volume, so our gross margin will benefit from that. The comps from last year, if you look at our trend last year, our gross margin expansion was essentially all in the first half, and that was due to inflation phasing, where inflation accelerated during the course of F '16. Last year, gross margins were up 170 basis points in the first half. It was actually about flat in the second half, and actually Q3 was down 130 basis points. So again, I think that gross margin expansion this year on a comparable basis will skew to Q4. To your specific question on inflation, we think it's fairly stable through the course of the year, slight deceleration in the back half and the fourth quarter. And obviously, we'll see pretty steady contributions from HMM exceeding that inflation. Our cost actions will build during the course of the year. That will help the gross margin in the back half. And then transaction FX, which, for the full year will be about a $50 million drag for us. But $35 million of that is in the first half, as I said in my comments. The pound will continue to impact us in the back half, but we think the Canadian dollar will be less so. So we've absorbed the majority of the transaction FX negative in the first half, so there'll be less of a drag in the second. So really those 4 things: the volume leverage that we'll get in the second slightly better than the first half; the comps, particularly around inflation phasing will favor the back half this year, again especially the fourth quarter; our cost actions will build around Project Century benefits; and then transaction FX, still a negative but a lighter negative in the back half."

But from an advertising standpoint, in the back half of the year, we said in the last call we expect advertising after the first quarter will be down double digits for the year. We still believe that'll probably be mid-teens, which means it will be better in the back half. Still down slightly, but importantly, up in some key businesses. As a matter of fact, if you look at our growth businesses in the back half, excluding U.S. Yogurt -- which we've always said we're going to really rightsize our investment there and given how are historical share of voice, excluding U.S. yogurt, our growth businesses, advertising investment, media investment will be up low single digits in the back half. Again, fairly spread across the businesses that Jeff talked to. So we'll see that in the back half. And actually, our admin continues to be below last year, both at the -- within SOP and then on the corporate level as well, so that's actually a contributor. Obviously, what's different is the sales are lower and volume is lower than we started the year, and that's an offset. So again, I don't exactly follow your math, but we expect to get our 150 basis points of operating margin expansion. We'll get a good piece of that, as you noted, through gross margin, and we'll get the balance through the rest of the P&L.

We've got really good innovation at Häagen-Dazs, good innovation on Old El Paso, and we continue to expand our Bars business. So -- and the integration of our Yoplait business with our European business will be largely behind us, so we expect improved performance from there. So I would say, in the second half, you'll see that. But I also want to mention that what we see is that our 2 largest developing markets, China and Brazil, have returned to growth, if you look at organic growth. They're somehow -- they're a little bit clouded by some restructuring we're doing of our Snacks business in China and of our acquisitions of Yogurt in Brazil.

Well, thanks, Jeff, and good morning to one and all. I'll cover the key headlines for the second quarter. 
First, we feel good about the margin expansion progress and EPS growth we delivered in the quarter. And we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver on our goal of a 20% operating margin by fiscal '18. 
We remain committed to our Consumer First strategy and where we're getting the ideas right, it's driving growth, whether that's Annie's and Lärabar in the U.S., Häagen-Dazs outside North America, or Old El Paso around the world. 
Even so, our net sales performance did not meet our expectations in the second quarter. We didn't have enough marketing support, meaning the combination of trade, media and new product news, to drive improved top line results. And on top of that, we saw a slowdown in food industry growth in the U.S. in recent periods. 
So we're making targeted adjustments to our plans in the back half to find the right balance of investment and return while still driving significant margin expansion. Jeff Harmening will take you through more details on our second half business plans in a moment. 
As a result of our sales trend, we're revising down our expectations for full year net sales and segment operating profit. But we remain on track to deliver our EPS and margin expansion guidance. And we're increasing our free cash flow growth expectations, thanks to continued good financial discipline. 
Finally, we announced an important change to our organizational structure earlier this month. This change represents a significant step towards operating as a global company, allowing us to unlock global growth opportunities while continuing to drive efficiency and increase agility in our organization. 
So with that, let me turn things over to Don to provide more detail on our financial performance."
274715,411442461,1104020,"General Mills, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2016",2016-12-20,"Earnings Calls","General Mills, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ken, and good morning to everyone. With that as a backdrop, let me get into the numbers, provide a summary of our cost-savings efforts and give you some more details on our updated guidance. Slide 6 summarizes our second quarter fiscal '17 finan",1800,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning to everyone. With that as a backdrop, let me get into the numbers, provide a summary of our cost-savings efforts and give you some more details on our updated guidance. 
Slide 6 summarizes our second quarter fiscal '17 financial results. Net sales totaled $4.1 billion, down 7% as reported. Organic net sales declined 4%. Total segment operating profit totaled $830 million, comparable to last year on a constant currency basis. Net earnings decreased 9% to $482 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.80 as reported. 
Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability was $0.85. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 5% compared to last year's results. 
Slide 7 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales declined 4% in the quarter, driven by 7 points of lower organic pound volume growth, partially offset by 3 points of positive sales mix and net price realization. Foreign currency translation didn't have a material impact on net sales this quarter. And the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced sales growth by 3 points in the quarter. 
Turning to segment results. Total U.S. Retail net sales declined 9%, with growth in snacks offset by declines in the other operating units. Organic net sales were down 6% in the quarter. The difference between reported and organic net sales primarily reflects the divestiture of Green Giant, which impacts the meals unit results. Segment operating profit grew 2% versus last year with benefits from our margin expansion initiatives more than offsetting lower volumes. 
In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, net sales declined 4% in the second quarter. This segment's Focus 6 platforms returned to growth with net sales up 2%, driven by growth in cereal, yogurt, snacks, mixes and biscuits. As we expected, net sales declined 10% on our non-Focus 6 businesses in the quarter, primarily due to market index pricing on bakery flour. We expect headwinds from flour index pricing, which impacts sales, with a profit neutral, to lessen significantly in the second half. For the second quarter, segment operating profit was up 6%, driven by benefit from cost-savings initiatives, lower input costs, favorable product mix and higher grain merchandising rates. 
Slide 10 summarizes our constant currency net sales and profit results for our International segment. Total International organic net sales declined 1% in the second quarter. At the region level, second quarter constant currency net sales in the Asia Pacific region were comparable to last year, with double-digit growth in India offset by the restructuring of our Snacks business in China, which we announced last quarter. This action will continue to be a headwind to sales growth through the first quarter of fiscal '18. Excluding snacks, net sales for the rest of our China business were up mid-single digits in the quarter. Latin American sales declined 2% in constant currency in the second quarter, reflecting the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Organic net sales in the region were up low single digits. 
In Europe, constant currency net sales were down 3%, with declines in yogurt offsetting growth for Häagen-Dazs and Old El Paso. 
In Canada, sales were down 7% in constant currency, almost entirely due to the divestiture of Green Giant. 
Constant currency International operating profit declined 18% in the quarter due to currency-driven inflation on products imported into Canada and the U.K. While we expect further headwinds from the British pound in the second half, the Canadian dollar impact should moderate significantly. 
Turning to joint venture results on Slide 11. CPW net sales grew 3% in constant currency with broad growth across the Middle East, Asia, the U.K. and Australia. Häagen-Dazs Japan constant currency net sales increased 21% due to strong new seasonal product performance and double-digit growth in handheld treats. Combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $30 million in the second quarter, up 27% in constant currency, primarily driven by strong sales growth as well as lower administrative costs for CPW and lower input costs for Häagen-Dazs Japan. 
As Ken said, we made good progress on our margin expansion goals in the second quarter. Adjusted gross margins were up 130 basis points with benefits from Holistic Margin Management and our other cost-savings initiatives more than offsetting lower input cost inflation. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of goods sold HMM savings to more than offset our expectation of 2% inflation. 
Adjusted operating profit margins increased 160 basis points in the quarter, slightly ahead of our full year goal. 
Slide 13 summarizes other noteworthy income statement items in the quarter. We incurred $53 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter, included $24 million reported in cost of sales. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, decreased $18 million. Net interest expense increased 2% from the prior year. We continue to expect full year interest expense will be flat to last year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.8% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 32.4% compared to 32.3% last year. We now expect our full year tax rate will be roughly in line with the year-ago rate of 29.8%. And average diluted shares outstanding declined 2% in the quarter. We now expect a 2% reduction for the full year compared to our previous guidance of down 1% to 2%. 
Turning to our first half financial performance. Net sales of $8 billion were down 7% as reported and down 4% on an organic basis. Segment operating profit declined 2% in constant currency. And adjusted diluted EPS was up 1% as reported and up 2% in constant currency. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 15 shows our further progress on core working capital. Our core working capital decreased 20% versus a year ago, and we continue to drive operational improvements across our business. This is the 15th consecutive quarter that we've reduced core working capital. And we have visibility to further reductions in the coming quarters by continued efforts to improve -- improvements in payables. As a result, we're raising our fiscal '17 guidance on free cash flow growth from mid-single digits to high single digits. 
First half operating cash flow was $988 million, down 15% from a year ago, largely driven by timing of trade and advertising accruals and taxes payable related to the Green Giant divestiture last year. 
Year-to-date capital investments totaled $318 million. And through the first half of the year, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases. 
As Ken mentioned, we're taking another step toward operating as a global company by changing our reporting structure to maximize our global scale, unlock global growth opportunities and continue to drive efficiency. We've established 4 new business groups: North America Retail, which combines our current U.S. Retail segment and our Canada region in our International segment; Europe and Australia, which is currently another International region; Asia and Latin America, which combines the remaining 2 current International regions; and Convenience Stores and Foodservice. As part of this change, we anticipate eliminating 400 to 600 positions worldwide, which we estimate will drive savings of $70 million to $90 million by fiscal '18. 
We intend to begin reporting results under this new structure in the third quarter, and we'll provide restated historical data at that time. This announcement is the latest in a series of significant actions we've taken since fiscal '15 to streamline our structure and drive savings. 
As always, HMM is at the center of this effort and continues to deliver significant savings in our cost of goods. In fact, between fiscal '15 and fiscal '17, HMM will generate more than $1.2 billion in cost of goods sold savings, which keeps us on track to achieve our target of $4 billion of savings from HMM this decade. 
We've announced additional projects since fiscal '15 to improve our organizational effectiveness while delivering incremental cost savings. As part of our initiative to streamline our global supply chain network, we will have closed 11 plants by fiscal '18, or 17% of our 2014 factory base. Including those plant closures as well as Projects Catalyst, Compass and our new global reorganization, we'll have reduced approximately 5,000 positions by fiscal '18, or roughly 12% of our global headcount. And we continue to reduce our administrative expenses and drive incremental savings through our implementation of zero-based budgeting. We estimate these projects will drive $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal '18 above and beyond HMM. 
We're progressing well on our goal to 20% adjusted operating profit margins by fiscal '18, which represents more than 300 basis points improvement over fiscal '16 levels. We continue to expect this margin expansion to come from 3 areas. First, a fiscal '17 COGS HMM savings, net of inflation, still makes up about 25% of our goal. At our Investor Day in July, we said the other 2 buckets were split roughly equally. 
Now that we've provided visibility to our global reorganization, you can see that savings from our announced projects represent fully half of our margin expansion goal. The remaining 25% will come primarily from strategic revenue management, spending optimization efforts and other cost efficiency initiatives. 
So let me finish with our second half expectations and full year outlook. We expect modest improvement in organic net sales growth in the second half as we adjust our levels of support and continue to invest in Consumer First news that is working. We expect to deliver significant adjusted operating profit margin expansion thanks to our cost-savings efforts. And that, in turn, will help drive double-digit growth in adjusted diluted EPS in the second half. 
Finally, we expect to accelerate our free cash flow growth behind further improvements in our core working capital. 
I'll close my section by summarizing our updated fiscal '17 guidance, which you can find on Slide 21. Given our first half performance, we now expect full year organic net sales to be down 3% to 4%. As a result, we're now targeting total segment operating profit growth of 2% to 4% on a constant currency basis versus the prior guidance of 6% to 8% growth. We continue to expect adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 150 basis points. 
As I mentioned previously, we expect interest expense and our adjusted tax rate will be flat to last year. And we anticipate average diluted shares will decline 2%. We continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS will be up between 6% and 8% in constant currency. We now expect foreign currency translation will be a $0.01 headwind to full year diluted EPS results. 
Finally, we're increasing our free cash flow guidance from mid-single-digit growth to high single-digit growth, reflecting continued strong core working capital discipline. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff."

As Don mentioned, we posted organic net sales declines in the quarter, with our growth and foundation businesses down 3% and 8%, respectively. 
In some businesses, we met our expectations and in others, we fell short. We didn't deliver the top line improvement we were expecting from the U.S. Retail in the second quarter, with organic sales finishing down 6%. On the other hand, margin delivery was strong with U.S. Retail operating profit margins up 270 basis points to 24.4%. 
We also expected better net sales performance for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, and we met that expectation with our Focus 6 platforms returning to growth this quarter. 
Within our International segment, we expected improved organic net sales performance. We saw top line improvement in Europe and in China, offset by a slowdown in Canada, leaving the total segment organic net sales growth in line with our first quarter results. 
Let me describe in more detail the drivers of our second quarter performance and discuss our operating plans for the second half of this year, starting with U.S. Retail. 
The operating environment here in the U.S. remains challenging. As you can see on Slide 24, the industry has experienced a slowdown in retail sales growth, including a decline in the most recent quarter as benefits from pricing have eroded and unit volume has remained weak. In our categories, average unit prices were up 3% last quarter, but volume softness drove overall category retail sales down 1%. 
For our business, it was our 5 largest categories: Cereal, yogurt, snack bars, refrigerated dough and soup, that fell short of expectations. As Ken told you upfront, we did not have enough marketing support in the form of trade and consumer spending and new product news to deliver the improvement we were looking for. We also saw a bit more competitive activity in some of these categories in the quarter. 
In our other categories, our results were actually a bit better than our expectations, led by Old El Paso Mexican foods, Totino's hot snacks and our Natural & Organic portfolio. 
We're adding back some support in the second half, but we will remain disciplined in our spending. We still believe prioritized investment against the best growth opportunities, while continuing to drive margin expansion, is the right thing to do for the long-term health of our business. 
Retail sales for our Cereal brands were down 3% in the quarter. Where we had compelling Consumer First messaging, we saw good consumer response. For example, our gluten-free Cheerios news and removal of artificial ingredients continue to drive growth in baseline or full price sales. And consumers still love great-tasting cereals. More cocoa in Cocoa Puffs is driving double-digit retail sales growth for this brand. And more cinnamon news continued to drive good performance on Cinnamon Toast Crunch. 
But overall, we didn't get the quality of merchandising we expected, and we didn't have enough marketing pressure to drive better results for our business in the quarter. 
In the second half, we're adding incremental consumer spending to support news that's working, like gluten-free Cheerios and the removal of artificial ingredients. We'll also improve our in-store execution, and we're securing better merchandising events with key retailers on some of our largest established brands. In total, we expect to continue to drive positive net price realization for our Cereal business in the back half of the year. 
New products will also contribute to improved second half performance. We're bringing the taste of real fruit to Cheerios with the new Very Berry variety. It contains strawberries, blueberries and raspberries with no artificial colors or flavors. And of course, it's gluten-free. Watch for it in stores beginning next month. 
On yogurt, we continue to see challenging performance in the second quarter, with retail sales down 18%, and our Light and Greek 100 varieties driving the majority of those declines. Retail sales for the yogurt category also turned negative in the quarter as elevated levels of merchandising generated less incremental lift and as the level of new products news slowed. On a more positive note, we're seeing good initial consumer response to our Annie's and Liberté organic yogurts that we launched in the first quarter. 
As we enter the second half, we'll build on our first half yogurt news. Together, the Annie's and Liberté brands already hold an 8% share of the organic yogurt segment. We expect these brands to have a more significant impact on our second half performance as we continue to expand distribution. 
We also have renovated our yogurt offerings in the first half, improving the value proposition with larger counts of individual tubes. Where we're getting the price right with retailers, it is performing quite well, so we'll look to expand that success in the remainder of the year. 
We're also introducing new and renovated yogurt offerings in the second half that squarely meet consumer needs. Our renovated Greek 100 protein line appeals to consumers looking for a higher amount of protein for just 100 calories. It's made with real fruit and has a delicious thick texture that we think consumers will prefer. 
Yoplait Dippers combined creamy Greek yogurt with the crunch of pretzels or Oat Bites. They offer spoon-free snacking and are a perfect afternoon pick-me-up. And Yoplait Custard Yogurt is a silky smooth indulgent snack or dessert made with whole milk and just a few other simple ingredients. 
We know we have a good deal of work to do to turn around our yogurt business. We expect some improvement in the second half, but won't return to growth this year. We believe the key to success will be fundamentally shifting our portfolio through renovation and innovation to give consumers what they want from their yogurt. That's the essence of Consumer First. The product news I just shared will help us make important strides toward that goal in the second half of this year. And we have a great pipeline of innovation, including an exciting launch in early fiscal '18, that should help build a strong foundation for the future. 
On snack bars, Nature Valley retail sales were down 3% in the second quarter, so we're adding some incremental media support in the back half, and we have a good lineup of new launches. We're expanding our successful Biscuit sandwiches with a cocoa almond butter variety. We're launching new XL Sweet & Salty bars that are 50% bigger, developed with men in mind. And we're very excited about our new Granola Cups, which feature a crunchy whole grain shell filled with peanut or almond butter. They add an indulgent offering to the Nature Valley brand, but with just 9 grams of sugar per serving. 
Retail sales for Fiber One bars were down double digits in the second quarter, consistent with the decline in the adult segment of the bars category. As you may recall, Fiber One was the first brand to do the seemingly impossible: make fiber taste good. And we're making it taste even better with new layered bars that contain crisp grains, caramel and almond toppings in chocolate and 9 grams of fiber per bar. 
On Lärabar, retail sales were up more than 50% in the second quarter. In the back half, we're expanding Lärabar's offerings with a line of new fruits and grains bars. Each bar contains 1/4 cup of kale or spinach, giving Lärabar consumers the nutrition they're looking for in just 5 simple ingredients per bar. 
Refrigerated dough and soup round out our largest 5 categories in the U.S, and we're supporting these businesses with consumer news in the second half. We'll be adding marketing support to Pillsbury refrigerated dough and we have some news coming for Easter, too. And with our new shelf set of stand-up cans, we continue to expand across retailers. 
Our performance on Progresso soup wasn't where we wanted it to be the second quarter, as we experienced heightened competitive activity and unusually warn weather. But winter is certainly here now, and we're ramping up our messaging behind our antibiotic-free chicken news. 
As I mentioned earlier, we saw good results in our other categories in the U.S. Retail and we'll build on that momentum in the second half. Old El Paso has been generating growth within our meals platform in recent years. Consumer First innovation, including new flavors and formats of Stand 'N Stuff shells and tortillas, drove retail sales up 6% in the quarter. 
Innovation is also working for Totino's Hot Snacks, with retail sales up 6% in the quarter. We saw particularly good performance on Pizza Sticks, which were launched in the first quarter, and we'll introduce larger count sizes next month. We think this is a great example of knowing our consumer and reaching them with relevant products and messaging. 
The Annie's brand continues to lead our growth in Natural & Organic. Retail sales for the brand grew 46% in the second quarter, and our points of distribution are up more than 30% year-to-date in Nielsen-measured channels alone. Retail sales for Annie's established items like snacks and mac and cheese grew 20% in the quarter. And we continue to build distribution on our category expansions in cereals, yogurt, soup, baked goods and grain snacks. 
Next month, we'll introduce Annie's organic ready-to-eat popcorn. With the strength of this great brand, as well as the performance of our other terrific Natural & Organic brands, we are well on our way to meeting our goal of $1 billion in net sales for our Natural & Organic portfolio by 2019. 
So as we look to the second half, we have plans in place to drive improvement for our U.S. Retail businesses. We're optimizing our marketing support across our 5 largest categories, we'll continue to build on what's working by investing behind our Natural & Organic businesses as well as Old El Paso and Totino's, we have a solid lineup of new products that are aligned with growing areas of consumer interest and we'll continue to drive margin expansion for U.S. Retail, building on the improvement we posted in the first half. 
Let me turn briefly to our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment. As Don mentioned, net sales declined in the quarter, driven in large part by a negative impact of flour pricing. However, our Focus 6 platforms posted net sales growth, led by our yogurt platform, with net sales gains for Yoplait Parfait Pro and increased cereals sales in schools. 
In the second half, we expect continued goods -- continued good growth from our Focus 6 platforms and a reduced headwind from our flour index pricing. 
We'll also bring more innovation to Foodservice customers with new artisan breads designed for K-12 schools. This includes presliced, premium quality ciabatta breads and flat panini breads that allow operators to make hot sandwiches with reduced labor and without additional equipment. In total, these efforts should result in improved top line performance for this segment in second half. 
Now let's turn to our International segment. Sales in our developed markets were mixed in the second quarter. Retail sales for Old El Paso were up high single digits in Canada behind Stand 'N Stuff taco shell innovation. In Europe, we posted high single digit retail sales declines on yogurt, high single digit growth for wholesome snacks and high teens growth for Häagen-Dazs, led by stick bars. 
In the second half, we'll build on what's working in developed markets and also bring new product news to our categories. Our Old El Paso Stand 'N Stuff business has been a good growth driver in recent years, and we've recently launched a mini shell variety in Europe. And we're expanding our successful Häagen-Dazs stick bars into new European markets and adding new flavors to the line. 
On yogurt, we're focusing on improving our in-store execution and closing distribution gaps. We're also entering the fast-growing indulgence segment with our new Triple Sensations line. 
In Canada, we're launching Yoplait whole milk yogurt that has all family appeal, and we'll drive growth on our expanding Natural & Organic business with the addition of items like Lärabar bites. 
China is our largest emerging market, and we saw good second quarter net sales growth there on Häagen-Dazs, Wanchai Ferry and Yoplait. Our Yoplait yogurt business continued to grow in Shanghai, and we're gaining a foothold in Beijing, which we entered this summer. As Don mentioned, our results were partially offset by our Snacks restructuring in China, which was a headwind to sales, but will be slightly accretive to underlying profit. 
And in the EMEA region, Häagen-Dazs stick bars launched in the first quarter and are performing well. 
In the second half, in China, we're launching a new Wanchai Ferry's kids line in time for the Chinese New Year. These dumplings come in colorful wrappers, are a smaller size for kids and have nutritional ingredients like pork, salmon and shrimp that appeal to moms. 
On Häagen-Dazs, we're launching new fruit and flowers ice cream flavors like rose and raspberry and elderflower and blackcurrant that deliver a sweet, aromatic experience. 
In EMEA, we'll continue to drive growth on Häagen-Dazs with new flavors of stick bars in our core client business, and we're launching frozen yogurt across multiple markets following its success in China. 
For our International segment in total, we expect our underlying top line trend to improve in the back half, and we're planning for operating margin expansion as transaction currency headwinds moderate.

So thank you, Jeff, and let me just summarize our comments this morning. We continue to take a disciplined approach to the top line, focusing our investments behind our highest returning Consumer First ideas and eliminating activities that are not generating profitable volume. 
Our organic sales results didn't meet our expectations this quarter, so we're adding support and launching a solid lineup of new products to strengthen the second half. 
We delivered strong margin expansion and good EPS growth in the second quarter, and our HMM and other cost-savings efforts keep us on track to deliver our fiscal '18 goal of a 20% adjusted operating profit margin. 
And we updated our full year growth goals to reflect a softer top line, but we're maintaining our EPS guidance and increasing our free cash flow growth target as we continue to drive operational efficiency across our businesses. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you can open the line for questions."

But can you give us a sense of comfort that the strategy for this year and for next year -- that you're not cutting too far to the bone or that there's not going to be a bigger reinvestment in '18 to kind of make up for what's been lost in the first couple of quarters?"

Having said that, as we look back at the first quarter, we think there are cases where we cut too far or reduced spending too much in certain areas. And so we're going to add back and correct as we go forward in the second half. And I think you heard Jeff comment on some of the areas where we're going to do that.

I'm just trying to get a sense of having a specific margin target out there. And I understand what drove the thinking around putting a target out there when you did, but we're in a bit of a different environment now, I think. And does that maybe limit you in what you may feel you need to do from a reinvestment perspective just to get the top line to stabilize?

I mean, it's been -- as we look at the environment, which has been slower growth across consumer industries, and listen pretty carefully to our investors, people who hold our stock, I mean, there really has been a very, very high interest in margin in this environment. And so we felt it was important to make it clear that we've heard of that interest, and it was helpful externally. But I will also tell you very helpful internally for us to set a very clear and important goal. I also want to tell you that the actions that we've taken to achieve that have been highly positive for General Mills. And so the work that we've done over the last several years to optimize our supply chain, getting the right capacity in the right place, has been extremely beneficial to the company for the long term. The base that's there now is very highly utilized. The actions that we've taken, in fact, as we've said a number of times, opened the door to kind of a second wave of productivity initiatives as those plants are highly utilized. So that's been extremely positive for General Mills. And the work we've done on the administrative structure, just to get a lighter structure, the work that we just announced to optimize and structure for global growth with a North American segment, kind of a Europe developed marketing segment, Asia, that segment. These are really designed now for executional efficiency, better sharing, they're just way more efficient. So I understand the question, but I would just say that the work that we've done and that we put in place to achieve these stronger margin goals has, I would say, overall been very highly positive for General Mills and sets us up very well for the future. Obviously, margin and free cash flow, very important metrics for us. We talk about them repeatedly. Top line, of course, is also super important.

But I think it's important to understand that as we look at our business, there's different levers we can pull to drive shareholder return. Sales growth is clearly the one that has the longest term benefit and where our focus is. But there's clearly margin expansion, there's cash conversion and cash return to shareholders. And at different points in our history, we've pulled those at different strengths based on what the market could bear. And as we looked at the market over the past couple of years, at least for the near term, with less available top line growth, we wanted to make sure that we were still delivering a competitive return for our shareholders, and that meant more on the margins. That was kind of one input. The other is that setting a target -- and Ken kind of touched on this, it does makes you think differently. And it's brought to bear more ideas in terms of where we can find efficiencies, and we've done it throughout our P&L and our balance sheet. And as a result, it's creating flex for us to reinvest back in our business. And I think those are all good things.

There's actually 3 things and they really all revolve around working capital. The first is, a year ago, we had a big payable from the Green Giant sale that hit our operating cash flow even though the, obviously, the cash that came out was -- or cash that came in was in the financing section -- or in the investment section, excuse me. So we had a large liability that will not, obviously, reoccur this year. So that was $160 million, I believe, in the -- at this point last year. So that will change the complexion of our working capital in the balance of the year. The other is our trade and advertising accruals. As we've said, our media, our trade was down in the first half even a bit more than we had planned and anticipated. As we reinvest more in the back half, those accruals will come up, again favorably impacting working capital. And the last thing, the one that's the most, I guess, sustainable that will carry forward into F '18 as well is our focus on core working capital. Inventory was a bit higher than we wanted it to be at the end of the second quarter, and that's because volumes did not come in as anticipated. That will even out and come down as the year unfolds. And then most importantly, as we continue to work on our payables and as we move our vendors to 90-day terms, we'll see that benefit start to accrete more in the second half, and again, more in '18 as well. So it's all in our working capital and it's those 3 big items, the tax payable on the Green Giant divestiture a year ago that we're rolling over, the level of advertising and trade payables that will increase as the year goes on as we increase investments in those 2 areas and then -- and in the core -- our continued work on reducing core working capital."

What I would say is that the competitive atmosphere is dynamic, and what you'll see from us is making sure we're make adjustments of those plans as we go along, which is what we're doing in the back half. So even though we get a lot of things right, some of the things we tactically need to adjust, and that's what you're seeing us do in the back half of this year. So as time goes on, we're dedicated to it. But I would say that we've analyzed deeply the second quarter, and we've already made some changes even from the end of our second quarter, which was the end of November, until today. So I think what you'll see from us is making sure that while we remain dedicated strategically to net revenue management and optimizing our profitable volume, we'll make adjustments as time goes along and as we see the competitive dynamics change."

We think it will be up closer to 200 basis points in the back half of the year. So at full year, we'll be below our original 150 guidance, probably more in the 100 to 120 range. But it will improve in the back half for some substantial reasons. First off, we'll get better volume leverage as we see improved sales in the back half, which is primarily from volume, so our gross margin will benefit from that. The comps from last year, if you look at our trend last year, our gross margin expansion was essentially all in the first half, and that was due to inflation phasing, where inflation accelerated during the course of F '16. Last year, gross margins were up 170 basis points in the first half. It was actually about flat in the second half, and actually Q3 was down 130 basis points. So again, I think that gross margin expansion this year on a comparable basis will skew to Q4. To your specific question on inflation, we think it's fairly stable through the course of the year, a slight deceleration in the back half and the fourth quarter. And obviously, we'll see pretty steady contributions from HMM exceeding that inflation. Our cost actions will build during the course of the year. That will help gross margin in the back half. And then transaction FX, which, for the full year will be about a $50 million drag for us. But $35 million of that is in the first half, as I said in my comments. The pound will continue to impact us in the back half, but we think the Canadian dollar will be less so. So we've absorbed the majority of the transaction FX negative in the first half, so that'll be less of a drag in the second. So really those 4 things: the volume leverage that we'll get in the second half slightly better than the first half; the comps, particularly around inflation phasing will favor the back half of this year, again, especially in the fourth quarter; our cost actions will build around Project Century benefits; and then transaction FX, still a negative but a lighter negative in the back half."

But from an advertising standpoint, in the back half of the year, we said in the last call we expect advertising after the first quarter will be down double digits for the year. We still believe that, probably mid-teens, which means it will be better in the back half. Still down slightly, but importantly, up in some key businesses. As a matter of fact, if you look at our growth businesses in the back half, excluding U.S. Yogurt, which we've always said we're going to really rightsize our investment there, given our historical share of voice, excluding U.S. yogurt, our growth businesses, advertising investment, media investment will be up low single digits in the back half. Again, fairly spread across the businesses that Jeff talked to. So we'll see that in the back half. And actually, our admin continues to be below last year, both at the -- within SOP and then on the corporate level as well, so that's actually a contributor. Obviously, what's different is that sales are lower and volume is lower than we started the year, and that's an offset. So again, I didn't exactly follow your math, but we expect to get our 150 basis points of operating margin expansion. We'll get a good piece of that, as you noted, through gross margin, and we'll get the balance through the rest of the P&L.

We've got really good innovation on Häagen-Dazs, good innovation on Old El Paso, and we continue to expand our bars business. So -- and the integration of our Yoplait business with our European business will be largely behind us, so we expect improved performance from there. So I would say, in the second half, you'll see that. But I also want to mention that what we see is that our 2 largest developing markets, China and Brazil, have returned to growth, if you look at organic growth. They're somehow -- they're a little bit clouded by some restructuring we've been doing of our Snacks business in China and of our acquisition of Yogurt in Brazil.

Well, thanks, Jeff, and good morning to one and all. I'll cover the key headlines for the second quarter. 
First, we feel good about the margin expansion progress and EPS growth we delivered in the quarter. And we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver on our goal of a 20% operating margin by fiscal '18. 
We remain committed to our Consumer First strategy and where we're getting the ideas right, it's driving growth, whether that's Annie's and Lärabar in the U.S., Häagen-Dazs outside North America, or Old El Paso around the world. 
Even so, our net sales performance did not meet our expectations in the second quarter. We didn't have enough marketing support, meaning the combination of trade, media and new product news, to drive improved top line results. And on top of that, we saw a slowdown in food industry growth in the U.S. in recent periods. 
So we're making targeted adjustments to our plans in the back half to find the right balance of investment and return while still driving significant margin expansion. Jeff Harmening will take you through more details on our second half business plans in a moment. 
As a result of our sales trend, we're revising down our expectations for full year net sales and segment operating profit. But we remain on track to deliver our EPS and margin expansion guidance. And we're increasing our free cash flow growth expectations, thanks to continued good financial discipline. 
Finally, we announced an important change to our organizational structure earlier this month. This change represents a significant step towards operating as a global company, allowing us to unlock global growth opportunities while continuing to drive efficiency and increase agility in our organization. 
So with that, let me turn things over to Don to provide more detail on our financial performance."
274715,411442461,1104058,"General Mills, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2016",2016-12-20,"Earnings Calls","General Mills, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ken, and good morning to everyone. With that as a backdrop, let me get into the numbers, provide a summary of our cost-savings efforts and give you some more details on our updated guidance. Slide 6 summarizes our second quarter fiscal '17 finan",1800,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning to everyone. With that as a backdrop, let me get into the numbers, provide a summary of our cost-savings efforts and give you some more details on our updated guidance. 
Slide 6 summarizes our second quarter fiscal '17 financial results. Net sales totaled $4.1 billion, down 7% as reported. Organic net sales declined 4%. Total segment operating profit totaled $830 million, comparable to last year on a constant currency basis. Net earnings decreased 9% to $482 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.80 as reported. 
Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability was $0.85. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 5% compared to last year's results. 
Slide 7 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales declined 4% in the quarter, driven by 7 points of lower organic pound volume growth, partially offset by 3 points of positive sales mix and net price realization. Foreign currency translation didn't have a material impact on net sales this quarter. And the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced sales growth by 3 points in the quarter. 
Turning to segment results. Total U.S. Retail net sales declined 9%, with growth in snacks offset by declines in the other operating units. Organic net sales were down 6% in the quarter. The difference between reported and organic net sales primarily reflects the divestiture of Green Giant, which impacts the meals unit results. Segment operating profit grew 2% versus last year with benefits from our margin expansion initiatives more than offsetting lower volumes. 
In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, net sales declined 4% in the second quarter. This segment's Focus 6 platforms returned to growth with net sales up 2%, driven by growth in cereal, yogurt, snacks, mixes and biscuits. As we expected, net sales declined 10% on our non-Focus 6 businesses in the quarter, primarily due to market index pricing on bakery flour. We expect headwinds from flour index pricing, which impacts sales, with a profit neutral, to lessen significantly in the second half. For the second quarter, segment operating profit was up 6%, driven by benefit from cost-savings initiatives, lower input costs, favorable product mix and higher grain merchandising rates. 
Slide 10 summarizes our constant currency net sales and profit results for our International segment. Total International organic net sales declined 1% in the second quarter. At the region level, second quarter constant currency net sales in the Asia Pacific region were comparable to last year, with double-digit growth in India offset by the restructuring of our Snacks business in China, which we announced last quarter. This action will continue to be a headwind to sales growth through the first quarter of fiscal '18. Excluding snacks, net sales for the rest of our China business were up mid-single digits in the quarter. Latin American sales declined 2% in constant currency in the second quarter, reflecting the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Organic net sales in the region were up low single digits. 
In Europe, constant currency net sales were down 3%, with declines in yogurt offsetting growth for Häagen-Dazs and Old El Paso. 
In Canada, sales were down 7% in constant currency, almost entirely due to the divestiture of Green Giant. 
Constant currency International operating profit declined 18% in the quarter due to currency-driven inflation on products imported into Canada and the U.K. While we expect further headwinds from the British pound in the second half, the Canadian dollar impact should moderate significantly. 
Turning to joint venture results on Slide 11. CPW net sales grew 3% in constant currency with broad growth across the Middle East, Asia, the U.K. and Australia. Häagen-Dazs Japan constant currency net sales increased 21% due to strong new seasonal product performance and double-digit growth in handheld treats. Combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $30 million in the second quarter, up 27% in constant currency, primarily driven by strong sales growth as well as lower administrative costs for CPW and lower input costs for Häagen-Dazs Japan. 
As Ken said, we made good progress on our margin expansion goals in the second quarter. Adjusted gross margins were up 130 basis points with benefits from Holistic Margin Management and our other cost-savings initiatives more than offsetting lower input cost inflation. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of goods sold HMM savings to more than offset our expectation of 2% inflation. 
Adjusted operating profit margins increased 160 basis points in the quarter, slightly ahead of our full year goal. 
Slide 13 summarizes other noteworthy income statement items in the quarter. We incurred $53 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter, included $24 million reported in cost of sales. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, decreased $18 million. Net interest expense increased 2% from the prior year. We continue to expect full year interest expense will be flat to last year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.8% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 32.4% compared to 32.3% last year. We now expect our full year tax rate will be roughly in line with the year-ago rate of 29.8%. And average diluted shares outstanding declined 2% in the quarter. We now expect a 2% reduction for the full year compared to our previous guidance of down 1% to 2%. 
Turning to our first half financial performance. Net sales of $8 billion were down 7% as reported and down 4% on an organic basis. Segment operating profit declined 2% in constant currency. And adjusted diluted EPS was up 1% as reported and up 2% in constant currency. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 15 shows our further progress on core working capital. Our core working capital decreased 20% versus a year ago, and we continue to drive operational improvements across our business. This is the 15th consecutive quarter that we've reduced core working capital. And we have visibility to further reductions in the coming quarters by continued efforts to improve -- improvements in payables. As a result, we're raising our fiscal '17 guidance on free cash flow growth from mid-single digits to high single digits. 
First half operating cash flow was $988 million, down 15% from a year ago, largely driven by timing of trade and advertising accruals and taxes payable related to the Green Giant divestiture last year. 
Year-to-date capital investments totaled $318 million. And through the first half of the year, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases. 
As Ken mentioned, we're taking another step toward operating as a global company by changing our reporting structure to maximize our global scale, unlock global growth opportunities and continue to drive efficiency. We've established 4 new business groups: North America Retail, which combines our current U.S. Retail segment and our Canada region in our International segment; Europe and Australia, which is currently another International region; Asia and Latin America, which combines the remaining 2 current International regions; and Convenience Stores and Foodservice. As part of this change, we anticipate eliminating 400 to 600 positions worldwide, which we estimate will drive savings of $70 million to $90 million by fiscal '18. 
We intend to begin reporting results under this new structure in the third quarter, and we'll provide restated historical data at that time. This announcement is the latest in a series of significant actions we've taken since fiscal '15 to streamline our structure and drive savings. 
As always, HMM is at the center of this effort and continues to deliver significant savings in our cost of goods. In fact, between fiscal '15 and fiscal '17, HMM will generate more than $1.2 billion in cost of goods sold savings, which keeps us on track to achieve our target of $4 billion of savings from HMM this decade. 
We've announced additional projects since fiscal '15 to improve our organizational effectiveness while delivering incremental cost savings. As part of our initiative to streamline our global supply chain network, we will have closed 11 plants by fiscal '18, or 17% of our 2014 factory base. Including those plant closures as well as Projects Catalyst, Compass and our new global reorganization, we'll have reduced approximately 5,000 positions by fiscal '18, or roughly 12% of our global headcount. And we continue to reduce our administrative expenses and drive incremental savings through our implementation of zero-based budgeting. We estimate these projects will drive $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal '18 above and beyond HMM. 
We're progressing well on our goal to 20% adjusted operating profit margins by fiscal '18, which represents more than 300 basis points improvement over fiscal '16 levels. We continue to expect this margin expansion to come from 3 areas. First, a fiscal '17 COGS HMM savings, net of inflation, still makes up about 25% of our goal. At our Investor Day in July, we said the other 2 buckets were split roughly equally. 
Now that we've provided visibility to our global reorganization, you can see that savings from our announced projects represent fully half of our margin expansion goal. The remaining 25% will come primarily from strategic revenue management, spending optimization efforts and other cost efficiency initiatives. 
So let me finish with our second half expectations and full year outlook. We expect modest improvement in organic net sales growth in the second half as we adjust our levels of support and continue to invest in Consumer First news that is working. We expect to deliver significant adjusted operating profit margin expansion thanks to our cost-savings efforts. And that, in turn, will help drive double-digit growth in adjusted diluted EPS in the second half. 
Finally, we expect to accelerate our free cash flow growth behind further improvements in our core working capital. 
I'll close my section by summarizing our updated fiscal '17 guidance, which you can find on Slide 21. Given our first half performance, we now expect full year organic net sales to be down 3% to 4%. As a result, we're now targeting total segment operating profit growth of 2% to 4% on a constant currency basis versus the prior guidance of 6% to 8% growth. We continue to expect adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 150 basis points. 
As I mentioned previously, we expect interest expense and our adjusted tax rate will be flat to last year. And we anticipate average diluted shares will decline 2%. We continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS will be up between 6% and 8% in constant currency. We now expect foreign currency translation will be a $0.01 headwind to full year diluted EPS results. 
Finally, we're increasing our free cash flow guidance from mid-single-digit growth to high single-digit growth, reflecting continued strong core working capital discipline. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff."

As Don mentioned, we posted organic net sales declines in the quarter, with our growth and foundation businesses down 3% and 8%, respectively. 
In some businesses, we met our expectations and in others, we fell short. We didn't deliver the top line improvement we were expecting from the U.S. Retail in the second quarter, with organic sales finishing down 6%. On the other hand, margin delivery was strong with U.S. Retail operating profit margins up 270 basis points to 24.4%. 
We also expected better net sales performance for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, and we met that expectation with our Focus 6 platforms returning to growth this quarter. 
Within our International segment, we expected improved organic net sales performance. We saw top line improvement in Europe and in China, offset by a slowdown in Canada, leaving the total segment organic net sales growth in line with our first quarter results. 
Let me describe in more detail the drivers of our second quarter performance and discuss our operating plans for the second half of this year, starting with U.S. Retail. 
The operating environment here in the U.S. remains challenging. As you can see on Slide 24, the industry has experienced a slowdown in retail sales growth, including a decline in the most recent quarter as benefits from pricing have eroded and unit volume has remained weak. In our categories, average unit prices were up 3% last quarter, but volume softness drove overall category retail sales down 1%. 
For our business, it was our 5 largest categories: Cereal, yogurt, snack bars, refrigerated dough and soup, that fell short of expectations. As Ken told you upfront, we did not have enough marketing support in the form of trade and consumer spending and new product news to deliver the improvement we were looking for. We also saw a bit more competitive activity in some of these categories in the quarter. 
In our other categories, our results were actually a bit better than our expectations, led by Old El Paso Mexican foods, Totino's hot snacks and our Natural & Organic portfolio. 
We're adding back some support in the second half, but we will remain disciplined in our spending. We still believe prioritized investment against the best growth opportunities, while continuing to drive margin expansion, is the right thing to do for the long-term health of our business. 
Retail sales for our Cereal brands were down 3% in the quarter. Where we had compelling Consumer First messaging, we saw good consumer response. For example, our gluten-free Cheerios news and removal of artificial ingredients continue to drive growth in baseline or full price sales. And consumers still love great-tasting cereals. More cocoa in Cocoa Puffs is driving double-digit retail sales growth for this brand. And more cinnamon news continued to drive good performance on Cinnamon Toast Crunch. 
But overall, we didn't get the quality of merchandising we expected, and we didn't have enough marketing pressure to drive better results for our business in the quarter. 
In the second half, we're adding incremental consumer spending to support news that's working, like gluten-free Cheerios and the removal of artificial ingredients. We'll also improve our in-store execution, and we're securing better merchandising events with key retailers on some of our largest established brands. In total, we expect to continue to drive positive net price realization for our Cereal business in the back half of the year. 
New products will also contribute to improved second half performance. We're bringing the taste of real fruit to Cheerios with the new Very Berry variety. It contains strawberries, blueberries and raspberries with no artificial colors or flavors. And of course, it's gluten-free. Watch for it in stores beginning next month. 
On yogurt, we continue to see challenging performance in the second quarter, with retail sales down 18%, and our Light and Greek 100 varieties driving the majority of those declines. Retail sales for the yogurt category also turned negative in the quarter as elevated levels of merchandising generated less incremental lift and as the level of new products news slowed. On a more positive note, we're seeing good initial consumer response to our Annie's and Liberté organic yogurts that we launched in the first quarter. 
As we enter the second half, we'll build on our first half yogurt news. Together, the Annie's and Liberté brands already hold an 8% share of the organic yogurt segment. We expect these brands to have a more significant impact on our second half performance as we continue to expand distribution. 
We also have renovated our yogurt offerings in the first half, improving the value proposition with larger counts of individual tubes. Where we're getting the price right with retailers, it is performing quite well, so we'll look to expand that success in the remainder of the year. 
We're also introducing new and renovated yogurt offerings in the second half that squarely meet consumer needs. Our renovated Greek 100 protein line appeals to consumers looking for a higher amount of protein for just 100 calories. It's made with real fruit and has a delicious thick texture that we think consumers will prefer. 
Yoplait Dippers combined creamy Greek yogurt with the crunch of pretzels or Oat Bites. They offer spoon-free snacking and are a perfect afternoon pick-me-up. And Yoplait Custard Yogurt is a silky smooth indulgent snack or dessert made with whole milk and just a few other simple ingredients. 
We know we have a good deal of work to do to turn around our yogurt business. We expect some improvement in the second half, but won't return to growth this year. We believe the key to success will be fundamentally shifting our portfolio through renovation and innovation to give consumers what they want from their yogurt. That's the essence of Consumer First. The product news I just shared will help us make important strides toward that goal in the second half of this year. And we have a great pipeline of innovation, including an exciting launch in early fiscal '18, that should help build a strong foundation for the future. 
On snack bars, Nature Valley retail sales were down 3% in the second quarter, so we're adding some incremental media support in the back half, and we have a good lineup of new launches. We're expanding our successful Biscuit sandwiches with a cocoa almond butter variety. We're launching new XL Sweet & Salty bars that are 50% bigger, developed with men in mind. And we're very excited about our new Granola Cups, which feature a crunchy whole grain shell filled with peanut or almond butter. They add an indulgent offering to the Nature Valley brand, but with just 9 grams of sugar per serving. 
Retail sales for Fiber One bars were down double digits in the second quarter, consistent with the decline in the adult segment of the bars category. As you may recall, Fiber One was the first brand to do the seemingly impossible: make fiber taste good. And we're making it taste even better with new layered bars that contain crisp grains, caramel and almond toppings in chocolate and 9 grams of fiber per bar. 
On Lärabar, retail sales were up more than 50% in the second quarter. In the back half, we're expanding Lärabar's offerings with a line of new fruits and grains bars. Each bar contains 1/4 cup of kale or spinach, giving Lärabar consumers the nutrition they're looking for in just 5 simple ingredients per bar. 
Refrigerated dough and soup round out our largest 5 categories in the U.S, and we're supporting these businesses with consumer news in the second half. We'll be adding marketing support to Pillsbury refrigerated dough and we have some news coming for Easter, too. And with our new shelf set of stand-up cans, we continue to expand across retailers. 
Our performance on Progresso soup wasn't where we wanted it to be the second quarter, as we experienced heightened competitive activity and unusually warn weather. But winter is certainly here now, and we're ramping up our messaging behind our antibiotic-free chicken news. 
As I mentioned earlier, we saw good results in our other categories in the U.S. Retail and we'll build on that momentum in the second half. Old El Paso has been generating growth within our meals platform in recent years. Consumer First innovation, including new flavors and formats of Stand 'N Stuff shells and tortillas, drove retail sales up 6% in the quarter. 
Innovation is also working for Totino's Hot Snacks, with retail sales up 6% in the quarter. We saw particularly good performance on Pizza Sticks, which were launched in the first quarter, and we'll introduce larger count sizes next month. We think this is a great example of knowing our consumer and reaching them with relevant products and messaging. 
The Annie's brand continues to lead our growth in Natural & Organic. Retail sales for the brand grew 46% in the second quarter, and our points of distribution are up more than 30% year-to-date in Nielsen-measured channels alone. Retail sales for Annie's established items like snacks and mac and cheese grew 20% in the quarter. And we continue to build distribution on our category expansions in cereals, yogurt, soup, baked goods and grain snacks. 
Next month, we'll introduce Annie's organic ready-to-eat popcorn. With the strength of this great brand, as well as the performance of our other terrific Natural & Organic brands, we are well on our way to meeting our goal of $1 billion in net sales for our Natural & Organic portfolio by 2019. 
So as we look to the second half, we have plans in place to drive improvement for our U.S. Retail businesses. We're optimizing our marketing support across our 5 largest categories, we'll continue to build on what's working by investing behind our Natural & Organic businesses as well as Old El Paso and Totino's, we have a solid lineup of new products that are aligned with growing areas of consumer interest and we'll continue to drive margin expansion for U.S. Retail, building on the improvement we posted in the first half. 
Let me turn briefly to our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment. As Don mentioned, net sales declined in the quarter, driven in large part by a negative impact of flour pricing. However, our Focus 6 platforms posted net sales growth, led by our yogurt platform, with net sales gains for Yoplait Parfait Pro and increased cereals sales in schools. 
In the second half, we expect continued goods -- continued good growth from our Focus 6 platforms and a reduced headwind from our flour index pricing. 
We'll also bring more innovation to Foodservice customers with new artisan breads designed for K-12 schools. This includes presliced, premium quality ciabatta breads and flat panini breads that allow operators to make hot sandwiches with reduced labor and without additional equipment. In total, these efforts should result in improved top line performance for this segment in second half. 
Now let's turn to our International segment. Sales in our developed markets were mixed in the second quarter. Retail sales for Old El Paso were up high single digits in Canada behind Stand 'N Stuff taco shell innovation. In Europe, we posted high single digit retail sales declines on yogurt, high single digit growth for wholesome snacks and high teens growth for Häagen-Dazs, led by stick bars. 
In the second half, we'll build on what's working in developed markets and also bring new product news to our categories. Our Old El Paso Stand 'N Stuff business has been a good growth driver in recent years, and we've recently launched a mini shell variety in Europe. And we're expanding our successful Häagen-Dazs stick bars into new European markets and adding new flavors to the line. 
On yogurt, we're focusing on improving our in-store execution and closing distribution gaps. We're also entering the fast-growing indulgence segment with our new Triple Sensations line. 
In Canada, we're launching Yoplait whole milk yogurt that has all family appeal, and we'll drive growth on our expanding Natural & Organic business with the addition of items like Lärabar bites. 
China is our largest emerging market, and we saw good second quarter net sales growth there on Häagen-Dazs, Wanchai Ferry and Yoplait. Our Yoplait yogurt business continued to grow in Shanghai, and we're gaining a foothold in Beijing, which we entered this summer. As Don mentioned, our results were partially offset by our Snacks restructuring in China, which was a headwind to sales, but will be slightly accretive to underlying profit. 
And in the EMEA region, Häagen-Dazs stick bars launched in the first quarter and are performing well. 
In the second half, in China, we're launching a new Wanchai Ferry's kids line in time for the Chinese New Year. These dumplings come in colorful wrappers, are a smaller size for kids and have nutritional ingredients like pork, salmon and shrimp that appeal to moms. 
On Häagen-Dazs, we're launching new fruit and flowers ice cream flavors like rose and raspberry and elderflower and blackcurrant that deliver a sweet, aromatic experience. 
In EMEA, we'll continue to drive growth on Häagen-Dazs with new flavors of stick bars in our core client business, and we're launching frozen yogurt across multiple markets following its success in China. 
For our International segment in total, we expect our underlying top line trend to improve in the back half, and we're planning for operating margin expansion as transaction currency headwinds moderate. 
And now I'll turn it back to Ken for some closing remarks."

So thank you, Jeff, and let me just summarize our comments this morning. We continue to take a disciplined approach to the top line, focusing our investments behind our highest returning Consumer First ideas and eliminating activities that are not generating profitable volume. 
Our organic sales results didn't meet our expectations this quarter, so we're adding support and launching a solid lineup of new products to strengthen the second half. 
We delivered strong margin expansion and good EPS growth in the second quarter, and our HMM and other cost-savings efforts keep us on track to deliver our fiscal '18 goal of a 20% adjusted operating profit margin. 
And we updated our full year growth goals to reflect a softer top line, but we're maintaining our EPS guidance and increasing our free cash flow growth target as we continue to drive operational efficiency across our businesses.

And quite honestly, we're just -- we're going through depth and frequency and executional approach across our trade promotion, and we have the ability to look at those and understand their impact almost deal by deal. And we think that doing that and that approach is the right thing to do. We just don't want to promote in ways that create a loss for us. And the same, of course, is true for consumer spending, and we've got to see the return. So I think we remain very convinced and committed to expecting strong return from our promotional and advertising dollars. Having said that, as we look back at the first quarter, we think there are cases where we cut too far or reduced spending too much in certain areas. And so we're going to add back and correct as we go forward in the second half. And I think you heard Jeff comment on some of the areas where we're going to do that. So fundamentally, we think discipline in this area is good. And there are opportunities to improve, I think quite significantly, but we've got to correct as we go forward into the second half. Jeff, I don't know if you'd add anything."

And I understand what drove the thinking around putting a target out there when you did, but we're in a bit of a different environment now, I think. And does that maybe limit you in what you may feel you need to do from a reinvestment perspective just to get the top line to stabilize? Because having a certain margin target, obviously, is noble in a lot of ways, but if it comes on a significantly smaller sales base, it still doesn't get you obviously to where you want to be.

I mean, it's been -- as we look at the environment, which has been slower growth across consumer industries, and listen pretty carefully to our investors, people who hold our stock, I mean, there really has been a very, very high interest in margin in this environment. And so we felt it was important to make it clear that we've heard of that interest, and it was helpful externally. But I will also tell you very helpful internally for us to set a very clear and important goal. I also want to tell you that the actions that we've taken to achieve that have been highly positive for General Mills. And so the work that we've done over the last several years to optimize our supply chain, getting the right capacity in the right place, has been extremely beneficial to the company for the long term. The base that's there now is very highly utilized. The actions that we've taken, in fact, as we've said a number of times, opened the door to kind of a second wave of productivity initiatives as those plants are highly utilized. So that's been extremely positive for General Mills. And the work we've done on the administrative structure, just to get a lighter structure, the work that we just announced to optimize and structure for global growth with a North American segment, kind of a Europe developed marketing segment, Asia, that segment. These are really designed now for executional efficiency, better sharing, they're just way more efficient. So I understand the question, but I would just say that the work that we've done and that we put in place to achieve these stronger margin goals has, I would say, overall been very highly positive for General Mills and sets us up very well for the future. Obviously, margin and free cash flow, very important metrics for us. We talk about them repeatedly. Top line, of course, is also super important. So we understand how important it is to get the top line to turn, and we're very focused on that. If you guys want to add anything?"

But I think it's important to understand that as we look at our business, there's different levers we can pull to drive shareholder return. Sales growth is clearly the one that has the longest term benefit and where our focus is. But there's clearly margin expansion, there's cash conversion and cash return to shareholders. And at different points in our history, we've pulled those at different strengths based on what the market could bear. And as we looked at the market over the past couple of years, at least for the near term, with less available top line growth, we wanted to make sure that we were still delivering a competitive return for our shareholders, and that meant more on the margins. That was kind of one input. The other is that setting a target -- and Ken kind of touched on this, it does makes you think differently. And it's brought to bear more ideas in terms of where we can find efficiencies, and we've done it throughout our P&L and our balance sheet. And as a result, it's creating flex for us to reinvest back in our business. And I think those are all good things. But at the end of the day, the goal is to ensure that we are investing behind good top line growing ideas and then driving a competitive margin.

There's actually 3 things and they really all revolve around working capital. The first is, a year ago, we had a big payable from the Green Giant sale that hit our operating cash flow even though the, obviously, the cash that came out was -- or cash that came in was in the financing section -- or in the investment section, excuse me. So we had a large liability that will not, obviously, reoccur this year. So that was $160 million, I believe, in the -- at this point last year. So that will change the complexion of our working capital in the balance of the year. The other is our trade and advertising accruals. As we've said, our media, our trade was down in the first half even a bit more than we had planned and anticipated. As we reinvest more in the back half, those accruals will come up, again favorably impacting working capital. And the last thing, the one that's the most, I guess, sustainable that will carry forward into F '18 as well is our focus on core working capital. Inventory was a bit higher than we wanted it to be at the end of the second quarter, and that's because volumes did not come in as anticipated. That will even out and come down as the year unfolds. And then most importantly, as we continue to work on our payables and as we move our vendors to 90-day terms, we'll see that benefit start to accrete more in the second half, and again, more in '18 as well. So it's all in our working capital and it's those 3 big items, the tax payable on the Green Giant divestiture a year ago that we're rolling over, the level of advertising and trade payables that will increase as the year goes on as we increase investments in those 2 areas and then -- and in the core -- our continued work on reducing core working capital."

First on gross margins, can you give us a view of what you're expecting for the full year?

So our gross margin, we increased 50 basis points year-to-date. We think it will be up closer to 200 basis points in the back half of the year.

We think it will be up closer to 200 basis points in the back half of the year. So at full year, we'll be below our original 150 guidance, probably more in the 100 to 120 range. But it will improve in the back half for some substantial reasons. First off, we'll get better volume leverage as we see improved sales in the back half, which is primarily from volume, so our gross margin will benefit from that. The comps from last year, if you look at our trend last year, our gross margin expansion was essentially all in the first half, and that was due to inflation phasing, where inflation accelerated during the course of F '16. Last year, gross margins were up 170 basis points in the first half. It was actually about flat in the second half, and actually Q3 was down 130 basis points. So again, I think that gross margin expansion this year on a comparable basis will skew to Q4. To your specific question on inflation, we think it's fairly stable through the course of the year, a slight deceleration in the back half and the fourth quarter. And obviously, we'll see pretty steady contributions from HMM exceeding that inflation. Our cost actions will build during the course of the year. That will help gross margin in the back half. And then transaction FX, which, for the full year will be about a $50 million drag for us. But $35 million of that is in the first half, as I said in my comments. The pound will continue to impact us in the back half, but we think the Canadian dollar will be less so. So we've absorbed the majority of the transaction FX negative in the first half, so that'll be less of a drag in the second. So really those 4 things: the volume leverage that we'll get in the second half slightly better than the first half; the comps, particularly around inflation phasing will favor the back half of this year, again, especially in the fourth quarter; our cost actions will build around Project Century benefits; and then transaction FX, still a negative but a lighter negative in the back half."

Building on that, to get to your 150 full year EBIT margin expansion, A&P is adding -- on track to add around 100 bps to margins. And maybe you spend some back, so let's just say at 75. So between GM and A&P, you'll have 200 bps of margin cushion there, implying some SG&A leakage at margin despite all the aggressive cost cuts. Is that just a product of some of the sales softness? Is it a cadence of the SG&A discipline? I don't know, maybe you could shed some light on that."

But from an advertising standpoint, in the back half of the year, we said in the last call we expect advertising after the first quarter will be down double digits for the year. We still believe that, probably mid-teens, which means it will be better in the back half. Still down slightly, but importantly, up in some key businesses. As a matter of fact, if you look at our growth businesses in the back half, excluding U.S. Yogurt, which we've always said we're going to really rightsize our investment there, given our historical share of voice, excluding U.S. yogurt, our growth businesses, advertising investment, media investment will be up low single digits in the back half. Again, fairly spread across the businesses that Jeff talked to. So we'll see that in the back half. And actually, our admin continues to be below last year, both at the -- within SOP and then on the corporate level as well, so that's actually a contributor. Obviously, what's different is that sales are lower and volume is lower than we started the year, and that's an offset. So again, I didn't exactly follow your math, but we expect to get our 150 basis points of operating margin expansion. We'll get a good piece of that, as you noted, through gross margin, and we'll get the balance through the rest of the P&L. But all lines, including administrative costs and overhead costs, will contribute."

As we look at the second half of the year, I mean, the biggest improvement we'll see will be in Europe. And -- which is a very profitable business for us. And we improved that business in the second quarter from the first quarter. We had a tough summer, based on Häagen-Dazs sales as well as the Yoplait integration. But we saw the second quarter improve on Häagen-Dazs and -- as well as OEP, Old El Paso, and bars, and we expect that to continue in the second half of the year. We've got really good innovation on Häagen-Dazs, good innovation on Old El Paso, and we continue to expand our bars business. So -- and the integration of our Yoplait business with our European business will be largely behind us, so we expect improved performance from there. So I would say, in the second half, you'll see that. But I also want to mention that what we see is that our 2 largest developing markets, China and Brazil, have returned to growth, if you look at organic growth. They're somehow -- they're a little bit clouded by some restructuring we've been doing of our Snacks business in China and of our acquisition of Yogurt in Brazil. But underlying that, in China, we're back to mid-single-digit organic growth. We're growing our Wanchai Ferry business. We're growing Häagen-Dazs, and we continue to see good growth from Yogurt. And we're back to growth in Brazil as well, and we're kind of -- we're executing better in Brazil and so we're back to growth there.

First, we feel good about the margin expansion progress and EPS growth we delivered in the quarter. And we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver on our goal of a 20% operating margin by fiscal '18. 
We remain committed to our Consumer First strategy and where we're getting the ideas right, it's driving growth, whether that's Annie's and Lärabar in the U.S., Häagen-Dazs outside North America, or Old El Paso around the world. 
Even so, our net sales performance did not meet our expectations in the second quarter. We didn't have enough marketing support, meaning the combination of trade, media and new product news, to drive improved top line results. And on top of that, we saw a slowdown in food industry growth in the U.S. in recent periods. 
So we're making targeted adjustments to our plans in the back half to find the right balance of investment and return while still driving significant margin expansion. Jeff Harmening will take you through more details on our second half business plans in a moment. 
As a result of our sales trend, we're revising down our expectations for full year net sales and segment operating profit. But we remain on track to deliver our EPS and margin expansion guidance. And we're increasing our free cash flow growth expectations, thanks to continued good financial discipline. 
Finally, we announced an important change to our organizational structure earlier this month. This change represents a significant step towards operating as a global company, allowing us to unlock global growth opportunities while continuing to drive efficiency and increase agility in our organization. 
So with that, let me turn things over to Don to provide more detail on our financial performance."
274715,411442461,1104255,"General Mills, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2016",2016-12-20,"Earnings Calls","General Mills, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ken, and good morning to everyone. With that as a backdrop, let me get into the numbers, provide a summary of our cost-savings efforts and give you some more details on our updated guidance. Slide 6 summarizes our second quarter fiscal '17 finan",1800,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning to everyone. With that as a backdrop, let me get into the numbers, provide a summary of our cost-savings efforts and give you some more details on our updated guidance. 
Slide 6 summarizes our second quarter fiscal '17 financial results. Net sales totaled $4.1 billion, down 7% as reported. Organic net sales declined 4%. Total segment operating profit totaled $830 million, comparable to last year on a constant currency basis. Net earnings decreased 9% to $482 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.80 as reported. 
Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability was $0.85. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 5% compared to last year's results. 
Slide 7 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales declined 4% in the quarter, driven by 7 points of lower organic pound volume growth, partially offset by 3 points of positive sales mix and net price realization. Foreign currency translation didn't have a material impact on net sales this quarter. And the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced sales growth by 3 points in the quarter. 
Turning to segment results. Total U.S. Retail net sales declined 9%, with growth in snacks offset by declines in the other operating units. Organic net sales were down 6% in the quarter. The difference between reported and organic net sales primarily reflects the divestiture of Green Giant, which impacts the meals unit results. Segment operating profit grew 2% versus last year with benefits from our margin expansion initiatives more than offsetting lower volumes. 
In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, net sales declined 4% in the second quarter. This segment's Focus 6 platforms returned to growth with net sales up 2%, driven by growth in cereal, yogurt, snacks, mixes and biscuits. As we expected, net sales declined 10% on our non-Focus 6 businesses in the quarter, primarily due to market index pricing on bakery flour. We expect headwinds from flour index pricing, which impacts sales, with a profit neutral, to lessen significantly in the second half. For the second quarter, segment operating profit was up 6%, driven by benefit from cost-savings initiatives, lower input costs, favorable product mix and higher grain merchandising rates. 
Slide 10 summarizes our constant currency net sales and profit results for our International segment. Total International organic net sales declined 1% in the second quarter. At the region level, second quarter constant currency net sales in the Asia Pacific region were comparable to last year, with double-digit growth in India offset by the restructuring of our Snacks business in China, which we announced last quarter. This action will continue to be a headwind to sales growth through the first quarter of fiscal '18. Excluding snacks, net sales for the rest of our China business were up mid-single digits in the quarter. Latin American sales declined 2% in constant currency in the second quarter, reflecting the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Organic net sales in the region were up low single digits. 
In Europe, constant currency net sales were down 3%, with declines in yogurt offsetting growth for Häagen-Dazs and Old El Paso. 
In Canada, sales were down 7% in constant currency, almost entirely due to the divestiture of Green Giant. 
Constant currency International operating profit declined 18% in the quarter due to currency-driven inflation on products imported into Canada and the U.K. While we expect further headwinds from the British pound in the second half, the Canadian dollar impact should moderate significantly. 
Turning to joint venture results on Slide 11. CPW net sales grew 3% in constant currency with broad growth across the Middle East, Asia, the U.K. and Australia. Häagen-Dazs Japan constant currency net sales increased 21% due to strong new seasonal product performance and double-digit growth in handheld treats. Combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $30 million in the second quarter, up 27% in constant currency, primarily driven by strong sales growth as well as lower administrative costs for CPW and lower input costs for Häagen-Dazs Japan. 
As Ken said, we made good progress on our margin expansion goals in the second quarter. Adjusted gross margins were up 130 basis points with benefits from Holistic Margin Management and our other cost-savings initiatives more than offsetting lower input cost inflation. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of goods sold HMM savings to more than offset our expectation of 2% inflation. 
Adjusted operating profit margins increased 160 basis points in the quarter, slightly ahead of our full year goal. 
Slide 13 summarizes other noteworthy income statement items in the quarter. We incurred $53 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter, included $24 million reported in cost of sales. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, decreased $18 million. Net interest expense increased 2% from the prior year. We continue to expect full year interest expense will be flat to last year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.8% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 32.4% compared to 32.3% last year. We now expect our full year tax rate will be roughly in line with the year-ago rate of 29.8%. And average diluted shares outstanding declined 2% in the quarter. We now expect a 2% reduction for the full year compared to our previous guidance of down 1% to 2%. 
Turning to our first half financial performance. Net sales of $8 billion were down 7% as reported and down 4% on an organic basis. Segment operating profit declined 2% in constant currency. And adjusted diluted EPS was up 1% as reported and up 2% in constant currency. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 15 shows our further progress on core working capital. Our core working capital decreased 20% versus a year ago, and we continue to drive operational improvements across our business. This is the 15th consecutive quarter that we've reduced core working capital. And we have visibility to further reductions in the coming quarters by continued efforts to improve -- improvements in payables. As a result, we're raising our fiscal '17 guidance on free cash flow growth from mid-single digits to high single digits. 
First half operating cash flow was $988 million, down 15% from a year ago, largely driven by timing of trade and advertising accruals and taxes payable related to the Green Giant divestiture last year. 
Year-to-date capital investments totaled $318 million. And through the first half of the year, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases. 
As Ken mentioned, we're taking another step toward operating as a global company by changing our reporting structure to maximize our global scale, unlock global growth opportunities and continue to drive efficiency. We've established 4 new business groups: North America Retail, which combines our current U.S. Retail segment and our Canada region in our International segment; Europe and Australia, which is currently another International region; Asia and Latin America, which combines the remaining 2 current International regions; and Convenience Stores and Foodservice. As part of this change, we anticipate eliminating 400 to 600 positions worldwide, which we estimate will drive savings of $70 million to $90 million by fiscal '18. 
We intend to begin reporting results under this new structure in the third quarter, and we'll provide restated historical data at that time. This announcement is the latest in a series of significant actions we've taken since fiscal '15 to streamline our structure and drive savings. 
As always, HMM is at the center of this effort and continues to deliver significant savings in our cost of goods. In fact, between fiscal '15 and fiscal '17, HMM will generate more than $1.2 billion in cost of goods sold savings, which keeps us on track to achieve our target of $4 billion of savings from HMM this decade. 
We've announced additional projects since fiscal '15 to improve our organizational effectiveness while delivering incremental cost savings. As part of our initiative to streamline our global supply chain network, we will have closed 11 plants by fiscal '18, or 17% of our 2014 factory base. Including those plant closures as well as Projects Catalyst, Compass and our new global reorganization, we'll have reduced approximately 5,000 positions by fiscal '18, or roughly 12% of our global headcount. And we continue to reduce our administrative expenses and drive incremental savings through our implementation of zero-based budgeting. We estimate these projects will drive $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal '18 above and beyond HMM. 
We're progressing well on our goal to 20% adjusted operating profit margins by fiscal '18, which represents more than 300 basis points improvement over fiscal '16 levels. We continue to expect this margin expansion to come from 3 areas. First, a fiscal '17 COGS HMM savings, net of inflation, still makes up about 25% of our goal. At our Investor Day in July, we said the other 2 buckets were split roughly equally. 
Now that we've provided visibility to our global reorganization, you can see that savings from our announced projects represent fully half of our margin expansion goal. The remaining 25% will come primarily from strategic revenue management, spending optimization efforts and other cost efficiency initiatives. 
So let me finish with our second half expectations and full year outlook. We expect modest improvement in organic net sales growth in the second half as we adjust our levels of support and continue to invest in Consumer First news that is working. We expect to deliver significant adjusted operating profit margin expansion thanks to our cost-savings efforts. And that, in turn, will help drive double-digit growth in adjusted diluted EPS in the second half. 
Finally, we expect to accelerate our free cash flow growth behind further improvements in our core working capital. 
I'll close my section by summarizing our updated fiscal '17 guidance, which you can find on Slide 21. Given our first half performance, we now expect full year organic net sales to be down 3% to 4%. As a result, we're now targeting total segment operating profit growth of 2% to 4% on a constant currency basis versus the prior guidance of 6% to 8% growth. We continue to expect adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 150 basis points. 
As I mentioned previously, we expect interest expense and our adjusted tax rate will be flat to last year. And we anticipate average diluted shares will decline 2%. We continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS will be up between 6% and 8% in constant currency. We now expect foreign currency translation will be a $0.01 headwind to full year diluted EPS results. 
Finally, we're increasing our free cash flow guidance from mid-single-digit growth to high single-digit growth, reflecting continued strong core working capital discipline. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff."

As Don mentioned, we posted organic net sales declines in the quarter, with our growth and foundation businesses down 3% and 8%, respectively. 
In some businesses, we met our expectations and in others, we fell short. We didn't deliver the top line improvement we were expecting from the U.S. Retail in the second quarter, with organic sales finishing down 6%. On the other hand, margin delivery was strong with U.S. Retail operating profit margins up 270 basis points to 24.4%. 
We also expected better net sales performance for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, and we met that expectation with our Focus 6 platforms returning to growth this quarter. 
Within our International segment, we expected improved organic net sales performance. We saw top line improvement in Europe and in China, offset by a slowdown in Canada, leaving the total segment organic net sales growth in line with our first quarter results. 
Let me describe in more detail the drivers of our second quarter performance and discuss our operating plans for the second half of this year, starting with U.S. Retail. 
The operating environment here in the U.S. remains challenging. As you can see on Slide 24, the industry has experienced a slowdown in retail sales growth, including a decline in the most recent quarter as benefits from pricing have eroded and unit volume has remained weak. In our categories, average unit prices were up 3% last quarter, but volume softness drove overall category retail sales down 1%. 
For our business, it was our 5 largest categories: Cereal, yogurt, snack bars, refrigerated dough and soup, that fell short of expectations. As Ken told you upfront, we did not have enough marketing support in the form of trade and consumer spending and new product news to deliver the improvement we were looking for. We also saw a bit more competitive activity in some of these categories in the quarter. 
In our other categories, our results were actually a bit better than our expectations, led by Old El Paso Mexican foods, Totino's hot snacks and our Natural & Organic portfolio. 
We're adding back some support in the second half, but we will remain disciplined in our spending. We still believe prioritized investment against the best growth opportunities, while continuing to drive margin expansion, is the right thing to do for the long-term health of our business. 
Retail sales for our Cereal brands were down 3% in the quarter. Where we had compelling Consumer First messaging, we saw good consumer response. For example, our gluten-free Cheerios news and removal of artificial ingredients continue to drive growth in baseline or full price sales. And consumers still love great-tasting cereals. More cocoa in Cocoa Puffs is driving double-digit retail sales growth for this brand. And more cinnamon news continued to drive good performance on Cinnamon Toast Crunch. 
But overall, we didn't get the quality of merchandising we expected, and we didn't have enough marketing pressure to drive better results for our business in the quarter. 
In the second half, we're adding incremental consumer spending to support news that's working, like gluten-free Cheerios and the removal of artificial ingredients. We'll also improve our in-store execution, and we're securing better merchandising events with key retailers on some of our largest established brands. In total, we expect to continue to drive positive net price realization for our Cereal business in the back half of the year. 
New products will also contribute to improved second half performance. We're bringing the taste of real fruit to Cheerios with the new Very Berry variety. It contains strawberries, blueberries and raspberries with no artificial colors or flavors. And of course, it's gluten-free. Watch for it in stores beginning next month. 
On yogurt, we continue to see challenging performance in the second quarter, with retail sales down 18%, and our Light and Greek 100 varieties driving the majority of those declines. Retail sales for the yogurt category also turned negative in the quarter as elevated levels of merchandising generated less incremental lift and as the level of new products news slowed. On a more positive note, we're seeing good initial consumer response to our Annie's and Liberté organic yogurts that we launched in the first quarter. 
As we enter the second half, we'll build on our first half yogurt news. Together, the Annie's and Liberté brands already hold an 8% share of the organic yogurt segment. We expect these brands to have a more significant impact on our second half performance as we continue to expand distribution. 
We also have renovated our yogurt offerings in the first half, improving the value proposition with larger counts of individual tubes. Where we're getting the price right with retailers, it is performing quite well, so we'll look to expand that success in the remainder of the year. 
We're also introducing new and renovated yogurt offerings in the second half that squarely meet consumer needs. Our renovated Greek 100 protein line appeals to consumers looking for a higher amount of protein for just 100 calories. It's made with real fruit and has a delicious thick texture that we think consumers will prefer. 
Yoplait Dippers combined creamy Greek yogurt with the crunch of pretzels or Oat Bites. They offer spoon-free snacking and are a perfect afternoon pick-me-up. And Yoplait Custard Yogurt is a silky smooth indulgent snack or dessert made with whole milk and just a few other simple ingredients. 
We know we have a good deal of work to do to turn around our yogurt business. We expect some improvement in the second half, but won't return to growth this year. We believe the key to success will be fundamentally shifting our portfolio through renovation and innovation to give consumers what they want from their yogurt. That's the essence of Consumer First. The product news I just shared will help us make important strides toward that goal in the second half of this year. And we have a great pipeline of innovation, including an exciting launch in early fiscal '18, that should help build a strong foundation for the future. 
On snack bars, Nature Valley retail sales were down 3% in the second quarter, so we're adding some incremental media support in the back half, and we have a good lineup of new launches. We're expanding our successful Biscuit sandwiches with a cocoa almond butter variety. We're launching new XL Sweet & Salty bars that are 50% bigger, developed with men in mind. And we're very excited about our new Granola Cups, which feature a crunchy whole grain shell filled with peanut or almond butter. They add an indulgent offering to the Nature Valley brand, but with just 9 grams of sugar per serving. 
Retail sales for Fiber One bars were down double digits in the second quarter, consistent with the decline in the adult segment of the bars category. As you may recall, Fiber One was the first brand to do the seemingly impossible: make fiber taste good. And we're making it taste even better with new layered bars that contain crisp grains, caramel and almond toppings in chocolate and 9 grams of fiber per bar. 
On Lärabar, retail sales were up more than 50% in the second quarter. In the back half, we're expanding Lärabar's offerings with a line of new fruits and grains bars. Each bar contains 1/4 cup of kale or spinach, giving Lärabar consumers the nutrition they're looking for in just 5 simple ingredients per bar. 
Refrigerated dough and soup round out our largest 5 categories in the U.S, and we're supporting these businesses with consumer news in the second half. We'll be adding marketing support to Pillsbury refrigerated dough and we have some news coming for Easter, too. And with our new shelf set of stand-up cans, we continue to expand across retailers. 
Our performance on Progresso soup wasn't where we wanted it to be the second quarter, as we experienced heightened competitive activity and unusually warm weather. But winter is certainly here now, and we're ramping up our messaging behind our antibiotic-free chicken news. 
As I mentioned earlier, we saw good results in our other categories in the U.S. Retail and we'll build on that momentum in the second half. Old El Paso has been generating growth within our meals platform in recent years. Consumer First innovation, including new flavors and formats of Stand 'N Stuff shells and tortillas, drove retail sales up 6% in the quarter. 
Innovation is also working for Totino's Hot Snacks, with retail sales up 6% in the quarter. We saw particularly good performance on Pizza Sticks, which were launched in the first quarter, and we'll introduce larger count sizes next month. We think this is a great example of knowing our consumer and reaching them with relevant products and messaging. 
The Annie's brand continues to lead our growth in Natural & Organic. Retail sales for the brand grew 46% in the second quarter, and our points of distribution are up more than 30% year-to-date in Nielsen-measured channels alone. Retail sales for Annie's established items like snacks and mac and cheese grew 20% in the quarter. And we continue to build distribution on our category expansions in cereals, yogurt, soup, baked goods and grain snacks. 
Next month, we'll introduce Annie's organic ready-to-eat popcorn. With the strength of this great brand, as well as the performance of our other terrific Natural & Organic brands, we are well on our way to meeting our goal of $1 billion in net sales for our Natural & Organic portfolio by 2019. 
So as we look to the second half, we have plans in place to drive improvement for our U.S. Retail businesses. We're optimizing our marketing support across our 5 largest categories, we'll continue to build on what's working by investing behind our Natural & Organic businesses as well as Old El Paso and Totino's, we have a solid lineup of new products that are aligned with growing areas of consumer interest and we'll continue to drive margin expansion for U.S. Retail, building on the improvement we posted in the first half. 
Let me turn briefly to our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment. As Don mentioned, net sales declined in the quarter, driven in large part by a negative impact of flour pricing. However, our Focus 6 platforms posted net sales growth, led by our yogurt platform, with net sales gains for Yoplait Parfait Pro and increased cereals sales in schools. 
In the second half, we expect continued goods -- continued good growth from our Focus 6 platforms and a reduced headwind from our flour index pricing. 
We'll also bring more innovation to Foodservice customers with new artisan breads designed for K-12 schools. This includes presliced, premium quality ciabatta breads and flat panini breads that allow operators to make hot sandwiches with reduced labor and without additional equipment. In total, these efforts should result in improved top line performance for this segment in second half. 
Now let's turn to our International segment. Sales in our developed markets were mixed in the second quarter. Retail sales for Old El Paso were up high single digits in Canada behind Stand 'N Stuff taco shell innovation. In Europe, we posted high single digit retail sales declines on yogurt, high single digit growth for wholesome snacks and high teens growth for Häagen-Dazs, led by stick bars. 
In the second half, we'll build on what's working in developed markets and also bring new product news to our categories. Our Old El Paso Stand 'N Stuff business has been a good growth driver in recent years, and we've recently launched a mini shell variety in Europe. And we're expanding our successful Häagen-Dazs stick bars into new European markets and adding new flavors to the line. 
On yogurt, we're focusing on improving our in-store execution and closing distribution gaps. We're also entering the fast-growing indulgence segment with our new Triple Sensations line. 
In Canada, we're launching Yoplait whole milk yogurt that has all family appeal, and we'll drive growth on our expanding Natural & Organic business with the addition of items like Lärabar bites. 
China is our largest emerging market, and we saw good second quarter net sales growth there on Häagen-Dazs, Wanchai Ferry and Yoplait. Our Yoplait yogurt business continued to grow in Shanghai, and we're gaining a foothold in Beijing, which we entered this summer. As Don mentioned, our results were partially offset by our Snacks restructuring in China, which was a headwind to sales, but will be slightly accretive to underlying profit. 
And in the EMEA region, Häagen-Dazs stick bars launched in the first quarter and are performing well. 
In the second half, in China, we're launching a new Wanchai Ferry's kids line in time for the Chinese New Year. These dumplings come in colorful wrappers, are a smaller size for kids and have nutritional ingredients like pork, salmon and shrimp that appeal to moms. 
On Häagen-Dazs, we're launching new fruit and flowers ice cream flavors like rose and raspberry and elderflower and blackcurrant that deliver a sweet, aromatic experience. 
In EMEA, we'll continue to drive growth on Häagen-Dazs with new flavors of stick bars in our core client business, and we're launching frozen yogurt across multiple markets following its success in China. 
For our International segment in total, we expect our underlying top line trend to improve in the back half, and we're planning for operating margin expansion as transaction currency headwinds moderate. 
And now I'll turn it back to Ken for some closing remarks."

So thank you, Jeff, and let me just summarize our comments this morning. We continue to take a disciplined approach to the top line, focusing our investments behind our highest returning Consumer First ideas and eliminating activities that are not generating profitable volume. 
Our organic sales results didn't meet our expectations this quarter, so we're adding support and launching a solid lineup of new products to strengthen the second half. 
We delivered strong margin expansion and good EPS growth in the second quarter, and our HMM and other cost-savings efforts keep us on track to deliver our fiscal '18 goal of a 20% adjusted operating profit margin. 
And we updated our full year growth goals to reflect a softer top line, but we're maintaining our EPS guidance and increasing our free cash flow growth target as we continue to drive operational efficiency across our businesses.

But can you give us a sense of comfort that the strategy for this year and for next year -- that you're not cutting too far to the bone or that there's not going to be a bigger reinvestment in '18 to kind of make up for what's been lost in the first couple of quarters?"

Having said that, as we look back at the first quarter, we think there are cases where we cut too far or reduced spending too much in certain areas. And so we're going to add back and correct as we go forward in the second half. And I think you heard Jeff comment on some of the areas where we're going to do that.

I'm just trying to get a sense of having a specific margin target out there. And I understand what drove the thinking around putting a target out there when you did, but we're in a bit of a different environment now, I think. And does that maybe limit you in what you may feel you need to do from a reinvestment perspective just to get the top line to stabilize? Because having a certain margin target, obviously, is noble in a lot of ways, but if it comes on a significantly smaller sales base, it still doesn't get you obviously to where you want to be.

I mean, it's been -- as we look at the environment, which has been slower growth across consumer industries, and listen pretty carefully to our investors, people who hold our stock, I mean, there really has been a very, very high interest in margin in this environment. And so we felt it was important to make it clear that we've heard of that interest, and it was helpful externally. But I will also tell you very helpful internally for us to set a very clear and important goal. I also want to tell you that the actions that we've taken to achieve that have been highly positive for General Mills. And so the work that we've done over the last several years to optimize our supply chain, getting the right capacity in the right place, has been extremely beneficial to the company for the long term. The base that's there now is very highly utilized. The actions that we've taken, in fact, as we've said a number of times, opened the door to kind of a second wave of productivity initiatives as those plants are highly utilized. So that's been extremely positive for General Mills. And the work we've done on the administrative structure, just to get a lighter structure, the work that we just announced to optimize and structure for global growth with a North American segment, kind of a Europe developed marketing segment, Asia, that segment. These are really designed now for executional efficiency, better sharing, they're just way more efficient. So I understand the question, but I would just say that the work that we've done and that we put in place to achieve these stronger margin goals has, I would say, overall been very highly positive for General Mills and sets us up very well for the future. Obviously, margin and free cash flow, very important metrics for us. We talk about them repeatedly. Top line, of course, is also super important. So we understand how important it is to get the top line to turn, and we're very focused on that. If you guys want to add anything?"

But I think it's important to understand that as we look at our business, there's different levers we can pull to drive shareholder return. Sales growth is clearly the one that has the longest term benefit and where our focus is. But there's clearly margin expansion, there's cash conversion and cash return to shareholders. And at different points in our history, we've pulled those at different strengths based on what the market could bear. And as we looked at the market over the past couple of years, at least for the near term, with less available top line growth, we wanted to make sure that we were still delivering a competitive return for our shareholders, and that meant more on the margins. That was kind of one input. The other is that setting a target -- and Ken kind of touched on this, it does makes you think differently. And it's brought to bear more ideas in terms of where we can find efficiencies, and we've done it throughout our P&L and our balance sheet. And as a result, it's creating flex for us to reinvest back in our business. And I think those are all good things.

There's actually 3 things and they really all revolve around working capital. The first is, a year ago, we had a big payable from the Green Giant sale that hit our operating cash flow even though the, obviously, the cash that came out was -- or cash that came in was in the financing section -- or in the investment section, excuse me. So we had a large liability that will not, obviously, reoccur this year. So that was $160 million, I believe, in the -- at this point last year. So that will change the complexion of our working capital in the balance of the year. The other is our trade and advertising accruals. As we've said, our media, our trade was down in the first half even a bit more than we had planned and anticipated. As we reinvest more in the back half, those accruals will come up, again favorably impacting working capital. And the last thing, the one that's the most, I guess, sustainable that will carry forward into F '18 as well is our focus on core working capital. Inventory was a bit higher than we wanted it to be at the end of the second quarter, and that's because volumes did not come in as anticipated. That will even out and come down as the year unfolds. And then most importantly, as we continue to work on our payables and as we move our vendors to 90-day terms, we'll see that benefit start to accrete more in the second half, and again, more in '18 as well. So it's all in our working capital and it's those 3 big items, the tax payable on the Green Giant divestiture a year ago that we're rolling over, the level of advertising and trade payables that will increase as the year goes on as we increase investments in those 2 areas and then -- and in the core -- our continued work on reducing core working capital."

We think it will be up closer to 200 basis points in the back half of the year. So at full year, we'll be below our original 150 guidance, probably more in the 100 to 120 range. But it will improve in the back half for some substantial reasons. First off, we'll get better volume leverage as we see improved sales in the back half, which is primarily from volume, so our gross margin will benefit from that. The comps from last year, if you look at our trend last year, our gross margin expansion was essentially all in the first half, and that was due to inflation phasing, where inflation accelerated during the course of F '16. Last year, gross margins were up 170 basis points in the first half. It was actually about flat in the second half, and actually Q3 was down 130 basis points. So again, I think that gross margin expansion this year on a comparable basis will skew to Q4. To your specific question on inflation, we think it's fairly stable through the course of the year, a slight deceleration in the back half and the fourth quarter. And obviously, we'll see pretty steady contributions from HMM exceeding that inflation. Our cost actions will build during the course of the year. That will help gross margin in the back half. And then transaction FX, which, for the full year will be about a $50 million drag for us. But $35 million of that is in the first half, as I said in my comments. The pound will continue to impact us in the back half, but we think the Canadian dollar will be less so. So we've absorbed the majority of the transaction FX negative in the first half, so that'll be less of a drag in the second. So really those 4 things: the volume leverage that we'll get in the second half slightly better than the first half; the comps, particularly around inflation phasing will favor the back half of this year, again, especially in the fourth quarter; our cost actions will build around Project Century benefits; and then transaction FX, still a negative but a lighter negative in the back half."

Building on that, to get to your 150 full year EBIT margin expansion, A&P is adding -- on track to add around 100 bps to margins. And maybe you spend some back, so let's just say at 75. So between GM and A&P, you'll have 200 bps of margin cushion there, implying some SG&A leakage at margin despite all the aggressive cost cuts. Is that just a product of some of the sales softness? Is it a cadence of the SG&A discipline? I don't know, maybe you could shed some light on that."

But from an advertising standpoint, in the back half of the year, we said in the last call we expect advertising after the first quarter will be down double digits for the year. We still believe that, probably mid-teens, which means it will be better in the back half. Still down slightly, but importantly, up in some key businesses. As a matter of fact, if you look at our growth businesses in the back half, excluding U.S. Yogurt, which we've always said we're going to really rightsize our investment there, given our historical share of voice, excluding U.S. yogurt, our growth businesses, advertising investment, media investment will be up low single digits in the back half. Again, fairly spread across the businesses that Jeff talked to. So we'll see that in the back half. And actually, our admin continues to be below last year, both at the -- within SOP and then on the corporate level as well, so that's actually a contributor. Obviously, what's different is that sales are lower and volume is lower than we started the year, and that's an offset. So again, I didn't exactly follow your math, but we expect to get our 150 basis points of operating margin expansion. We'll get a good piece of that, as you noted, through gross margin, and we'll get the balance through the rest of the P&L. But all lines, including administrative costs and overhead costs, will contribute."

As we look at the second half of the year, I mean, the biggest improvement we'll see will be in Europe. And -- which is a very profitable business for us. And we improved that business in the second quarter from the first quarter. We had a tough summer, based on Häagen-Dazs sales as well as the Yoplait integration. But we saw the second quarter improve on Häagen-Dazs and -- as well as OEP, Old El Paso, and bars, and we expect that to continue in the second half of the year. We've got really good innovation on Häagen-Dazs, good innovation on Old El Paso, and we continue to expand our bars business. So -- and the integration of our Yoplait business with our European business will be largely behind us, so we expect improved performance from there. So I would say, in the second half, you'll see that. But I also want to mention that what we see is that our 2 largest developing markets, China and Brazil, have returned to growth, if you look at organic growth. They're somehow -- they're a little bit clouded by some restructuring we've been doing of our Snacks business in China and of our acquisition of Yogurt in Brazil. But underlying that, in China, we're back to mid-single-digit organic growth. We're growing our Wanchai Ferry business. We're growing Häagen-Dazs, and we continue to see good growth from Yogurt. And we're back to growth in Brazil as well, and we're kind of -- we're executing better in Brazil and so we're back to growth there.
