Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and our progress on the strategic changes we've implemented at Campbell over the past year. Overall",2122,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and our progress on the strategic changes we've implemented at Campbell over the past year. Overall, I'm pleased with our results this quarter but not satisfied with our sales performance. We delivered outstanding adjusted EBIT and EPS growth. I'm particularly happy with our continued gross margin expansion, improved execution from our supply chain team and the progress we've made on our cost savings initiative. 
Organic sales for the quarter were comparable to a year ago, a bit below our expectations as our categories and geographies continue to face challenging conditions. As I discussed last week at CAGNY, the macroeconomic conditions are challenging in many of the markets where we have operations. In the United States, consumer spending remains cautious. In other parts of the world, financial capitals are grappling with the weakening economies and increased volatility. We recognized that sales growth in many of our center store categories has been a key challenge for Campbell. Driving profitable net sales growth remains an area of focus for our entire team. 
Our supply chain execution continued to improve this quarter. We've now delivered 4 consecutive quarters of improved supply chain performance dating back to the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As we head into the second half of the year, we expect to sustain this performance. However, we'll begin cycling our improved operations and the rate of improvement will likely come at a more modest pace. 
I'm also extremely pleased with the overdelivery of our 3-year cost savings initiative. Through a combination of our organization redesign, the creation of our Integrated Global Services group, headcount reductions, more stringent policies and the implementation of zero-based budgeting, Campbell is becoming a leaner, more effective and more efficient company. In addition to lowering our cost base, we're seeing signs of cultural change as employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. 
We're reaping the benefits of our cost savings efforts ahead of our expectations and we continue to identify additional savings opportunities. As a result, we increased our 2018 savings target to $300 million, up from the $200 million objective we set when we introduced the program 1 year ago. We'll continue to invest a portion of these savings into our businesses based on their portfolio roles and longer-term growth opportunities that we've identified to create shareholder value over time. For instance, we plan to make several investments on the second half of the year in the areas of new product development and support for several of our key brands. Additionally, we're building new capabilities in areas such as e-commerce. 
As announced last week, we raised our annual earnings guidance and now expect adjusted EBIT to increase to 13% and adjusted EPS to grow by 9% to 12%. We continue to expect the outlook for net sales to be in the range of negative 1% to 0%. The improved outlook for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS are primarily due to improved gross margin performance and the better-than-expected benefits of our cost savings initiative. 
Now I'd like to share my perspective on our segment results. Let's start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. As we've previously outlined, we're focused on increasing net price realization including optimizing promotion spending and improving our supply chain performance. I'm encouraged by the progress we've made against all 3 of them. 
Organic sales declined by 1% in the quarter predominantly driven by a decline in U.S. Soup sales. As context, the entire wet soup category declined 3% for the 13 weeks ended January 31. Our soup sales down 4% were below our expectations although we had some bright spots. Our condensed soup business was up for the quarter and our broth business grew nicely. However, declines in ready-to-serve soup more than offset those gains. Let me explain the factors at play. 
As we discussed back in the first quarter, we began taking steps to increase our net price realization through a combination of pricing actions and implementing more balanced promotion plans to support our business. As anticipated, these price realization activities had a negative impact on volume but it was a necessary step to address the historical lack of price realization in RTF and strategically important for our entire soup portfolio. 
Another factor was the timing of our marketing plans. As we discussed in the first quarter, our marketing and merchandising support was planned for late in the year across the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter. We also experienced some execution issues related to an on-label promotion on our Chunky brand. 
Finally, weather is not something we control and it's certainly not the main reason for the decline in our soup business, but we believe the unusually warm winter had a negative impact on the entire category in the first half. In January, we grew soup sales in the high single digits as we began to address our execution issues in Chunky, ramped up marketing activities, implemented more effective promotions and benefited from more seasonal weather. Our plans will continue into the third quarter. Despite these headwinds, we're taking steps to improve the performance of our U.S. Soup business. Our pricing actions are taking hold. We've implemented more impactful promotion programs and our new advertising campaign is resonating with consumers. This bodes well for the future. 
Beyond soup, our Simple Meals business performed well in the quarter, with solid sales growth in Prego, Pace and especially Plum. We told you last July that our innovation plans in the Americas would focus on fewer bigger ideas. In our quest to ramp up innovation, we recognize that some things will work and others will not. The key is to recognize it early and move on, and that's precisely what we're doing. 
Overall, our innovation results are mixed. On the plus side, Campbell's Dinner Sauces platform and Slow Kettle soups continue to grow and are overindexing will millennials. Campbell's organic soups line is meeting expectations and helping us expand our health and well-being options in the center store. In our beverage business, we're pleased with V8 Veggie Blends and V8 + Energy. Finally, the innovation driving the expansion of our Plum portfolio is robust as this brand continues to build loyalty with millennial parents. 
Now let's look at what's not working as well. Pace and Prego ready meals and Campbell's Fresh-Brewed Soups and K-Cups are performing below expectations and we're taking steps to evaluate the root cause and course correct. Additionally, we've discontinued the V8 protein line. Our key learning was that these shakes and bars were not differentiated enough to succeed in a crowded and competitive space. We recently hired Greg Shewchuk as our new Chief Marketing and Commercial Officer for the Americas division. With his extensive experience, we expect he will lead accelerated marketing innovation and sharpen our focus on fewer bigger initiatives. We're excited to welcome Greg to the team in early March. 
Clearly, the highlight in the Americas division was the significant gross margin expansion and the 22% increase in operating earnings. A major improvement this quarter was our supply chain performance. In addition to our ongoing productivity programs, we improved our execution in transportation and warehousing. We also benefited from the benign inflationary environment. Overall, our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division continues to make progress in delivering against its portfolio role. 
Moving on. Our global Biscuits and Snacks division performed well in the quarter, delivering organic sales growth and driving significant profit. This division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses and its portfolio role is to manage growth while improving margins in both developed and developing markets. Our core developed markets of Australia and United States continued to deliver positive results. 
I'm pleased with the performance in our U.S. Biscuits and Bakery business with sales growth across numerous Pepperidge Farm categories including fresh bakery, frozen and cookies. Looking ahead, we have solid innovation plans in place in our core developed markets with new products in the U.S. such as the launch of artisan rolls and the introduction of Goldfish crackers with organic wheat. In Australia, we're restaging our Shapes product like to increase the flavor of these popular snacks. 
Turning to developing markets. Excluding the impact of currency, sales growth in Malaysia was offset by the declines in Indonesia, where economic conditions remain challenging. While we're expecting the Indonesian economy to improve in the second half of the year, we don't expect our business to return to growth this year. In China, our primary focus has been the Kelsen business. We've made many changes to improve this business since acquiring it in August 2013. At the end of fiscal 2015, we changed distributors, added new marketing and digital talent and began ramping up our sales force. We had a solid sell-in for the Chinese New Year, our biggest and most important season, and our new distributors delivered strong execution including merchandising supported by our new integrated marketing campaign. As I discussed last week at CAGNY, we believe it's important for Campbell to become more geographically diverse despite short-term volatility in developing markets. 
Turning now to Campbell Fresh. C-Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and our Refrigerated Soup business. This division's portfolio role is to accelerate sales growth and expand into new Packaged Fresh categories. Reported segment sales increased 10% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales were comparable to a year ago. In Bolthouse Farms, we delivered mid-single-digit sales growth in beverages and double-digit gains in refrigerated salad dressings. 
Carrot sales were down slightly although we grew share. We continued to drive growth in the faster-growing organic segment of the carrot market and we're taking steps to increase our presence there. As a reminder, one of the key roles of our market-leading carrot business is to provide the refrigerated logistic system and scale in the perimeter that we can leverage for distribution and merchandising of our CPG business. Our carrot ingredients business remains challenged with the significant decline in the quarter related to reduced export demand from Japan. As expected, the rate of decline moderated in the quarter and we expect that trend to continue in the back half of the year. We're happy with the margin expansion in C-Fresh and the increased operating profit. We've invested in capacity, enabling us to increase our in-house production. We rationalized unproductive beverage SKUs. We've increased our supply chain productivity and we've managed SG&A. However, C-Fres is portfolio role is full force growth, and we expect stronger top line performance from the CPG portion of this business. Looking ahead, we expect improved sales growth in C-Fresh in the second half of the year to be driven by stronger performance in the CPG business and moderating declines in carrot ingredients. We have one of the strongest spring innovation efforts in several years. We'll add 14 new items across beverages and salad dressings including 6 new varieties of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, our ultra-premium coldpressed organic juice line. With our increased capacity coming online this month, we expect to expand our ACV distribution of 1915 to 50% this year, largely in line with the category. 
The integration of Garden Fresh Gourmet and our retail perimeter soup business into C-Fresh is progressing well. Sales of retail soup were up modestly in the quarter and Garden Fresh Gourmet is tracking to deliver the sales we expected through increase distribution and increased market penetration. 
We've accomplished a great deal over the last 12 months as we've aligned our enterprise structure with our strategy, created 3 new divisions with strong leadership, defined clear portfolio roles and implemented a major cost savings initiative. We're now better positioned to execute our strategies and to invest in the areas of our business that hold the greatest growth potential including several investments in the second half of this year. 
Against this backdrop, I'm encouraged by our performance this quarter. Our enterprise redesign and cost savings efforts are delivering better-than-expected results and our new divisions are beginning to perform in line with their portfolio roles, but we remain unsatisfied with our top line growth and I know we can do better. We expect to improve our growth profile in the second half and we continue to stay focused on driving long-term sustainable, profitable net sales growth. 
I look forward to answering your questions, but now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."

Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the second quarter. At the top line, organic sales, which were comparable to last year, were below our expectations, reflecting the sales performance of U.S. Soups. We made outstanding progress in gross margins, up 4 percentage points on an adjusted basis, benefiting from our price realization actions and supply chain performance. Our cost savings initiatives are delivering significant benefits, $50 million in the second quarter. And as we shared at CAGNY last week, we've raised our 3-year savings target to $300 million, with these savings impacting multiple P&L lines. Based on our gross margin performance and incremental cost savings, we also raised our full year earnings guidance last week, and I'll provide more details in a moment. 
Now I'll take you through the detailed results in our 2016 guidance. For the second quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 1% to $2.2 billion primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks were offset by declines in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. 
Reflecting a 4 point increase in operating margin, adjusted EBIT increased 26% to $423 million benefiting from a higher gross margin percentage and savings from our cost reduction initiative. These positive drivers were partly offset by higher incentive compensation costs, currency translation, which had a 3 point [indiscernible] impact and lower volumes. Adjusted EPS increased 23% to $0.87. For the first half, net sales on an as-reported basis were down 2% while organic sales were comparable to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT increased 24% and adjusted EPS of $1.82 was up 21%. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter, reported sales declined 1% with organic sales comparable to the prior year. Within organic sales, volume and mix attracted 2 points was primarily driven by U.S. Soup within the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment. Higher selling prices contributed 1 point while lower promotional spending also added a point, both driven by our net price realization efforts in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and in Global Biscuits and Snacks. Currency translation had an average impact of 2 points on the top line as our 2 primary foreign currency, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar, weakened against the U.S. dollar. To complete the bridge, the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet contributed 1 point to net sales in the quarter. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 4 points to 37.3% exceeding our expectations on lower-than-anticipated cost inflation and better-than-anticipated supply chain performance. Compared to the year-ago period, within inflation and other, we experienced improve supply chain performance primarily from transportation cost savings initiatives as well as lower losses on open commodity contracts. In aggregate, inflation on input costs was close to 0. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 20 basis points. Our net price realization actions contributed 1.4 points of margin expansion with 50 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principal [ph] trade reductions in U.S. Soup and Pepperidge Farm and 90 basis points from higher selling prices. 
Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our 3-year cost savings program, contributed 180 basis points to margin improvement in the quarter. Recent capacity additions in Bolthouse Farms and U.S. broth as well as our soup common platform initiative are contributing to these productivity gains.
Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted marketing and selling expenses declined 5% in the quarter primarily due to reductions in nonworking marketing from our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by higher advertising and consumer promotion expense, driven by increases in Kelsen, Pepperidge Farm and U.S. Soup. Adjusted administrative expenses increased 6% primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs compared to a year ago, partly offset by benefits from our cost savings initiative. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. As you can see, in aggregate, adjusted EPS increased $0.16 compared with the prior year from $0.71 to $0.87 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT mostly from the gross margin expansion and benefits from our cost savings initiatives contributed $0.22 to EPS growth. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly but had no impact on EPS for the quarter. And while net interest expense increased $2 million as we extended the majority of the debt portfolio in fiscal 2015, this also had no impact on EPS for the quarter. Going the other way, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31.6%, up 2.8 points versus the prior year primarily due to lapping the favorable resolution of an intercompany pricing agreement, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.04. Currency had a $0.03 negative impact in EPS in the quarter completing the bridge to $0.87 per share.
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 1% to $1.2 billion. U.S. Soup sales decreased 4% driven by declines in ready-to-serve soups partly offset by gains in broth and condensed soup. Sales of other U.S. Simple Meals increased driven by gains in Plum, Prego pasta sauces and Pace Mexican sauces. Sales of U.S. Beverages declined primarily due to weakness in V8 Fusion beverages. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales in Canada decreased driven by declines in soup. Operating earnings increased 22%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage which benefited from net price realization, productivity gains and improved supply chain performance. 
Reflecting declines in ready-to-serve soups, total U.S. Soup sales declined 4% driven by category declines from warmer weather, the volume impact from our pricing actions, the timing of our marketing programs and an issue with the on-label promotion on Chunky, which has since been corrected. Within U.S. Soup, RTS declined 20%, which was partly offset by a 7% gain in Swanson broth and a 2% gain in condensed. We began and ended the quarter with retailer inventory in aggregate comparable to year-ago levels. As we said last quarter, we do not believe subcategory sales performance is a meaningful disclosure. We will continue to provide it through the fiscal year before discontinuing in 2017. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending January 31, 2016, the category as a whole declined 1.9%. Our sales in measured channels declined 2.8% with weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% [ph] market share, a decline of 50 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, up 30 basis points reflecting share gains by smaller brands.
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2% with growth in Pepperidge Farm and the Asia-Pacific region. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by fresh bakery, frozen products and cookies. Sales of Goldfish crackers were up slightly for the quarter with modest share gains for the first half of the fiscal year. In the Asia-Pacific region, excluding the impact of currency translation, growth in Australia, driven by Arnott's Tim Tam biscuits, was partially offset by declines in Indonesia as that market continues to face economic challenges. Operating earnings increased 23% primarily driven by a higher gross margin percentage which benefited from net price realization and productivity gains, partly offset by the negative impact of currency translation. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales were comparable to the prior year with gains in Bolthouse Farms premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, which, on a combined basis, grew mid-single digits offset by declines in carrot ingredient export sales and declines in retail carrots despite gaining share. 
Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 10 points of sales growth to the segment. Operating earnings grew 62% to $21 million driven by a higher gross margin percentage which benefited from improved supply chain performance, productivity improvements and the favorable mix impact from growth in the higher-margin refrigerated beverages. This performance resulted in a 2 point improvement in operating margin for the segment compared to a year ago. 
We had strong cash flow performance in the first half. Cash from operations increased by $143 million to $727 million driven by higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements. Capital expenditures increased $10 million to $153 million. We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2016. We paid dividends totaling $197 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of 31.2 cents per share. In aggregate, we repurchased $86 million of shares in the first half, $50 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt declined by approximately $150 million as positive net cash flow generated by the business more than offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Now I will review our 2016 guidance, which is consistent with our news release on February 16. We expect sales to change by minus 1% to 0% including a 1 point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet and a 2 point negative impact from currency translation as compared to the previous estimated currency impact of 3 points. This sales guidance implies a reduction in organic sales compared to our previous guidance, reflecting the performance of U.S. Soup. Benefiting from gross margin performance and incremental cost savings, we expect adjusted EBIT to grow by 10% to 13% and adjusted EPS to grow by 9% to 12%. 
Our full year guidance implies a modest earnings declines in the back of of the year. This reflects investments we are making in new product launches, higher marketing spending and headwinds from higher incentive compensation and the negative impact of currency on the input cost of our international businesses. We expect adjusted gross margin to expand by approximately 175 basis points driven primarily by our first half performance. In the back half, we anticipate headwinds from increased promotional spending to support new products and key brands, the negative impact of currency on the EBIT course cost of our international businesses and from modest cost inflation. Offsetting these headwinds, gross margin will benefit from our cost savings initiatives and productivity gains but we will be wrapping much of the pricing and improved supply chain performance we experienced in the first half. Against our cost savings program, we expect to deliver savings in the range of $120 million to $140 million in 2016 compared to our previous range of $80 million to $100 million. As announced last week, we have increased our 2018 annual savings sales target from $250 million to $300 million. Also, we expect the full year adjusted tax rates to be approximately 33%. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

Yes, we are giving guidance on gross margin and we expect 175 basis points of gross margin improvement for the year. So that implies about a flattish back half, but let me try to give some more context on this one. I think if you go back to the last fiscal year 2015, it really is a story of 2 halves. In the first half of the last year, gross margin was down about 2 points. And then the second half of last year, gross margin was up 1.4 points as we took some pricing and improved our supply chain performance in the back half. So if you look at it on a 2-year basis both the first and the second half of this year are each up just over a point versus 2 years ago. And the reason we're flat in the back half, there's a couple of things, there's a couple of headwinds. One is higher promotional spending to support some new product launches and some key brands and, as I mentioned in my comments, the negative impact of currency on cost. So both our Australian business and our Canadian business have a significant portion of their inputs are denominated in U.S. dollar and we were hedged for a while, but we're closer to market now on those currency impacts. So that's having an increasing impact. And we still have a little bit of cost inflation although it's more moderate than you certainly had initially expected. And we believe we'll be able to offset all that impact with continuing productivity gains and the benefits of our cost savings program."

So in C-Fresh, we're going to be supporting our strongest innovation effort in several years with 4 key new products including new varieties of 1915. In Global Baking and Snacking, we're investing in Goldfish with the launch of organic wheat Goldfish. We're investing in Tim Tam and the relaunch of Shapes in Australia. And then in the Americas, we still have marketing activity that, remember, we staged later in the year to support our soup and our beverage businesses as well as product launches across Simple Meals and a robust pipeline for Plum Organics. So we have a lot of activity planned in the second half and this does reflect an acceleration."

Well, first of all, when you step back, the entire wet soup category was down 3% and we were down 4%, and we were up in condensed by 2% and up in broth by 7%. In the RTS, particularly in Chunky, is where we experienced our issue. Recall we did take net price realization. So that's a combination of pricing actions and also promotion actions, and that's not an easy one because you've got a marketplace where some of the marketplaces are high low on promotions and some of them is EDLP. So finding that right rhythm is an important idea. The other thing is the competitive landscape. We have to take that into consideration as well. In the case of Chunky, we actually had a promotion on pack label that cause consumer confusion and we are largely out of that right now, so that one is behind us. And then finally, we launched a portfolio campaign which really helped our condensed soup but it did not do the job on brand Chunky. And so it wasn't until later in the quarter that we came in with dedicated advertising, and that will continue into quarter 3. And again, I do not really want to give the weather report, but it really was, relative to last year, a much warmer winter. So we really expect soup to grow modestly consistent with other [indiscernible] store categories. We are continuing to invest in the soup business and we are continuing to invest in the quality of the product. So it's not any one silver bullet. It's a combination of things."

Let me give you some examples. In the Americas, even though we're managing Americas for modest growth and margin expansion, the Americas still has some pockets of full force growth businesses, and we will continue to invest, first of all, in the quality of our products and making sure that we're looking at ingredients and the quality against our purpose of real food that matters for life's moments. Second of all, we continue to invest in our sauces business, which is really healthy and our broth business. And then finally having made the acquisition of Plum Organics, we're incredibly pleased with the performance of that business and seal a lot of runway in the innovation pipeline to make smart investments and continue to cultivate relationships with millennial parents. And the Global Biscuits and Snacks front, we are very committed to expanding the Kelsen business in China and beyond. We have plans for increasing our footprint of the Tim Tam brands. And as I mentioned, we are continuously working on product quality, for example, the investment we're making back in our Shapes business. We are, in the United States, continuing to work on our Goldfish brand, and we believe there's more growth in that brand particularly as we move into products in the health and well-being space. And then finally, C-Fresh is our full force growth and we've been very pleased with the portfolio of brands and categories in the produce area and in the deli part of this perimeter. Inclusive of our refrigerated soup, between the beverages, the salad dressings, the hummus, the sauces and the soup, we have a lot to work with and we have capabilities in each one of those categories and just able that we can actually bring into the fresh space. So we have a very energized team across all 3 of these divisions to do so. So I think based on 5 years ago, we have a lot more to work with. And so making sure that we make smart investments and have a discipline about it is important but we have a lot of places where we could put our dollars."

So that's what you see on the P&L. Inside of cost, the inflation on input cost was about flat compared to a year ago. So it was neither a help nor a hindrance on our gross margin, but it's certainly more modest than it's been. And in cost, what you're seeing is a few different things coming out of the supply chain and kind of breaking down into 3 chunks. One is it's just better supply chain performance, and what we mean by that is that the plans are operating at higher efficiency levels. Our customer service levels are back above our targets, and as a result, we see lower into plans shipments. We see fewer, less than truckload shipments. So we have better weights. We actually have less miles. So that's all kind of within how we're operating. And then we have a portion of our cost savings initiative that's coming through, and this is primarily in the area of transportation and in the fact that we worked our entire transportation network last year. So we've recontracted it. We have increased permitted carrier capacity. At the same time, we've achieved lower rates. And as a result of our service levels be where they are, we really had been almost a 0 use of the spot market, so that's a premium cost we have last year that we don't have this year. And the third bucket is what we call productivity where we have specific actions that the supply chain has taken to generate cost savings, a couple of examples within that would be the capacity and the additions in Bolthouse Farms and in our U.S. broth business have allowed us to repatriate production from co-packer. So we're seeing that benefit come through. The other one is our Soup Common Platform initiative, which we're also seeing benefit on the P&L and, lastly, warehousing capacity we've made some investments on our own internal where housing so we've reduced some of our lines in our third-party warehousing and some of those cost reductions coming through as well."

It has been sluggish and it is a major source of profit for retailers, and we believe that we've got the portfolio that not only can jazz the center store but it also toggles into the perimeter as well because many of our brands in the center store are using conjunction with products that consumers will buy in the perimeter as well. So we continue to work with them on those kinds of goals and their mutual goals. So the way we look at our trade is as an investment, where we hope to continue to build a return on that investment by good planning with retailers."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and our progress on the strategic changes we've implemented at Campbell over the past year. Overall",2124,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and our progress on the strategic changes we've implemented at Campbell over the past year. Overall, I'm pleased with our results this quarter, but not satisfied with our sales performance. We delivered outstanding adjusted EBIT and EPS growth. I'm particularly happy with our continued gross margin expansion, improved execution from our supply chain team and the progress we've made on our costs savings initiative. 
Organic sales for the quarter were comparable to a year ago, a bit below our expectations as our categories and geographies continue to face challenging conditions. 
As I discussed last week at CAGNY, the macroeconomic conditions are challenging in many of the markets where we have operations. In the United States, consumer spending remains cautious. In other parts of the world, financial capitals are grappling with the weakening economies and increased volatility. We recognize that sales growth in many of our center store categories has been a key challenge for Campbell. Driving profitable net sales growth remains an area of focus for our entire team. 
Our supply chain execution continued to improve this quarter. We've now delivered 4 consecutive quarters of improved supply chain performance dating back to the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As we head into the second half of the year, we expect to sustain this performance. However, we'll begin cycling our improved operations and the rate of improvement will likely come at a more modest pace. 
I'm also extremely pleased with the over delivery of our 3-year cost savings initiative. Through a combination of our organization redesign, the creation of our Integrated Global Services group, headcount reductions, more stringent policies and the implementation of zero-based budgeting, Campbell is becoming a leaner, more effective and more efficient company. In addition to lowering our cost base, we're seeing signs of cultural change as employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. 
We're reaping the benefits of our cost savings efforts ahead of our expectations and we continue to identify additional savings opportunities. As a result, we increased our 2018 savings target to $300 million, up from the $200 million objective we set when we introduced the program 1 year ago. We'll continue to invest a portion of these savings into our businesses based on their portfolio roles and longer-term growth opportunities that we've identified to create shareholder value over time. For instance, we plan to make several investments in the second half of the year in the areas of new product development and support for several of our key brands. Additionally, we're building new capabilities in areas such as e-commerce. 
As announced last week, we raised our annual earnings guidance and now expect adjusted EBIT to increase to 13% and adjusted EPS to grow by 9% to 12%. We continue to expect the outlook for net sales to be in the range of negative 1% to 0%. The improved outlook for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS are primarily due to improved gross margin performance and the better-than-expected benefits of our cost savings initiative. 
Now I'd like to share my perspective on our segment results. Let's start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. As we've previously outlined, we're focused on increasing net price realization, including optimizing promotion spending and improving our supply chain performance. I'm encouraged by the progress we've made against all 3 of them. 
Organic sales declined by 1% in the quarter predominantly driven by a decline in U.S. soup sales. As context, the entire wet soup category declined 3% for the 13 weeks ended January 31. Our soup sales down 4% were below our expectations although we had some bright spots. Our condensed soup business was up for the quarter and our broth business grew nicely. However, declines in ready-to-serve soup more than offset those gains. Let me explain the factors at play. 
As we discussed back in the first quarter, we began taking steps to increase our net price realization through a combination of pricing actions and implementing more balanced promotion plans to support our business. As we anticipated, these price realization activities had a negative impact on volume, but it was a necessary step to address the historical lack of price realization in RTS and strategically important for our entire soup portfolio. 
Another factor was the timing of our marketing plans. As we discussed in the first quarter, our marketing and merchandising support was planned for late in the year across the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter. We also experienced some execution issues related to an on-label promotion on our Chunky brand. 
Finally, weather is not something we control and it's certainly not the main reason for the decline in our soup business, but we believe the unusually warm winter had a negative impact on the entire category in the first half. 
In January, we grew soup sales in the high single digits as we began to address our execution issues in Chunky, ramped up marketing activities, implemented more effective promotions and benefited from more seasonal weather. Our plans will continue into the third quarter. Despite these headwinds, we're taking steps to improve the performance of our U.S. soup business. Our pricing actions are taking hold. We've implemented more impactful promotion programs and our new advertising campaign is resonating with consumers. This bodes well for the future. 
Beyond soup, our simple meals business performed well in the quarter, with solid sales growth in Prego, Pace and especially Plum. We told you last July that our innovation plans in the Americas would focus on fewer, bigger ideas. In our quest to ramp up innovation, we recognize that some things will work and others will not. The key is to recognize it early and move on, and that's precisely what we're doing. 
Overall, our innovation results are mixed. On the plus side, Campbell's Dinner Sauces platform and Slow Kettle soups continued to grow and are overindexing will millennials. Campbell's organic soups line is meeting expectations and helping us expand our health and well-being options in the center store. In our beverage business, we're pleased with V8 Veggie Blends and V8 + Energy. Finally, the innovation driving the expansion of our Plum portfolio is robust as this brand continues to build loyalty with millennial parents. 
Now let's look at what's not working as well. Pace and Prego ready meals and Campbell's Fresh-Brewed Soups and K-Cups are performing below expectations and we're taking steps to evaluate the root cause and course correct. Additionally, we've discontinued the V8 protein line. Our key learning was that these shakes and bars were not differentiated enough to succeed in a crowded and competitive space. 
We recently hired Greg Shewchuk, as our new Chief Marketing and Commercial Officer for the Americas division. With his extensive experience, we expect he will lead accelerated marketing innovation and sharpen our focus on fewer, bigger initiatives. We're excited to welcome Greg to the team in early March. 
Clearly, the highlight in the Americas division was the significant gross margin expansion and the 22% increase in operating earnings. A major improvement this quarter was our supply chain performance. In addition to our ongoing productivity programs, we improved our execution in transportation and warehousing. We also benefited from the benign inflationary environment. Overall, our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division continues to make progress in delivering against its portfolio role. 
Moving on, our Global Biscuits and Snacks division performed well in the quarter, delivering organic sales growth and driving significant profit. This division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses and its portfolio role is to manage growth while improving margins in both developed and developing markets. Our core developed markets of Australia and the United States continued to deliver positive results. 
I'm pleased with the performance in our U.S. biscuits and bakery business with sales growth across numerous Pepperidge Farm categories, including fresh bakery, frozen and cookies. Looking ahead, we have solid innovation plans in place in our core developed markets with new products in the U.S., such as the launch of artisan rolls and the introduction of Goldfish crackers with organic wheat. In Australia, we're restaging our Shapes product like to increase the flavor of these popular snacks. 
Turning to developing markets. Excluding the impact of currency, sales growth in Malaysia was offset by the declines in Indonesia, where economic conditions remain challenging. While we're expecting the Indonesian economy to improve in the second half of the year, we don't expect our business to return to growth this year. 
In China, our primary focus has been the Kelsen business. We've made many changes to improve this business since acquiring it in August 2013. At the end of fiscal 2015, we changed distributors, added new marketing and digital talent and began ramping up our sales force. We had a solid sell-in for the Chinese New Year, our biggest and most important season, and our new distributors delivered strong execution, including merchandising supported by our new integrated marketing campaign. As I discussed last week at CAGNY, we believe it's important for Campbell to become more geographically diverse despite short-term volatility in developing markets. 
Turning now to Campbell Fresh. C-Fresh, includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and our refrigerated soup business. This division's portfolio role is to accelerate sales growth and expand into new Packaged Fresh categories. 
Reported segment sales increased 10% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales were comparable to a year ago. In Bolthouse Farms, we delivered mid-single-digit sales growth in beverages and double-digit gains in refrigerated salad dressings. 
Carrot sales were down slightly, although, we grew share. We continued to drive growth in the faster-growing organic segment of the carrot market and we're taking steps to increase our presence there. As a reminder, one of the key roles of our market-leading carrot business is to provide the refrigerated logistic system and scale in the perimeter that we can leverage for distribution and merchandising of our CPG business. 
Our carrot ingredients business remains challenged with a significant decline in the quarter related to reduced export demand from Japan. As expected, the rate of decline moderated in the quarter and we expect that trend to continue in the back half of the year. 
We're happy with the margin expansion in C-Fresh and the increased operating profit. We've invested in capacity, enabling us to increase our in-house production. We rationalized unproductive beverage SKUs. We've increased our supply chain productivity and we've managed SG&A. However, C-Fresh's portfolio role is full force growth, and we expect stronger top line performance from the CPG portion of this business. 
Looking ahead, we expect improved sales growth in C-Fresh in the second half of the year to be driven by stronger performance in the CPG business and moderating declines in carrot ingredients. We have one of the strongest spring innovation efforts in several years. We'll add 14 new items across beverages and salad dressings, including 6 new varieties of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, our ultra-premium cold-pressed organic juice line. With our increased capacity coming online this month, we expect to expand our ACV distribution of 1915 to 50% this year, largely in line with the category. 
The integration of Garden Fresh Gourmet and our retail perimeter soup business into C-Fresh is progressing well. Sales of retail soup were up modestly in the quarter and Garden Fresh Gourmet is tracking to deliver the sales we expected through increased distribution and increased market penetration. 
We've accomplished a great deal over the last 12 months as we've aligned our enterprise structure with our strategy, created 3 new divisions with strong leadership, defined clear portfolio roles and implemented a major cost savings initiative. We're now better positioned to execute our strategies and to invest in the areas of our business that hold the greatest growth potential, including several investments in the second half of this year. Against this backdrop, I'm encouraged by our performance this quarter. 
Our enterprise redesign and cost savings efforts are delivering better-than-expected results and our new divisions are beginning to perform in line with their portfolio roles. But we remain unsatisfied with our top line growth and I know we can do better. We expect to improve our growth profile in the second half and we continue to stay focused on driving long-term sustainable, profitable net sales growth. 
I look forward to answering your questions, but now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."

Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the second quarter. At the top line, organic sales, which were comparable to last year, were below our expectations, reflecting the sales performance of U.S. soups. We made outstanding progress in gross margins, up 4 percentage points on an adjusted basis, benefiting from our price realization actions and supply chain performance. Our cost savings initiatives are delivering significant benefits, $50 million in the second quarter. And as we shared at CAGNY last week, we've raised our 3-year savings target to $300 million, with these savings impacting multiple P&L line. Based on our gross margin performance and incremental cost savings, we also raised our full year earnings guidance last week, and I'll provide more details in a moment. 
Now I'll take you through the detailed results in our 2016 guidance. For the second quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 1% to $2.2 billion, primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks were offset by declines in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. 
Reflecting a 4 point increase in operating margin, adjusted EBIT increased 26% to $423 million benefiting from a higher gross margin percentage and savings from our cost reduction initiative. These positive drivers were partly offset by higher incentive compensation costs, currency translation, which had a 3 point negative impact and lower volumes. 
Adjusted EPS increased 23% to $0.87. For the first half, net sales on an as-reported basis were down 2%, while organic sales were comparable to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT increased 24% and adjusted EPS of $1.82 was up 21%. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter, reported sales declined 1% with organic sales comparable to the prior year. Within organic sales, volume and mix attracted 2 points was primarily driven by U.S. soup within the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment. Higher selling prices contributed 1 point while lower promotional spending also added a point, both driven by our net price realization efforts in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and in Global Biscuits and Snacks. Currency translation had an average impact of 2 points on the top line as our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar, weakened against the U.S. dollar. To complete the bridge, the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet contributed 1 point to net sales in the quarter. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 4 points to 37.3% exceeding our expectations on lower-than-anticipated cost inflation and better-than-anticipated supply chain performance. Compared to the year-ago period, within inflation and other, we experienced improved supply chain performance, primarily from transportation cost savings initiatives as well as lower losses on open commodity contracts. In aggregate, inflation on input costs was close to 0. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 20 basis points.  
Our net price realization actions contributed 1.4 points of margin expansion with 50 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in U.S. Soup and Pepperidge Farm and 90 basis points from higher selling prices. 
Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our 3-year cost savings program, contributed 180 basis points to margin improvement in the quarter. Recent capacity additions in Bolthouse Farms and U.S. broth as well as our soup common platform initiative are contributing to these productivity gains.
Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted marketing and selling expenses declined 5% in the quarter, primarily due to reductions in nonworking marketing from our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by higher advertising and consumer promotion expense, driven by increases in Kelsen, Pepperidge Farm and U.S. soup. 
Adjusted administrative expenses increased 6% primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs compared to a year ago, partly offset by benefits from our cost savings initiative. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. As you can see, in aggregate, adjusted EPS increased $0.16 compared with the prior year from $0.71 to $0.87 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT mostly from the gross margin expansion and benefits from our cost savings initiatives contributed $0.22 to EPS growth. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly, but had no impact on EPS for the quarter. And while net interest expense increased $2 million as we extended the maturity on the debt portfolio in fiscal 2015, this also had no impact on EPS for the quarter. Going the other way, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31.6%, up 2.8 points versus the prior year, primarily due to lapping the favorable resolution of an intercompany pricing agreement, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.04. Currency had a $0.03 negative impact in EPS in the quarter completing the bridge to $0.87 per share.
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 1% to $1.2 billion. U.S. soup sales decreased 4% driven by declines in ready-to-serve soups, partly offset by gains in broth and condensed soup. Sales of other U.S. Simple Meals increased driven by gains in Plum, Prego pasta sauces and Pace Mexican sauces. Sales of U.S. Beverages declined, primarily due to weakness in V8 V-Fusion beverages. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales in Canada decreased driven by declines in soup. Operating earnings increased 22%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from net price realization, productivity gains and improved supply chain performance. 
Reflecting declines in ready-to-serve soups, total U.S. soup sales declined 4% driven by category declines from warmer weather, the volume impact from our pricing actions, the timing of our marketing programs and an issue with our on-label promotion on Chunky, which has since been corrected. 
Within U.S. soup, RTS declined 20%, which was partly offset by a 7% gain in Swanson broth and a 2% gain in condensed. We began and ended the quarter with the retailer inventory in aggregate comparable to year-ago levels. As we said last quarter, we do not believe subcategory sales performance is a meaningful disclosure. We will continue to provide it through the fiscal year before discontinuing in 2017. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending January 31, 2016, the category as a whole declined 1.9%. Our sales in measured channels declined 2.8% with weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decline of 50 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, up 30 basis points reflecting share gains by smaller brands.
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2% with growth in Pepperidge Farm and the Asia-Pacific region. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by fresh bakery, frozen products and cookies. Sales of Goldfish crackers were up slightly for the quarter with modest share gains for the first half of the fiscal year. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, excluding the impact of currency translation, growth in Australia, driven by Arnott's Tim Tam biscuits, was partially offset by declines in Indonesia as that market continues to face economic challenges. Operating earnings increased 23%, primarily driven by a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from net price realization and productivity gains, partly offset by the negative impact of currency translation. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales were comparable to the prior year with gains in Bolthouse Farms premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, which, on a combined basis, grew mid-single digits offset by declines in carrot ingredient export sales and declines in retail carrots despite gaining share. 
Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 10 points of sales growth to the segment. Operating earnings grew 62% to $21 million driven by a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from improved supply chain performance, productivity improvements and the favorable mix impact from growth in the higher-margin refrigerated beverages. This performance resulted in a 2 point improvement in operating margin for the segment compared to a year ago. 
We had strong cash flow performance in the first half. Cash from operations increased by $143 million to $727 million driven by higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements. Capital expenditures increased $10 million to $153 million. 
We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2016. We paid dividends totaling $197 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased $86 million of shares in the first half, $50 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt declined by approximately $150 million as positive net cash flow generated by the business more than offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Now I will review our 2016 guidance, which is consistent with our news release on February 16. We expect sales to change by minus 1% to 0%, including a 1 point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet and a 2 point negative impact from currency translation as compared to the previous estimated currency impact of 3 points. This sales guidance implies a reduction in organic sales compared to our previous guidance, reflecting the performance of U.S. soup. Benefiting from gross margin performance and incremental cost savings, we expect adjusted EBIT to grow by 10% to 13% and adjusted EPS to grow by 9% to 12%. 
Our full year guidance implies a modest earnings decline in the back half of the year. This reflects investments we are making in new product launches, higher marketing spending and headwinds from higher incentive compensation and the negative impact of currency on the input cost of our international businesses. 
We expect adjusted gross margin to expand by approximately 175 basis points driven primarily by our first half performance. In the back half, we anticipate headwinds from increased promotional spending to support new products and key brands, the negative impact of currency on the EBIT cost of our international businesses and from modest cost inflation. Offsetting these headwinds, gross margin will benefit from our cost savings initiatives and productivity gains, but we will be wrapping much of the pricing and improved supply chain performance we experienced in the first half. 
Against our cost savings program, we expect to deliver savings in the range of $120 million to $140 million in 2016 compared to our previous range of $80 million to $100 million. As announced last week, we have increased our 2018 annual savings target from $250 million to $300 million. Also, we expect the full year adjusted tax rates to be approximately 33%. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

Yes, we are giving guidance on gross margin and we expect 175 basis points of gross margin improvement for the year. So that implies about a flattish back half, but let me try to give some more context on this one. I think if you go back to last fiscal year 2015, it really is a story of 2 halves. In the first half of the last year, gross margin was down about 2 points. And then the second half of last year, gross margin was up 1.4 points as we took some pricing and improved our supply chain performance in the back half. So if you look at it on a 2-year basis both the first and second half of this year are each up just over a point versus 2 years ago. And the reason we're flat in the back half, there's a couple of things, there's a couple of headwinds. One is higher promotional spending to support some new product launches and some key brands and, as I mentioned in my comments, the negative impact of currency on cost. So both our Australian business and Canadian business have a significant portion of their inputs are denominated in U.S. dollar and we were hedged for a while, but we're closer to market now on those currency impacts. So that's having an increasing impact. And we still have a little bit of cost inflation although it's more moderate than certainly we had initially expected. And we believe we'll be able to offset all that impact with continuing productivity gains and the benefits of our cost savings program."

And then in the Americas, we still have marketing activity that, remember, we staged later in the year to support our soup and our beverage businesses as well as product launches across Simple Meals and a robust pipeline for Plum Organics.

In RTS, particularly in Chunky, is where we experienced our issue. And recall we did take net-net price realization. So that's a combination of pricing actions and also promotion actions, and that's not an easy one because you've got a marketplace where some of the marketplaces at high low on promotions and some of it is EDLP. So finding that right rhythm is an important idea. The other thing is the competitive landscape. We have to take that into consideration as well. In the case of Chunky, we actually had a promotion on pack label that cause consumer confusion and we are largely out of that right now, so that one is behind us. And then finally, we launched a portfolio campaign which really helped our condensed soup, but it did not do the job on brand Chunky. And so it wasn't until later in the quarter that we came in with dedicated advertising, and that will continue into quarter 3. And again, I do not really want to give the weather report, but it really was, relative to last year, a much warmer winter. So we really expect soup to grow modestly consistent with other center store categories. We are continuing to invest in the soup business and we are continuing to invest in the quality of the product. So it's not any one silver bullet, it's a combination of things."

We kind of redid our entire freight lane structure at the end of last year. We're seeing better rates. We're seeing almost no usage of the spot market. We're seeing better truck weight.

Let me give you some examples. In the Americas, even though we're managing Americas for modest growth and margin expansion, the Americas still has some pockets of full force growth businesses. And we will continue to invest, first of all, in the quality of our products and making sure that we're looking at ingredients and the quality against our purpose of real food that matters for life's moments. Second of all, we continued to invest in our sauces business, which is really healthy and our broth business. And then finally, having made the acquisition of Plum Organics, we're incredibly pleased with the performance of that business and seal a lot of runway in the innovation pipeline to make smart investments and continue to cultivate relationships with millennial parents. In the Global Biscuits and Snacks front, we are very committed to expanding the Kelsen business in China and beyond. We have plans for increasing our footprint of the Tim Tam brands. And as I mentioned, we are continuously working on product quality, for example, the investment we're making back in our Shapes business. We are, in the United States, continuing to work on our Goldfish brand, and we believe there's more growth in that brand, particularly as we move into products in the health and well-being space. And then finally, C-Fresh is our full force growth and we've been very pleased with the portfolio of brands and categories in the produce area and in the deli part of this perimeter. Inclusive of our refrigerated soup, between the beverages, the salad dressings, the hummus, the sauces and the soup, we have a lot to work with and we have capabilities in each one of those categories and just able that we can actually bring into the fresh space. So we have a very energized team across all 3 of these divisions to do so. So I think based on 5 years ago, we have a lot more to work with. And so making sure that we make smart investments and have a discipline about it is important, but we have a lot of places where we could put our dollars."

X that, the admin would be down as a result of our cost savings initiative. So that's what you see on the P&L. Inside of cost, the inflation on input cost was about flat compared to a year ago. So it was neither a help nor a hindrance on gross margin, but it's certainly been more modest than it's been. And in cost, what you're seeing is a few different things coming out of the supply chain and kind of breaking down into 3 chunks. One is, it is just better supply chain performance. And what we mean by that is that the plans are operating at a higher efficiency levels. Our customer service levels are back above our targets. And as a result, we see lower interplant shipments. We see fewer, less than truckload shipments. So we have better weights. We actually have less miles. So that's all kind of within how we're operating. And then we have a portion of our cost savings initiative that's coming through. And this is primarily in the area of transportation and in the fact that we worked our entire transportation network last year. So we've recontracted it. We have increased the committed carrier capacity. At the same time, we've achieved lower rates. And as a result of our service levels being where they are, we really had almost 0 use of the spot market, so that's a premium cost we had last year that we don't have this year. And the third bucket is what we call productivity where we have specific actions that supply chain has taken to generate cost savings, a couple of examples within that would be the capacity additions in Bolthouse Farms and in our U.S. broth business have allowed us to repatriate production from co-packer. So we're seeing that benefit come through. The other one is our Soup Common Platform initiative, which we're also seeing benefit on the P&L. And, lastly, warehousing capacity we've made some investments on our own internal warehousing so we've reduced our reliance on third-party warehouses and some of those cost reductions are coming through as well."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and our progress on the strategic changes we've implemented at Campbell over the past year. Overall",2124,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and our progress on the strategic changes we've implemented at Campbell over the past year. Overall, I'm pleased with our results this quarter, but not satisfied with our sales performance. We delivered outstanding adjusted EBIT and EPS growth. I'm particularly happy with our continued gross margin expansion, improved execution from our supply chain team and the progress we've made on our costs savings initiative. 
Organic sales for the quarter were comparable to a year ago, a bit below our expectations as our categories and geographies continued to face challenging conditions. 
As I discussed last week at CAGNY, the macroeconomic conditions are challenging in many of the markets where we have operations. In the United States, consumer spending remains cautious. In other parts of the world, financial capitals are grappling with the weakening economies and increased volatility. We recognize that sales growth in many of our center-store categories has been a key challenge for Campbell. Driving profitable net sales growth remains an area of focus for our entire team. 
Our supply chain execution continued to improve this quarter. We've now delivered 4 consecutive quarters of improved supply chain performance dating back to the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As we head into the second half of the year, we expect to sustain this performance. However, we'll begin cycling our improved operations and the rate of improvement will likely come at a more modest pace. 
I'm also extremely pleased with the overdelivery of our 3-year cost savings initiative. Through a combination of our organization redesign, the creation of our Integrated Global Services group, headcount reductions, more stringent policies and the implementation of zero-based budgeting, Campbell is becoming a leaner, more effective and more efficient company. In addition to lowering our cost base, we're seeing signs of cultural change as employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. 
We're reaping the benefits of our cost savings efforts ahead of our expectations and we continue to identify additional savings opportunities. As a result, we increased our 2018 savings target to $300 million, up from the $200 million objective we set when we introduced the program 1 year ago. We'll continue to invest a portion of these savings into our businesses based on their portfolio roles and longer-term growth opportunities that we've identified to create shareholder value over time. For instance, we plan to make several investments in the second half of the year in the areas of new product development and support for several of our key brands. Additionally, we're building new capabilities in areas such as e-commerce. 
As announced last week, we raised our annual earnings guidance and now expect adjusted EBIT to increase 10% to 13% and adjusted EPS to grow by 9% to 12%. We continue to expect the outlook for net sales to be in the range of negative 1% to 0%. The improved outlook for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS are primarily due to improved gross margin performance and the better-than-expected benefits of our cost savings initiative. 
Now I'd like to share my perspective on our segment results. Let's start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. As we've previously outlined, we're focused on increasing net price realization, including optimizing promotion spending and improving our supply chain performance. I'm encouraged by the progress we've made against all 3 of them. 
Organic sales declined by 1% in the quarter predominantly driven by a decline in U.S. soup sales. As context, the entire wet soup category declined 3% for the 13 weeks ended January 31. Our soup sales, down 4%, were below our expectations although we had some bright spots. Our condensed soup business was up for the quarter and our broth business grew nicely. However, declines in ready-to-serve soup more than offset those gains. Let me explain the factors at play. 
As we discussed back in the first quarter, we began taking steps to increase our net price realization through a combination of pricing actions and implementing more balanced promotion plans to support our business. As anticipated, these price realization activities had a negative impact on volume, but it was a necessary step to address the historical lack of price realization in RTS and strategically important for our entire soup portfolio. 
Another factor was the timing of our marketing plans. As we discussed in the first quarter, our marketing and merchandising support was planned for later in the year, across the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter. We also experienced some execution issues related to an on-label promotion on our Chunky brand. 
Finally, weather is not something we control and it's certainly not the main reason for the decline in our soup business, but we believe the unusually warm winter had a negative impact on the entire category in the first half. 
In January, we grew soup sales in the high single digits as we began to address our execution issues in Chunky, ramped up marketing activities, implemented more effective promotions and benefited from more seasonal weather. Our plans will continue into the third quarter. Despite these headwinds, we're taking steps to improve the performance of our U.S. soup business. Our pricing actions are taking hold. We've implemented more impactful promotion programs and our new advertising campaign is resonating with consumers. This bodes well for the future. 
Beyond soup, our Simple Meals business performed well in the quarter, with solid sales growth in Prego, Pace and especially Plum. We told you last July that our innovation plans in the Americas would focus on fewer, bigger ideas. In our quest to ramp up innovation, we recognize that some things will work and others will not. The key is to recognize it early and move on, and that's precisely what we're doing. 
Overall, our innovation results are mixed. On the plus side, Campbell's Dinner Sauces platform and Slow Kettle soups continued to grow and are overindexing with millennials. Campbell's Organic soup line is meeting expectations and helping us expand our health and well-being options in the center store. In our beverage business, we're pleased with V8 Veggie Blends and V8 + Energy. Finally, the innovation driving the expansion of our Plum portfolio is robust as this brand continues to build loyalty with millennial parents. 
Now let's look at what's not working as well. Pace and Prego ready meals and Campbell's Fresh-Brewed Soups and K-Cups are performing below expectations, and we're taking steps to evaluate the root cause and course correct. Additionally, we've discontinued the V8 protein line. Our key learning was that these shakes and bars were not differentiated enough to succeed in a crowded and competitive space. 
We recently hired Greg Shewchuk as our new Chief Marketing and Commercial Officer for the Americas division. With his extensive experience, we expect he will lead accelerated marketing innovation and sharpen our focus on fewer, bigger initiatives. We're excited to welcome Greg to the team in early March. 
Clearly, the highlight in the Americas division was the significant gross margin expansion and the 22% increase in operating earnings. A major improvement this quarter was our supply chain performance. In addition to our ongoing productivity programs, we improved our execution in transportation and warehousing. We also benefited from the benign inflationary environment. Overall, our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division continues to make progress in delivering against its portfolio role. 
Moving on, our Global Biscuits and Snacks division performed well in the quarter, delivering organic sales growth and driving significant profit. This division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses, and its portfolio role is to manage growth while improving margins in both developed and developing markets. Our core developed markets of Australia and the United States continue to deliver positive results. 
I'm pleased with the performance in our U.S. biscuits and bakery business with sales growth across numerous Pepperidge Farm categories, including fresh bakery, frozen and cookies. Looking ahead, we have solid innovation plans in place in our core developed markets with new products in the U.S., such as the launch of artisan rolls and the introduction of Goldfish crackers with organic wheat. In Australia, we're restaging our Shapes product line to increase the flavor of these popular snacks. 
Turning to developing markets. Excluding the impact of currency, sales growth in Malaysia was offset by the declines in Indonesia, where economic conditions remain challenging. While we're expecting the Indonesian economy to improve in the second half of the year, we don't expect our business to return to growth this year. 
In China, our primary focus has been the Kelsen business. We've made many changes to improve this business since acquiring it in August 2013. At the end of fiscal 2015, we changed distributors, added new marketing and digital talent and began ramping up our sales force. We had a solid sell-in for the Chinese New Year, our biggest and most important season, and our new distributors delivered strong execution, including merchandising supported by our new integrated marketing campaign. As I discussed last week at CAGNY, we believe it's important for Campbell to become more geographically diverse despite short-term volatility in developing markets. 
Turning now to Campbell Fresh. C-Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and our refrigerated soup business. This division's portfolio role is to accelerate sales growth and expand into new packaged fresh categories. 
Reported segment sales increased 10% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales were comparable to a year ago. In Bolthouse Farms, we delivered mid-single-digit sales growth in beverages and double-digit gains in refrigerated salad dressings. 
Carrot sales were down slightly although we grew share. We continued to drive growth in the faster-growing organic segment of the carrot market, and we're taking steps to increase our presence there. As a reminder, one of the key roles of our market-leading carrot business is to provide the refrigerated logistics system and scale in the perimeter that we can leverage for distribution and merchandising of our CPG business. 
Our carrot ingredients business remains challenged with a significant decline in the quarter related to reduced export demand from Japan. As expected, the rate of decline moderated in the quarter and we expect that trend to continue in the back half of the year. 
We're happy with the margin expansion in C-Fresh and the increased operating profit. We've invested in capacity, enabling us to increase our in-house production. We rationalized unproductive beverage SKUs. We've increased our supply chain productivity. And we've managed SG&A. However, C-Fresh's portfolio role is full force growth, and we expect stronger top line performance from the CPG portion of this business. 
Looking ahead, we expect improved sales growth in C-Fresh in the second half of the year to be driven by stronger performance in the CPG business and moderating declines in carrot ingredients. We have one of the strongest spring innovation efforts in several years. We'll add 14 new items across beverages and salad dressings, including 6 new varieties of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, our ultra-premium cold-pressed organic juice line. With our increased capacity coming online this month, we expect to expand our ACV distribution of 1915 to 50% this year, largely in line with the category. 
The integration of Garden Fresh Gourmet and our retail perimeter soup business into C-Fresh is progressing well. Sales of retail soup were up modestly in the quarter, and Garden Fresh Gourmet is tracking to deliver the sales we expected through increased distribution and increased market penetration. 
We've accomplished a great deal over the last 12 months as we've aligned our enterprise structure with our strategy, created 3 new divisions with strong leadership, defined clear portfolio roles and implemented a major cost savings initiative. We're now better positioned to execute our strategies and to invest in the areas of our business that hold the greatest growth potential, including several investments in the second half of this year. Against this backdrop, I'm encouraged by our performance this quarter. 
Our enterprise redesign and cost savings efforts are delivering better than expected results, and our new divisions are beginning to perform in line with their portfolio roles. But we remain unsatisfied with our top line growth, and I know we can do better. We expect to improve our growth profile in the second half, and we continue to stay focused on driving long-term sustainable, profitable net sales growth. 
I look forward to answering your questions, but now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."

Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the second quarter. At the top line, organic sales, which were comparable to last year, were below our expectations, reflecting the sales performance",1846,"Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the second quarter. At the top line, organic sales, which were comparable to last year, were below our expectations, reflecting the sales performance of U.S. soups. We made outstanding progress in gross margins, up 4 percentage points on an adjusted basis, benefiting from our price realization actions and supply chain performance. Our cost savings initiatives are delivering significant benefits, $50 million in the second quarter. And as we shared at CAGNY last week, we've raised our 3-year savings target to $300 million, with these savings impacting multiple P&L lines. Based on our gross margin performance and incremental cost savings, we also raised our full year earnings guidance last week, and I'll provide more details in a moment. 
Now I'll take you through the detailed results and our 2016 guidance. For the second quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 1% to $2.2 billion, primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks were offset by declines in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. 
Reflecting a 4 point increase in operating margin, adjusted EBIT increased 26% to $423 million, benefiting from a higher gross margin percentage and savings from our cost reduction initiatives. These positive drivers were partly offset by higher incentive compensation costs, currency translation, which had a 3 point negative impact, and lower volumes. 
Adjusted EPS increased 23% to $0.87. For the first half, net sales on an as-reported basis were down 2%, while organic sales were comparable to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT increased 24% and adjusted EPS of $1.82 was up 21%. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter, reported sales declined 1% with organic sales comparable to the prior year. Within organic sales, volume and mix subtracted 2 points, was primarily driven by U.S. Soup within the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment. Higher selling prices contributed 1 point while lower promotional spending also added a point, both driven by our net price realization efforts in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and in Global Biscuits and Snacks. Currency translation had an average impact of 2 points on the top line as our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar, weakened against the U.S. dollar. To complete the bridge, the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet contributed 1 point to net sales in the quarter. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 4 points to 37.3%, exceeding our expectations on lower-than-anticipated cost inflation and better-than-anticipated supply chain performance. Compared to the year-ago period, within inflation and other, we experienced improved supply chain performance, primarily from transportation cost savings initiatives as well as lower losses on open commodity contracts. In aggregate, inflation on input costs was close to 0. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 20 basis points.  
Our net price realization actions contributed 1.4 points of margin expansion with 50 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in U.S. Soup and Pepperidge Farm, and 90 basis points from higher selling prices. 
Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our 3-year cost savings program, contributed 180 basis points to margin improvement in the quarter. Recent capacity additions in Bolthouse Farms and U.S. broth as well as our Soup Common Platform initiative are contributing to these productivity gains.
Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted marketing and selling expenses declined 5% in the quarter, primarily due to reductions in nonworking marketing from our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by higher advertising and consumer promotion expense, driven by increases in Kelsen, Pepperidge Farm and U.S. Soup. 
Adjusted administrative expenses increased 6% primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs compared to a year ago, partly offset by benefits from our cost savings initiatives. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. As you can see, in aggregate, adjusted EPS increased $0.16 compared with the prior year from $0.71 to $0.87 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT, mostly from the gross margin expansion and benefits from our cost savings initiatives, contributed $0.22 to EPS growth. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly, but had no impact on EPS for the quarter. And while net interest expense increased $2 million as we extended the maturity on the debt portfolio in fiscal 2015, this also had no impact on EPS for the quarter. Going the other way, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31.6%, up 2.8 points versus the prior year, primarily due to lapping the favorable resolution of an intercompany pricing agreement, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.04. Currency had a $0.03 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.87 per share.
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 1% to $1.2 billion. U.S. soup sales decreased 4% driven by declines in ready-to-serve soups, partly offset by gains in broth and condensed soup. Sales of other U.S. Simple Meals increased driven by gains in Plum, Prego pasta sauces and Pace Mexican sauces. Sales of U.S. Beverages declined, primarily due to weakness in V8 V-Fusion beverages. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales in Canada decreased driven by declines in soup. Operating earnings increased 22%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from net price realization, productivity gains and improved supply chain performance. 
Reflecting declines in ready-to-serve soup, total U.S. soup sales declined 4% driven by category declines from warmer weather, the volume impact from our pricing actions, the timing of our marketing programs and an issue with an on-label promotion on Chunky, which has since been corrected. 
Within U.S. soup, RTS declined 20%, which was partly offset by a 7% gain in Swanson broth and a 2% gain in condensed. We began and ended the quarter with a retailer inventory in aggregate comparable to year-ago levels. As we said last quarter, we do not believe subcategory sales performance is a meaningful disclosure. We will continue to provide it through the fiscal year before discontinuing in 2017. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending January 31, 2016, the category as a whole declined 1.9%. Our sales in measured channels declined 2.8%, with weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decline of 50 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, up 30 basis points, reflecting share gains by smaller brands.
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2% with growth in Pepperidge Farm and the Asia-Pacific region. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by fresh bakery, frozen products and cookies. Sales of Goldfish crackers were up slightly for the quarter with modest share gains for the first half of the fiscal year. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, excluding the impact of currency translation, growth in Australia, driven by Arnott's Tim Tam biscuits, was partially offset by declines in Indonesia as that market continued to face economic challenges. Operating earnings increased 23%, primarily driven by a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from net price realization and productivity gains, partly offset by the negative impact of currency translation. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales were comparable to the prior year with gains in Bolthouse Farms premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, which, on a combined basis, grew mid-single digits, offset by declines in carrot ingredient export sales and declines in retail carrots despite gaining share. 
Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 10 points of sales growth to the segment. Operating earnings grew 62% to $21 million driven by a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from improved supply chain performance, productivity improvements and the favorable mix impact from growth in the higher-margin refrigerated beverages. This performance resulted in a 2 point improvement in operating margin for the segment compared to a year ago. 
We had strong cash flow performance in the first half. Cash from operations increased by $143 million to $727 million, driven by higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements. Capital expenditures increased $10 million to $153 million. 
We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2016. We paid dividends totaling $197 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased $86 million of shares in the first half, $50 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt declined by approximately $150 million as positive net cash flow generated by the business more than offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Now I'll review our 2016 guidance, which is consistent with our news release on February 16. We expect sales to change by minus 1% to 0%, including a 1 point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet and a 2 point negative impact from currency translation as compared to the previous estimated currency impact of 3 points. This sales guidance implies a reduction in organic sales compared to our previous guidance, reflecting the performance of U.S. soup. Benefiting from gross margin performance and incremental cost savings, we expect adjusted EBIT to grow by 10% to 13% and adjusted EPS to grow by 9% to 12%. 
Our full year guidance implies a modest earnings decline in the back half of the year. This reflects investments we are making in new product launches, higher marketing spending and headwinds from higher incentive compensation and the negative impact of currency on the input costs of our international businesses. 
We expect adjusted gross margin to expand by approximately 175 basis points driven primarily by our first half performance. In the back half, we anticipate headwinds from increased promotional spending to support new products and key brands, the negative impact of currency on the EBIT costs of our international businesses and from modest cost inflation. Offsetting these headwinds, gross margin will benefit from our cost savings initiatives and productivity gains, but we will be wrapping much of the pricing and improved supply chain performance we experienced in the first half. 
Against our cost savings program, we expect to deliver savings in the range of $120 million to $140 million in 2016 compared to our previous range of $80 million to $100 million. As announced last week, we have increased our 2018 annual savings target from $250 million to $300 million. Also, we expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 33%. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

Yes, we are giving guidance on gross margin, and we expect 175 basis points of gross margin improvement for the year. So that implies about a flattish back half, but let me try to give some more context on this one. I think if you go back to last fiscal year 2015, it really is a story of 2 halves. In the first half of last year, gross margin was down about 2 points. And in the second half of last year, gross margin was up 1.4 points as we took some pricing and improved our supply chain performance in the back half. So if you look at it on a 2-year basis, both the first and second half of this year are each up just over a point versus 2 years ago. And the reason we're flat in the back half, there's a couple of things, there's a couple of headwinds. One is higher promotional spending to support some new product launches and some key brands, and as I mentioned in my comments, the negative impact of currency on costs. So both our Australian business and Canadian business have a significant portion of their inputs are denominated in U.S. dollar and we were hedged for a while, but we're closer to market now on those currency impacts, so that's having an increasing impact. And we still have a little bit of cost inflation although it's more moderate than certainly we had initially expected. And we believe we'll be able to offset all of that impact with continuing productivity gains and the benefits of our cost savings program."

Well, first of all, when you step back, the entire wet soup category was down 3% and we were down 4%, and we were up in condensed by 2% and up in broth by 7%. In RTS, particularly in Chunky is where we experienced our issue. And recall we did take net-net price realization. So that's a combination of pricing actions and also promotion actions, and that's not an easy one because you've got a marketplace where some of the marketplace is at high low on promotions and some of it is EDLP. So finding that right rhythm is an important idea. The other thing is the competitive landscape. We have to take that into consideration as well. In the case of Chunky, we actually had a promotion on-pack label that caused consumer confusion, and we are largely out of that right now, so that one is behind us. And then finally, we launched a portfolio campaign, which really helped our condensed soup, but it did not do the job on brand Chunky. And so it wasn't until later in the quarter that we came in with dedicated advertising, and that will continue into quarter 3. And again, I'm not really one to give the weather report, but it really was, relative to last year, a much warmer winter. So we really expect soup to grow modestly consistent with other center-store  categories. We are continuing to invest in the soup business, and we are continuing to invest in the quality of the product. So it's not any one silver bullet, it's a combination of things."

And then finally, having made the acquisition of Plum Organics, we're incredibly pleased with the performance of that business and see a lot of runway in the innovation pipeline to make smart investments and continue to cultivate relationships with millennial parents. In the Global Biscuits and Snacks front, we are very committed to expanding the Kelsen business in China and beyond. We are -- we have plans for increasing our footprint of the Tim Tam brands. And as I mentioned, we are continuously working on product quality, for example, the investment we're making back in our Shapes business. We are, in the United States, continuing to work on our Goldfish brand, and we believe there's more growth in that brand, particularly as we move into products in the health and well-being space. And then finally, C-Fresh is our full-force growth, and we've been very pleased with the portfolio of brands and categories in the produce area and in the deli part of the perimeter. Inclusive of our refrigerated soup, that between the beverages, the salad dressings, the hummus, the sauces and the soup, we have a lot to work with, and we have capabilities in each one of those categories in shelf-stable that we can actually bring into the fresh space. So we have a very energized team across all 3 of these divisions to do so. So I think based on 5 years ago, we have a lot more to work with. And so making sure that we make smart investments and have a discipline about it is important, but we have a lot of places where we can put our dollars."

Ex that, admin would be down as a result of our cost savings initiative. So that's what you see on the P&L. Inside of costs, the inflation on input costs was about flat compared to a year ago, so it was neither a help nor a hindrance on gross margin, but it's certainly been more modest than it's been. And in costs, what you're seeing is a few different things coming out of the supply chain and kind of breaking down into 3 chunks. One is, it is just better supply chain performance. And what we mean by that is that the plants are operating at higher efficiency levels, our customer service levels are back above our targets and as a result, we see lower interplant shipments. We see fewer less than truckload shipments. So we had better weights. We actually had less miles. So that's all kind of within how we're operating. And then we have a portion of our cost savings initiative that's coming through. And this is primarily in the area of transportation and in the fact that we reworked our entire transportation network last year. So we recontracted it. We have increased the committed carrier capacity. At the same time, we've achieved lower rates. And as a result of our service levels being where they are, we really had almost 0 use of the spot market, so that's a premium cost we had last year that we don't have this year. And the third bucket is what we call productivity, where we had specific actions that supply chain has taken to generate cost savings, and a couple of examples within that would be the capacity additions in Bolthouse Farms and in our U.S. broth business that have allowed us to repatriate production from co-packers. So we're seeing that benefit come through. The other one is our Soup Common Platform initiative, which we're also seeing benefit on the P&L. And, lastly, warehousing capacity, we've made some investments on our own internal warehousing so we've reduced our reliance on third-party warehouses and some of those cost reductions are coming through as well."

It has been sluggish, and it is a major source of profit for retailers. And we believe that we've got the portfolio that not only can jazz the center store but it also toggles into the perimeter as well, because many of our brands in the center store are used in conjunction with products that consumers will buy in the perimeter as well. So we continue to work with them on those kinds of goals, and they're mutual goals. So the way we look at our trade is as an investment where we hope to continue to build a return on that investment by good planning with retailers."

Today, I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. As many of you are aware, the consumer environment continues to be challenging in many of the markets where we have operations. In the U.S., consumer spending remains cautious. Shoppers are making more frequent trips than a year ago with their purchasing less per trip. As a result, consumer takeaway of total food and beverage has softened compared to both short and longer-term comparisons. This has exerted top line pressure on both retailers and manufacturers. In other parts of the world, economic conditions remain volatile. 
In the third quarter, our organic sales declined 2% which was below our expectations. Key factors that led to this decline include softer-than-expected soup category performance, weakness in V8 beverages and product shortages in our Bolthouse Farms carrot business. I continue to be pleased with our adjusted gross margin expansion, driven by supply chain productivity programs despite the negative impact of the weather on our Bolthouse Farms carrot business. Both our sales and the cost of carrots were adversely impacted by the poor growing conditions in California. Cold rain weather from mid-December through mid-March reduced carrot yields across the industry. The decreased crop yield had a significant impact on our gross margin performance in the quarter. Both Anthony and I will discuss this later in the call. 
Third quarter adjusted EBIT declined but was better than we expected, reflecting improved gross margin performance. The decline in adjusted EBIT was due to higher levels of planned spending including the increase marketing investments as well as higher incentive compensation costs and investments in long-term innovation. We expected that our adjusted EBIT performance would taper in the second half as we realize the benefits of our cost savings earlier, cycled improved gross margin from a year ago and implemented our plans to increase marketing investment in the second half. 
Now let me share my view on our segment performance for the quarter. Let's start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. Organic sales declined by 2% in the quarter predominantly driven by U.S. Soup and V8 beverages. Our ready-to-serve soup business was challenged by a number of the same factors we discussed last quarter: the mild winter weather, which affected the entire category, the volume impact of our pricing actions and marketing execution on the Chunky brand. We're realistic about these issues and have plans to address those things within our control for the next soup season, namely, we intend to do a better job of driving demand particularly for Chunky ready-to-serve soups. We'll have a more robust marketing plan that fully leverages our NFL sponsorship. We also recognize that we need to bring more excitement to the category and we have new on-prem product innovations planned for fiscal 2017. We'll discuss these plans in greater detail at our Investor Day in July. 
There were several bright spots within soup and Simple Meals. Sales of Swanson broth, Slow Kettle and Campbell's organic soup all grew. Also, Campbell's condensed soup gained share. Beyond soup, Prego continues to perform well, driven by strong merchandising and growth in white sauces. We also began shipping Prego Farmer's Market, our new premium Italian sauce with a clean label. Additionally, we drove double-digit sales gains in plum. 
V8 beverages continued to struggle with sales declines in V8 Reds, V Fusion and V8 Splash. There was, however, some good news, particularly in the performance of V8 Veggie Blends and V8 plus energy. In the short term, we've taken steps to address the performance of V8 Red and have increased both TV and digital advertising specific to the V8 Red brand. In the past, we've had success with advertising that reminds consumers of the benefits of V8. We're also building on the successful launch of V8 Veggie Blends with new varieties and expanding our V8 plus energy carbonated beverages into the grocery channel. We recognize that these short-term actions are not the complete solution. That said, V8 is a great brand and we believe we have a solid platform to build upon going forward. We're in the process of finalizing our strategy and we'll discuss our longer-term plans to get this business back on track at Investor Day. 
Overall, we feel good about how the Americas division is performing against its portfolio role year-to-date especially its continued margin expansion. Clearly, we have some work to do in several key categories to generate demand for our products. We get it and we're on it.
Turning to Global Biscuits and Snacks. This division unifies our Pepperidge Farms, and Arnott's and Kelsen businesses, and its portfolio role is to manage growth while improving margins in both developed and developing markets. Pepperidge Farm delivered modest sales growth while we experienced some challenges in our Australia and China businesses. The 2 main drivers of the sales decline were Kelsen in China and Arnott's sweet biscuits in and Australia. 
First, China. Despite strong merchandising support and our improve marketing efforts heading into Chinese New Year's, sales were below expectations. We experienced short-term distribution challenges and faced strong competitive activity. Let me explain. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we made changes to our business model, adding salespeople and changing distributors. This new go-to-market model is designed to improve execution while enabling us increase distribution into multiple cities in China over time. However, our new distribution system did not have the same reach as in the past. In spite of the challenges we faced, Kelsen consumer takeaway and share increased in our priority markets. Going forward, we'll need to supplement and expand our distributor network to increase our geographic reach. We're confident that we'll get there and continue to believe in the long-term prospects for Kelsen in this important market. 
In Asia-Pacific, excluding currency, sales of Arnott’s biscuits were comparable to the prior year with growth in Indonesia offset by declines in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, we faced competitive pressure in the sweet biscuit category and experienced lower consumer takeaway on special varieties of Arnott's Tim Tam biscuits which had a negative impact on sales. On the plus side, our savory biscuit business performed well and we're encouraged by the launch of our new and improved Arnott's Shapes crackers. While small, our developing markets in Southeast Asia performed well. Excluding the impact of currency, we grew sales in both Indonesia and Malaysia double digits. As expected, the economic situation in Indonesia started to improve in the quarter. 
Turning to North America. Pepperidge Farm cookies and crackers continued to perform well, driven mainly by Goldfish crackers. Sales declined slightly in our fresh bakery business as we faced increased competition in the quarter. 
Moving on to Campbell Fresh. C-Fresh is anchored by Bolthouse Farms and also includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and our Refrigerated Soup business. This division's portfolio role is to accelerate sales growth and expand into new Packaged Fresh categories. The CPG portion of this business is the full force growth engine of the division. Reported segment sales increased 6% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales declined 4%. In the quarter, Bolthouse Farms was a tale of 2 cities. Solid performance in our CPG premium juice and salad dressing business was more than offset by significant declines in our farm business, which consists of carrots and carrot ingredients. 
As I mentioned earlier, the carrot supply across the industry was negatively impacted by the adverse weather in California. This led to product shortages and product allocation to customers as we were unable to meet market demand. As a result, our carrot sales were down double digits in the quarter. This weather pattern is irregular. As we look back, the Bolthouse Farms carrot business experienced similar weather conditions in the winter of 2010 to 2011. Since then, we've significantly diversified our winter crop into multiple growing regions in California, Arizona and Georgia. Today, we're much better equipped to respond and have reduced our recovery time. We're currently back in full supply with customers and don't anticipate any material sales impact going forward as we're now in the prime growing season in California. 
Turning to the CPG side of Bolthouse Farms. We're pleased with the 8% sales growth we delivered in the quarter. As expected, this growth was driven by distribution gains and our spring innovation. We added 14 new items across all try and superpremium beverages as well as salad dressings which increased double digits. We're also pleased with the performance of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, our ultra-premium cold-pressed organic juices line. We achieved 50% ACV in less than 12 months enabled by our investment and expanded capacity. Due to the success of our spring innovation sell-in, we're well positioned for the fourth quarter and as we look ahead to fiscal 2017. 
A quick word on our Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition. From an integration standpoint, we continue to make progress on bringing the business into the Bolthouse Farms operations platform and we've expanded fresh salad [ph] distribution. We remain very optimistic about the potential of this brand. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to share my thoughts on our year-to-date performance. Year-to-date, organic sales are down slightly, 1%, in what continues to be very challenging consumer environment. We're clear-eyed about the factors impacting our top line and the actions we need to take to address them. We can and we must do better on driving profitable net sales growth. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and next fiscal year, we expect to grow organic sales. Our year-to-date adjusted EBIT increase of plus 15% reflects our improved gross margin performance and the benefits of our $300 million cost savings initiatives including our move to zero-based budgeting. As we focus on finishing the fiscal year, I feel good about the progress we're making, how we've performed year-to-date and our outlook for the full year. This is reflected in our updated guidance which Anthony will discuss shortly. 
We've made many important changes to Campbell, completely redesigning our organization, setting up the company by category versus geography and assigning each division a clear portfolio role. We continue to remain focused on strengthening our core business and expanding into faster-growing spaces as we unleash the power of our purpose, real food that matters for life's moments. 
Overall, we're now better positioned to execute our strategies, invest in the areas of our business that hold the greatest profitable growth potential and increase shareholder value. We're proud of the progress we've made but we know we have more to do. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."
258458,290972500,989298,"Campbell Soup Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 20, 2016",2016-05-20,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the third quarter.

Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the third quarter. Organic sales in the quarter were below our expectations, reflecting softness in U.S. Soup, V8 beverages and the weather-related crop yield issue which negatively impacted our carrot sales and earnings. We continue to make progress on adjusted gross margin. It improved by 40 basis points, better than expected, benefiting from our supply chain performance and moderating cost inflation despite the weather-related yield issue on carrots. The carrot issued negatively impacted sales by approximately $14 million and our adjusted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points or $0.02 per share. We continue to make good progress on our cost savings initiatives. We've delivered approximately $30 million of savings in the third quarter, with these savings impacting multiple P&L line, bringing the year-to-date total to $110 million. Program to date, we are now at $195 million in cost savings. 
With one quarter to go, we are updating our guidance. We're holding the sales range, narrowing the adjusted EBIT range and raising the adjusted EPS range to reflect our current outlook for adjusted EBIT and a lower adjusted tax rate. Now I'll take you through the detailed results and guidance. 
For the third quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 2% to $1.78 billion. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales also declined 2% driven by lower volume. Net price realization was comparable to the prior year with higher selling prices offset by increased trade promotions. Adjusted EBIT decreased 5% to $312 million, reflecting higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses, higher administrative expenses and lower volumes partly offset by a higher gross margin percentage. Adjusted EPS decreased 2% to $0.65. For the 9-month period, net sales on an as-reported basis were down 2% while organic sales decreased 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT of $1,214,000,000 and adjusted EPS of $2.48 both increased by 15%. Year-to-date earnings growth is being driven by our improved gross margin performance and benefits from our cost savings initiatives. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Reported net sales and organic sales both declined 2% as the 1 point negative impact of currency translation was offset by the 1 point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. Within organic sales, volume and mix subtracted 2 points which was primarily driven by declines in V8 beverages and soup within the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment as well as the lost carrot sales in Campbell Fresh. Higher selling prices contributed 1 point of sales growth while higher promotional spending subtracted 1 point. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 40 basis points to 37% exceeding our expectations on overall supply chain performance despite the weather-related carrot issue. Cost inflation and other factors had a negative margin impact of 1.6 points, driven primarily by cost inflation which, as a rate, increased by approximately 1% and the increase in carrot cost previously discussed. In aggregate, our net price realization reduced adjusted gross margin by 20 basis points as higher promotional spending in the quarter to support U.S. Soup, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Bolthouse Farms beverages was mostly offset by list pricing actions previously taken across several businesses. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 10 basis points. Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our 3-year cost-saving program, contributed 210 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. 
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 5% in the quarter primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expense. Advertising and consumer promotion expense increased 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by increases in Pepperidge Farm and V8 beverages. Adjusted administrative expenses increased 4% primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, inflation, increased cost to support long-term innovation and the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet partly offset by the benefits from cost savings initiatives. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. As you can see, adjusted EPS decreased $0.01 compared with the prior year from $0.66 to $0.65 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, declines in adjusted EBIT had a $0.03 a negative impact on EPS. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly but had no impact on EPS for the quarter, and net interest expense was comparable to prior year levels. 
Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 28.5%, down 3.1 points versus the prior year primarily due to lower-than-expected taxes on foreign earnings, partly offset by the geographic mix of our earnings with a higher proportion of income in the U.S. The lower tax rate benefited EPS by $0.03. Currency had a $0.01 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.65 per share. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 2% to $999 million driven by declines in soup and V8 beverages partly offset by gains in Prego pasta sauces and Plum products. Operating earnings increased 1% reflecting a higher gross margin percentage driven by productivity improvement partly offset by lower volume and increased advertising expenses. In total, U.S. Soup sales declined 5% driven by category declines which, as Denise mentioned, were primarily impacted by warmer weather compared to the year ago quarter, the impact from our pricing action and marketing execution issues on Chunky. Although our pricing actions had a negative impact on volumes, they have contributed to improved profitability. Within U.S. Soup, RTS declined 13% [ph] and condensed declined 4% partly offset by a 10% gain in Swanson broth. Estimated changes in retailer inventory levels did not meaningfully impact sales in the quarter. As we previously stated, we will not be providing this subcategory sales performance beyond this fiscal year. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending May 1, 2016, the category as a whole declined 2.4%. Our sales and measured channels declined 3.5% with weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decline of 70 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 29%, up 50 basis points reflecting share gains by smaller brands. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales decreased 1% with declines in Kelsen partly offset by gains in Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers and soups and beverages in Australia. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales from Arnott’s biscuits were comparable to the prior year with gains in Indonesia offset by declines in sweet biscuit varieties in Australia. Operating earnings decreased 8% primarily driven by higher incentive compensation costs and the negative impact of currency translation. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales decreased 4% with declines in carrot partly offset by gains in Bolthouse Farms premium, refrigerated beverages and salad dressings. Not included in the organic result is our recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 10 points of sales growth to the segment. Operating earnings declined 28% driven by the higher carrot cost. Excluding the negative impact from the carrot issue and the acquisition, operating earnings for C-Fresh in the quarter would have increased significantly compared to the prior year. Despite the negative impact in the quarter, year-to-date operating margins in C-Fresh have increased by 1 percentage point. 
We had strong cash flow performance for the first 9 months. Cash from operations increased by $212 million to $1,183,000,000 driven by higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements especially in the area of inventory. Capital expenditures decreased $17 million to $225 million. We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2016. We paid dividends totaling $294 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of 31.2 cents per share. In aggregate, we repurchased $118 million of shares in the first 9 months, $75 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt declined by approximately $250 million as positive net cash flow generated by the business more than offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Now I'll review our 2016 outlook. Our sales guidance remains unchanged at minus 1% to 0% including a 1 point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet and a 2 point negative impact from currency translation. We're narrowing the range for adjusted EBIT which we now expect to grow 11% to 13%. The year-over-year growth reflects the benefit of improved gross margin performance and the benefits from our cost savings initiatives. We expect adjusted gross margin for the year to expand by approximately 175 to 200 basis points. We're increasing the adjusted EPS growth range to 11% to 13% or $2.93 to $3 per share in line with EBIT growth. Reflecting lower taxes on foreign earnings, we now expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 32%. Against our cost savings program, and consistent with our prior forecast, we expect to deliver incremental savings in the range of $120 million to $140 million in 2016. Our 2018 annual savings target remains unchanged at $300 million. 
That concludes my remarks, and now let's turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

A lot of the money is going to make sure that we have support of our key brands in line with the portfolio roles in each division. One thing that is new is we are channeling some of these dollars into longer-term innovation so that we make sure we have a robust pipeline in a state of readiness.

I talked about the sales decline being due to 3 factors: one being predominantly RTS soup; the second being V8 beverages; and the third, the unfortunate situation we had in carrots with the shortage of organic carrots. The investment that we made were on different things. So we invested ANC advertising and consumer and our Global Biscuits and Snacks business against shapes in Australia which were Tim Tams in Australia, which didn't work; and our cookies and bakery business and Goldfish and Pepperidge Farm, which did work. We invested advertising consumer in V8 but we focused it on Veggie Blends, and that worked. But what we realized is we have more emphasis going forward on V8 Red and we're of course correcting there. We also spent predominantly promotion spending on our Campbell Fresh new product launches, and that is going incredibly well. And then finally, we spent money against Prego and Simple Meals, which also had a very good quarter. So we do believe in the investment of ANC in this business. And with trade spending, it was up against the Arnott's business that I just talked about, Goldfish and C-Fresh new products. On a year-to-date basis, trade spending is down 5% and about 0.3. It's down 0.3 points versus a year ago on a rate basis."

We'll give more specific guidance when we get to our fourth quarter call. In terms of the implied range, it does obviously have a $0.07 delta in the fourth quarter. I think for perspective and we've had a bit of challenge forecasting our year. As you know, we've taken the guidance up a couple of times already. We've just gone through massive change here at the company, probably the largest transformational change in the company's history in terms of reorganizing into 3 divisions, addressing spend layers and voluntary headcount reduction, involuntary headcount reduction, the adoption of zero-based budgeting and changing many of the policies we have at the company, changing our operating model and forming an Integrated Global Services function. And given the amount of change, it's just been really difficult or more difficult than usual to forecast. So we're just giving ourselves a little bit of a latitude here in the fourth quarter in terms of where we're going to come out. Some of the variability will likely be in gross margin. That 25 basis point range can take you from the top of the EPS beats to the bottom. Cost savings could be a little bit variable.

Or as we think forward, is there still opportunity? And can we expect to see it start to bear fruit as we go into next year?"

A lot of what you're seeing in the quarter is the result of timing. A lot of the cost savings came in the first half and we had rephased some of the marketing out of the first half and into the second half. So I think it's probably appropriate to judge us on our year-to-date results, which we feel really good about."

Welcome to the third quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2016. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO; and Blake MacMinn, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. 
As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who participate in a listen-only mode. 
Today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. 
Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. 
One final item. Before we get on our discussion of the quarter, I'd like to cordially invite our sell-side analysts and institutional investors to our Annual Investor Day at Campbell's World Headquarters. RSVPs are required. All others are invited to join by webcast. This year's event will be held the afternoon of Wednesday, July 20. We will include updates on our plans and key initiatives for the 3 operating divisions. We will also have time for interacting with our management team. More details to follow on this. 
With that, let me turn it over to Denise."

Today, I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. 
As many of you are aware, the consumer environment continues to be challenging in many of the markets where we have operations. In the U.S., consumer spending remains cautious. Shoppers are making more frequent trips than a year ago with their purchasing less per trip. As a result, consumer takeaway of total food and beverage has softened compared to both short- and longer-term comparisons. This has exerted top line pressure on both retailers and manufacturers. In other parts of the world, economic conditions remain volatile. 
In the third quarter, our organic sales declined 2%, which was below our expectations. Key factors that led to the decline include softer-than-expected soup category performance, weakness in V8 beverages and product shortages in our Bolthouse Farms carrot business. 
I continue to be pleased with our adjusted gross margin expansion, driven by supply chain productivity programs despite the negative impact of the weather on our Bolthouse Farms carrot business. Both our sales and the cost of carrots were adversely impacted by the poor growing conditions in California. Cold rain weather from mid-December through mid-March reduced carrot yields across the industry. The decreased crop yield had a significant impact on our gross margin performance in the quarter. Both Anthony and I will discuss this later in the call. 
Third quarter adjusted EBIT declined, but was better than we expected, reflecting improved gross margin performance. The decline in adjusted EBIT was due to higher levels of planned spending including the increased marketing investments as well as higher incentive compensation costs and investments in long-term innovation. We expected that our adjusted EBIT performance would taper in the second half as we realize the benefits of our cost savings earlier, cycled improved gross margin from a year ago and implemented our plans to increase marketing investment in the second half. 
Now let me share my view on our segment performance for the quarter. Let's start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. Organic sales declined by 2% in the quarter predominantly driven by U.S. and V8 beverages. Our ready-to-serve soup business was challenged by a number of the same factors we discussed last quarter: the mild winter weather, which affected the entire category, the volume impact of our pricing actions and marketing execution on the Chunky brand. We're realistic about these issues and have plans to address those things within our control for the next soup season, namely, we intend to do a better job of driving demand particularly for Chunky ready-to-serve soups. We'll have a more robust marketing plan that fully leverages our NFL sponsorship. We also recognize that we need to bring more excitement to the category and we have new on-trend product innovations planned for fiscal 2017. We'll discuss these plans in greater detail at our Investor Day in July. 
There were several bright spots within Soup and Simple Meals. Sales of Swanson broth, Slow Kettle and Campbell's Organic soup all grew. Also, Campbell's condensed soup gained share. 
Beyond soup, Prego continues to perform well, driven by strong merchandising and growth in white sauces. We also began shipping Prego Farmers' Market, our new premium Italian sauce with a clean label. Additionally, we drove double-digit sales gains in Plum. 
V8 beverages continued to struggle with sales declines in V8 Red, V-Fusion and V8 Splash. There was, however, some good news, particularly in the performance of V8 Veggie Blends and V8 +Energy. 
In the short term, we've taken steps to address the performance of V8 Red and have increased both TV and digital advertising specific to the V8 Red brand. In the past, we've had success with advertising that reminds consumers of the benefits of V8. We're also building on the successful launch of V8 Veggie Blends with new varieties and expanding our V8 +Energy carbonated beverages into the grocery channel. We recognize that these short-term actions are not the complete solution. That said, V8 is a great brand and we believe we have a solid platform to build upon going forward. We're in the process of finalizing our strategy and we'll discuss our longer-term plans to get this business back on track at Investor Day. 
Overall, we feel good about how the Americas division is performing against its portfolio role year-to-date especially its continued margin expansion. Clearly, we have some work to do in several key categories to generate demand for our products. We get it and we're on it.
Turning to Global Biscuits and Snacks. This division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses, and its portfolio role is to manage growth while improving margins in both developed and developing markets. Pepperidge Farm delivered modest sales growth while we experienced some challenges in our Australia and China businesses. The 2 main drivers of the sales decline were Kelsen in China and Arnott's sweet biscuits in and Australia. 
First, China. Despite strong merchandising support and our improved marketing efforts heading into Chinese New Year's, sales were below expectations. We experienced short-term distribution challenges and faced strong competitive activity. Let me explain. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we made changes to our business model, adding salespeople and changing distributors. This new go-to-market model is designed to improve execution while enabling us increase distribution into multiple cities in China over time. However, our new distribution system did not have the same reach as in the past. In spite of the challenges we faced, Kelsen consumer takeaway and share increased in our priority markets. Going forward, we'll need to supplement and expand our distributor network to increase our geographic reach. We're confident that we'll get there and continue to believe in the long-term prospects for Kelsen in this important market. 
In Asia Pacific, excluding currency, sales of Arnott’s biscuits were comparable to the prior year with growth in Indonesia offset by declines in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, we faced competitive pressure in the sweet biscuit category and experienced lower consumer takeaway on special varieties of Arnott's Tim Tam biscuits, which had a negative impact on sales. On the plus side, our savoury biscuit business performed well and we're encouraged by the launch of our new and improved Arnott's Shapes crackers. 
While small, our developing markets in Southeast Asia performed well. Excluding the impact of currency, we grew sales in both Indonesia and Malaysia double digits. As expected, the economic situation in Indonesia started to improve in the quarter. 
Turning to North America. Pepperidge Farm cookies and crackers continued to perform well, driven mainly by Goldfish crackers. Sales declined slightly in our fresh bakery business as we faced increased competition in the quarter. 
Moving on to Campbell Fresh. C-Fresh is anchored by Bolthouse Farms and also includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and our refrigerated soup business. This division's portfolio role is to accelerate sales growth and expand into new Packaged Fresh categories. The CPG portion of this business is the full force growth engine of the division. Reported segment sales increased 6% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales declined 4%. In the quarter, Bolthouse Farms was a tale of 2 cities. Solid performance in our CPG premium juice and salad dressing business was more than offset by significant declines in our farm business, which consists of carrots and carrot ingredients. 
As I mentioned earlier, the carrot supply across the industry was negatively impacted by the adverse weather in California. This led to product shortages and product allocation to customers as we were unable to meet market demand. As a result, our carrot sales were down double digits in the quarter. This weather pattern is irregular. As we looked back, the Bolthouse Farms carrot business experienced similar weather conditions in the winter of 2010 to 2011. Since then, we've significantly diversified our winter crop into multiple growing regions in California, Arizona and Georgia. Today, we're much better equipped to respond and have reduced our recovery time. We're currently back in full supply with customers and don't anticipate any material sales impact going forward as we're now in the prime growing season in California. 
Turning to the CPG side of Bolthouse Farms. We're pleased with the 8% sales growth we delivered in the quarter. As expected, this growth was driven by distribution gains and our spring innovation. We added 14 new items across ultra- and super-premium beverages as well as salad dressings, which increased double digits. 
We're also pleased with the performance of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, our Ultra-Premium Cold-Pressed Organic juice line. We achieved 50% ACV in less than 12 months enabled by our investment in expanded capacity. Due to the success of our spring innovation sell-in, we're well positioned for the fourth quarter and as we look ahead to fiscal 2017. 
A quick word on our Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition. From an integration standpoint, we continue to make progress on bringing the business into the Bolthouse Farms operations platform and we've expanded fresh salsa distribution. We remain very optimistic about the potential of this brand. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to share my thoughts on our year-to-date performance. Year-to-date, organic sales are down slightly, 1%, in what continues to be a very challenging consumer environment. We're clear-eyed about the factors impacting our top line and the actions we need to take to address them. We can and we must do better on driving profitable net sales growth. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and next fiscal year, we expect to grow organic sales. Our year-to-date adjusted EBIT increase of plus 15% reflects our improved gross margin performance and the benefits of our $300 million cost savings initiatives including our move to zero-based budgeting. As we focus on finishing the fiscal year, I feel good about the progress we're making, how we've performed year-to-date and our outlook for the full year. This is reflected in our updated guidance, which Anthony will discuss shortly. 
We've made many important changes to Campbell, completely redesigning our organization, setting up the company by category versus geography and assigning each division a clear portfolio role. We continue to remain focused on strengthening our core business and expanding into faster-growing spaces as we unleash the power of our purpose: real food that matters for life's moments. 
Overall, we're now better positioned to execute our strategies, invest in the areas of our business that hold the greatest profitable growth potential and increase shareholder value. We're proud of the progress we've made, but we know we have more to do. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."
258458,290972500,989390,"Campbell Soup Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 20, 2016",2016-05-20,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the third quarter.

Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the third quarter. Organic sales in the quarter were below our expectations, reflecting softness in U.S. soup, V8 beverages and the weather-related crop yield issue, which negatively impacted our carrot sales and earnings. 
We continued to make progress on adjusted gross margin. It improved by 40 basis points, better than expected, benefiting from our supply chain performance and moderating cost inflation despite the weather-related yield issue on carrots. The carrot issued negatively impacted sales by approximately $14 million and our adjusted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points or $0.02 per share. 
We continued to make good progress on our cost savings initiatives, which delivered approximately $30 million of savings in the third quarter, with these savings impacting multiple P&L lines, bringing the year-to-date total to $110 million. Program to date, we are now at $195 million in cost savings. 
With one quarter to go, we are updating our guidance. We are holding the sales range, narrowing the adjusted EBIT range and raising the adjusted EPS range to reflect our current outlook for adjusted EBIT and a lower adjusted tax rate. 
Now I'll take you through the detailed results and guidance. For the third quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 2% to $1.87 billion. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales also declined 2% driven by lower volume. Net price realization was comparable to the prior year with higher selling prices offset by increased trade promotions. Adjusted EBIT decreased 5% to $312 million, reflecting higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses, higher administrative expenses and lower volumes partly offset by a higher gross margin percentage. Adjusted EPS decreased 2% to $0.65. 
For the 9-month period, net sales on an as-reported basis were down 2% while organic sales decreased 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT of $1,214,000,000 and adjusted EPS of $2.48 both increased by 15%. Year-to-date earnings growth is being driven by our improved gross margin performance and benefits from our cost savings initiatives. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Reported net sales and organic sales both declined 2% as the 1-point negative impact of currency translation was offset by the 1-point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. Within organic sales, volume and mix subtracted 2 points, which was primarily driven by declines in V8 beverages and soup within the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment as well as the lost carrot sales in Campbell Fresh. Higher selling prices contributed 1 point of sales growth while higher promotional spending subtracted 1 point. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 40 basis points to 37% exceeding our expectations on overall supply chain performance despite the weather-related carrot issue. Cost inflation and other factors had a negative margin impact of 1.6 points, driven primarily by cost inflation, which, as a rate, increased by approximately 1% and the increase in carrot cost previously discussed. In aggregate, our net price realization reduced adjusted gross margin by 20 basis points as higher promotional spending in the quarter to support U.S. Soup, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Bolthouse Farms beverages was mostly offset by list pricing actions previously taken across several businesses. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 10 basis points. Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our 3-year cost savings program, contributed 210 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. 
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 5% in the quarter primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expense. Advertising and consumer promotion expense increased 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by increases in Pepperidge Farm and V8 beverages. 
Adjusted administrative expenses increased 4% primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, inflation, increased costs to support long-term innovation and the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet partly offset by the benefits from cost savings initiatives. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. As you can see, adjusted EPS decreased $0.01 compared with the prior year from $0.66 to $0.65 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, declines in adjusted EBIT had a $0.03 a negative impact on EPS. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly, but had no impact on EPS for the quarter. And net interest expense was comparable to prior year levels. 
Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 28.5%, down 3.1 points versus the prior year primarily due to lower-than-expected taxes on foreign earnings partly offset by the geographic mix of our earnings with a higher proportion of income in the U.S. The lower tax rate benefited EPS by $0.03. 
Currency had a $0.01 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.65 per share. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 2% to $999 million driven by declines in soup and V8 beverages partly offset by gains in Prego pasta sauces and Plum products. Operating earnings increased 1% reflecting a higher gross margin percentage driven by productivity improvement partly offset by lower volumes and increased advertising expenses. 
In total, U.S. soup sales declined 5% driven by category declines, which, as Denise mentioned, were primarily impacted by warmer weather compared to the year ago quarter, the impact from our pricing action and marketing execution issues on Chunky. Although our pricing actions had a negative impact on volumes, they have contributed to improved profitability. Within U.S. soup, RTS declined 13% and condensed declined 4% partly offset by a 10% gain in Swanson broth. Estimated changes in retailer inventory levels did not meaningfully impact sales in the quarter. As we previously stated, we will not be providing this subcategory sales performance beyond this fiscal year. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending May 1, 2016, the category as a whole declined 2.4%. Our sales in measured channels declined 3.5% with weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decline of 70 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 29%, up 50 basis points reflecting share gains by smaller brands. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales decreased 1% with declines in Kelsen partly offset by gains in Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers and soups and beverages in Australia. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales from Arnott’s biscuits were comparable to the prior year with gains in Indonesia offset by declines in sweet biscuit varieties in Australia. Operating earnings decreased 8% primarily driven by higher incentive compensation costs and the negative impact of currency translation. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales decreased 4% with declines in carrot partly offset by gains in Bolthouse Farms premium, refrigerated beverages and salad dressings. Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 10 points of sales growth to the segment. Operating earnings declined 28% driven by the higher carrot cost. Excluding the negative impact from the carrot issue and the acquisition, operating earnings for C-Fresh in the quarter would have increased significantly compared to the prior year. Despite the negative impacts in the quarter, year-to-date operating margins in C-Fresh have increased by 1 percentage point. 
We had strong cash flow performance for the first 9 months. Cash from operations increased by $212 million to $1,183,000,000 driven by higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements especially in the area of inventory. 
Capital expenditures decreased $17 million to $225 million. 
We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2016. 
We paid dividends totaling $294 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 cents per share. 
In aggregate, we repurchased $118 million of shares in the first 9 months, $75 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt declined by approximately $250 million as positive net cash flow generated by the business more than offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Now I'll review our 2016 outlook. Our sales guidance remains unchanged at minus 1% to 0% including a 1-point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet and a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. We're narrowing the range for adjusted EBIT, which we now expect to grow 11% to 13%. The year-over-year growth reflects the benefit of improved gross margin performance and the benefits from our cost savings initiatives. We expect adjusted gross margin for the year to expand by approximately 175 to 200 basis points. We're increasing the adjusted EPS growth range to 11% to 13% or $2.93 to $3 per share, in line with EBIT growth. Reflecting lower taxes on foreign earnings, we now expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 32%. Against our cost savings program, and consistent with our prior forecast, we expect to deliver incremental savings in the range of $120 million to $140 million in 2016. Our 2018 annual savings target remains unchanged at $300 million. 
That concludes my remarks, and now I turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

A lot of the money is going to make sure that we have support of our key brands in line with the portfolio roles in each division.

I talked about the sales decline being due to 3 factors: one being predominantly RTS soup, the second being V8 beverages, and the third, the unfortunate situation we had in carrots with the shortage of organic carrots. The investment that we made was on different things. So we invested A&C, advertising and consumer, in our Global Biscuits and Snacks business against Shapes in Australia, which worked; Tim Tams in Australia, which didn't work; and our cookies and bakery business in Goldfish and Pepperidge Farm, which did work. We invested advertising and consumer in V8, but we focused it on the Veggie Blends and that worked, but what we realized is that we had to put more emphasis going forward on V8 Red and we're, of course, correcting there. We also spent predominantly promotion spending on our Campbell Fresh new product launches and that is going incredibly well. And then, finally, we spent money against Prego and Simple Meals, which also had a very good quarter. So we do believe in the investment of A&C in this business. And with trade spending, it was up against the Arnott's business that I just talked about, Goldfish and C-Fresh new products. On a year-to-date basis, trade spending is down 5% and about 0.3 -- it's down 0.3 point versus a year ago on a rate basis."

We'll give a more specific guidance when we get to our fourth quarter call. In terms of the implied range, it does obviously have a $0.07 delta in the fourth quarter. I think, for perspective and -- we've had a bit of challenge forecasting our year. As you know, we've taken the guidance up a couple of times already. We've just gone through massive change here at the company, probably the largest transformational change in the company's history in terms of reorganizing into 3 divisions, addressing spans and layers and voluntary headcount reduction, involuntary headcount reduction, the adoption of zero-based budgeting and changing many of the policies we have at the company, changing our operating model and forming an Integrated Global Services function. And given the amount of change, it's just been really difficult or more difficult than usual to forecast, so we're just giving ourselves a little bit of a latitude here in the fourth quarter in terms of where we're going to come out. Some of the variability will likely be in gross margin. That 25 basis point range can take you from the top of the EPS rates to the bottom. Cost savings could be a little bit variable.

I mean I know you maybe had some weather, but on a 2-year basis, that's not really been the case, some weather this year. And going forward now, the costs are right rising a little bit more.

I'd say on the -- from the cost side, you said they're rising a little bit more. We're seeing moderating cost inflation at least in the back half of this year and probably into next year and that takes a little bit of pressure off in the pricing algorithm, and our objective is to expand gross margins through a combination of net pricing and productivity in excess of cost inflation. So as cost inflation moderates, that gives us a little more flexibility. There's no question that if you look back over the last couple of years, we have moved up some of our net pricing, both list and promoted, in an effort to improve the profitability of the soup business, and in fact, we've done that quite successfully.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today, I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. As many of you are aware, the consumer environment continues to be challenging i",1806,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today, I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. 
As many of you are aware, the consumer environment continues to be challenging in many of the markets where we have operations. In the U.S., consumer spending remains cautious. Shoppers are making more frequent trips than a year ago but they're purchasing less per trip. As a result, consumer takeaway of total food and beverage has softened compared to both short- and longer-term comparisons. This has exerted top line pressure on both retailers and manufacturers. In other parts of the world, economic conditions remain volatile. 
In the third quarter, our organic sales declined 2%, which was below our expectations. Key factors that led to the decline include softer-than-expected soup category performance, weakness in V8 beverages and product shortages in our Bolthouse Farms carrot business. 
I continue to be pleased with our adjusted gross margin expansion, driven by supply chain productivity programs despite the negative impact of the weather on our Bolthouse Farms carrot business. Both our sales and the cost of carrots were adversely impacted by the poor growing conditions in California. Cold rainy weather from mid-December through mid-March reduced carrot yields across the industry. The decreased crop yield had a significant impact on our gross margin performance in the quarter. Both Anthony and I will discuss this later in the call. 
Third quarter adjusted EBIT declined, but was better than we expected, reflecting improved gross margin performance. The decline in adjusted EBIT was due to higher levels of planned spending including the increased marketing investments as well as higher incentive compensation costs and investments in long-term innovation. We expected that our adjusted EBIT performance would taper in the second half as we realize the benefits of our cost savings earlier, cycled improved gross margin from a year ago and implemented our plans to increase marketing investment in the second half. 
Now let me share my view on our segment performance for the quarter. Let's start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. Organic sales declined by 2% in the quarter predominantly driven by U.S. Soup and V8 beverages. Our ready-to-serve soup business was challenged by a number of the same factors we discussed last quarter: the mild winter weather, which affected the entire category, the volume impact of our pricing actions and marketing execution on the Chunky brand. We're realistic about these issues and have plans to address those things within our control for the next soup season, namely, we intend to do a better job of driving demand particularly for Chunky ready-to-serve soups. We'll have a more robust marketing plan that fully leverages our NFL sponsorship. We also recognize that we need to bring more excitement to the category and we have new on-trend product innovations planned for fiscal 2017. We'll discuss these plans in greater detail at our Investor Day in July. 
There were several bright spots within Soup and Simple Meals. Sales of Swanson broth, Slow Kettle and Campbell's Organic soup all grew. Also, Campbell's condensed soup gained share. 
Beyond soup, Prego continues to perform well, driven by strong merchandising and growth in white sauces. We also began shipping Prego Farmers' Market, our new premium Italian sauce with a clean label. Additionally, we drove double-digit sales gains in Plum. 
V8 beverages continued to struggle with sales declines in V8 Red, V-Fusion and V8 Splash. There was, however, some good news, particularly in the performance of V8 Veggie Blends and V8 +Energy. 
In the short term, we've taken steps to address the performance of V8 Red and have increased both TV and digital advertising specific to the V8 Red brand. In the past, we've had success with advertising that reminds consumers of the benefits of V8. We're also building on the successful launch of V8 Veggie Blends with new varieties and expanding our V8 +Energy carbonated beverages into the grocery channel. We recognize that these short-term actions are not the complete solution. That said, V8 is a great brand and we believe we have a solid platform to build upon going forward. We're in the process of finalizing our strategy and we'll discuss our longer-term plans to get this business back on track at Investor Day. 
Overall, we feel good about how the Americas division is performing against its portfolio role year-to-date especially its continued margin expansion. Clearly, we have some work to do in several key categories to generate demand for our products. We get it and we're on it.
Turning to Global Biscuits and Snacks. This division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses, and its portfolio role is to manage growth while improving margins in both developed and developing markets. Pepperidge Farm delivered modest sales growth while we experienced some challenges in our Australia and China businesses. The 2 main drivers of the sales decline were Kelsen in China and Arnott's sweet biscuits in and Australia. 
First, China. Despite strong merchandising support and our improved marketing efforts heading into Chinese New Year's, sales were below expectations. We experienced short-term distribution challenges and faced strong competitive activity. Let me explain. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we made changes to our business model, adding salespeople and changing distributors. This new go-to-market model is designed to improve execution while enabling us increase distribution into multiple cities in China over time. However, our new distribution system did not have the same reach as in the past. In spite of the challenges we faced, Kelsen consumer takeaway and share increased in our priority markets. Going forward, we'll need to supplement and expand our distributor network to increase our geographic reach. We're confident that we'll get there and continue to believe in the long-term prospects for Kelsen in this important market. 
In Asia Pacific, excluding currency, sales of Arnott’s biscuits were comparable to the prior year with growth in Indonesia offset by declines in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, we faced competitive pressure in the sweet biscuit category and experienced lower consumer takeaway on special varieties of Arnott's Tim Tam biscuits, which had a negative impact on sales. On the plus side, our savoury biscuit business performed well and we're encouraged by the launch of our new and improved Arnott's Shapes crackers. 
While small, our developing markets in Southeast Asia performed well. Excluding the impact of currency, we grew sales in both Indonesia and Malaysia double digits. As expected, the economic situation in Indonesia started to improve in the quarter. 
Turning to North America. Pepperidge Farm cookies and crackers continued to perform well, driven mainly by Goldfish crackers. Sales declined slightly in our fresh bakery business as we faced increased competition in the quarter. 
Moving on to Campbell Fresh. C-Fresh is anchored by Bolthouse Farms and also includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and our refrigerated soup business. This division's portfolio role is to accelerate sales growth and expand into new Packaged Fresh categories. The CPG portion of this business is the full force growth engine of the division. Reported segment sales increased 6% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales declined 4%. In the quarter, Bolthouse Farms was a tale of 2 cities. Solid performance in our CPG premium juice and salad dressing business was more than offset by significant declines in our farm business, which consists of carrots and carrot ingredients. 
As I mentioned earlier, the carrot supply across the industry was negatively impacted by the adverse weather in California. This led to product shortages and product allocation to customers as we were unable to meet market demand. As a result, our carrot sales were down double digits in the quarter. This weather pattern is irregular. As we looked back, the Bolthouse Farms carrot business experienced similar weather conditions in the winter of 2010 to 2011. Since then, we've significantly diversified our winter crop into multiple growing regions in California, Arizona and Georgia. Today, we're much better equipped to respond and have reduced our recovery time. We're currently back in full supply with customers and don't anticipate any material sales impact going forward as we're now in the prime growing season in California. 
Turning to the CPG side of Bolthouse Farms. We're pleased with the 8% sales growth we delivered in the quarter. As expected, this growth was driven by distribution gains and our spring innovation. We added 14 new items across ultra- and super-premium beverages as well as salad dressings, which increased double digits. 
We're also pleased with the performance of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, our Ultra-Premium Cold-Pressed Organic juice line. We achieved 50% ACV in less than 12 months enabled by our investment in expanded capacity. Due to the success of our spring innovation sell-in, we're well positioned for the fourth quarter and as we look ahead to fiscal 2017. 
A quick word on our Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition. From an integration standpoint, we continue to make progress on bringing the business into the Bolthouse Farms operations platform and we've expanded fresh salsa distribution. We remain very optimistic about the potential of this brand. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to share my thoughts on our year-to-date performance. Year-to-date, organic sales are down slightly, 1%, in what continues to be a very challenging consumer environment. We're clear-eyed about the factors impacting our top line and the actions we need to take to address them. We can and we must do better on driving profitable net sales growth. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and next fiscal year, we expect to grow organic sales. Our year-to-date adjusted EBIT increase of plus 15% reflects our improved gross margin performance and the benefits of our $300 million cost savings initiatives including our move to zero-based budgeting. As we focus on finishing the fiscal year, I feel good about the progress we're making, how we've performed year-to-date and our outlook for the full year. This is reflected in our updated guidance, which Anthony will discuss shortly. 
We've made many important changes to Campbell, completely redesigning our organization, setting up the company by category versus geography and assigning each division a clear portfolio role. We continue to remain focused on strengthening our core business and expanding into faster-growing spaces as we unleash the power of our purpose: real food that matters for life's moments. 
Overall, we're now better positioned to execute our strategies, invest in the areas of our business that hold the greatest profitable growth potential and increase shareholder value. We're proud of the progress we've made, but we know we have more to do. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."
258458,290972500,989431,"Campbell Soup Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 20, 2016",2016-05-20,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the third quarter.

Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the third quarter. Organic sales in the quarter were below our expectations, reflecting softness in U.S. soup, V8 beverages and the weather-related crop yield issue, which negatively impacted our carrot sales and earnings. 
We continued to make progress on adjusted gross margin. It improved by 40 basis points, better than expected, benefiting from our supply chain performance and moderating cost inflation despite the weather-related yield issue on carrots. The carrot issued negatively impacted sales by approximately $14 million and our adjusted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points or $0.02 per share. 
We continue to make good progress on our cost savings initiative, which delivered approximately $30 million of savings in the third quarter, with these savings impacting multiple P&L lines, bringing the year-to-date total to $110 million. Program to date, we are now at $195 million in cost savings. 
With one quarter to go, we are updating our guidance. We are holding the sales range, narrowing the adjusted EBIT range and raising the adjusted EPS range to reflect our current outlook for adjusted EBIT and a lower adjusted tax rate. 
Now I'll take you through the detailed results and guidance. For the third quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 2% to $1.87 billion. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales also declined 2% driven by lower volume. Net price realization was comparable to the prior year with higher selling prices offset by increased trade promotions. Adjusted EBIT decreased 5% to $312 million, reflecting higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses, higher administrative expenses and lower volumes partly offset by a higher gross margin percentage. Adjusted EPS decreased 2% to $0.65. 
For the 9-month period, net sales on an as-reported basis were down 2% while organic sales decreased 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT of $1,214,000,000 and adjusted EPS of $2.48 both increased by 15%. Year-to-date earnings growth is being driven by our improved gross margin performance and benefits from our cost savings initiatives. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Reported net sales and organic sales both declined 2% as the 1-point negative impact of currency translation was offset by the 1-point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. Within organic sales, volume and mix subtracted 2 points, which was primarily driven by declines in V8 beverages and soup within the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment as well as the lost carrot sales in Campbell Fresh. Higher selling prices contributed 1 point of sales growth while higher promotional spending subtracted 1 point. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 40 basis points to 37% exceeding our expectations on overall supply chain performance despite the weather-related carrot issue. Cost inflation and other factors had a negative margin impact of 1.6 points, driven primarily by cost inflation, which, as a rate, increased by approximately 1% and the increase in carrot cost previously discussed. In aggregate, our net price realization reduced adjusted gross margin by 20 basis points as higher promotional spending in the quarter to support U.S. Soup, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Bolthouse Farms beverages was mostly offset by list pricing actions previously taken across several businesses. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 10 basis points. Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our 3-year cost savings program, contributed 210 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. 
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 5% in the quarter primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expense. Advertising and consumer promotion expense increased 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by increases in Pepperidge Farm and V8 beverages. 
Adjusted administrative expenses increased 4% primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, inflation, increased costs to support long-term innovation and the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet partly offset by the benefits from cost savings initiatives. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. As you can see, adjusted EPS decreased $0.01 compared with the prior year from $0.66 to $0.65 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, declines in adjusted EBIT had a $0.03 a negative impact on EPS. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly, but had no impact on EPS for the quarter. And net interest expense was comparable to prior year levels. 
Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 28.5%, down 3.1 points versus the prior year primarily due to lower-than-expected taxes on foreign earnings partly offset by the geographic mix of our earnings with a higher proportion of income in the U.S. The lower tax rate benefited EPS by $0.03. 
Currency had a $0.01 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.65 per share. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 2% to $999 million driven by declines in soup and V8 beverages partly offset by gains in Prego pasta sauces and Plum products. Operating earnings increased 1% reflecting a higher gross margin percentage driven by productivity improvement partly offset by lower volumes and increased advertising expenses. 
In total, U.S. soup sales declined 5% driven by category declines, which, as Denise mentioned, were primarily impacted by warmer weather compared to the year ago quarter, the impact from our pricing actions and marketing execution issues on Chunky. Although our pricing actions had a negative impact on volumes, they have contributed to improved profitability. Within U.S. soup, RTS declined 13% and condensed declined 4% partly offset by a 10% gain in Swanson broth. Estimated changes in retailer inventory levels did not meaningfully impact sales in the quarter. As we previously stated, we will not be providing this subcategory sales performance beyond this fiscal year. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending May 1, 2016, the category as a whole declined 2.4%. Our sales in measured channels declined 3.5% with weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decline of 70 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 29%, up 50 basis points reflecting share gains by smaller brands. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales decreased 1% with declines in Kelsen partly offset by gains in Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers and soups and beverages in Australia. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales from Arnott’s biscuits were comparable to the prior year with gains in Indonesia offset by declines in sweet biscuit varieties in Australia. Operating earnings decreased 8% primarily driven by higher incentive compensation costs and the negative impact of currency translation. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales decreased 4% with declines in carrot partly offset by gains in Bolthouse Farms premium, refrigerated beverages and salad dressings. Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 10 points of sales growth to the segment. Operating earnings declined 28% driven by the higher carrot costs. Excluding the negative impact from the carrot issue and the acquisition, operating earnings for C-Fresh in the quarter would have increased significantly compared to the prior year. Despite the negative impacts in the quarter, year-to-date operating margins in C-Fresh have increased by 1 percentage point. 
We had strong cash flow performance for the first 9 months. Cash from operations increased by $212 million to $1,183,000,000 driven by higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements especially in the area of inventory. 
Capital expenditures decreased $17 million to $225 million. 
We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2016. 
We paid dividends totaling $294 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 cents per share. 
In aggregate, we repurchased $118 million of shares in the first 9 months, $75 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt declined by approximately $250 million as positive net cash flow generated by the business more than offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Now I'll review our 2016 outlook. Our sales guidance remains unchanged at minus 1% to 0% including a 1-point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet and a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. We're narrowing the range for adjusted EBIT, which we now expect to grow 11% to 13%. The year-over-year growth reflects the benefit of improved gross margin performance and the benefits from our cost savings initiative. We expect adjusted gross margin for the year to expand by approximately 175 to 200 basis points. We're increasing the adjusted EPS growth range to 11% to 13% or $2.93 to $3 per share, in line with EBIT growth. Reflecting lower taxes on foreign earnings, we now expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 32%. Against our cost savings program, and consistent with our prior forecast, we expect to deliver incremental savings in the range of $120 million to $140 million in 2016. Our 2018 annual savings target remains unchanged at $300 million. 
That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

So is it right to think, kind of going forward, that like the bulk of the '17 savings should get reinvested back into the business, Denise?

A lot of the money is going to make sure that we have support of our key brands in line with the portfolio roles in each division. One thing that is new is we are channeling some of these dollars into longer-term innovation so that we make sure we have a robust pipeline in a state of readiness.

I talked about the sales decline being due to 3 factors: one being predominantly RTS soup, the second being V8 beverages, and the third, the unfortunate situation we had in carrots with the shortage of organic carrots. The investment that we made was on different things. So we invested A&C, advertising and consumer, in our Global Biscuits and Snacks business against Shapes in Australia, which worked; Tim Tams in Australia, which didn't work; and our cookies and bakery business in Goldfish and Pepperidge Farm, which did work. We invested advertising and consumer in V8, but we focused it on the Veggie Blends and that worked, but what we realized is that we had to put more emphasis going forward on V8 Red and we're course-correcting there. We also spent, predominantly, promotion spending on our Campbell Fresh new product launches and that is going incredibly well. And then, finally, we spent money against Prego and Simple Meals, which also had a very good quarter. So we do believe in the investment of A&C in this business. And with trade spending, it was up against the Arnott's business that I just talked about, Goldfish and C-Fresh new products.

We'll give more specific guidance when we get to our fourth quarter call. In terms of the implied range, it does obviously have a $0.07 delta in the fourth quarter. I think, for perspective and -- we've had a bit of challenge forecasting our year. As you know, we've taken the guidance up a couple of times already. We've just gone through massive change here at the company, probably the largest transformational change in the company's history in terms of reorganizing into 3 divisions, addressing spans and layers and a voluntary headcount reduction, involuntary headcount reduction, the adoption of zero-based budgeting and changing many of the policies we have at the company, changing our operating model and forming an Integrated Global Services function. And given the amount of change, it's just been really difficult or more difficult than usual to forecast, so we're just giving ourselves a little bit of a latitude here in the fourth quarter in terms of where we're going to come out. Some of the variability will likely be in gross margin. That 25 basis point range can take you from the top of the EPS rates to the bottom. Cost savings could be a little bit variable.

If you go over the past 2 years, it looks like pricing is up about 2.5 points while volume is down about 7.5, that's just for this third quarter, just stack the past 2 years. And I'm wondering, I know costs are down a fair amount in that time and so I understand you've done a great job holding share in those categories, we're mainly talking soup here, but what role do you think higher pricing across the category is having in sort of hurting the volumes in soup? I mean I know you maybe had some weather, but on a 2-year basis, that's not really been the case, some weather this year. And going forward now, the costs are right rising a little bit more. Is that going to change your philosophy in thinking about how you balance price and volume in America's Simple Meals?"

I'd say on the cost side, you said they're rising a little bit more. We're seeing moderating cost inflation at least in the back half of this year and probably into next year and that takes a little bit of pressure off the pricing algorithm. I mean, our objective is to expand gross margins through a combination of net pricing and productivity in excess of cost inflation. So as cost inflation moderates, that gives us a little more flexibility. There's no question that if you look back over the last couple of years, we have moved up some of our net pricing, both list and promoted, in an effort to improve the profitability of the soup business, and in fact, we've done that quite successfully. Now that does have a short-term impact on volume. Longer term, we like to think that the broad basket of things that'll drive consumer demand, things like product quality and innovation and robust marketing are all part of that algorithm to drive volume growth over the long term."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today, I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and year-to-date.

Today, I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. 
As many of you are aware, the consumer environment continues to be challenging in many of the markets where we have operations. In the U.S., consumer spending remains cautious. Shoppers are making more frequent trips than a year ago but they're purchasing less per trip. As a result, consumer takeaway of total food and beverage has softened compared to both short- and longer-term comparisons. This has exerted top line pressure on both retailers and manufacturers. In other parts of the world, economic conditions remain volatile. 
In the third quarter, our organic sales declined 2%, which was below our expectations. Key factors that led to the decline include softer-than-expected soup category performance, weakness in V8 beverages and product shortages in our Bolthouse Farms carrot business. 
I continue to be pleased with our adjusted gross margin expansion, driven by supply chain productivity programs despite the negative impact of the weather on our Bolthouse Farms carrot business. Both our sales and the cost of carrots were adversely impacted by the poor growing conditions in California. Cold rainy weather from mid-December through mid-March reduced carrot yields across the industry. The decreased crop yield had a significant impact on our gross margin performance in the quarter. Both Anthony and I will discuss this later in the call. 
Third quarter adjusted EBIT declined, but was better than we expected, reflecting improved gross margin performance. The decline in adjusted EBIT was due to higher levels of planned spending including the increased marketing investments as well as higher incentive compensation costs and investments in long-term innovation. We expected that our adjusted EBIT performance would taper in the second half as we realize the benefits of our cost savings earlier, cycled improved gross margin from a year ago and implemented our plans to increase marketing investment in the second half. 
Now let me share my view on our segment performance for the quarter. Let's start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. Organic sales declined by 2% in the quarter predominantly driven by U.S. Soup and V8 beverages. Our ready-to-serve soup business was challenged by a number of the same factors we discussed last quarter: the mild winter weather, which affected the entire category, the volume impact of our pricing actions and marketing execution on the Chunky brand. We're realistic about these issues and have plans to address those things within our control for the next soup season, namely, we intend to do a better job of driving demand particularly for Chunky ready-to-serve soups. We'll have a more robust marketing plan that fully leverages our NFL sponsorship. We also recognize that we need to bring more excitement to the category and we have new on-trend product innovations planned for fiscal 2017. We'll discuss these plans in greater detail at our Investor Day in July. 
There were several bright spots within Soup and Simple Meals. Sales of Swanson broth, Slow Kettle and Campbell's Organic soup all grew. Also, Campbell's condensed soup gained share. 
Beyond soup, Prego continues to perform well, driven by strong merchandising and growth in white sauces. We also began shipping Prego Farmers' Market, our new premium Italian sauce with a clean label. Additionally, we drove double-digit sales gains in Plum. 
V8 beverages continued to struggle with sales declines in V8 Red, V-Fusion and V8 Splash. There was, however, some good news, particularly in the performance of V8 Veggie Blends and V8 +Energy. 
In the short term, we've taken steps to address the performance of V8 Red and have increased both TV and digital advertising specific to the V8 Red brand. In the past, we've had success with advertising that reminds consumers of the benefits of V8. We're also building on the successful launch of V8 Veggie Blends with new varieties and expanding our V8 +Energy carbonated beverages into the grocery channel. We recognize that these short-term actions are not the complete solution. That said, V8 is a great brand and we believe we have a solid platform to build upon going forward. We're in the process of finalizing our strategy and we'll discuss our longer-term plans to get this business back on track at Investor Day. 
Overall, we feel good about how the Americas division is performing against its portfolio role year-to-date especially its continued margin expansion. Clearly, we have some work to do in several key categories to generate demand for our products. We get it and we're on it.
Turning to Global Biscuits and Snacks. This division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses, and its portfolio role is to manage growth while improving margins in both developed and developing markets. Pepperidge Farm delivered modest sales growth while we experienced some challenges in our Australia and China businesses. The 2 main drivers of the sales decline were Kelsen in China and Arnott's sweet biscuits in and Australia. 
First, China. Despite strong merchandising support and our improved marketing efforts heading into Chinese New Year's, sales were below expectations. We experienced short-term distribution challenges and faced strong competitive activity. Let me explain. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we made changes to our business model, adding salespeople and changing distributors. This new go-to-market model is designed to improve execution while enabling us increase distribution into multiple cities in China over time. However, our new distribution system did not have the same reach as in the past. In spite of the challenges we faced, Kelsen consumer takeaway and share increased in our priority markets. Going forward, we'll need to supplement and expand our distributor network to increase our geographic reach. We're confident that we'll get there and continue to believe in the long-term prospects for Kelsen in this important market. 
In Asia Pacific, excluding currency, sales of Arnott’s biscuits were comparable to the prior year with growth in Indonesia offset by declines in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, we faced competitive pressure in the sweet biscuit category and experienced lower consumer takeaway on special varieties of Arnott's Tim Tam biscuits, which had a negative impact on sales. On the plus side, our savoury biscuit business performed well and we're encouraged by the launch of our new and improved Arnott's Shapes crackers. 
While small, our developing markets in Southeast Asia performed well. Excluding the impact of currency, we grew sales in both Indonesia and Malaysia double digits. As expected, the economic situation in Indonesia started to improve in the quarter. 
Turning to North America. Pepperidge Farm cookies and crackers continued to perform well, driven mainly by Goldfish crackers. Sales declined slightly in our fresh bakery business as we faced increased competition in the quarter. 
Moving on to Campbell Fresh. C-Fresh is anchored by Bolthouse Farms and also includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and our refrigerated soup business. This division's portfolio role is to accelerate sales growth and expand into new Packaged Fresh categories. The CPG portion of this business is the full force growth engine of the division. Reported segment sales increased 6% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales declined 4%. In the quarter, Bolthouse Farms was a tale of 2 cities. Solid performance in our CPG premium juice and salad dressing business was more than offset by significant declines in our farm business, which consists of carrots and carrot ingredients. 
As I mentioned earlier, the carrot supply across the industry was negatively impacted by the adverse weather in California. This led to product shortages and product allocation to customers as we were unable to meet market demand. As a result, our carrot sales were down double digits in the quarter. This weather pattern is irregular. As we looked back, the Bolthouse Farms carrot business experienced similar weather conditions in the winter of 2010 to 2011. Since then, we've significantly diversified our winter crop into multiple growing regions in California, Arizona and Georgia. Today, we're much better equipped to respond and have reduced our recovery time. We're currently back in full supply with customers and don't anticipate any material sales impact going forward as we're now in the prime growing season in California. 
Turning to the CPG side of Bolthouse Farms. We're pleased with the 8% sales growth we delivered in the quarter. As expected, this growth was driven by distribution gains and our spring innovation. We added 14 new items across ultra- and super-premium beverages as well as salad dressings, which increased double digits. 
We're also pleased with the performance of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, our Ultra-Premium Cold-Pressed Organic juice line. We achieved 50% ACV in less than 12 months enabled by our investment in expanded capacity. Due to the success of our spring innovation sell-in, we're well positioned for the fourth quarter and as we look ahead to fiscal 2017. 
A quick word on our Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition. From an integration standpoint, we continue to make progress on bringing the business into the Bolthouse Farms operations platform and we've expanded fresh salsa distribution. We remain very optimistic about the potential of this brand. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to share my thoughts on our year-to-date performance. Year-to-date, organic sales are down slightly, 1%, in what continues to be a very challenging consumer environment. We're clear-eyed about the factors impacting our top line and the actions we need to take to address them. We can and we must do better on driving profitable net sales growth. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and next fiscal year, we expect to grow organic sales. Our year-to-date adjusted EBIT increase of plus 15% reflects our improved gross margin performance and the benefits of our $300 million cost savings initiatives including our move to zero-based budgeting. As we focus on finishing the fiscal year, I feel good about the progress we're making, how we've performed year-to-date and our outlook for the full year. This is reflected in our updated guidance, which Anthony will discuss shortly. 
We've made many important changes to Campbell, completely redesigning our organization, setting up the company by category versus geography and assigning each division a clear portfolio role. We continue to remain focused on strengthening our core business and expanding into faster-growing spaces as we unleash the power of our purpose: real food that matters for life's moments. 
Overall, we're now better positioned to execute our strategies, invest in the areas of our business that hold the greatest profitable growth potential and increase shareholder value. We're proud of the progress we've made, but we know we have more to do. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."
258458,290972500,989439,"Campbell Soup Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 20, 2016",2016-05-20,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the third quarter.

Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the third quarter. Organic sales in the quarter were below our expectations, reflecting softness in U.S. soup, V8 beverages and the weather-related crop yield issue, which negatively impacted our carrot sales and earnings. 
We continued to make progress on adjusted gross margin. It improved by 40 basis points, better than expected, benefiting from our supply chain performance and moderating cost inflation despite the weather-related yield issue on carrots. The carrot issued negatively impacted sales by approximately $14 million and our adjusted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points or $0.02 per share. 
We continue to make good progress on our cost savings initiative, which delivered approximately $30 million of savings in the third quarter, with these savings impacting multiple P&L lines, bringing the year-to-date total to $110 million. Program to date, we are now at $195 million in cost savings. 
With one quarter to go, we are updating our guidance. We are holding the sales range, narrowing the adjusted EBIT range and raising the adjusted EPS range to reflect our current outlook for adjusted EBIT and a lower adjusted tax rate. 
Now I'll take you through the detailed results and guidance. For the third quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 2% to $1.87 billion. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales also declined 2% driven by lower volume. Net price realization was comparable to the prior year with higher selling prices offset by increased trade promotions. Adjusted EBIT decreased 5% to $312 million, reflecting higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses, higher administrative expenses and lower volumes partly offset by a higher gross margin percentage. Adjusted EPS decreased 2% to $0.65. 
For the 9-month period, net sales on an as-reported basis were down 2% while organic sales decreased 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT of $1,214,000,000 and adjusted EPS of $2.48 both increased by 15%. Year-to-date earnings growth is being driven by our improved gross margin performance and benefits from our cost savings initiatives. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Reported net sales and organic sales both declined 2% as the 1-point negative impact of currency translation was offset by the 1-point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. Within organic sales, volume and mix subtracted 2 points, which was primarily driven by declines in V8 beverages and soup within the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment as well as the lost carrot sales in Campbell Fresh. Higher selling prices contributed 1 point of sales growth while higher promotional spending subtracted 1 point. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 40 basis points to 37% exceeding our expectations on overall supply chain performance despite the weather-related carrot issue. Cost inflation and other factors had a negative margin impact of 1.6 points, driven primarily by cost inflation, which, as a rate, increased by approximately 1% and the increase in carrot cost previously discussed. In aggregate, our net price realization reduced adjusted gross margin by 20 basis points as higher promotional spending in the quarter to support U.S. Soup, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Bolthouse Farms beverages was mostly offset by list pricing actions previously taken across several businesses. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 10 basis points. Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our 3-year cost savings program, contributed 210 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. 
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 5% in the quarter primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expense. Advertising and consumer promotion expense increased 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by increases in Pepperidge Farm and V8 beverages. 
Adjusted administrative expenses increased 4% primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, inflation, increased costs to support long-term innovation and the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet partly offset by the benefits from cost savings initiatives. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. As you can see, adjusted EPS decreased $0.01 compared with the prior year from $0.66 to $0.65 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, declines in adjusted EBIT had a $0.03 a negative impact on EPS. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly, but had no impact on EPS for the quarter. And net interest expense was comparable to prior year levels. 
Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 28.5%, down 3.1 points versus the prior year primarily due to lower-than-expected taxes on foreign earnings partly offset by the geographic mix of our earnings with a higher proportion of income in the U.S. The lower tax rate benefited EPS by $0.03. 
Currency had a $0.01 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.65 per share. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 2% to $999 million driven by declines in soup and V8 beverages partly offset by gains in Prego pasta sauces and Plum products. Operating earnings increased 1% reflecting a higher gross margin percentage driven by productivity improvement partly offset by lower volumes and increased advertising expenses. 
In total, U.S. soup sales declined 5% driven by category declines, which, as Denise mentioned, were primarily impacted by warmer weather compared to the year ago quarter, the impact from our pricing actions and marketing execution issues on Chunky. Although our pricing actions had a negative impact on volumes, they have contributed to improved profitability. Within U.S. soup, RTS declined 13% and condensed declined 4% partly offset by a 10% gain in Swanson broth. Estimated changes in retailer inventory levels did not meaningfully impact sales in the quarter. As we previously stated, we will not be providing this subcategory sales performance beyond this fiscal year. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending May 1, 2016, the category as a whole declined 2.4%. Our sales in measured channels declined 3.5% with weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decline of 70 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 29%, up 50 basis points reflecting share gains by smaller brands. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales decreased 1% with declines in Kelsen partly offset by gains in Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers and soups and beverages in Australia. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales from Arnott’s biscuits were comparable to the prior year with gains in Indonesia offset by declines in sweet biscuit varieties in Australia. Operating earnings decreased 8% primarily driven by higher incentive compensation costs and the negative impact of currency translation. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales decreased 4% with declines in carrot partly offset by gains in Bolthouse Farms premium, refrigerated beverages and salad dressings. Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 10 points of sales growth to the segment. Operating earnings declined 28% driven by the higher carrot costs. Excluding the negative impact from the carrot issue and the acquisition, operating earnings for C-Fresh in the quarter would have increased significantly compared to the prior year. Despite the negative impacts in the quarter, year-to-date operating margins in C-Fresh have increased by 1 percentage point. 
We had strong cash flow performance for the first 9 months. Cash from operations increased by $212 million to $1,183,000,000 driven by higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements especially in the area of inventory. 
Capital expenditures decreased $17 million to $225 million. 
We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2016. 
We paid dividends totaling $294 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. 
In aggregate, we repurchased $118 million of shares in the first 9 months, $75 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt declined by approximately $250 million as positive net cash flow generated by the business more than offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Now I'll review our 2016 outlook. Our sales guidance remains unchanged at minus 1% to 0% including a 1-point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet and a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. We're narrowing the range for adjusted EBIT, which we now expect to grow 11% to 13%. The year-over-year growth reflects the benefit of improved gross margin performance and the benefits from our cost savings initiative. We expect adjusted gross margin for the year to expand by approximately 175 to 200 basis points. We're increasing the adjusted EPS growth range to 11% to 13% or $2.93 to $3 per share, in line with EBIT growth. Reflecting lower taxes on foreign earnings, we now expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 32%. Against our cost savings program, and consistent with our prior forecast, we expect to deliver incremental savings in the range of $120 million to $140 million in 2016. Our 2018 annual savings target remains unchanged at $300 million. 
That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

I talked about the sales decline being due to 3 factors: one being predominantly RTS soup, the second being V8 beverages, and the third, the unfortunate situation we had in carrots with the shortage of organic carrots. The investment that we made was on different things. So we invested A&C, advertising and consumer, in our Global Biscuits and Snacks business against Shapes in Australia, which worked; Tim Tams in Australia, which didn't work; and our cookies and bakery business in Goldfish and Pepperidge Farm, which did work. We invested advertising and consumer in V8, but we focused it on the Veggie Blends and that worked, but what we realized is that we had to put more emphasis going forward on V8 Red and we're course-correcting there. We also spent, predominantly, promotion spending on our Campbell Fresh new product launches and that is going incredibly well. And then, finally, we spent money against Prego and Simple Meals, which also had a very good quarter. So we do believe in the investment of A&C in this business. And with trade spending, it was up against the Arnott's business that I just talked about, Goldfish and C-Fresh new products. On a year-to-date basis, trade spending is down 5% and about 0.3 -- it's down 0.3 points versus year ago on a rate basis."

I think, for perspective and -- we've had a bit of challenge forecasting our year. As you know, we've taken the guidance up a couple of times already. We've just gone through massive change here at the company, probably the largest transformational change in the company's history in terms of reorganizing into 3 divisions, addressing spans and layers and a voluntary headcount reduction, involuntary headcount reduction, the adoption of zero-based budgeting and changing many of the policies we have at the company, changing our operating model and forming an Integrated Global Services function. And given the amount of change, it's just been really difficult or more difficult than usual to forecast, so we're just giving ourselves a little bit of a latitude here in the fourth quarter in terms of where we're going to come out. Some of the variability will likely be in gross margin. That 25 basis point range can take you from the top of the EPS rates to the bottom. Cost savings could be a little bit variable.

I'd say on the cost side, you said they're rising a little bit more.

I mean, our objective is to expand gross margins through a combination of net pricing and productivity in excess of cost inflation. So as cost inflation moderates, that gives us a little more flexibility. There's no question that if you look back over the last couple of years, we have moved up some of our net pricing, both list and promoted, in an effort to improve the profitability of the soup business, and in fact, we've done that quite successfully.

As many of you are aware, the consumer environment continues to be challenging in many of the markets where we have operations. In the U.S., consumer spending remains cautious. Shoppers are making more frequent trips than a year ago but they're purchasing less per trip. As a result, consumer takeaway of total food and beverage has softened compared to both short- and longer-term comparisons. This has exerted top line pressure on both retailers and manufacturers. In other parts of the world, economic conditions remain volatile. 
In the third quarter, our organic sales declined 2%, which was below our expectations. Key factors that led to the decline include softer-than-expected soup category performance, weakness in V8 beverages and product shortages in our Bolthouse Farms carrot business. 
I continue to be pleased with our adjusted gross margin expansion, driven by supply chain productivity programs despite the negative impact of the weather on our Bolthouse Farms carrot business. Both our sales and the cost of carrots were adversely impacted by the poor growing conditions in California. Cold rainy weather from mid-December through mid-March reduced carrot yields across the industry. The decreased crop yield had a significant impact on our gross margin performance in the quarter. Both Anthony and I will discuss this later in the call. 
Third quarter adjusted EBIT declined, but was better than we expected, reflecting improved gross margin performance. The decline in adjusted EBIT was due to higher levels of planned spending including the increased marketing investments as well as higher incentive compensation costs and investments in long-term innovation. We expected that our adjusted EBIT performance would taper in the second half as we realize the benefits of our cost savings earlier, cycled improved gross margin from a year ago and implemented our plans to increase marketing investment in the second half. 
Now let me share my view on our segment performance for the quarter. Let's start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. Organic sales declined by 2% in the quarter predominantly driven by U.S. Soup and V8 beverages. Our ready-to-serve soup business was challenged by a number of the same factors we discussed last quarter: the mild winter weather, which affected the entire category, the volume impact of our pricing actions and marketing execution on the Chunky brand. We're realistic about these issues and have plans to address those things within our control for the next soup season, namely, we intend to do a better job of driving demand particularly for Chunky ready-to-serve soups. We'll have a more robust marketing plan that fully leverages our NFL sponsorship. We also recognize that we need to bring more excitement to the category and we have new on-trend product innovations planned for fiscal 2017. We'll discuss these plans in greater detail at our Investor Day in July. 
There were several bright spots within Soup and Simple Meals. Sales of Swanson broth, Slow Kettle and Campbell's Organic soup all grew. Also, Campbell's condensed soup gained share. 
Beyond soup, Prego continues to perform well, driven by strong merchandising and growth in white sauces. We also began shipping Prego Farmers' Market, our new premium Italian sauce with a clean label. Additionally, we drove double-digit sales gains in Plum. 
V8 beverages continued to struggle with sales declines in V8 Red, V-Fusion and V8 Splash. There was, however, some good news, particularly in the performance of V8 Veggie Blends and V8 +Energy. 
In the short term, we've taken steps to address the performance of V8 Red and have increased both TV and digital advertising specific to the V8 Red brand. In the past, we've had success with advertising that reminds consumers of the benefits of V8. We're also building on the successful launch of V8 Veggie Blends with new varieties and expanding our V8 +Energy carbonated beverages into the grocery channel. We recognize that these short-term actions are not the complete solution. That said, V8 is a great brand and we believe we have a solid platform to build upon going forward. We're in the process of finalizing our strategy and we'll discuss our longer-term plans to get this business back on track at Investor Day. 
Overall, we feel good about how the Americas division is performing against its portfolio role year-to-date especially its continued margin expansion. Clearly, we have some work to do in several key categories to generate demand for our products. We get it and we're on it.
Turning to Global Biscuits and Snacks. This division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses, and its portfolio role is to manage growth while improving margins in both developed and developing markets. Pepperidge Farm delivered modest sales growth while we experienced some challenges in our Australia and China businesses. The 2 main drivers of the sales decline were Kelsen in China and Arnott's sweet biscuits in and Australia. 
First, China. Despite strong merchandising support and our improved marketing efforts heading into Chinese New Year's, sales were below expectations. We experienced short-term distribution challenges and faced strong competitive activity. Let me explain. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we made changes to our business model, adding salespeople and changing distributors. This new go-to-market model is designed to improve execution while enabling us increase distribution into multiple cities in China over time. However, our new distribution system did not have the same reach as in the past. In spite of the challenges we faced, Kelsen consumer takeaway and share increased in our priority markets. Going forward, we'll need to supplement and expand our distributor network to increase our geographic reach. We're confident that we'll get there and continue to believe in the long-term prospects for Kelsen in this important market. 
In Asia Pacific, excluding currency, sales of Arnott’s biscuits were comparable to the prior year with growth in Indonesia offset by declines in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, we faced competitive pressure in the sweet biscuit category and experienced lower consumer takeaway on special varieties of Arnott's Tim Tam biscuits, which had a negative impact on sales. On the plus side, our savoury biscuit business performed well and we're encouraged by the launch of our new and improved Arnott's Shapes crackers. 
While small, our developing markets in Southeast Asia performed well. Excluding the impact of currency, we grew sales in both Indonesia and Malaysia double digits. As expected, the economic situation in Indonesia started to improve in the quarter. 
Turning to North America. Pepperidge Farm cookies and crackers continued to perform well, driven mainly by Goldfish crackers. Sales declined slightly in our fresh bakery business as we faced increased competition in the quarter. 
Moving on to Campbell Fresh. C-Fresh is anchored by Bolthouse Farms and also includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and our refrigerated soup business. This division's portfolio role is to accelerate sales growth and expand into new Packaged Fresh categories. The CPG portion of this business is the full force growth engine of the division. Reported segment sales increased 6% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales declined 4%. In the quarter, Bolthouse Farms was a tale of 2 cities. Solid performance in our CPG premium juice and salad dressing business was more than offset by significant declines in our farm business, which consists of carrots and carrot ingredients. 
As I mentioned earlier, the carrot supply across the industry was negatively impacted by the adverse weather in California. This led to product shortages and product allocation to customers as we were unable to meet market demand. As a result, our carrot sales were down double digits in the quarter. This weather pattern is irregular. As we looked back, the Bolthouse Farms carrot business experienced similar weather conditions in the winter of 2010 to 2011. Since then, we've significantly diversified our winter crop into multiple growing regions in California, Arizona and Georgia. Today, we're much better equipped to respond and have reduced our recovery time. We're currently back in full supply with customers and don't anticipate any material sales impact going forward as we're now in the prime growing season in California. 
Turning to the CPG side of Bolthouse Farms. We're pleased with the 8% sales growth we delivered in the quarter. As expected, this growth was driven by distribution gains and our spring innovation. We added 14 new items across ultra- and super-premium beverages as well as salad dressings, which increased double digits. 
We're also pleased with the performance of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, our Ultra-Premium Cold-Pressed Organic juice line. We achieved 50% ACV in less than 12 months enabled by our investment in expanded capacity. Due to the success of our spring innovation sell-in, we're well positioned for the fourth quarter and as we look ahead to fiscal 2017. 
A quick word on our Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition. From an integration standpoint, we continue to make progress on bringing the business into the Bolthouse Farms operations platform and we've expanded fresh salsa distribution. We remain very optimistic about the potential of this brand. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to share my thoughts on our year-to-date performance. Year-to-date, organic sales are down slightly, 1%, in what continues to be a very challenging consumer environment. We're clear-eyed about the factors impacting our top line and the actions we need to take to address them. We can and we must do better on driving profitable net sales growth. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and next fiscal year, we expect to grow organic sales. Our year-to-date adjusted EBIT increase of plus 15% reflects our improved gross margin performance and the benefits of our $300 million cost savings initiatives including our move to zero-based budgeting. As we focus on finishing the fiscal year, I feel good about the progress we're making, how we've performed year-to-date and our outlook for the full year. This is reflected in our updated guidance, which Anthony will discuss shortly. 
We've made many important changes to Campbell, completely redesigning our organization, setting up the company by category versus geography and assigning each division a clear portfolio role. We continue to remain focused on strengthening our core business and expanding into faster-growing spaces as we unleash the power of our purpose: real food that matters for life's moments. 
Overall, we're now better positioned to execute our strategies, invest in the areas of our business that hold the greatest profitable growth potential and increase shareholder value. We're proud of the progress we've made, but we know we have more to do. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."
258458,290972500,989540,"Campbell Soup Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 20, 2016",2016-05-20,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the third quarter. Organic sales in the quarter were below our expectations, reflecting softness in U.S. soup, V8 beverages and the weather-related c",1579,"Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the third quarter. Organic sales in the quarter were below our expectations, reflecting softness in U.S. soup, V8 beverages and the weather-related crop yield issue, which negatively impacted our carrot sales and earnings. 
We continued to make progress on adjusted gross margin. It improved by 40 basis points, better than expected, benefiting from our supply chain performance and moderating cost inflation despite the weather-related yield issue on carrots. The carrot issued negatively impacted sales by approximately $14 million and our adjusted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points or $0.02 per share. 
We continue to make good progress on our cost savings initiative, which delivered approximately $30 million of savings in the third quarter, with these savings impacting multiple P&L lines, bringing the year-to-date total to $110 million. Program to date, we are now at $195 million in cost savings. 
With one quarter to go, we are updating our guidance. We are holding the sales range, narrowing the adjusted EBIT range and raising the adjusted EPS range to reflect our current outlook for adjusted EBIT and a lower adjusted tax rate. 
Now I'll take you through the detailed results and guidance. For the third quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 2% to $1.87 billion. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales also declined 2% driven by lower volume. Net price realization was comparable to the prior year with higher selling prices offset by increased trade promotions. Adjusted EBIT decreased 5% to $312 million, reflecting higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses, higher administrative expenses and lower volumes partly offset by a higher gross margin percentage. Adjusted EPS decreased 2% to $0.65. 
For the 9-month period, net sales on an as-reported basis were down 2% while organic sales decreased 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT of $1,214,000,000 and adjusted EPS of $2.48 both increased by 15%. Year-to-date earnings growth is being driven by our improved gross margin performance and benefits from our cost savings initiatives. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Reported net sales and organic sales both declined 2% as the 1-point negative impact of currency translation was offset by the 1-point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. Within organic sales, volume and mix subtracted 2 points, which was primarily driven by declines in V8 beverages and soup within the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment as well as the lost carrot sales in Campbell Fresh. Higher selling prices contributed 1 point of sales growth while higher promotional spending subtracted 1 point. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 40 basis points to 37% exceeding our expectations on overall supply chain performance despite the weather-related carrot issue. Cost inflation and other factors had a negative margin impact of 1.6 points, driven primarily by cost inflation, which, as a rate, increased by approximately 1% and the increase in carrot cost previously discussed. In aggregate, our net price realization reduced adjusted gross margin by 20 basis points as higher promotional spending in the quarter to support U.S. Soup, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Bolthouse Farms beverages was mostly offset by list pricing actions previously taken across several businesses. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 10 basis points. Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our 3-year cost savings program, contributed 210 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. 
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 5% in the quarter primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expense. Advertising and consumer promotion expense increased 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by increases in Pepperidge Farm and V8 beverages. 
Adjusted administrative expenses increased 4% primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, inflation, increased costs to support long-term innovation and the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet partly offset by the benefits from cost savings initiatives. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. As you can see, adjusted EPS decreased $0.01 compared with the prior year from $0.66 to $0.65 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, declines in adjusted EBIT had a $0.03 a negative impact on EPS. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly, but had no impact on EPS for the quarter. And net interest expense was comparable to prior year levels. 
Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 28.5%, down 3.1 points versus the prior year primarily due to lower-than-expected taxes on foreign earnings partly offset by the geographic mix of our earnings with a higher proportion of income in the U.S. The lower tax rate benefited EPS by $0.03. 
Currency had a $0.01 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.65 per share. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 2% to $999 million driven by declines in soup and V8 beverages partly offset by gains in Prego pasta sauces and Plum products. Operating earnings increased 1% reflecting a higher gross margin percentage driven by productivity improvement partly offset by lower volumes and increased advertising expenses. 
In total, U.S. soup sales declined 5% driven by category declines, which, as Denise mentioned, were primarily impacted by warmer weather compared to the year ago quarter, the impact from our pricing actions and marketing execution issues on Chunky. Although our pricing actions had a negative impact on volumes, they have contributed to improved profitability. Within U.S. soup, RTS declined 13% and condensed declined 4% partly offset by a 10% gain in Swanson broth. Estimated changes in retailer inventory levels did not meaningfully impact sales in the quarter. As we previously stated, we will not be providing this subcategory sales performance beyond this fiscal year. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending May 1, 2016, the category as a whole declined 2.4%. Our sales in measured channels declined 3.5% with weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decline of 70 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 29%, up 50 basis points reflecting share gains by smaller brands. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales decreased 1% with declines in Kelsen partly offset by gains in Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers and soups and beverages in Australia. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales from Arnott’s biscuits were comparable to the prior year with gains in Indonesia offset by declines in sweet biscuit varieties in Australia. Operating earnings decreased 8% primarily driven by higher incentive compensation costs and the negative impact of currency translation. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales decreased 4% with declines in carrot partly offset by gains in Bolthouse Farms premium, refrigerated beverages and salad dressings. Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 10 points of sales growth to the segment. Operating earnings declined 28% driven by the higher carrot costs. Excluding the negative impact from the carrot issue and the acquisition, operating earnings for C-Fresh in the quarter would have increased significantly compared to the prior year. Despite the negative impacts in the quarter, year-to-date operating margins in C-Fresh have increased by 1 percentage point. 
We had strong cash flow performance for the first 9 months. Cash from operations increased by $212 million to $1,183,000,000 driven by higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements especially in the area of inventory. 
Capital expenditures decreased $17 million to $225 million. 
We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2016. 
We paid dividends totaling $294 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. 
In aggregate, we repurchased $118 million of shares in the first 9 months, $75 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt declined by approximately $250 million as positive net cash flow generated by the business more than offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Now I'll review our 2016 outlook. Our sales guidance remains unchanged at minus 1% to 0% including a 1-point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet and a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. We're narrowing the range for adjusted EBIT, which we now expect to grow 11% to 13%. The year-over-year growth reflects the benefit of improved gross margin performance and the benefits from our cost savings initiative. We expect adjusted gross margin for the year to expand by approximately 175 to 200 basis points. We're increasing the adjusted EPS growth range to 11% to 13% or $2.93 to $3 per share, in line with EBIT growth. Reflecting lower taxes on foreign earnings, we now expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 32%. Against our cost savings program, and consistent with our prior forecast, we expect to deliver incremental savings in the range of $120 million to $140 million in 2016. Our 2018 annual savings target remains unchanged at $300 million. 
That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

So is it right to think, kind of going forward, that like the bulk of the '17 savings should get reinvested back into the business, Denise?

A lot of the money is going to make sure that we have support of our key brands in line with the portfolio roles in each division. One thing that is new is we are channeling some of these dollars into longer-term innovation so that we make sure we have a robust pipeline in a state of readiness. And then, finally, we're reinvesting it to build capabilities in things that we see coming into the industry such as digital and advanced analytics.

I talked about the sales decline being due to 3 factors: one being predominantly RTS soup, the second being V8 beverages, and the third, the unfortunate situation we had in carrots with the shortage of organic carrots. The investment that we made was on different things. So we invested A&C, advertising and consumer, in our Global Biscuits and Snacks business against Shapes in Australia, which worked; Tim Tams in Australia, which didn't work; and our cookies and bakery business in Goldfish and Pepperidge Farm, which did work. We invested advertising and consumer in V8, but we focused it on the Veggie Blends and that worked, but what we realized is that we had to put more emphasis going forward on V8 Red and we're course-correcting there. We also spent, predominantly, promotion spending on our Campbell Fresh new product launches and that is going incredibly well. And then, finally, we spent money against Prego and Simple Meals, which also had a very good quarter. So we do believe in the investment of A&C in this business. And with trade spending, it was up against the Arnott's business that I just talked about, Goldfish and C-Fresh new products. On a year-to-date basis, trade spending is down 5% and about 0.3 -- it's down 0.3 points versus year ago on a rate basis."

We'll give more specific guidance when we get to our fourth quarter call. In terms of the implied range, it does obviously have a $0.07 delta in the fourth quarter. I think, for perspective and -- we've had a bit of challenge forecasting our year. As you know, we've taken the guidance up a couple of times already. We've just gone through massive change here at the company, probably the largest transformational change in the company's history in terms of reorganizing into 3 divisions, addressing spans and layers and a voluntary headcount reduction, involuntary headcount reduction, the adoption of zero-based budgeting and changing many of the policies we have at the company, changing our operating model and forming an Integrated Global Services function. And given the amount of change, it's just been really difficult or more difficult than usual to forecast, so we're just giving ourselves a little bit of a latitude here in the fourth quarter in terms of where we're going to come out. Some of the variability will likely be in gross margin. That 25 basis point range can take you from the top of the EPS rates to the bottom. Cost savings could be a little bit variable.

I mean I know you maybe had some weather, but on a 2-year basis, that's not really been the case, some weather this year. And going forward now, the costs are right rising a little bit more.

So as cost inflation moderates, that gives us a little more flexibility. There's no question that if you look back over the last couple of years, we have moved up some of our net pricing, both list and promoted, in an effort to improve the profitability of the soup business, and in fact, we've done that quite successfully. Now that does have a short-term impact on volume.

As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slide posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who participate in listen-only mode. 
Today, we will make forward-looking statements which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates which can be inaccurate and are subject to risks. Please refer to Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. 
Now I'd like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this morning's news release, the current quarter results reflect a noncash impairment charge, pension and postretirement mark-to-market losses and charges related to cost-savings initiatives. The prior year quarter included pension and postretirement mark-to-market losses and charges related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost-savings initiatives. The adjusted results exclude the impact of these items impacting comparability, and our comparisons of the full year 2016 with 2015 will exclude these and previously announced items. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. 
Lastly, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2017's earnings date. We plan to release earnings on November 22, 2016; February 17, 2017; May 19, 2017; and August 31, 2017.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, I'll offer my perspective on our performance with a focus on how each of our divisions are performing against their portfolio roles. We finished the year in",2111,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, I'll offer my perspective on our performance with a focus on how each of our divisions are performing against their portfolio roles. 
We finished the year in line with our guidance and with strong profit performance. However, our results this quarter certainly did not meet my expectations. I am particularly unhappy with the short-term executional issues that have led to the poor performance in Campbell Fresh, both for the quarter and for the year. I'll spend the majority of my time this morning addressing this topic. 
While sales for the year, including Garden Fresh Gourmet, were up 5%, organic sales declined 4% in C-Fresh. In the fourth quarter, organic sales were down 12%, driven by declines in both CPG and Farms. This performance is unacceptable. I expect far more from the Campbell Fresh business. 
It's clear that we have several immediate challenges in Campbell Fresh, and we are addressing them. I'll get to that in a moment. But first, I want to step back and look at the big picture. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 is the first year of operation of Campbell Fresh. This division, which accounts for approximately $1 billion in revenue, or about 13% of our total sales, combines Bolthouse Farms, the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition and our refrigerated soup business. Strategically, C-Fresh positions Campbell to benefit from the growing health and well-being trend as well as the growing demand for better-for-you foods in the Packaged Fresh category. Its portfolio role is to deliver full-force growth, driven by the CPG business, and to contribute to the acceleration of Campbell's overall sales trajectory. While disappointed in our execution, I remain confident in our C-Fresh strategy. We have strong popular brands that are on trend with the changing nature of consumers' eating habits. We're well positioned in the produce and deli section of stores with an eye on expansion into other categories such as dairy. We have a robust innovation pipeline, and we're enhancing our approach to long-term innovation. Strategy was not the issue. Our problem was execution. I'm going to spend some time on what didn't work, and importantly, the actions we're taking to ensure the business performs to its potential. 
So what went wrong? There were 2 issues that was the primary drivers of the C-Fresh result in the quarter: the Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS recall and the poor performance of our carrot business. Let's start with our CPG business and the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage. As previously announced on June 22, we voluntarily recalled 3.8 million bottles of Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS beverages due to possible spoilage. The Protein PLUS lineup accounts for approximately 15% of the Bolthouse Farms' beverage business. In addition, the same manufacturing lines are used to produce our café drinks, which account for another 10% of the beverage business. Our examination into the recall identified our manufacturing equipment and process as a primary cause of the spoilage. We have corrected these problems, rigorously tested the products and started shipping again. However, production has not returned to the pre-recall levels due to new operating procedures that we put in place, including an enhanced test release protocol to ensure the product meets our high quality standards. Prior to the recall, a typical production run for these products would have been 72 hours. Today, production run is 24 hours. Unfortunately, the shorter runs significantly reduced our capacity. We were examining various ways to increase capacity, including commissioning other production lines, but we currently anticipate this will take time to implement and expect the supply will be impacted through the end of the calendar year 2016. 
Now turning to Farms. Let's take a look at our second issue, our carrot business. In July at our Investor Day, we discussed some weather-related problems and a customer issue in our carrot business. As we reviewed these issues further, we learned the problems were rooted in several decisions that had compounded one and another, and therefore were broader than we understood at the time. Specifically, there were some planting, harvesting and commercial decisions made earlier in the calendar year that exacerbated the weather problems. This led our farm's operation to harvest carrots prematurely in an attempt to meet customer demand. Ultimately, this resulted in a spring crop that yielded smaller carrots, which led to customer dissatisfaction and an additional loss of business. The size of the carrots we're harvesting now is vastly improved, and we're actively addressing service issues with customers. However, it will take us time to regain the lost business. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2017 carrot sales to be comparable to fiscal 2016, rather than benefiting from a recovery from last year's issues. 
A final point of context. Carrots are a relatively low-margin business. However, it serves as a chassis for our higher-margin value-added CPG business. Carrots provide the scale for the refrigerated logistics system that we leverage for distribution and merchandising. 
So what actions have we taken so far to correct these issues? Over the last several weeks, we made major organizational changes under Jeff Dunn, the President of Campbell Fresh. Several senior managers are no longer with the company, including the President of Bolthouse Farms. Additionally, we created a new structure to bolster more agility and collaboration across the division. Previously, we had 2 operating units. Bolthouse Farms functioned as a distinct unit, and Garden Fresh Gourmet was combined with Fresh Soup. Now we have 3 operating units reporting directly to Jeff. CPG, which integrates Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings with Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and chips, along with fresh soups; Farms, which consist of carrots and carrot ingredients, and the long-term innovation unit we discussed at Investor Day in July. In addition to the 3 operating units, we have created a more integrated structure both at the divisional level and with Campbell. In particular, we have strengthened the integration and oversight of the Campbell Fresh supply chain. We've also bolstered the Campbell Fresh leadership team by adding more senior finance, human resources and sales executives. This new team is a combination of seasoned and accomplished Campbell and Bolthouse Farms leaders and experienced executives recruited from food start-ups and major industry players. I believe that this newly structured team will lead this business back to the growth profile mandated by its portfolio role. In the first half of fiscal 2017, the new management team will take steps to stabilize the business. First, we expect to improve our execution. Second, we plan to continue to increase capacity as we rebound from the Protein PLUS recall and related production outage. And third, we'll stabilize the carrot business through improved quality and customer service. Our plans call for C-Fresh sales to be down slightly in the first half and return to growth consistent with its portfolio role in the second half. Putting it all together, we expect sales growth to be in the low-single digits for fiscal '17, and we will keep you updated on developments as we go. While disappointed in the near-term performance of C-Fresh, I remain confident in the strategy we are pursuing, the Packaged Fresh platform we're building and the growth potential of this business. 
Now let me shift gears to the progress we've made in other areas during fiscal 2016. As I said earlier, when I look at the year as a whole for the company, our profit performance was strong. This was driven by our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks divisions. We delivered double-digit adjusted earnings growth with solid operating performance, including expanded gross margin, significantly improved supply chain performance and better-than-expected cost savings. We also advanced our Real Food and Transparency agenda, establishing Campbell as a leader in this area. However, we continue to face challenges on the top line. We recognize that we need to grow sales, and it remains a top priority. Our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks divisions have performed largely in line with their portfolio roles. 
First, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. Things are moving in the right direction here, and I feel good about what we've achieved this year. We made important strides in fiscal 2016. The team drove significant gross margin expansion through a combination of net price realization and major improvements in our supply chain. This resulted in a 13% increase in operating profit. Our Simple Meals brands delivered sales growth behind Prego and Taste, and Plum delivered double-digit sales gains through increased distribution and innovation. And we advanced our Real Food agenda, changing many of our recipes, including clean label products, and embracing transparency. 
While we've accomplished much in the Americas division, sales remain inconsistent. Organic sales declined 1% for the year. Many of our brands are performing in line with the categories in which we compete. However, portions of the portfolio are underperforming their categories, in particular beverages and ready-to-serve soup. We're taking steps to address this and expect improved performance in these areas and modest growth in the division in fiscal '17. 
Looking ahead, the Americas division will continue to concentrate on getting more from our core brands with a focus on driving sales through investments and fewer bigger innovations and improved marketing while increasing margins. We have plans in place to drive continued margin expansion through supply chain efficiencies. In fiscal 2017, we expect our soup business to grow behind continued growth of broth and better performance from our ready-to-serve soup portfolio. As we outlined in Investor Day, our plans call for improved execution around the Chunky brand and the midyear launch of the new Well Yes clean label soup line. We also anticipate better performance from V8 beverages, driven by the continued success of Veggie Blends and V8 +Energy as well as a renewed focus on tried-and-tested marketing that reengages our loyal V8 Red consumers. To connect with our consumers, build brand relevance and drive demand, we're investing in 4 integrated marketing campaigns in the Americas, including a new NFL team Chunky campaign featuring 6 popular players. 
For the year, our Global Biscuits and Snacks division made progress in performing against its portfolio role. Organic sales increased 1%, and operating earnings were up 10%. Pepperidge Farm delivered strong performance, and our Asia Pacific team drove solid sales results in a highly competitive and concentrated trading environment. The emphasis on growing our icon brands, Goldfish, Tim Tam and Milano, as well as revenue management initiatives and improved supply chain performance, drove our results. Looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering the division's role of expanding in both developed and developing markets while improving margins. In the United States, we have higher levels of investment to drive sustained Goldfish growth, continued momentum from Milano, expanded Tim Tam distribution and increased innovation in our fresh bakery business. In Australia, we're focused on strengthening our Arnott's brand through integrated marketing and relevant consumer-driven innovation. In developing markets, we expect continued growth in Malaysia and improved performance in China and Indonesia. 
Looking forward to 2017, I have a pragmatic outlook. Our plan calls for modest growth, driven by reinvesting some of our cost savings back into the business. We're confident in the C-Fresh platform, and we're acting with urgency to address our execution to get the beverage and carrot business back on track while continuing to drive sales on salad dressings, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and fresh soups. We expect Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks to continue to live into their portfolio roles. We remain focus on delivering a 3-year cost-savings target. And we are looking for more opportunities to drive effectiveness and efficiency. We'll be reinvesting a portion of our cost savings in focused innovation and improved marketing on our core business, and we're creating an ownership mindset across the organization for through our zero-based budgeting efforts. These are reflected in our annual guidance, which Anthony will take you through in a few minutes. 
Clearly, we have some challenges ahead of us, but we know what's working and what's not. And we're taking action to improve our sales performance in every division. I remain confident in the strategic imperatives that we're pursuing and that they provide a compelling past to increase shareholder value. Reflecting confidence in our growth prospects and the strong profit performance this year, our Board of Directors declared a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend. 
Thank you. I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."

As Denise stated, we are disappointed with the performance of our C-Fresh division in the fourth quarter, which was the key driver of a 1% decline in organic sales for the company, reflecting the recall of Bolthouse Farms protein drink and declines in carrot. And the EBIT line, the negative impact of the C-Fresh performance was offset by lower incentive compensation accrual relative to our expectations. In the fourth quarter, our adjusted tax rate was negatively impacted by a $13 million correction for deferred taxes. The correction had a negative impact on EPS of $0.04 per share. And as a result, our full year tax rate finished above our previous expectation.
Moving on to the full year. While adjusted EPS of $2.94 was within our guidance range, we finished at the lower end due to the tax correction. We are pleased with our gross margin performance, which, on an adjusted basis, increased by 170 basis points, in line with expectations, driven by significantly improved supply chain performance, cost savings and net price realization. We continue to make very good progress against our 3-year cost-savings target of $300 million, delivering about $130 million of incremental savings in fiscal 2016, bringing the program to-date total to $215 million. 
As part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $0.41 per share in our GAAP results on our Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredient business, reflecting reduced expectations for future cash flows. I'm very pleased with our strong cash flow performance as cash from operations exceeded $1.4 billion, and our board has approved a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, although below our long-term target, we plan to improve our sales performance compared to 2016 and make investments in the business to support key brand, launch new products, drive long-term innovation and build capabilities in areas like digital and e-commerce. 
Now I'll review our detail -- sorry, our results in more detail. For the fourth quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis of $1,687,000,000 were comparable to the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation and the favorable impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales declined 1%, driven by declines in Campbell Fresh, partly offset by gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks. The negative impact from the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage was approximately 1 percentage point on total company sales. Adjusted EBIT declined 2% to $253 million as higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses and a lower gross margin percentage were partly offset by lower administrative expenses, reflecting lower incentive compensation accruals. Adjusted EPS decreased 6% or $0.03 to $0.46. This EPS decline includes a $0.03 per share negative impact from the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage, consistent with our expectation, as well as a $0.04 per share negative impact from the tax correction. For the full year, as reported and organic net sales both decreased 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT of $1,467,000,000 and adjusted EPS of $2.94 both increased by 11%. Earnings growth is being driven by our improved gross margin performance and a benefit from our cost-savings initiatives. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Net sales was comparable to prior year. Organic sales declined 1% as a 2-point negative impact from higher promotional spending was partly offset by a 1-point gain from volume and mix. Gains in volume were driven by growth in Arnott’s biscuits, Pepperidge Farm's Goldfish crackers and Prego pasta sauces, which benefited from the launch of the new Prego Farmer's Market product line, partly offset by declines in C-Fresh due to the Bolthouse Farms protein drinks recall and volume decline in carrot. Increased promotional spending across our 3 segments includes higher spending in Arnott's as we're lapping an unusually low quarter, which was impacted by product availability, higher spending in Bolthouse Farms to remain competitive and support the launch of 1915 and higher spending on Prego and Taste. With the exception of C-Fresh, increased promotional spending drove gains in volume. Completing the bridge, a 1 point negative impact from currency translation was offset by the 1 point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Our gross margin declined 90 basis points in the quarter to 36.1%. Looking at the drivers of this decline, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 270 basis points, driven primarily by cost inflation, which, on a rate basis, increased by about 1.5%, the recall and related production outages of Bolthouse Farms protein drink and higher carrot cost from unfavorable crop yields. Reflecting the increased promotional spending on the businesses I mentioned in the sales discussion, the higher promotional rate had a negative impact of 110 basis points on gross margin. This was partly offset by list pricing gains of 20 basis points from previous pricing actions in Global Biscuits and Snacks. Mix was slightly favorable, also adding 20 basis points. Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our 3-year cost-savings program, contributed 250 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. 
Looking at this another way, not on the chart, the weak performance of the Campbell Fresh segment accounted for 70 basis points of the total decline of 90 basis points, including the protein drink recall, which accounted for 50 basis points. Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 14% in the quarter, primarily due to higher advertising expenses in Pepperidge Farms to support Goldfish Crackers and the fresh bakery business and increased support of Prego pasta sauces. Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 19%, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs, which account for about 2/3 of the decline, as well as the benefit from our cost-savings initiatives. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. Adjusted EPS decreased $0.03 from $0.49 in the prior year to $0.46 per share in the current quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, declines in adjusted EBIT had a negative impact in EPS of $0.01. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter increased by 2.3 points to 36.4%. The increase in the tax rate reduced EPS by $0.02 as the impact of the deferred tax correction was partly offset by the benefit of geographic mix. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly, but due to rounding, shows no benefit on EPS in the quarter. Interest was fairly comparable to prior year, up $1 million, with no impact on EPS as the impact of higher average interest rate from the debt portfolio was mostly offset by lower debt level. Currency translation also had no impact, completing the bridge to $0.46 per share. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales were comparable to prior year at $842 million, driven by double-digit gains in Prego pasta sauces, including the benefit of the launch of Prego Farmers Market and also by double-digit gains in Plum products, offset by declines in V8 beverages and ready-to-serve soup. Operating earnings increased 4%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage driven by productivity improvement, partly offset by increased marketing expenses as we've increased support behind Prego and V8 beverages. 
Within U.S. Soup, which declined 2% in aggregate, condensed declined 1% and RTS declined 6%. These declines were partly offset by a 7% gain in Swanson broth. Estimated changes in retailer inventory levels did not meaningfully impact soup sales in the quarter. As we previously stated, while we will discuss the key drivers of soup performance as we do with our other businesses, this is the last quarter we will provide detailed subcategories sales performance. 
Here is a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending July 31, 2016, the category as a whole declined by 2.7%. Our sales and measure channels declined 3.8%, primarily driven by weakness in ready-to-serve, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share for the 52-week period, declining 70 basis points. Private label grew share by 10 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 29%, [ph] up 60 basis points, reflecting share gains by smaller brands. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2% with double-digit gains in Pepperidge Farm's Goldfish crackers, supported by increased advertising and growth and Arnott’s biscuits in Australia and New Zealand driven by increased promotional activity. Operating earnings increased 5% to $81 million as lower administrative costs were partly offset by lower gross margin percentage. Within gross margin, the impact of cost inflation and increased promotional spending was partly offset by productivity improvement. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales decreased 12% reflecting declines in Bolthouse Farms premium refrigerated beverages due to the recall of protein drinks. Sales of the CPG beverages and salad dressings businesses declined 10% in the quarter. Sales of carrot also declined as we experienced quality issues in the fourth quarter, which led to customer dissatisfaction and the loss of business. These declines were partly offset by gains in fresh soup. Operating earnings declined by $13 million or 62% to $8 million, primarily driven by the adverse impact of the voluntary recall on Bolthouse Farms protein drink and related production outages as well as higher carrot cost and lower sales of carrot and carrot ingredient, partly offset by lower administrative expenses. Just a reminder, the Garden Fresh Gourmet was acquired on June 29, 2015, and we have now wrapped the acquisition date. As a result, there is 1 month of operating results in Garden Fresh Gourmet now included in organic sales. 
We had very strong cash flow performance in fiscal 2016. Cash from operations increased by $281 million to a record $1,463,000,000, driven by significantly higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirement, reflecting reductions in inventory level. Capital expenditures declined $39 million to $341 million. We paid dividends totaling $390 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. And as announced this morning, we will be increasing our quarterly dividend by 12% to $0.35 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased $143 million of shares in fiscal 2016, $100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt declined by $592 million as cash from operations was well in excess of capital expenditures, dividend and share repurchases. 
Now I'll review our 2017 outlook. The company expects sales to grow by 0% to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 1% to 4% and adjusted EPS to grow by 2% to 5% or $3.09 per share. This guidance assumes, based on current exchange rates, that the impact from currency translation will be nominal. While not to the level of our long-term sales growth target of 1% to 3%, sales performance is expected to improve relative to 2016 as we address those businesses which have underperformed. While we expect to achieve further EBIT margin expansion in 2017, growth in adjusted EBIT is slightly below our long-term target as we will be making investments in our business to support key brands, new product launches, and long-term innovations and to build capabilities in areas like digital and e-commerce. These investments are designed to improve our growth profile over the long term. Our range for growth in adjusted EPS is ahead of EBIT as we plan to increase share repurchases and benefit from a slightly lower tax rate, partly offset by slightly higher interest expense given our expectation of rising short-term interest rates. While we don't give quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect the majority of our top and bottom line growth to come in the second half as we work through the issues we're currently experiencing in C-Fresh and as we wrap lower levels of marketing support in the first half of fiscal 2016. 
Turning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance, while inflation on core ingredients and packaging has moderated, we expect inflation and cost of products sold of approximately 2%, including higher wage and ongoing benefit cost and a lagging negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on the input cost of our international businesses given the timing of our foreign currency hedges. As we've successfully delivered in the past, we expect ongoing supply chain productivity gains, excluding our B2B initiative of approximately 3% of cost of products sold. We expect our gross margin percentage to improve slightly with productivity gains exceeding inflation. The effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 32%, slightly below the 2016 adjusted rate of 32.6%. While we are not prepared to provide a specific amount, we currently plan to significantly increase share repurchases, unless needed for other uses including M&A. Our EPS guidance reflects the favorable impact of these anticipated repurchases over the course of the year on our average shares outstanding. We are forecasting capital expenditures of approximately $350 million, comparable to fiscal 2016 levels and in line with our historical spending levels. And under our cost-savings program, we expect to deliver incremental savings of $50 million in fiscal 2017 and are on track to achieve our $300 million goal by 2018. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

We're going to support new product launches, things like Prego's Farmers market, Well Yes soup, Plum infant formula, the Bolthouse innovation, Tim Tam's expansion in the U.S. Goldfish made with organic wheat. So we have a number of product launches going on. We're also going to invest in new capabilities around things like digital and also e-commerce. We're going to make investment in our Real Food initiatives, so these are things like improving our can line and continuing the removal of BPA, improving the product and more clean label of those types of ingredients would tend to be more expensive.

Within that, we look at net price realization, productivity improvement to exceed inflation. On the net price realization, we feel really good about what we've been able to accomplish in 2016. In fact, 40 basis points of our 170 basis point gross margin improvement is driven by net price realization. And within that, and I guess a little distorted on the sales variance, but we've made meaningful reductions in trade spend in soup given the promotional pricing we've taken on RTS. And although it's impacted volumes, it has contributed significantly to margin expansion. Now we're up a little bit in the fourth quarter. It's a nonseasonal quarter for us. Most of our dollar increase in trade in the fourth quarter relates to our Arnott's business in Australia, but we're lapping a period of supply constraints, so we have a pullback on our promotional activity so we're wrapping that. But as I look at the whole year, we are accomplish what we set out to do in our plans and have made meaningful progress, especially in soup, which is very critical to our agenda going forward."

As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who participate in listen-only mode. 
Today, we will make forward-looking statements which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. 
Now I'd like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this morning's news release, the current quarter results reflect a noncash impairment charge, pension and post-retirement mark-to-market losses and charges related to cost-savings initiatives. The prior year quarter included pension and post-retirement mark-to-market losses and charges related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost-savings initiatives. The adjusted results exclude the impact of these items impacting comparability and our comparisons of the full year 2016 with 2015, will exclude these and previously announced items. 
Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. 
Lastly, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2017's earnings dates. We plan to release earnings on November 22, 2016; February 17, 2017; May 19, 2017; and August 31, 2017.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, I'll offer my perspective on our performance with a focus on how each of our divisions are performing against their portfolio roles. We finished the year in",2113,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, I'll offer my perspective on our performance with a focus on how each of our divisions are performing against their portfolio roles. 
We finished the year in line with our guidance and with strong profit performance. However, our results this quarter certainly did not meet my expectations. I am particularly unhappy with the short-term executional issues that have led to the poor performance in Campbell Fresh, both for the quarter and for the year. I'll spend the majority of my time this morning addressing this topic. 
While sales for the year, including Garden Fresh Gourmet, were up 5%, organic sales declined 4% in C-Fresh. In the fourth quarter, organic sales were down 12%, driven by declines in both CPG and Farms. This performance is unacceptable. I expect far more from the Campbell Fresh business. It's clear that we have several immediate challenges in Campbell Fresh, and we are addressing them. I'll get to that in a moment. But first, I want to step back and look at the big picture. 
As a reminder, fiscal 2016 is the first year of operation of Campbell Fresh. This division, which accounts for approximately $1 billion in revenue or about 13% of our total sales, combines Bolthouse Farms, the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition and our refrigerated soup business. Strategically, C-Fresh positions Campbell to benefit from the growing health and well-being trend as well as the growing demand for better-for-you foods in the Packaged Fresh category. Its portfolio role is to deliver full-force growth, driven by the CPG business and to contribute to the acceleration of Campbell's overall sales trajectory. While disappointed in our execution, I remain confident in our C-Fresh strategy. We have strong popular brands that are on trend with the changing nature of consumers' eating habits. We're well positioned in the produce and deli section of stores with an eye on expansion into other categories such as dairy. We have a robust innovation pipeline, and we're enhancing our approach to long-term innovation. Strategy was not the issue. Our problem was execution. I'm going to spend some time on what didn't work, and importantly, the actions we're taking to ensure the business performs to its potential. 
So what went wrong? There were 2 issues that were the primary drivers of the C-Fresh result in the quarter: the Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS recall; and the poor performance of our carrot business. Let's start with our CPG business and the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage. As previously announced on June 22, we voluntarily recalled 3.8 million bottles of Bolthouse Farms' Protein PLUS beverages due to possible spoilage. The Protein PLUS lineup accounts for approximately 15% of the Bolthouse Farms' beverage business. In addition, the same manufacturing lines are used to produce our café drinks, which account for another 10% of the beverage business. Our examination into the recall identified our manufacturing equipment and process, as the primary cause of the spoilage. We have corrected these problems, rigorously tested the product and started shipping again. However, production has not returned to the pre-recall levels due to new operating procedures that we've put in place, including an enhanced test and release protocol to ensure the product meets our high quality standards. Prior to the recall, a typical production run for these products would have been 72 hours. Today, our production run is 24 hours. Unfortunately, the shorter run significantly reduced our capacity. We were examining various ways to increase capacity, including commissioning other production lines, but we currently anticipate these will take time to implement and expect that supply will be impacted through the end of the calendar year 2016. 
Now turning to Farms. Let's take a look at our second issue, our carrot business. In July, at our Investor Day, we discussed some weather-related problems and a customer issue in our carrot business. As we review these issues further, we learned the problems were rooted in several decisions that had compounded one and another, and therefore were broader than we understood at the time. Specifically, there were some planting, harvesting and commercial decisions made earlier in the calendar year that exacerbated the weather problems. This led our farm's operation to harvest carrots prematurely in an attempt to meet customer demand. Ultimately, this resulted in a spring crop that yielded smaller carrots, which led to customer dissatisfaction and an additional loss of business. The size of the carrots we're harvesting now is vastly improved, and we're actively addressing service issues with customers. However, it will take us time to regain the lost business. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2017 carrot sales to be comparable to fiscal 2016, rather than benefiting from a recovery from last year's issues. 
A final point of context. Carrots are a relatively low-margin business. However, it serves as a chassis for our higher-margin value-added CPG business. Carrots provide the scale for the refrigerated logistic system that we leverage for distribution and merchandising. 
So what actions have we taken so far to correct these issues? Over the last several weeks, we made major organization changes under Jeff Dunn, the President of Campbell Fresh. Several senior managers are no longer with the company, including the President of Bolthouse Farms. Additionally, we created a new structure to bolster more agility and collaboration across the division. Previously, we had 2 operating units: Bolthouse Farms functioned as a distinct unit; and Garden Fresh Gourmet was combined with Fresh Soup. Now we have 3 operating units reporting directly to Jeff. CPG, which integrates Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings with Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and chips, along with fresh soups. Farms, which consist of carrots and carrot ingredients, and the long-term innovation unit we discussed at Investor Day in July. In addition to the 3 operating units, we have created a more integrated structure both at the divisional level and with Campbell. In particular, we have strengthened the integration and oversight of the Campbell Fresh supply chain. 
We have also bolstered the Campbell Fresh leadership team by adding more senior finance, human resources and sales executives. This new team is a combination of seasoned and accomplished Campbell and Bolthouse Farms leaders and experienced executives recruited from food start-ups and major industry players. I believe that this newly structured team will lead this business back to the growth profile mandated by its portfolio role. In the first half of fiscal 2017, the new management team will take steps to stabilize the business. First, we expect to improve our execution. Second, we plan to continue to increase capacity as we rebound from the Protein PLUS recall and related production outage. And third, we'll stabilize the carrot business through improved quality and customer service. 
Our plans call for C-Fresh sales to be down slightly in the first half and return to growth consistent with its portfolio role in the second half. Putting it all together, we expect sales growth to be in the low-single digits for fiscal '17, and we will keep you updated on developments as we go. 
While disappointed in the near-term performance of C-Fresh, I remain confident in the strategy we are pursuing, the Packaged Fresh platform we're building and the growth potential of this business. 
Now let me shift gears to the progress we've made in other areas during fiscal 2016. As I said earlier, when I look at the year as a whole for the company, our profit performance was strong. This was driven by our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks divisions. We delivered double-digit adjusted earnings growth with solid operating performance, including expanded gross margin, significantly improved supply chain performance and better-than-expected cost savings. We also advanced our real food and transparency agenda, establishing Campbell as a leader in this area. However, we continue to face challenges on the top line. We recognize that we need to grow sales, and it remains a top priority. Our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks divisions have performed largely in line with their portfolio roles. 
First, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. Things are moving in the right direction here, and I feel good about what we've achieved this year. We made important strides in fiscal 2016. The team drove significant gross margin expansion through a combination of net price realization and major improvements in our supply chain. This resulted in a 13% increase in operating profit. Our Simple Meals brands delivered sales growth behind Prego and Pace, and Plum delivered double-digit sales gains through increased distribution and innovation. And we advanced our Real Food agenda, changing many of our recipes, including clean label products, and embracing transparency. 
While we've accomplished much in the Americas divisions, sales remained inconsistent. Organic sales declined 1% for the year. Many of our brands are performing in line with the categories in which we compete. However, portions of the portfolio are underperforming their categories, in particular beverages and ready-to-serve soup. We're taking steps to address this and expect improved performance in these areas and modest growth in the division in fiscal '17. Looking ahead, the Americas division will continue to concentrate on getting more from our core brands with a focus on driving sales through investments in fewer bigger innovations and improved marketing while increasing margins. We have plans in place to drive continued margin expansion through supply chain efficiencies. 
In fiscal 2017, we expect our soup business to grow behind continued growth of broth and better performance from our ready-to-serve soup portfolio. As we outlined at Investor Day, our plans call for improved execution around the Chunky brand and the midyear launch of the new Well Yes clean label soup line. We also anticipate better performance from V8 beverages, driven by the continued success of Veggie Blends and V8 +Energy as well as a renewed focus on tried-and-tested marketing that reengages our loyal V8 Red consumers. 
To connect with our consumers, build brand relevance and drive demand, we're investing in 4 integrated marketing campaigns in the Americas, including a new NFL team Chunky campaign featuring 6 popular players. 
For the year, our Global Biscuits and Snacks division made progress in performing against its portfolio role. Organic sales increased 1%, and operating earnings were up 10%. Pepperidge Farm delivered strong performance, and our Asia Pacific team drove solid sales results in a highly competitive and concentrated trading environment. The emphasis on growing our icon brands Goldfish, Tim Tam and Milano, as well as revenue management initiatives and improved supply chain performance, drove our results. Looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering the division's role of expanding in both developed and developing markets while improving margins. In the United States, we have higher levels of investment to drive sustained Goldfish growth, continued momentum for Milano, expanded Tim Tam distribution and increased innovation in our fresh bakery business. In Australia, we're focused on strengthening our Arnott's brand through integrated marketing and relevant consumer-driven innovation. In developing markets, we expect continued growth in Malaysia and improved performance in China and Indonesia. 
Looking forward to 2017, I have a pragmatic outlook. Our plan calls for modest growth, driven by reinvesting some of our cost savings back into the business. We're confident in the C-Fresh platform, and we're acting with urgency to address our execution to get the beverage and carrot business back on track while continuing to drive sales on salad dressing, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and fresh soup. We expect Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks to continue to live into their portfolio roles. We remain focused on delivering our 3-year cost-savings target, and we are looking for more opportunities to drive effectiveness and efficiency. We'll be reinvesting a portion of our cost savings in focused innovation and improved marketing on our core business, and we're creating an ownership mindset across the organization through our zero-based budgeting efforts. These are reflected in our annual guidance, which Anthony will take you through in a few minutes. 
Clearly, we have some challenges ahead of us, but we know what's working and what's not. And we're taking action to improve our sales performance in every division. I remain confident in the strategic imperatives that we're pursuing and that they provide a compelling path to increase shareholder value. Reflecting confidence in our growth prospects and the strong profit performance this year, our Board of Directors declared a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend. 
Thank you. I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."
258458,290972518,1040666,"Campbell Soup Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 01, 2016",2016-09-01,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before I get into the details, I want to provide my perspective on our results and guidance. As Denise stated, we are disappointed with the performance of our C-Fresh division in the fourth quarter, which was the key driv",2261,"Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before I get into the details, I want to provide my perspective on our results and guidance. As Denise stated, we are disappointed with the performance of our C-Fresh division in the fourth quarter, which was the key driver of a 1% decline in organic sales for the company, reflecting the recall of Bolthouse Farms protein drink and declines in carrot. At the EBIT line, the negative impact of the C-Fresh performance was offset by lower incentive compensation accrual relative to our expectations. In the fourth quarter, our adjusted tax rate was negatively impacted by a $13 million correction for deferred taxes. The correction had a negative impact on EPS of $0.04 per share. And as a result, our full year tax rate finished above our previous expectations.
Moving on to the full year. While adjusted EPS of $2.94 was within our guidance range, we finished at the lower end due to the tax correction. We're pleased with our gross margin performance, which, on an adjusted basis, increased by 170 basis points, in line with the expectations, driven by significantly improved supply chain performance, cost savings and net price realization. We continue to make very good progress against our 3-year cost-savings target of $300 million, delivering about a $130 million of incremental savings in fiscal 2016, bringing the program to-date total to $215 million. 
As part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $0.41 per share in our GAAP results on our Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredient business, reflecting reduced expectation for future cash flows. I'm very pleased with our strong cash flow performance as cash from operations exceeded $1.4 billion, and our board has approved a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, although below our long-term target, we plan to improve our sales performance compared to 2016 and make investments in the business to support key brand, launch new products, drive long-term innovation and build capabilities in areas like digital and e-commerce. 
Now I'll review our detail -- sorry, our results in more detail. For the fourth quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis of $1,687,000,000 were comparable to the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation and the favorable impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales declined 1%, driven by declines in Campbell Fresh, partly offset by gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks. The negative impact from the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage was approximately 1 percentage point on total company sales. Adjusted EBIT declined 2% to $253 million as higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses and a lower gross margin percentage were partly offset by lower administrative expenses, reflecting lower incentive compensation accruals. Adjusted EPS decreased 6% or $0.03 to $0.46. This EPS decline includes a $0.03 per share negative impact from the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage, consistent with our expectation, as well as a $0.04 per share negative impact from the tax correction. 
For the full year, as reported and organic net sales both decreased 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT of $1,467,000,000 and adjusted EPS of $2.94 both increased by 11%. Earnings growth is being driven by our improved gross margin performance and a benefit from our cost-savings initiatives. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Net sales was comparable to prior year. Organic sales declined 1% as a 2-point negative impact from higher promotional spending was partly offset by a 1-point gain from volume and mix. Gains in volume were driven by growth in Arnott’s biscuits, Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers and Prego pasta sauces, which benefited from the launch of the new Prego Farmers' Market product line, partly offset by declines in C-Fresh due to the Bolthouse Farms protein drinks recall and volume decline in carrot. Increased promotional spending across our 3 segment includes higher spending in Arnott's, as we're lapping in an unusually low quarter, which was impacted by product availability, higher spending in Bolthouse Farms to remain competitive and support the launch of 1915 and higher spending on Prego and Taste. With the exception of C-Fresh, increased promotional spending drove gains in volume. Completing the bridge, a 1-point negative impact from currency translation was offset by the 1-point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Our gross margin declined 90 basis points in the quarter to 36.1%. Looking at the drivers of this decline, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 270 basis points, driven primarily by cost inflation, which, on a rate basis, increased by about 1.5%, the recall and related production outages of Bolthouse Farms protein drinks and higher carrot cost from unfavorable crop yields. Reflecting the increased promotional spending on the businesses I mentioned in the sales discussion, the higher promotional rate had a negative impact of 110 basis points on gross margin. This was partly offset by list pricing gains of 20 basis points from previous pricing actions in Global Biscuits and Snacks. Mix was slightly favorable, also adding 20 basis points. Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our 3-year cost-savings program, contributed 250 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. 
Looking at this another way, not on the chart, the weak performance of the Campbell Fresh segment accounted for 70 basis points of the total decline of 90 basis points, including the protein drink recall, which accounted for 50 basis points. 
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 14% in the quarter, primarily due to higher advertising expenses in Pepperidge Farm to support Goldfish crackers and the fresh bakery business and increased support of Prego pasta sauces. Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 19%, primarily due to lower incentive compensation cost, which account for about 2/3 of the decline, as well as the benefit from our cost-savings initiatives. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below the line items. Adjusted EPS decreased $0.03 from $0.49 in the prior year to $0.46 per share in the current quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, declines in adjusted EBIT had a negative impact on EPS of $0.01. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter increased by 2.3 points to 36.4%. The increase in the tax rate reduced the EPS by $0.02, as the impact of the deferred tax correction was partly offset by the benefit of geographic mix. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly, but due to rounding, shows no benefit on EPS in the quarter. Interest was fairly comparable to prior year, up $1 million, with no impact on EPS as the impact of higher average interest rate from the debt portfolio was mostly offset by lower debt level. Currency translation also had no impact, completing the bridge to $0.46 per share. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales were comparable to prior year at $842 million, driven by double-digit gains in Prego pasta sauces, including the benefit of the launch of Prego Farmers' Market and also by double-digit gains in Plum products, offset by declines in V8 beverages and ready-to-serve soup. Operating earnings increased 4%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage driven by productivity improvement, partly offset by increased marketing expenses, as we've increased support behind Prego and V8 beverages. 
Within U.S. soup, which declined 2% in aggregate, condensed declined 1% and RTS declined 6%. These declines were partly offset by a 7% gain in Swanson broth. Estimated changes in retailer inventory levels did not meaningfully impact soup sales in the quarter. As we previously stated, while we will discuss the key drivers of soup performance as we do with our other businesses, this is the last quarter we will provide detailed subcategory sales performance. 
Here is a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending July 31, 2016, the category as a whole declined by 2.7%. Our sales in measured channels declined 3.8%, primarily driven by weakness in ready-to-serve, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share for the 52-week period, declining 70 basis points. Private label grew share by 10 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 29% up 60 basis points, reflecting share gains by smaller brands. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2% with double-digit gains in Pepperidge Farm's Goldfish crackers, supported by increased advertising and growth in Arnott’s biscuits in Australia and New Zealand, driven by increased promotional activity. Operating earnings increased 5% to $81 million, as lower administrative costs were partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage. Within gross margin, the impact of cost inflation and increased promotional spending was partly offset by productivity improvement. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales decreased 12%, reflecting declines in Bolthouse Farms premium refrigerated beverages due to the recall of protein drinks. Sales of the CPG beverages and salad dressings businesses declined 10% in the quarter. Sales of carrots also declined as we experienced quality issues in the fourth quarter which led to customer dissatisfaction and the loss of business. These declines were partly offset by gains in fresh soup. Operating earnings declined by $13 million or 62% to $8 million, primarily driven by the adverse impact of the voluntary recall on Bolthouse Farms protein drink and related production outages as well as higher carrot cost and lower sales of carrots and carrot ingredient, partly offset by lower administrative expenses. Just a reminder, the Garden Fresh Gourmet was acquired on June 29, 2015, and we have now wrapped the acquisition date. As a result, there is 1 month of operating results from Garden Fresh Gourmet now included in organic sales. 
We had very strong cash flow performance in fiscal 2016. Cash from operations increased by $281 million to a record $1,463,000,000, driven by significantly higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirement, reflecting reductions in inventory level. Capital expenditures declined $39 million to $341 million. We paid dividends totaling $390 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. And as announced this morning, we will be increasing our quarterly dividend by 12% to $0.35 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased $143 million of shares in fiscal 2016, $100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt declined by $592 million, as cash from operations was well in excess of capital expenditures, dividend and share repurchases. 
Now I'll review our 2017 outlook. The company expects sales to grow by 0% to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 1% to 4% and adjusted EPS to grow by 2% to 5% or $3.00 to $3.09 per share. This guidance assumes, based on current exchange rates, that the impact from currency translation will be nominal. While not to the level of our long-term sales growth target of 1% to 3%, sales performance is expected to improve relative to 2016, as we address those businesses which have underperformed. While we expect to achieve further EBIT margin expansion in 2017, growth in adjusted EBIT is slightly below our long-term target, as we will be making investments in our business to support key brands, in new product launches, in long-term innovation and to build capabilities in areas like digital and e-commerce. These investments are designed to improve our growth profile over the long term. Our range for growth in adjusted EPS is ahead of EBIT, as we plan to increase share repurchases and benefit from a slightly lower tax rate, partly offset by slightly higher interest expense, given our expectation of rising short-term interest rates. While we don't give quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect the majority of our top and bottom line growth to come in the second half, as we work through the issues we're currently experiencing in C-Fresh and as we wrap lower levels of marketing support in the first half of fiscal 2016. 
Turning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance, while inflation on core ingredients and packaging has moderated, we expect inflation and cost of products sold of approximately 2%, including higher wage and ongoing benefit cost and a lagging negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on the input cost of our international businesses, given the timing of our foreign currency hedges. As we've successfully delivered in the past, we expect ongoing supply chain productivity gains, excluding our ZBB initiative of approximately 3% of cost of products sold. We expect our gross margin percentage to improve slightly with productivity gains exceeding inflation. The effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 32%, slightly below the 2016 adjusted rate of 32.6%. While we are not prepared to provide a specific amount, we currently plan to significantly increase share repurchases, unless needed for other uses including M&A. Our EPS guidance reflects the favorable impact of these anticipated repurchases over the course of the year on our average shares outstanding. We are forecasting capital expenditures of approximately $350 million comparable to fiscal 2016 levels and in line with our historical spending level. And under our cost-savings program, we expect to deliver incremental savings of $50 million in fiscal 2017 and are on track to achieve our $300 million goal by 2018. 
That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

We're going to support new product launches, things like Prego's Farmers' market, Well Yes soup, Plum infant formula, the Bolthouse spring innovations, Tim Tam's expansion in the U.S., Goldfish made with organic wheat. So we have a number of product launches going on. We're also going to invest in new capabilities around things like digital and e-commerce. We're going to make investments in our Real Food initiative, so these are things like improving our can liners, continuing the removal of BPA, improving the product and more clean label, those types of ingredients which tend to be more expensive.

With me on the call are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; and Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO. 
As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who participate in listen-only mode. 
Today, we will make forward-looking statements which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. 
Now I'd like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this morning's news release, the current quarter results reflect a noncash impairment charge, pension and post-retirement mark-to-market losses and charges related to cost-savings initiatives. The prior year quarter included pension and post-retirement mark-to-market losses and charges related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost-savings initiatives. The adjusted results exclude the impact of these items impacting comparability, and our comparisons of the full year 2016 with 2015 will exclude these and previously announced items. 
Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. 
Lastly, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2017's earnings dates. We plan to release earnings on November 22, 2016; February 17, 2017; May 19, 2017; and August 31, 2017.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, I'll offer my perspective on our performance with a focus on how each of our divisions are performing against their portfolio roles. 
We finished the year in line with our guidance and with strong profit performance. However, our results this quarter certainly did not meet my expectations. I am particularly unhappy with the short-term executional issues that have led to the poor performance in Campbell Fresh, both for the quarter and for the year. I'll spend the majority of my time this morning addressing this topic. 
While sales for the year, including Garden Fresh Gourmet, were up 5%, organic sales declined 4% in C-Fresh. In the fourth quarter, organic sales were down 12%, driven by declines in both CPG and Farms. This performance is unacceptable. I expect far more from the Campbell Fresh business. It's clear that we have several immediate challenges in Campbell Fresh, and we are addressing them. I'll get to that in a moment. But first, I want to step back and look at the big picture. 
As a reminder, fiscal 2016 is the first year of operation of Campbell Fresh. This division, which accounts for approximately $1 billion in revenue or about 13% of our total sales, combines Bolthouse Farms, the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition and our refrigerated soup business. Strategically, C-Fresh positions Campbell to benefit from the growing health and well-being trend as well as the growing demand for better-for-you foods in the Packaged Fresh category. Its portfolio role is to deliver full-force growth, driven by the CPG business and to contribute to the acceleration of Campbell's overall sales trajectory. While disappointed in our execution, I remain confident in our C-Fresh strategy. We have strong popular brands that are on trend with the changing nature of consumers' eating habits. We're well positioned in the produce and deli section of stores with an eye on expansion into other categories such as dairy. We have a robust innovation pipeline, and we're enhancing our approach to long-term innovation. Strategy was not the issue. Our problem was execution. I'm going to spend some time on what didn't work, and importantly, the actions we're taking to ensure the business performs to its potential. 
So what went wrong? There were 2 issues that were the primary drivers of the C-Fresh results in the quarter: the Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS recall; and the poor performance of our carrot business. Let's start with our CPG business and the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage. As previously announced on June 22, we voluntarily recalled 3.8 million bottles of Bolthouse Farms' Protein PLUS beverages due to possible spoilage. The Protein PLUS lineup accounts for approximately 15% of the Bolthouse Farms' beverage business. In addition, the same manufacturing lines are used to produce our café drinks, which account for another 10% of the beverage business. Our examination into the recall identified our manufacturing equipment and process as the primary cause of the spoilage. We have corrected these problems, rigorously tested the product and started shipping it again. However, production has not returned to the pre-recall levels due to new operating procedures that we've put in place, including an enhanced test and release protocol to ensure the product meets our high quality standards. Prior to the recall, a typical production run for these products would have been 72 hours. Today, a production run is 24 hours. Unfortunately, the shorter run significantly reduced our capacity. We are examining various ways to increase capacity, including commissioning other production lines, but we currently anticipate these will take time to implement and expect that supply will be impacted through the end of the calendar year 2016. 
Now turning to Farms. Let's take a look at our second issue, our carrot business. In July, at our Investor Day, we discussed some weather-related problems and a customer issue in our carrot business. As we review these issues further, we learned the problems were rooted in several decisions that had compounded one on another, and therefore were broader than we understood at the time. Specifically, there were some planting, harvesting and commercial decisions made earlier in the calendar year that exacerbated the weather problems. This led our farm's operation to harvest carrots prematurely in an attempt to meet customer demand. Ultimately, this resulted in a spring crop that yielded smaller carrots, which led to customer dissatisfaction and an additional loss of business. The size of the carrots we're harvesting now is vastly improved, and we're actively addressing service issues with customers. However, it will take us time to regain the lost business. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2017 carrot sales to be comparable to fiscal 2016, rather than benefiting from a recovery from last year's issues. 
A final point of context. Carrots are a relatively low-margin business. However, it serves as the chassis for our higher-margin value-added CPG business. Carrots provide the scale for the refrigerated logistics system that we leverage for distribution and merchandising. 
So what actions have we taken so far to correct these issues? Over the last several weeks, we made major organization changes under Jeff Dunn, the President of Campbell Fresh. Several senior managers are no longer with the company, including the President of Bolthouse Farms. Additionally, we created a new structure to foster more agility and collaboration across the division. Previously, we had 2 operating units: Bolthouse Farms functioned as a distinct unit; and Garden Fresh Gourmet was combined with Fresh Soup. Now we have 3 operating units reporting directly to Jeff. CPG, which integrates Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings with Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and chips, along with fresh soups. Farms, which consist of carrots and carrot ingredients, and the long-term innovation unit we discussed at Investor Day in July. In addition to the 3 operating units, we have created a more integrated structure both at the divisional level and with Campbell. In particular, we have strengthened the integration and oversight of the Campbell Fresh supply chain. 
We have also bolstered the Campbell Fresh leadership team by adding more senior finance, human resources and sales executives. This new team is a combination of seasoned and accomplished Campbell and Bolthouse Farms leaders and experienced executives recruited from food start-ups and major industry players. I believe that this newly structured team will lead this business back to the growth profile mandated by its portfolio role. In the first half of fiscal 2017, the new management team will take steps to stabilize the business. First, we expect to improve our execution. Second, we plan to continue to increase capacity as we rebound from the Protein PLUS recall and related production outage. And third, we'll stabilize the carrot business through improved quality and customer service. 
Our plans call for C-Fresh sales to be down slightly in the first half and return to growth consistent with its portfolio role in the second half. Putting it all together, we expect sales growth to be in the low-single digits for fiscal '17, and we will keep you updated on developments as we go. 
While disappointed in the near-term performance of C-Fresh, I remain confident in the strategy we are pursuing, the Packaged Fresh platform we're building and the growth potential of this business. 
Now let me shift gears to the progress we've made in other areas during fiscal 2016. As I said earlier, when I look at the year as a whole for the company, our profit performance was strong. This was driven by our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks divisions. We delivered double-digit adjusted earnings growth with solid operating performance, including expanded gross margin, significantly improved supply chain performance and better-than-expected cost savings. We also advanced our real food and transparency agenda, establishing Campbell as a leader in this area. However, we continued to face challenges on the top line. We recognize that we need to grow sales, and it remains a top priority. Our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks divisions have performed largely in line with their portfolio roles. 
First, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. Things are moving in the right direction here, and I feel good about what we've achieved this year. We made important strides in fiscal 2016. The team drove significant gross margin expansion through a combination of net price realization and major improvements in our supply chain. This resulted in a 13% increase in operating profit. Our Simple Meals brands delivered sales growth behind Prego and Pace, and Plum delivered double-digit sales gains through increased distribution and innovation. And we advanced our Real Food agenda, changing many of our recipes, including clean labeled products, and embracing transparency. 
While we've accomplished much in the Americas divisions, sales remained inconsistent. Organic sales declined 1% for the year. Many of our brands are performing in line with the categories in which we compete. However, portions of the portfolio are underperforming their categories, in particular beverages and ready-to-serve soup. We're taking steps to address this and expect improved performance in these areas and modest growth in the division in fiscal '17. Looking ahead, the Americas division will continue to concentrate on getting more from our core brands with a focus on driving sales through investments in fewer, bigger innovations and improved marketing, while increasing margins. We have plans in place to drive continued margin expansion through supply chain efficiencies. 
In fiscal 2017, we expect our soup business to grow behind continued growth of broth and better performance from our ready-to-serve soup portfolio. As we outlined at Investor Day, our plans call for improved execution around the Chunky brand and the midyear launch of the new Well Yes clean-labeled soup line. We also anticipate better performance from V8 beverages, driven by the continued success of Veggie Blends and V8 +Energy as well as a renewed focus on tried-and-tested marketing that reengages our loyal V8 Red consumers. 
To connect with our consumers, build brand relevance and drive demand, we're investing in 4 integrated marketing campaigns in the Americas, including a new NFL-themed Chunky campaign featuring 6 popular players. 
For the year, our Global Biscuits and Snacks division made progress in performing against its portfolio role. Organic sales increased 1%, and operating earnings were up 10%. Pepperidge Farm delivered strong performance, and our Asia Pacific team drove solid sales results in a highly competitive and concentrated trading environment. The emphasis on growing our icon brands: Goldfish, Tim Tam and Milano, as well as revenue management initiatives and improved supply chain performance, drove our results. Looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering the division's role of expanding in both developed and developing markets while improving margins. In the United States, we have higher levels of investment to drive sustained Goldfish growth, continued momentum for Milano, expanded Tim Tam distribution and increased innovation in our fresh bakery business. In Australia, we're focused on strengthening our Arnott's brand through integrated marketing and relevant consumer-driven innovation. In developing markets, we expect continued growth in Malaysia and improved performance in China and Indonesia. 
Looking forward to 2017, I have a pragmatic outlook. Our plan calls for modest growth, driven by reinvesting some of our cost savings back into the business. We're confident in the C-Fresh platform, and we're acting with urgency to address our execution to get the beverage and carrot business back on track while continuing to drive sales on salad dressing, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and fresh soup. We expect Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks to continue to live into their portfolio roles. We remain focused on delivering our 3-year cost-savings target, and we are looking for more opportunities to drive effectiveness and efficiency. We'll be reinvesting a portion of our cost savings in focused innovation and improved marketing on our core business, and we're creating an ownership mindset across the organization through our zero-based budgeting efforts. These are reflected in our annual guidance, which Anthony will take you through in a few minutes. 
Clearly, we have some challenges ahead of us, but we know what's working and what's not. And we're taking action to improve our sales performance in every division. I remain confident in the strategic imperatives that we're pursuing and that they provide a compelling path to increase shareholder value. Reflecting confidence in our growth prospects and the strong profit performance this year, our Board of Directors declared a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend. 
Thank you. I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."
258458,290972518,1040696,"Campbell Soup Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 01, 2016",2016-09-01,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I want to provide my perspective on our results and guidance.

Before getting into the details, I want to provide my perspective on our results and guidance. As Denise stated, we are disappointed with the performance of our C-Fresh division in the fourth quarter, which was the key driver of a 1% decline in organic sales for the company, reflecting the recall of Bolthouse Farms protein drink and declines in carrot. At the EBIT line, the negative impact of the C-Fresh performance was offset by lower incentive compensation accrual relative to our expectations. In the fourth quarter, our adjusted tax rate was negatively impacted by a $13 million correction for deferred taxes. The correction had a negative impact on EPS of $0.04 per share. And as a result, our full year tax rate finished above our previous expectations.
Moving on to the full year. While adjusted EPS of $2.94 was within our guidance range, we finished at the lower end due to the tax correction. We are pleased with our gross margin performance, which, on an adjusted basis, increased by 170 basis points, in line with expectations, driven by significantly improved supply chain performance, cost savings and net price realization. We continue to make very good progress against our 3-year cost-savings target of $300 million, delivering about a $130 million of incremental savings in fiscal 2016, bringing the program to-date total to $215 million. 
As part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $0.41 per share in our GAAP results on our Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredient business, reflecting reduced expectations for future cash flows. I'm very pleased with our strong cash flow performance as cash from operations exceeded $1.4 billion and our board has approved a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, although below our long-term target, we plan to improve our sales performance compared to 2016 and make investments in the business to support key brands, launch new products, drive long-term innovation and build capabilities in areas like digital and e-commerce. 
Now I'll review our detail -- sorry, our results in more detail. For the fourth quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis of $1,687,000,000 were comparable to the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation and the favorable impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales declined 1%, driven by declines in Campbell Fresh, partly offset by gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks. The negative impact from the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage was approximately 1 percentage point on total company sales. Adjusted EBIT declined 2% to $253 million as higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses and a lower gross margin percentage were partly offset by lower administrative expenses, reflecting lower incentive compensation accruals. Adjusted EPS decreased 6% or $0.03 to $0.46. This EPS decline includes a $0.03 per share negative impact from the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage, consistent with our expectation, as well as a $0.04 per share negative impact from the tax correction. 
For the full year, as reported and organic net sales both decreased 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT of $1,467,000,000 and adjusted EPS of $2.94 both increased by 11%. Earnings growth is being driven by our improved gross margin performance and the benefits from our cost-savings initiatives. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Net sales was comparable to prior year. Organic sales declined 1% as a 2-point negative impact from higher promotional spending was partly offset by a 1-point gain from volume and mix. Gains in volume were driven by growth in Arnott’s biscuits, Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers and Prego pasta sauces, which benefited from the launch of the new Prego Farmers' Market product line, partly offset by declines in C-Fresh due to the Bolthouse Farms protein drinks recall and volume decline in carrot. Increased promotional spending across our 3 segments includes higher spending in Arnott's, as we're lapping in an unusually low quarter, which was impacted by product availability, higher spending in Bolthouse Farms to remain competitive and support the launch of 1915 and higher spending on Prego and Pace. With the exception of C-Fresh, increased promotional spending drove gains in volume. Completing the bridge, a 1-point negative impact from currency translation was offset by the 1-point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Our gross margin declined 90 basis points in the quarter to 36.1%. Looking at the drivers of the decline, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 270 basis points, driven primarily by cost inflation, which, on a rate basis, increased by about 1.5%, the recall and related production outages of Bolthouse Farms protein drinks and higher carrot costs from unfavorable crop yields. Reflecting the increased promotional spending on the businesses I mentioned in the sales discussion, the higher promotional rate had a negative impact of 110 basis points on gross margin. This was partly offset by list pricing gains of 20 basis points from previous pricing actions in Global Biscuits and Snacks. Mix was slightly favorable, also adding 20 basis points. Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our 3-year cost-savings program, contributed 250 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. 
Looking at this another way, not on the chart, the weak performance of the Campbell Fresh segment accounted for 70 basis points of the total decline of 90 basis points, including the protein drink recall, which accounted for 50 basis points. 
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 14% in the quarter, primarily due to higher advertising expenses in Pepperidge Farm to support Goldfish crackers and the fresh bakery business and increased support of Prego pasta sauces. Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 19%, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs, which account for about 2/3 of the decline, as well as the benefits from our cost-savings initiatives. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below the line items. Adjusted EPS decreased $0.03 from $0.49 in the prior year to $0.46 per share in the current quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, declines in adjusted EBIT had a negative impact on EPS of $0.01. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter increased by 2.3 points to 36.4%. The increase in the tax rate reduced the EPS by $0.02, as the impact of the deferred tax correction was partly offset by the benefit of geographic mix. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly, but due to rounding, shows no benefit on EPS in the quarter. Interest was fairly comparable to prior year, up $1 million, with no impact on EPS as the impact of higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio was mostly offset by lower debt level. Currency translation also had no impact, completing the bridge to $0.46 per share. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales were comparable to prior year at $842 million, driven by double-digit gains in Prego pasta sauces, including the benefit of the launch of Prego Farmers' Market and also by double-digit gains in Plum products, offset by declines in V8 beverages and ready-to-serve soup. Operating earnings increased 4%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage driven by productivity improvements, partly offset by increased marketing expenses, as we've increased support behind Prego and V8 beverages. 
Within U.S. soup, which declined 2% in aggregate, condensed declined 1% and RTS declined 6%. These declines were partly offset by a 7% gain in Swanson broth. Estimated changes in retailer inventory levels did not meaningfully impact soup sales in the quarter. As we previously stated, while we will discuss the key drivers of soup performance as we do with our other businesses, this is the last quarter we will provide detailed subcategory sales performance. 
Here is a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending July 31, 2016, the category as a whole declined by 2.7%. Our sales in measured channels declined 3.8%, primarily driven by weakness in ready-to-serve, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share for the 52-week period, declining 70 basis points. Private label grew share by 10 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 29% up 60 basis points, reflecting share gains by smaller brands. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2% with double-digit gains in Pepperidge Farm's Goldfish crackers, supported by increased advertising and growth in Arnott’s biscuits in Australia and New Zealand, driven by increased promotional activity. Operating earnings increased 5% to $81 million, as lower administrative costs were partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage. Within gross margin, the impact of cost inflation and increased promotional spending was partly offset by productivity improvements. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales decreased 12%, reflecting declines in Bolthouse Farms premium refrigerated beverages due to the recall of protein drinks. Sales in the CPG beverages and salad dressings businesses declined 10% in the quarter. Sales of carrots also declined as we experienced quality issues in the fourth quarter which led to customer dissatisfaction and the loss of business. These declines were partly offset by gains in fresh soup. Operating earnings declined by $13 million or 62% to $8 million, primarily driven by the adverse impact of the voluntary recall on Bolthouse Farms protein drinks and related production outages as well as higher carrot costs and lower sales of carrots and carrot ingredient, partly offset by lower administrative expenses. Just a reminder that Garden Fresh Gourmet was acquired on June 29, 2015, and we have now wrapped the acquisition date. As a result, there is 1 month of operating results from Garden Fresh Gourmet now included in organic sales. 
We had very strong cash flow performance in fiscal 2016. Cash from operations increased by $281 million to a record $1,463,000,000, driven by significantly higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements, reflecting reductions in inventory level. Capital expenditures declined $39 million to $341 million. We paid dividends totaling $390 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. And as announced this morning, we will be increasing our quarterly dividend by 12% to $0.35 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased $143 million of shares in fiscal 2016, $100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt declined by $592 million, as cash from operations was well in excess of capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. 
Now I'll review our 2017 outlook. The company expects sales to grow by 0% to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 1% to 4% and adjusted EPS to grow by 2% to 5% or $3.00 to $3.09 per share. This guidance assumes, based on current exchange rates, that the impact from currency translation will be nominal. While not to the level of our long-term sales growth target of 1% to 3%, sales performance is expected to improve relative to 2016, as we address those businesses which have underperformed. While we expect to achieve further EBIT margin expansion in 2017, growth in adjusted EBIT is slightly below our long-term target, as we will be making investments in our business to support key brands, in new product launches, in long-term innovation and to build capabilities in areas like digital and e-commerce. These investments are designed to improve our growth profile over the long term. Our range for growth in adjusted EPS is ahead of EBIT, as we plan to increase share repurchases and benefit from a slightly lower tax rate, partly offset by slightly higher interest expense, given our expectation of rising short-term interest rates. While we don't give quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect the majority of our top and bottom line growth to come in the second half, as we work through the issues we're currently experiencing in C-Fresh and as we wrap lower levels of marketing support in the first half of fiscal 2016. 
Turning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance, while inflation on core ingredients and packaging has moderated, we expect inflation in cost of products sold of approximately 2%, including higher wage and ongoing benefit costs and the lagging negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input costs of our international businesses, given the timing of our foreign currency hedges. As we've successfully delivered in the past, we expect ongoing supply chain productivity gains, excluding our ZBB initiative, of approximately 3% of cost of products sold. We expect our gross margin percentage to improve slightly with productivity gains exceeding inflation. The effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 32%, slightly below the 2016 adjusted rate of 32.6%. While we are not prepared to provide a specific amount, we currently plan to significantly increase share repurchases, unless needed for other uses including M&A. Our EPS guidance reflects the favorable impact of these anticipated repurchases over the course of the year on our average shares outstanding. We are forecasting capital expenditures of approximately $350 million comparable to fiscal 2016 levels and in line with our historical spending level. And under our cost-savings program, we expect to deliver incremental savings of $50 million in fiscal 2017 and are on track to achieve our $300 million goal by 2018. 
That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who participate in listen-only mode. 
Today, we will make forward-looking statements which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. 
Now I'd like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this morning's news release, the current quarter results reflect a noncash impairment charge, pension and post-retirement mark-to-market losses and charges related to cost-savings initiatives. The prior year quarter included pension and post-retirement mark-to-market losses and charges related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost-savings initiatives. The adjusted results exclude the impact of these items impacting comparability, and our comparisons of the full year 2016 with 2015 will exclude these and previously announced items. 
Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. 
Lastly, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2017's earnings dates. We plan to release earnings on November 22, 2016; February 17, 2017; May 19, 2017; and August 31, 2017.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, I'll offer my perspective on our performance with a focus on how each of our divisions are performing against their portfolio roles. 
We finished the year in line with our guidance and with strong profit performance. However, our results this quarter certainly did not meet my expectations. I am particularly unhappy with the short-term executional issues that have led to the poor performance in Campbell Fresh, both for the quarter and for the year. I'll spend the majority of my time this morning addressing this topic. 
While sales for the year, including Garden Fresh Gourmet, were up 5%, organic sales declined 4% in C-Fresh. In the fourth quarter, organic sales were down 12%, driven by declines in both CPG and Farms. This performance is unacceptable. I expect far more from the Campbell Fresh business. It's clear that we have several immediate challenges in Campbell Fresh, and we are addressing them. I'll get to that in a moment. But first, I want to step back and look at the big picture. 
As a reminder, fiscal 2016 is the first year of operation of Campbell Fresh. This division, which accounts for approximately $1 billion in revenue or about 13% of our total sales, combines Bolthouse Farms, the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition and our refrigerated soup business. Strategically, C-Fresh positions Campbell to benefit from the growing health and well-being trend as well as the growing demand for better-for-you foods in the Packaged Fresh category. Its portfolio role is to deliver full-force growth, driven by the CPG business and to contribute to the acceleration of Campbell's overall sales trajectory. While disappointed in our execution, I remain confident in our C-Fresh strategy. We have strong popular brands that are on trend with the changing nature of consumers' eating habits. We're well positioned in the produce and deli section of stores with an eye on expansion into other categories such as dairy. We have a robust innovation pipeline, and we're enhancing our approach to long-term innovation. Strategy was not the issue. Our problem was execution. I'm going to spend some time on what didn't work, and importantly, the actions we're taking to ensure the business performs to its potential. 
So what went wrong? There were 2 issues that were the primary drivers of the C-Fresh results in the quarter: the Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS recall; and the poor performance of our carrot business. Let's start with our CPG business and the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage. As previously announced on June 22, we voluntarily recalled 3.8 million bottles of Bolthouse Farms' Protein PLUS beverages due to possible spoilage. The Protein PLUS lineup accounts for approximately 15% of the Bolthouse Farms' beverage business. In addition, the same manufacturing lines are used to produce our café drinks, which account for another 10% of the beverage business. Our examination into the recall identified our manufacturing equipment and process as the primary cause of the spoilage. We have corrected these problems, rigorously tested the product and started shipping it again. However, production has not returned to the pre-recall levels due to new operating procedures that we've put in place, including an enhanced test and release protocol to ensure the product meets our high quality standards. Prior to the recall, a typical production run for these products would have been 72 hours. Today, a production run is 24 hours. Unfortunately, the shorter run significantly reduced our capacity. We are examining various ways to increase capacity, including commissioning other production lines, but we currently anticipate these will take time to implement and expect that supply will be impacted through the end of the calendar year 2016. 
Now turning to Farms. Let's take a look at our second issue, our carrot business. In July, at our Investor Day, we discussed some weather-related problems and a customer issue in our carrot business. As we review these issues further, we learned the problems were rooted in several decisions that had compounded one on another, and therefore were broader than we understood at the time. Specifically, there were some planting, harvesting and commercial decisions made earlier in the calendar year that exacerbated the weather problems. This led our farm's operation to harvest carrots prematurely in an attempt to meet customer demand. Ultimately, this resulted in a spring crop that yielded smaller carrots, which led to customer dissatisfaction and an additional loss of business. The size of the carrots we're harvesting now is vastly improved, and we're actively addressing service issues with customers. However, it will take us time to regain the lost business. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2017 carrot sales to be comparable to fiscal 2016, rather than benefiting from a recovery from last year's issues. 
A final point of context. Carrots are a relatively low-margin business. However, it serves as the chassis for our higher-margin value-added CPG business. Carrots provide the scale for the refrigerated logistics system that we leverage for distribution and merchandising. 
So what actions have we taken so far to correct these issues? Over the last several weeks, we made major organization changes under Jeff Dunn, the President of Campbell Fresh. Several senior managers are no longer with the company, including the President of Bolthouse Farms. Additionally, we created a new structure to foster more agility and collaboration across the division. Previously, we had 2 operating units: Bolthouse Farms functioned as a distinct unit; and Garden Fresh Gourmet was combined with Fresh Soup. Now we have 3 operating units reporting directly to Jeff. CPG, which integrates Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings with Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and chips, along with fresh soups. Farms, which consist of carrots and carrot ingredients, and the long-term innovation unit we discussed at Investor Day in July. In addition to the 3 operating units, we have created a more integrated structure both at the divisional level and with Campbell. In particular, we have strengthened the integration and oversight of the Campbell Fresh supply chain. 
We have also bolstered the Campbell Fresh leadership team by adding more senior finance, human resources and sales executives. This new team is a combination of seasoned and accomplished Campbell and Bolthouse Farms leaders and experienced executives recruited from food start-ups and major industry players. I believe that this newly structured team will lead this business back to the growth profile mandated by its portfolio role. In the first half of fiscal 2017, the new management team will take steps to stabilize the business. First, we expect to improve our execution. Second, we plan to continue to increase capacity as we rebound from the Protein PLUS recall and related production outage. And third, we'll stabilize the carrot business through improved quality and customer service. 
Our plans call for C-Fresh sales to be down slightly in the first half and return to growth consistent with its portfolio role in the second half. Putting it all together, we expect sales growth to be in the low-single digits for fiscal '17, and we will keep you updated on developments as we go. 
While disappointed in the near-term performance of C-Fresh, I remain confident in the strategy we are pursuing, the Packaged Fresh platform we're building and the growth potential of this business. 
Now let me shift gears to the progress we've made in other areas during fiscal 2016. As I said earlier, when I look at the year as a whole for the company, our profit performance was strong. This was driven by our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks divisions. We delivered double-digit adjusted earnings growth with solid operating performance, including expanded gross margin, significantly improved supply chain performance and better-than-expected cost savings. We also advanced our real food and transparency agenda, establishing Campbell as a leader in this area. However, we continued to face challenges on the top line. We recognize that we need to grow sales, and it remains a top priority. Our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks divisions have performed largely in line with their portfolio roles. 
First, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. Things are moving in the right direction here, and I feel good about what we've achieved this year. We made important strides in fiscal 2016. The team drove significant gross margin expansion through a combination of net price realization and major improvements in our supply chain. This resulted in a 13% increase in operating profit. Our Simple Meals brands delivered sales growth behind Prego and Pace, and Plum delivered double-digit sales gains through increased distribution and innovation. And we advanced our Real Food agenda, changing many of our recipes, including clean labeled products, and embracing transparency. 
While we've accomplished much in the Americas divisions, sales remained inconsistent. Organic sales declined 1% for the year. Many of our brands are performing in line with the categories in which we compete. However, portions of the portfolio are underperforming their categories, in particular beverages and ready-to-serve soup. We're taking steps to address this and expect improved performance in these areas and modest growth in the division in fiscal '17. Looking ahead, the Americas division will continue to concentrate on getting more from our core brands with a focus on driving sales through investments in fewer, bigger innovations and improved marketing, while increasing margins. We have plans in place to drive continued margin expansion through supply chain efficiencies. 
In fiscal 2017, we expect our soup business to grow behind continued growth of broth and better performance from our ready-to-serve soup portfolio. As we outlined at Investor Day, our plans call for improved execution around the Chunky brand and the midyear launch of the new Well Yes clean-labeled soup line. We also anticipate better performance from V8 beverages, driven by the continued success of Veggie Blends and V8 +Energy as well as a renewed focus on tried-and-tested marketing that reengages our loyal V8 Red consumers. 
To connect with our consumers, build brand relevance and drive demand, we're investing in 4 integrated marketing campaigns in the Americas, including a new NFL-themed Chunky campaign featuring 6 popular players. 
For the year, our Global Biscuits and Snacks division made progress in performing against its portfolio role. Organic sales increased 1%, and operating earnings were up 10%. Pepperidge Farm delivered strong performance, and our Asia Pacific team drove solid sales results in a highly competitive and concentrated trading environment. The emphasis on growing our icon brands: Goldfish, Tim Tam and Milano, as well as revenue management initiatives and improved supply chain performance, drove our results. Looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering the division's role of expanding in both developed and developing markets while improving margins. In the United States, we have higher levels of investment to drive sustained Goldfish growth, continued momentum for Milano, expanded Tim Tam distribution and increased innovation in our fresh bakery business. In Australia, we're focused on strengthening our Arnott's brand through integrated marketing and relevant consumer-driven innovation. In developing markets, we expect continued growth in Malaysia and improved performance in China and Indonesia. 
Looking forward to 2017, I have a pragmatic outlook. Our plan calls for modest growth, driven by reinvesting some of our cost savings back into the business. We're confident in the C-Fresh platform, and we're acting with urgency to address our execution to get the beverage and carrot business back on track while continuing to drive sales on salad dressing, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and fresh soup. We expect Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks to continue to live into their portfolio roles. We remain focused on delivering our 3-year cost-savings target, and we are looking for more opportunities to drive effectiveness and efficiency. We'll be reinvesting a portion of our cost savings in focused innovation and improved marketing on our core business, and we're creating an ownership mindset across the organization through our zero-based budgeting efforts. These are reflected in our annual guidance, which Anthony will take you through in a few minutes. 
Clearly, we have some challenges ahead of us, but we know what's working and what's not. And we're taking action to improve our sales performance in every division. I remain confident in the strategic imperatives that we're pursuing and that they provide a compelling path to increase shareholder value. Reflecting confidence in our growth prospects and the strong profit performance this year, our Board of Directors declared a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend. 
Thank you. I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."

Before getting into the details, I want to provide my perspective on our results and guidance. As Denise stated, we are disappointed with the performance of our C-Fresh division in the fourth quarter, which was the key driver of a 1% decline in organic sales for the company, reflecting the recall of Bolthouse Farms protein drink and declines in carrot. At the EBIT line, the negative impact of the C-Fresh performance was offset by lower incentive compensation accrual relative to our expectations. In the fourth quarter, our adjusted tax rate was negatively impacted by a $13 million correction for deferred taxes. The correction had a negative impact on EPS of $0.04 per share. And as a result, our full year tax rate finished above our previous expectations.
Moving on to the full year. While adjusted EPS of $2.94 was within our guidance range, we finished at the lower end due to the tax correction. We are pleased with our gross margin performance, which, on an adjusted basis, increased by 170 basis points, in line with expectations, driven by significantly improved supply chain performance, cost savings and net price realization. We continue to make very good progress against our 3-year cost-savings target of $300 million, delivering about a $130 million of incremental savings in fiscal 2016, bringing the program to-date total to $215 million. 
As part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $0.41 per share in our GAAP results on our Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredient business, reflecting reduced expectations for future cash flows. I'm very pleased with our strong cash flow performance as cash from operations exceeded $1.4 billion and our board has approved a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, although below our long-term target, we plan to improve our sales performance compared to 2016 and make investments in the business to support key brands, launch new products, drive long-term innovation and build capabilities in areas like digital and e-commerce. 
Now I'll review our detail -- sorry, our results in more detail. For the fourth quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis of $1,687,000,000 were comparable to the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation and the favorable impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales declined 1%, driven by declines in Campbell Fresh, partly offset by gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks. The negative impact from the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage was approximately 1 percentage point on total company sales. Adjusted EBIT declined 2% to $253 million as higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses and a lower gross margin percentage were partly offset by lower administrative expenses, reflecting lower incentive compensation accruals. Adjusted EPS decreased 6% or $0.03 to $0.46. This EPS decline includes a $0.03 per share negative impact from the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage, consistent with our expectation, as well as a $0.04 per share negative impact from the tax correction. 
For the full year, as reported and organic net sales both decreased 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT of $1,467,000,000 and adjusted EPS of $2.94 both increased by 11%. Earnings growth is being driven by our improved gross margin performance and the benefits from our cost-savings initiatives. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Net sales was comparable to prior year. Organic sales declined 1% as a 2-point negative impact from higher promotional spending was partly offset by a 1-point gain from volume and mix. Gains in volume were driven by growth in Arnott’s biscuits, Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers and Prego pasta sauces, which benefited from the launch of the new Prego Farmers' Market product line, partly offset by declines in C-Fresh due to the Bolthouse Farms protein drinks recall and volume decline in carrot. Increased promotional spending across our 3 segments includes higher spending in Arnott's, as we're lapping in an unusually low quarter, which was impacted by product availability, higher spending in Bolthouse Farms to remain competitive and support the launch of 1915 and higher spending on Prego and Pace. With the exception of C-Fresh, increased promotional spending drove gains in volume. Completing the bridge, a 1-point negative impact from currency translation was offset by the 1-point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Our gross margin declined 90 basis points in the quarter to 36.1%. Looking at the drivers of the decline, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 270 basis points, driven primarily by cost inflation, which, on a rate basis, increased by about 1.5%, the recall and related production outages of Bolthouse Farms protein drinks and higher carrot costs from unfavorable crop yields. Reflecting the increased promotional spending on the businesses I mentioned in the sales discussion, the higher promotional rate had a negative impact of 110 basis points on gross margin. This was partly offset by list pricing gains of 20 basis points from previous pricing actions in Global Biscuits and Snacks. Mix was slightly favorable, also adding 20 basis points. Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our 3-year cost-savings program, contributed 250 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. 
Looking at this another way, not on the chart, the weak performance of the Campbell Fresh segment accounted for 70 basis points of the total decline of 90 basis points, including the protein drink recall, which accounted for 50 basis points. 
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 14% in the quarter, primarily due to higher advertising expenses in Pepperidge Farm to support Goldfish crackers and the fresh bakery business and increased support of Prego pasta sauces. Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 19%, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs, which account for about 2/3 of the decline, as well as the benefits from our cost-savings initiatives. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below the line items. Adjusted EPS decreased $0.03 from $0.49 in the prior year to $0.46 per share in the current quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, declines in adjusted EBIT had a negative impact on EPS of $0.01. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter increased by 2.3 points to 36.4%. The increase in the tax rate reduced the EPS by $0.02, as the impact of the deferred tax correction was partly offset by the benefit of geographic mix. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly, but due to rounding, shows no benefit on EPS in the quarter. Interest was fairly comparable to prior year, up $1 million, with no impact on EPS as the impact of higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio was mostly offset by lower debt level. Currency translation also had no impact, completing the bridge to $0.46 per share. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales were comparable to prior year at $842 million, driven by double-digit gains in Prego pasta sauces, including the benefit of the launch of Prego Farmers' Market and also by double-digit gains in Plum products, offset by declines in V8 beverages and ready-to-serve soup. Operating earnings increased 4%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage driven by productivity improvements, partly offset by increased marketing expenses, as we've increased support behind Prego and V8 beverages. 
Within U.S. soup, which declined 2% in aggregate, condensed declined 1% and RTS declined 6%. These declines were partly offset by a 7% gain in Swanson broth. Estimated changes in retailer inventory levels did not meaningfully impact soup sales in the quarter. As we previously stated, while we will discuss the key drivers of soup performance as we do with our other businesses, this is the last quarter we will provide detailed subcategory sales performance. 
Here is a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending July 31, 2016, the category as a whole declined by 2.7%. Our sales in measured channels declined 3.8%, primarily driven by weakness in ready-to-serve, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share for the 52-week period, declining 70 basis points. Private label grew share by 10 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 29% up 60 basis points, reflecting share gains by smaller brands. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2% with double-digit gains in Pepperidge Farm's Goldfish crackers, supported by increased advertising and growth in Arnott’s biscuits in Australia and New Zealand, driven by increased promotional activity. Operating earnings increased 5% to $81 million, as lower administrative costs were partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage. Within gross margin, the impact of cost inflation and increased promotional spending was partly offset by productivity improvements. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales decreased 12%, reflecting declines in Bolthouse Farms premium refrigerated beverages due to the recall of protein drinks. Sales in the CPG beverages and salad dressings businesses declined 10% in the quarter. Sales of carrots also declined as we experienced quality issues in the fourth quarter which led to customer dissatisfaction and the loss of business. These declines were partly offset by gains in fresh soup. Operating earnings declined by $13 million or 62% to $8 million, primarily driven by the adverse impact of the voluntary recall on Bolthouse Farms protein drinks and related production outages as well as higher carrot costs and lower sales of carrots and carrot ingredient, partly offset by lower administrative expenses. Just a reminder that Garden Fresh Gourmet was acquired on June 29, 2015, and we have now wrapped the acquisition date. As a result, there is 1 month of operating results from Garden Fresh Gourmet now included in organic sales. 
We had very strong cash flow performance in fiscal 2016. Cash from operations increased by $281 million to a record $1,463,000,000, driven by significantly higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements, reflecting reductions in inventory level. Capital expenditures declined $39 million to $341 million. We paid dividends totaling $390 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. And as announced this morning, we will be increasing our quarterly dividend by 12% to $0.35 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased $143 million of shares in fiscal 2016, $100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt declined by $592 million, as cash from operations was well in excess of capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. 
Now I'll review our 2017 outlook. The company expects sales to grow by 0% to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 1% to 4% and adjusted EPS to grow by 2% to 5% or $3.00 to $3.09 per share. This guidance assumes, based on current exchange rates, that the impact from currency translation will be nominal. While not to the level of our long-term sales growth target of 1% to 3%, sales performance is expected to improve relative to 2016, as we address those businesses which have underperformed. While we expect to achieve further EBIT margin expansion in 2017, growth in adjusted EBIT is slightly below our long-term target, as we will be making investments in our business to support key brands, in new product launches, in long-term innovation and to build capabilities in areas like digital and e-commerce. These investments are designed to improve our growth profile over the long term. Our range for growth in adjusted EPS is ahead of EBIT, as we plan to increase share repurchases and benefit from a slightly lower tax rate, partly offset by slightly higher interest expense, given our expectation of rising short-term interest rates. While we don't give quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect the majority of our top and bottom line growth to come in the second half, as we work through the issues we're currently experiencing in C-Fresh and as we wrap lower levels of marketing support in the first half of fiscal 2016. 
Turning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance, while inflation on core ingredients and packaging has moderated, we expect inflation in cost of products sold of approximately 2%, including higher wage and ongoing benefit costs and the lagging negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input costs of our international businesses, given the timing of our foreign currency hedges. As we've successfully delivered in the past, we expect ongoing supply chain productivity gains, excluding our ZBB initiative, of approximately 3% of cost of products sold. We expect our gross margin percentage to improve slightly with productivity gains exceeding inflation. The effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 32%, slightly below the 2016 adjusted rate of 32.6%. While we are not prepared to provide a specific amount, we currently plan to significantly increase share repurchases, unless needed for other uses including M&A. Our EPS guidance reflects the favorable impact of these anticipated repurchases over the course of the year on our average shares outstanding. We are forecasting capital expenditures of approximately $350 million comparable to fiscal 2016 levels and in line with our historical spending level. And under our cost-savings program, we expect to deliver incremental savings of $50 million in fiscal 2017 and are on track to achieve our $300 million goal by 2018. 
That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

I just want to make sure that that's one of the things that will hold it back this year, maybe relative to what we should expect in '18 and '19, is just simply there is a little bit of rebuilding that has to go on.

We're going to support new product launches, things like Prego's Farmers' market, Well Yes soup, Plum infant formula, the Bolthouse spring innovations, Tim Tam's expansion in the U.S., Goldfish made with organic wheat. So we have a number of product launches going on. We're also going to invest in new capabilities around things like digital and e-commerce. We're going to make investments in our Real Food initiative, so these are things like improving our can liners, continuing the removal of BPA, improving the product and more clean label, those types of ingredients which tend to be more expensive.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal '17 earnings call. I look forward to reviewing and discussing our results with you this morning. I'll start with a high-level overview and then provide my perspective on each",2197,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal '17 earnings call. I look forward to reviewing and discussing our results with you this morning. I'll start with a high-level overview and then provide my perspective on each division's performance. Anthony will follow with a detailed financial review. 
But first, let me start with some context about the external environment. In the United States, the length and tenor of the presidential campaign was unprecedented. There are many important issues the new administration will address that will impact the food industry, including tax policy, regulation, trade agreements, new leadership of the USDA and FDA as well as the upcoming Farm Bill. Meanwhile, the seismic shifts that I've outlined in our previous discussions continue to impact our industry, including a shrinking middle class, major demographic shifts, changing consumer preferences for food with an emphasis on health and wellbeing and the continued evolution of digital media and e-commerce channels. 
Across the industry, top line growth remains sluggish, particularly in center-store categories. Simultaneously, food deflation is pressuring both top and bottom lines and limiting pricing opportunities. This is driving a hypercompetitive environment for market share, along with the continued focus on cost savings measures to deliver earnings. As we've seen, many food companies have reported flat to declining organic sales in their most recent quarters, and that pressure is not limited to manufacturers. Retailers, too, are taking actions to reposition themselves for growth through consolidation, management changes and increased investments in e-commerce. 
With that as context, let me turn to our first quarter results. Relative to our expectations, I'm encouraged by our overall performance. We're executing against the plans we described in September. We expanded gross margin and delivered adjusted EBIT and EPS growth, cycling a strong year-ago quarter. Organic sales decreased 1% in the quarter, driven by declines in our Campbell Fresh business, which we expected and which we communicated in early September. Additionally, we remain on track to achieve our $300 million cost savings goal by the end of fiscal 2018. Importantly, we're reinvesting across the business to drive top line growth, including increased advertising support of Chunky Soup and Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers, expanding our digital and e-commerce capabilities and funding long-term innovation initiatives. 
Given our start and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we reaffirmed our full year guidance this morning. Let me now offer my perspective on the performance of each of our 3 divisions. 
Let's start with Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, our largest division. As a reminder, this division's portfolio role is to deliver moderate growth, consistent with the categories in which we operate, and to expand margins. Our sales were mixed this quarter. However, the division delivered strong operating earnings, and I continue to be pleased with the gross margin expansion driven by the improved performance of our supply chain. I'm optimistic about the start to the soup season. U.S. soup sales were comparable to a year ago, which reflects an improvement in trend. Sales of RTS soup and broth increased, while condensed sales declined slightly. Campbell's consumption outpaced the category, largely driven by the performance of the RTS portfolio. Chunky led the way as we dramatically improved our execution. We have corrected the labeling misstep from last year, began airing a new integrated NFL-themed campaign and introduced new stackable cans that are driving increased merchandising opportunities at major customers. It's also important to note that we're cycling net price realization gains that has held in the marketplace. All of this is resulting in improved performance. 
Looking ahead on soup, we continue to expect to deliver modest growth for the full year behind improved performance in Chunky, strong holiday plans for both condensed soups and broth and the upcoming launch of our Well Yes! RTS soup line. This new clean label soup is made with nutritious, recognizable and desirable ingredients and will begin shipping in December. The response from retailers has been overwhelmingly positive, and we have a robust integrated marketing plan to fuel the launch. 
In other parts of the portfolio, we drove double-digit sales gains in Plum with growth in the core pouch portfolio as well as the introduction of Plum organic infant formula. However, our shelf-stable beverage portfolio remains challenged, specifically V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash. On the positive side, V8 +Energy continues to perform well, and we're seeing improving trends in V8 Red, following our decision to increase advertising support. As we previously stated, we do not expect V8 to grow in fiscal 2017. 
While we have more work ahead, I'm encouraged by the start to the year, especially in U.S. soup, and I'm confident in our plans. In short, the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division continues to deliver against its portfolio role. 
Now let's turn to Global Biscuits and Snacks. As a reminder, this division includes our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kjeldsens businesses, and its portfolio role is to expand and develop -- in developing markets while improving market -- margins. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm on strong performance of Goldfish crackers and Milano cookies. Operating earnings decreased 2% as we invested in increased advertising. In the U.S., the team delivered sales and share gains in both Goldfish crackers and Milano cookies. Goldfish benefited from increased advertising investment, channel gains leveraging multiple pack sizes and innovative new products. Our efforts to expand our health and wellbeing offerings are performing well. Both multigrain Goldfish and Goldfish made with organic wheat contributed to the sales gains. 
At Investor Day, we shared our plans to focus on building brand equity and increasing our marketing investments in our cookie portfolio, and we're beginning to see results. Effective new advertising and flavor innovation drove sales and consumption gains for Milano cookies. 
Sales in fresh bakery declined in the quarter in the face of intensified competitive activity, and we have taken steps to address this with improved innovation and quality on our Pepperidge Farm Swirl Bread. 
Looking ahead, in the U.S., we're focused on driving growth in Goldfish, increase innovation in cookies, including the relaunch of our Pepperidge Farm American classic cookie line and the new fresh bakery quality improvements to take hold in the market. Additionally, expanding both Tim Tam distribution and our West Coast bakery operations remain top priorities. 
Turning to other parts of the world. In Southeast Asia, we maintained our momentum in Malaysia behind strong sales of sauces. But sales in Indonesia were negatively impacted by aggressive competitive activities in the general trade. In Australia, we delivered sales growth in biscuits, driven by strong performance in our chocolate biscuit portfolio despite declines in Shapes crackers. We've taken action to address Shapes' performance, and we're beginning to see signs of improvement. 
Looking ahead, we're focused on delivering consumer-driven product innovation in Tim Tam chocolate biscuits with a new range of seasonal varieties. We also expect our shapes performance to accelerate behind our new marketing campaign, highlighting both new and original recipes. 
Finally, I'll discuss our Campbell Fresh division. The CPG portion of C-Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and chips, and our refrigerated soups. The farms' portion of the portfolio includes carrot and natural ingredients. As a reminder, C-Fresh is a strategically important business to Campbell. It addresses a key consumer trend towards fresh foods and health and wellbeing, and its brands resonate with millennial consumers. The business performed as expected to the start of the year as we're continuing to execute the recovery plans related to the voluntary product recall of Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks and the carrot quality and execution issues we experienced in fiscal 2016. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we installed a new leadership team and that increased the integration and oversight of the Campbell Fresh supply chain. There have been other changes since then. As previously announced, Jeff Dunn left the company in October, and we named Ed Carolan, President of Campbell Fresh. Ed has been with Campbell since 2001 in a variety of leadership roles, including the President of U.S. Retail Soup, Sauce and Beverages. Most recently, he was President of Integrated Global Services, where he created and implemented a business model to build new capabilities and deliver faster, more efficient services. Ed and the Campbell Fresh leadership team are focused on returning the business to growth starting in the second half of the year. 
Now let's take a closer look at what drove the declines in the first quarter and our continued recovery from the Protein PLUS beverage recall and the carrot quality and execution issues. 
First, beverages. As we discussed in the fourth quarter, we identified and corrected the primary cause of last year's Protein PLUS recall and implemented enhanced processes to improve quality standards. While we're making progress, we still continue to expect the Protein PLUS supply will be negatively impacted through the end of the calendar year 2016. Our objective is to meet demand through a combination of improved run rates, increased in-house capacity and adding co-packers. Following the recall, we have been steadily increasing production capacity while also working hard to improve our customer service levels. We've made solid progress in the first quarter in improving our run times. To increase capacity, we're in the process of installing a new beverage line in our Bakersfield plant, which we expect will be commissioned by the end of the calendar year. 
Performance was mixed in other parts of the Campbell Fresh CPG portfolio. In the ultra-premium category, sales growth of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms cold-pressed juice was driven by increased distribution and share gains. Sales of Bolthouse Farms salad dressing also continued to grow. 
Turning to Garden Fresh Gourmet. Sales of hummus and salsa declined in the quarter. The team is focused on further product differentiation through regional flavors as we continue to execute our plans to expand Garden Fresh Gourmet beyond the Midwest. 
Another bright spot was the performance of retail fresh soup. Sales increased in the quarter with the introduction of new branded Garden Fresh Gourmet soup, which has been well received by customers. 
Now turning to the farms business. We are stabilizing our carrot operations and improved quality. The team remains focused on service levels and working to regain lost customers over time. We expect the recovery to continue throughout the year as we demonstrate to customers our ability to deliver sustained quality. While we're making progress, we clearly have more work ahead to get this division back to performing in line with its portfolio role of full-force growth. For the full year, we continue to expect Campbell Fresh sales to grow in the low single digits. 
Before closing, I want to touch upon our efforts to create new models of innovation to define the future real food and drive growth in new ways for Campbell. As I discussed with you in the past, new models continue to emerge and new startup companies are being fueled by an influx of venture capital. Campbell is now more fully participating in venture opportunities through Acre Venture Partners and independently managed $125 million venture fund where Campbell is the sole limited partner. Acre is investing in a number of promising and innovative food and food-related companies. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we funded $41 million out of our $125 million commitment. 
Another example of how we're investing our cost savings into long-term innovation is a new startup company called Habit, a business backed by Campbell and led by Neil Grimmer, the Co-Founder of Plum. Positioned at the intersection of health and wellbeing, technology and food, Habit will leverage individualized data to create personalized nutrition and meal plans for people who want to harness the transformative power of food to improve their lives. Stay tuned. We will be sharing additional details about Habit at CAGNY in February. 
Finally, we continue to build a robust pipeline of internal innovation focused on the large and growing consumer platforms of health and wellbeing and snacking. And we're also continuing to pursue smart external development to diversify our portfolio in faster-growing spaces. 
Given our expectations and plans for the year, we're satisfied with our performance to start the year and confident in our plans for fiscal '17. We continue to take action to strengthen our core business while also driving growth for the long term through our purpose, growth agenda and strategic imperatives: one, real food transparency and sustainability; two, digital and e-commerce; three, health and wellbeing; and four, snacking, all while continuing to build a high-performance organization focused on talent and culture and transforming the way we work. 
In summary, these unpredictable and uncertain times in which we live are marked by sweeping changes across the food industry landscape. At Campbell, we're guided by our purpose: real food that matters for life's moments and focused on meeting the needs of our consumers, helping our customers grow their business and increasing shareholder value for our investors. 
Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro, for an overview of our financial results."
258458,408983715,1090373,"Campbell Soup Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year. As Denise stated, organic sales, while down, were in line with our expectations. We anticipated our",1508,"Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year. As Denise stated, organic sales, while down, were in line with our expectations. We anticipated our first quarter sales to be under some pressure as we begin to recover from a capacity constraint on Bolthouse Farms beverages and stabilize the carrot business. Overall, U.S. soup sales were flat, and we were pleased with the performance of Chunky, which is responding well to our marketing program. 
Our adjusted gross margin expanded 120 basis points as our supply chain performed well and delivered significant productivity improvements while cost inflation remained moderate. We continue to make strong progress against our cost savings target of $300 million by the end of fiscal 2018, delivering about $35 million of incremental savings in the first quarter, bringing the program to-date total to $250 million. 
We adopted a new accounting standard that impacts the recognition of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. The tax rate for the quarter reflected a $6 million tax benefit related to the change. 
We are pleased with our first quarter start and are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 guidance that we announced in September. 
Now I'll review our results in more detail. On an as-reported basis, net sales of $2,202,000,000 were comparable to the prior year. Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation, organic net sales declined 1%, driven by declines in Campbell Fresh, partly offset by gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks. Adjusted EBIT increased 1% to $486 million as the benefits of a higher adjusted gross margin percentage and lower administrative expenses were partly offset by increased marketing and selling expenses. Adjusted EPS increased 5% or $0.05 to $1 per share. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Organic sales declined 1%, driven by a 1 point decline from volume and mix. Net price realization, both pricing and promotion, was stable for the quarter compared to last year. Offsetting the organic sales decline was a 1 point favorable impact from currency translation, principally the Australian dollar, resulting in net sales being comparable to the prior year. 
Our adjusted gross margin increased 120 basis points in the quarter. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 70 basis points. Cost inflation on a rate basis increased by about 1.5%. In addition, cost of products sold reflects higher cost in our C-Fresh division. These negative drivers were partly offset by the benefits from our cost savings initiatives. 
Reflecting the increased promotional spending in Pepperidge Farm to support Goldfish and fresh bakery, and in Indonesia to remain competitive, promotional spending had a 20 basis points negative impact, which was offset by list pricing gains of 20 basis points, primarily from our retail business in Canada. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 20 basis points, reflecting the sales decline in our lower-margin C-Fresh segment. 
Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our $300 million cost savings program, contributed 170 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. All in, our gross margin percentage increased 120 basis points to 39.1%. 
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 11% in the quarter, primarily due to higher advertising expenses as we reinvest in our key brands as well as higher selling expenses due largely to timing. The increase in advertising was primarily driven by increased support on Chunky soup behind the new advertising campaign and on Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers. Adjusted administrative expenses declined 4%, reflecting the benefit of our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by inflation and investments we are making in longer-term innovation. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. Adjusted EPS increased $0.05 from $0.95 in the prior year to $1 per share in the current quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, increases in adjusted EBIT had a $0.01 benefit on EPS. Share repurchases lowered our share count, also adding $0.01 benefit. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter decreased by 2 points to 32.1%. The decrease in the tax rate contributed $0.03 to EPS growth, including the benefit from the change in accounting for stock-based compensation. Interest was comparable to the prior year as the impact of higher interest rates was offset by a lower debt level. While slightly favorable, the currency translation benefit rounds to no impact, completing the bridge to $1 per share. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales were comparable to the prior year at $1,297,000,000, as double-digit gains in Plum products were offset by declines in V8 beverages. Sales of U.S. soup were comparable to the prior year as gains in ready-to-serve soups, primarily Chunky, benefiting from increased marketing support, and in broth, were offset by modest decline in condensed soups. Delivering against its portfolio role, operating earnings increased 6%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, driven primarily by productivity improvements, partly offset by increased marketing and selling expense. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending October 30, 2016, the category as a whole declined by 2.3%. Our sales in measured channels declined 2.7%, primarily driven by weakness in ready-to-serve, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share for the 52-week period, declining 20 basis points. Private label grew share by 30 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, down 10 basis points. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 1%, driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm on strong growth in Goldfish crackers, which benefited from increased advertising and promotional activity as well as new items. Operating earnings declined 2% to $112 million, driven primarily by higher advertising expenses, partly offset by the favorable impact of currency translation. The segment gross margin percentage was comparable to last year as the impact of cost inflation and increased promotional spending was partly offset by productivity improvements. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, as expected, organic sales declined 6%, reflecting declines in Bolthouse Farms beverages due to capacity constraints following the recall of Protein PLUS drink in June 2016 as well as declines in carrot and softness in Garden Fresh Gourmet, partly offset by gains in refrigerated soups. Lower carrot sales reflect the market share impact of quality and execution issues from last fiscal year. 
Operating earnings declined by $17 million to $1 million, reflecting higher carrot cost, which were associated with lower volumes and improved quality, the cost impact of lower beverage operating efficiencies and the impact of lower sales. As we've previously stated, we expect a return to growth in C-Fresh starting in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Cash flow from operations was $221 million, $23 million lower than the prior year. The decline reflects lower cash earnings and higher working capital requirement. Capital expenditures declined $23 million to $48 million. We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2017. We paid dividends totaling $100 million, reflecting a quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In September, we announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.35 per share, which, from a cash flow perspective, will be reflected in the second quarter. 
In aggregate, we repurchased $112 million of shares, $100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program, as we've increased our level of share repurchases. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt declined by $522 million compared to year-ago level as cash from operations over the last 4 quarters was well in excess of capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. 
Now I'll review our 2017 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we announced in September. The company expects sales to grow by 0% to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 1% to 4% and adjusted EPS to grow by 2% to 5% or $3 to $3.09 per share. This guidance assumes, based on current exchange rate, that the impact from currency translation will be nominal. We expect gross margin to improve slightly for the year. While inflation on core ingredients and packaging has moderated, we expect inflation and cost of products sold of approximately 2%. 
On our cost savings program, we are ahead of our expectations, having generated $35 million in the first quarter against our full year estimate of $50 million. It's early in the year, so before making any changes to the savings estimate or full year guidance, we'd like to see how our cost savings develop in the second quarter, assess the performance of the business, especially C-Fresh, and evaluate potential reinvestment opportunities. Our EPS guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, which includes the change in accounting and from the favorable impact of anticipated share repurchases over the course of the year. 
That concludes my remarks. And now I'll turn it back to Ken for Q&A."

Of the $35 million, the majority of those cost savings in Q1 were within the supply chain. Therefore, they're on the cost of products sold line. And the balance, I would say, is primarily within administrative expenses. We are certainly pleased with the gross margin performance in the quarter. We're a little bit ahead of our expectations. And there's a couple of things we see unfolding in the balance of the year. We are benefiting on our core ingredients and packaging items, a little bit of deflation in the first quarter, and we see that swing to more neutral to slightly positive in the back half, and the category to think about are -- is primarily 3 big ones. One is steel can. The other is dairy product. We're currently wrapping the impact of avian flu and weak prices, which are currently in deflation, and we expect that to also to be more neutral. So we see a little bit of a swing front half to back half. The other thing we anticipate as we unfold some of our real food investments, we are removing artificial colors and ingredients. We are removing BPA from our can liners. And those costs are going to accelerate as we go through the second half of the year relative to the first half. So we see a couple of headwinds ahead. Again, we feel good about our first quarter. We'll see how the second quarter unfolds and make an assessment then."

So only other 2 things are the expansion of Tim Tam in the United States, which we're really excited about, and that campaign starts in January.

I think, in the recent past, what we experienced last year was some execution issues on our RTS soup. Condensed was largely stable, and broth has been increasing nicely for several years, but we experienced declines in our Chunky brand that were quite severe due to labeling misstep. We took a very robust price realization, which has the good news is it is stock, but we did do that and that cost us some volume. We thought that was really necessary for the price spectrum of soup from value to premium that we are providing now to the consumer. And we didn't advertise Chunky. We literally did not have a consumer advertising campaign. We have remedied that this year, and that's why I believe that if we can continue to keep the stability on condensed soup, continue to grow broth and have a good come back on RTS with Chunky and new Well Yes!, I believe that is a stronger plan going forward."

I mean, as you've seen, the primary contributor to gross margin expansion came out of our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment, and it's driven by a couple of things. One is our supply chain is just running really well, and that is definitely sustainable. There's no reason that should fall back as we go throughout the year here. They also out of the gate pretty well on productivity improvement. So let me give you a couple of examples. We recently expanded one of our warehouses at our major thermal plant, so we've brought in some of the storage that were on third-party sites, so that saved us some money. We've added capacity in product lines like our Prego white sauce, additional capacity in broth, so we've repatriated some co-packer volume on those 2 products. And that obviously is sustainable. So I think the things that are generating the savings in the first quarter are definitely sustainable. The things that we see kind of moving against us as we look ahead one is cost inflation. We are, particularly within Americas, benefiting from some deflation in a couple of key categories, things like steel can and dairy, which I don't think are sustainable. And based on our forecast, that's going to move from more deflation to more, I say, flattish in the back half. And the third thing, which I mentioned earlier, we are making investments in the cost line against our real food initiatives, the cost of removing artificial colors and ingredients, cost associated with moving BPA from our can liners. That's going hit more as we progress throughout the year. So again, I think the supply chain is running well, and we've got a couple of things that are going to turn a little bit as we go through the year."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal '17 earnings call. I look forward to reviewing and discussing our results with you this morning. I'll start with a high-level overview and then provide my perspective on each",2197,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal '17 earnings call. I look forward to reviewing and discussing our results with you this morning. I'll start with a high-level overview and then provide my perspective on each division's performance. Anthony will follow with a detailed financial review. 
But first, let me start with some context about the external environment. In the United States, the length and tenor of the presidential campaign was unprecedented. There are many important issues the new administration will address that will impact the food industry, including tax policy, regulation, trade agreements, new leadership of the USDA and FDA as well as the upcoming Farm Bill. Meanwhile, the seismic shifts that I've outlined in our previous discussions continue to impact our industry, including a shrinking middle class, major demographic shifts, changing consumer preferences for food with an emphasis on health and wellbeing and the continued evolution of digital media and e-commerce channels. 
Across the industry, top line growth remains sluggish, particularly in center-store categories. Simultaneously, food deflation is pressuring both top and bottom lines and limiting pricing opportunities. This is driving a hypercompetitive environment for market share, along with the continued focus on cost savings measures to deliver earnings. As we've seen, many food companies have reported flat to declining organic sales in their most recent quarters, and that pressure is not limited to manufacturers. Retailers, too, are taking actions to reposition themselves for growth through consolidation, management changes and increased investments in e-commerce. 
With that as context, let me turn to our first quarter results. Relative to our expectations, I'm encouraged by our overall performance. We're executing against the plans we described in September. We expanded gross margin and delivered adjusted EBIT and EPS growth, cycling a strong year-ago quarter. Organic sales decreased 1% in the quarter, driven by declines in our Campbell Fresh business, which we expected and which we communicated in early September. Additionally, we remain on track to achieve our $300 million cost savings goal by the end of fiscal 2018. Importantly, we're reinvesting across the business to drive top line growth, including increased advertising support of Chunky Soup and Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers, expanding our digital and e-commerce capabilities and funding long-term innovation initiatives. 
Given our start and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we reaffirmed our full year guidance this morning. Let me now offer my perspective on the performance of each of our 3 divisions. 
Let's start with Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, our largest division. As a reminder, this division's portfolio role is to deliver moderate growth, consistent with the categories in which we operate, and to expand margins. Our sales were mixed this quarter. However, the division delivered strong operating earnings, and I continue to be pleased with the gross margin expansion driven by the improved performance of our supply chain. I'm optimistic about the start to the soup season. U.S. soup sales were comparable to a year ago, which reflects an improvement in trend. Sales of RTS soup and broth increased, while condensed sales declined slightly. Campbell's consumption outpaced the category, largely driven by the performance of the RTS portfolio. Chunky led the way as we dramatically improved our execution. We have corrected the labeling misstep from last year, began airing a new integrated NFL-themed campaign and introduced new stackable cans that are driving increased merchandising opportunities at major customers. It's also important to note that we're cycling net price realization gains that has held in the marketplace. All of this is resulting in improved performance. 
Looking ahead on soup, we continue to expect to deliver modest growth for the full year behind improved performance in Chunky, strong holiday plans for both condensed soups and broth and the upcoming launch of our Well Yes! RTS soup line. This new clean label soup is made with nutritious, recognizable and desirable ingredients and will begin shipping in December. The response from retailers has been overwhelmingly positive, and we have a robust integrated marketing plan to fuel the launch. 
In other parts of the portfolio, we drove double-digit sales gains in Plum with growth in the core pouch portfolio as well as the introduction of Plum organic infant formula. However, our shelf-stable beverage portfolio remains challenged, specifically V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash. On the positive side, V8 +Energy continues to perform well, and we're seeing improving trends in V8 Red, following our decision to increase advertising support. As we previously stated, we do not expect V8 to grow in fiscal 2017. 
While we have more work ahead, I'm encouraged by the start to the year, especially in U.S. soup, and I'm confident in our plans. In short, the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division continues to deliver against its portfolio role. 
Now let's turn to Global Biscuits and Snacks. As a reminder, this division includes our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses, and its portfolio role is to expand and develop -- in developing markets while improving market -- margins. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm on strong performance of Goldfish crackers and Milano cookies. Operating earnings decreased 2% as we invested in increased advertising. In the U.S., the team delivered sales and share gains in both Goldfish crackers and Milano cookies. Goldfish benefited from increased advertising investment, channel gains leveraging multiple pack sizes and innovative new products. Our efforts to expand our health and wellbeing offerings are performing well. Both multigrain Goldfish and Goldfish made with organic wheat contributed to the sales gains. 
At Investor Day, we shared our plans to focus on building brand equity and increasing our marketing investments in our cookie portfolio, and we're beginning to see results. Effective new advertising and flavor innovation drove sales and consumption gains for Milano cookies. 
Sales in fresh bakery declined in the quarter in the face of intensified competitive activity, and we have taken steps to address this with improved innovation and quality on our Pepperidge Farm Swirl Bread. 
Looking ahead, in the U.S., we're focused on driving growth in Goldfish, increase innovation in cookies, including the relaunch of our Pepperidge Farm American classic cookie line and the new fresh bakery quality improvements to take hold in the market. Additionally, expanding both Tim Tam distribution and our West Coast bakery operations remain top priorities. 
Turning to other parts of the world. In Southeast Asia, we maintained our momentum in Malaysia behind strong sales of sauces. But sales in Indonesia were negatively impacted by aggressive competitive activities in the general trade. In Australia, we delivered sales growth in biscuits, driven by strong performance in our chocolate biscuit portfolio despite declines in Shapes crackers. We've taken action to address Shapes' performance, and we're beginning to see signs of improvement. 
Looking ahead, we're focused on delivering consumer-driven product innovation in Tim Tam chocolate biscuits with a new range of seasonal varieties. We also expect our shapes performance to accelerate behind our new marketing campaign, highlighting both new and original recipes. 
Finally, I'll discuss our Campbell Fresh division. The CPG portion of C-Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and chips, and our refrigerated soups. The farms' portion of the portfolio includes carrot and natural ingredients. As a reminder, C-Fresh is a strategically important business to Campbell. It addresses a key consumer trend towards fresh foods and health and wellbeing, and its brands resonate with millennial consumers. The business performed as expected to the start of the year as we're continuing to execute the recovery plans related to the voluntary product recall of Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks and the carrot quality and execution issues we experienced in fiscal 2016. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we installed a new leadership team and that increased the integration and oversight of the Campbell Fresh supply chain. There have been other changes since then. As previously announced, Jeff Dunn left the company in October, and we named Ed Carolan, President of Campbell Fresh. Ed has been with Campbell since 2001 in a variety of leadership roles, including the President of U.S. Retail Soup, Sauce and Beverages. Most recently, he was President of Integrated Global Services, where he created and implemented a business model to build new capabilities and deliver faster, more efficient services. Ed and the Campbell Fresh leadership team are focused on returning the business to growth starting in the second half of the year. 
Now let's take a closer look at what drove the declines in the first quarter and our continued recovery from the Protein PLUS beverage recall and the carrot quality and execution issues. 
First, beverages. As we discussed in the fourth quarter, we identified and corrected the primary cause of last year's Protein PLUS recall and implemented enhanced processes to improve quality standards. While we're making progress, we still continue to expect the Protein PLUS supply will be negatively impacted through the end of the calendar year 2016. Our objective is to meet demand through a combination of improved run rates, increased in-house capacity and adding co-packers. Following the recall, we have been steadily increasing production capacity while also working hard to improve our customer service levels. We've made solid progress in the first quarter in improving our run times. To increase capacity, we're in the process of installing a new beverage line in our Bakersfield plant, which we expect will be commissioned by the end of the calendar year. 
Performance was mixed in other parts of the Campbell Fresh CPG portfolio. In the ultra-premium category, sales growth of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms cold-pressed juice was driven by increased distribution and share gains. Sales of Bolthouse Farms salad dressing also continued to grow. 
Turning to Garden Fresh Gourmet. Sales of hummus and salsa declined in the quarter. The team is focused on further product differentiation through regional flavors as we continue to execute our plans to expand Garden Fresh Gourmet beyond the Midwest. 
Another bright spot was the performance of retail fresh soup. Sales increased in the quarter with the introduction of new branded Garden Fresh Gourmet soup, which has been well received by customers. 
Now turning to the farms business. We are stabilizing our carrot operations and improved quality. The team remains focused on service levels and working to regain lost customers over time. We expect the recovery to continue throughout the year as we demonstrate to customers our ability to deliver sustained quality. While we're making progress, we clearly have more work ahead to get this division back to performing in line with its portfolio role of full-force growth. For the full year, we continue to expect Campbell Fresh sales to grow in the low single digits. 
Before closing, I want to touch upon our efforts to create new models of innovation to define the future real food and drive growth in new ways for Campbell. As I discussed with you in the past, new models continue to emerge and new startup companies are being fueled by an influx of venture capital. Campbell is now more fully participating in venture opportunities through Acre Venture Partners and independently managed $125 million venture fund where Campbell is the sole limited partner. Acre is investing in a number of promising and innovative food and food-related companies. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we funded $41 million out of our $125 million commitment. 
Another example of how we're investing our cost savings into long-term innovation is a new startup company called Habit, a business backed by Campbell and led by Neil Grimmer, the Co-Founder of Plum. Positioned at the intersection of health and wellbeing, technology and food, Habit will leverage individualized data to create personalized nutrition and meal plans for people who want to harness the transformative power of food to improve their lives. Stay tuned. We will be sharing additional details about Habit at CAGNY in February. 
Finally, we continue to build a robust pipeline of internal innovation focused on the large and growing consumer platforms of health and wellbeing and snacking. And we're also continuing to pursue smart external development to diversify our portfolio in faster-growing spaces. 
Given our expectations and plans for the year, we're satisfied with our performance to start the year and confident in our plans for fiscal '17. We continue to take action to strengthen our core business while also driving growth for the long term through our purpose, growth agenda and strategic imperatives: one, real food transparency and sustainability; two, digital and e-commerce; three, health and wellbeing; and four, snacking, all while continuing to build a high-performance organization focused on talent and culture and transforming the way we work. 
In summary, these unpredictable and uncertain times in which we live are marked by sweeping changes across the food industry landscape. At Campbell, we're guided by our purpose: real food that matters for life's moments and focused on meeting the needs of our consumers, helping our customers grow their business and increasing shareholder value for our investors. 
Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro, for an overview of our financial results."
258458,408983715,1090429,"Campbell Soup Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year.

Before reviewing our results, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year. As Denise stated, organic sales, while down, were in line with our expectations. We anticipated our first quarter sales to be under some pressure as we begin to recover from a capacity constraint on Bolthouse Farms beverages and stabilize the carrot business. Overall, U.S. soup sales were flat, and we were pleased with the performance of Chunky, which is responding well to our marketing program. 
Our adjusted gross margin expanded 120 basis points as our supply chain performed well and delivered significant productivity improvements while cost inflation remained moderate. We continue to make strong progress against our cost savings target of $300 million by the end of fiscal 2018, delivering about $35 million of incremental savings in the first quarter, bringing the program to-date total to $250 million. 
We adopted a new accounting standard that impacts the recognition of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. The tax rate for the quarter reflected a $6 million tax benefit related to the change. 
We are pleased with our first quarter start and are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 guidance that we announced in September. 
Now I'll review our results in more detail. On an as-reported basis, net sales of $2,202,000,000 were comparable to the prior year. Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation, organic net sales declined 1%, driven by declines in Campbell Fresh, partly offset by gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks. Adjusted EBIT increased 1% to $486 million as the benefits of a higher adjusted gross margin percentage and lower administrative expenses were partly offset by increased marketing and selling expenses. Adjusted EPS increased 5% or $0.05 to $1 per share. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Organic sales declined 1%, driven by a 1 point decline from volume and mix. Net price realization, both pricing and promotion, was stable for the quarter compared to last year. Offsetting the organic sales decline was a 1 point favorable impact from currency translation, principally the Australian dollar, resulting in net sales being comparable to the prior year. 
Our adjusted gross margin increased 120 basis points in the quarter. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 70 basis points. Cost inflation on a rate basis increased by about 1.5%. In addition, cost of products sold reflects higher cost in our C-Fresh division. These negative drivers were partly offset by the benefits from our cost savings initiatives. 
Reflecting the increased promotional spending in Pepperidge Farm to support Goldfish and fresh bakery, and in Indonesia to remain competitive, promotional spending had a 20 basis points negative impact, which was offset by list pricing gains of 20 basis points, primarily from our retail business in Canada. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 20 basis points, reflecting the sales decline in our lower-margin C-Fresh segment. 
Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our $300 million cost savings program, contributed 170 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. All in, our gross margin percentage increased 120 basis points to 39.1%. 
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 11% in the quarter, primarily due to higher advertising expenses as we reinvest in our key brands as well as higher selling expenses due largely to timing. The increase in advertising was primarily driven by increased support on Chunky soup behind the new advertising campaign and on Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers. Adjusted administrative expenses declined 4%, reflecting the benefit of our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by inflation and investments we are making in longer-term innovation. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. Adjusted EPS increased $0.05 from $0.95 in the prior year to $1 per share in the current quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, increases in adjusted EBIT had a $0.01 benefit on EPS. Share repurchases lowered our share count, also adding $0.01 benefit. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter decreased by 2 points to 32.1%. The decrease in the tax rate contributed $0.03 to EPS growth, including the benefit from the change in accounting for stock-based compensation. Interest was comparable to the prior year as the impact of higher interest rates was offset by a lower debt level. While slightly favorable, the currency translation benefit rounds to no impact, completing the bridge to $1 per share. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales were comparable to the prior year at $1,297,000,000, as double-digit gains in Plum products were offset by declines in V8 beverages. Sales of U.S. soup were comparable to the prior year as gains in ready-to-serve soups, primarily Chunky, benefiting from increased marketing support, and in broth, were offset by modest decline in condensed soups. Delivering against its portfolio role, operating earnings increased 6%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, driven primarily by productivity improvements, partly offset by increased marketing and selling expense. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending October 30, 2016, the category as a whole declined by 2.3%. Our sales in measured channels declined 2.7%, primarily driven by weakness in ready-to-serve, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share for the 52-week period, declining 20 basis points. Private label grew share by 30 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, down 10 basis points. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 1%, driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm on strong growth in Goldfish crackers, which benefited from increased advertising and promotional activity as well as new items. Operating earnings declined 2% to $112 million, driven primarily by higher advertising expenses, partly offset by the favorable impact of currency translation. The segment gross margin percentage was comparable to last year as the impact of cost inflation and increased promotional spending was partly offset by productivity improvements. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, as expected, organic sales declined 6%, reflecting declines in Bolthouse Farms beverages due to capacity constraints following the recall of Protein PLUS drink in June 2016 as well as declines in carrot and softness in Garden Fresh Gourmet, partly offset by gains in refrigerated soups. Lower carrot sales reflect the market share impact of quality and execution issues from last fiscal year. 
Operating earnings declined by $17 million to $1 million, reflecting higher carrot cost, which were associated with lower volumes and improved quality, the cost impact of lower beverage operating efficiencies and the impact of lower sales. As we've previously stated, we expect a return to growth in C-Fresh starting in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Cash flow from operations was $221 million, $23 million lower than the prior year. The decline reflects lower cash earnings and higher working capital requirement. Capital expenditures declined $23 million to $48 million. We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2017. We paid dividends totaling $100 million, reflecting a quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In September, we announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.35 per share, which, from a cash flow perspective, will be reflected in the second quarter. 
In aggregate, we repurchased $112 million of shares, $100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program, as we've increased our level of share repurchases. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt declined by $522 million compared to year-ago level as cash from operations over the last 4 quarters was well in excess of capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. 
Now I'll review our 2017 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we announced in September. The company expects sales to grow by 0% to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 1% to 4% and adjusted EPS to grow by 2% to 5% or $3 to $3.09 per share. This guidance assumes, based on current exchange rate, that the impact from currency translation will be nominal. We expect gross margin to improve slightly for the year. While inflation on core ingredients and packaging has moderated, we expect inflation and cost of products sold of approximately 2%. 
On our cost savings program, we are ahead of our expectations, having generated $35 million in the first quarter against our full year estimate of $50 million. It's early in the year, so before making any changes to the savings estimate or full year guidance, we'd like to see how our cost savings develop in the second quarter, assess the performance of the business, especially C-Fresh, and evaluate potential reinvestment opportunities. Our EPS guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, which includes the change in accounting and from the favorable impact of anticipated share repurchases over the course of the year. 
That concludes my remarks. And now I'll turn it back to Ken for Q&A."

And the balance, I would say, is primarily within administrative expenses. We are certainly pleased with the gross margin performance in the quarter. We're a little bit ahead of our expectations. And there's a couple of things we see unfolding in the balance of the year. We are benefiting on our core ingredients and packaging items, a little bit of deflation in the first quarter, and we see that swing to more neutral to slightly positive in the back half. And the category to think about are -- is primarily 3 big ones. One is steel can. The other is dairy products. We're currently wrapping the impact of avian flu and wheat prices, which are currently in deflation. and we expect that to also to be more neutral. So we see a little bit of a swing front half to back half. The other thing we anticipate, as we unfold some of our real food investments, we are removing artificial colors and ingredients. We are removing BPA from our can liners. And those costs are going to accelerate as we go through the second half of the year relative to the first half. So we see a couple of headwinds ahead. Again, we feel good about our first quarter. We'll see how the second quarter unfolds and make an assessment then."

Broth has been under a little bit of pressure, but we have big holiday plans. And so we're very confident in our holiday plans on broth. So I think it's shaping up to be a season very much as we expected. Well Yes! starts shipping in December, and so we have a huge -- the customer acceptance has been great, and so we have a huge Campbell launch on this one. So very excited about that."

I mean, as you've seen, the primary contributor to gross margin expansion came out of our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment, and it's driven by a couple of things. One is our supply chain is just running really well, and that is definitely sustainable. There's no reason that should fall back as we go throughout the year here. They're also added a gate pretty well on productivity improvement. So let me give you a couple of examples. We recently expanded one of our warehouses at our major thermal plant, so we've brought in some of the storage that was on third-party site, so that saved us some money. We've added capacity in product lines like our Prego white sauce, additional capacity in aseptic broth, so we've repatriated some cold pack volume on those 2 products. And that, obviously, is sustainable. So I think the things that are generating the savings in the first quarter are definitely sustainable. The things that we see kind of moving against us as we look ahead: one is on cost inflation. We are, particularly within Americas, benefiting from some deflation in a couple of key categories, things like steel can and dairy, which I don't think is sustainable. And based on our forecast, that's going to move from more deflation to more, I say, flattish in the back half. And the third thing, which I mentioned earlier, we are making investments in the cost line against our real food initiatives, the cost of removing artificial colors and ingredients, cost associated with moving BPA from our can liners. That's going hit more as we progress throughout the year. So again, I think the supply chain is running well, and we've got a couple of things that are going to turn a little bit as we go through the year."

So I guess my -- as you look at manufacturing centers, so if you look at ready-to-serve going forward, which strikes me the big risk here is only really that it loses shelf space with the retailers because it must be -- I mean, there must be some pretty good momentum in Chunky as you are presumably putting more resources behind us. And so my questions would be, are retailers recognizing the difference? Are they aware of this change in relative sort of commitment to this category? I know you've gotten net price realization there. And what sort of expectations do you have over, not only the next year, but the next couple of years as capacity changes in that industry that you'll be able to hold share for ready-to-serve as a whole as you presumably play a bigger role of that?"

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal '17 earnings call. I look forward to reviewing and discussing our results with you this morning. I'll start with a high-level overview and then provide my perspective on each",2196,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal '17 earnings call. I look forward to reviewing and discussing our results with you this morning. I'll start with a high-level overview and then provide my perspective on each division's performance. Anthony will follow with a detailed financial review. 
But first, let me start with some context about the external environment. In the United States, the length and tenor of the presidential campaign was unprecedented. There are many important issues the new administration will address that will impact the food industry, including tax policy, regulation, trade agreements, new leadership of the USDA and FDA as well as the upcoming Farm Bill. Meanwhile, the seismic shifts that I've outlined in our previous discussions continue to impact our industry, including a shrinking middle class, major demographic shifts, changing consumer preferences for food with an emphasis on health and wellbeing and the continued evolution of digital media and e-commerce channels. 
Across the industry, top line growth remains sluggish, particularly in center-store categories. Simultaneously, food deflation is pressuring both top and bottom lines and limiting pricing opportunities. This is driving a hypercompetitive environment for market share, along with the continued focus on cost savings measures to deliver earnings. As we've seen, many food companies have reported flat to declining organic sales in their most recent quarters, and that pressure is not limited to manufacturers. Retailers, too, are taking actions to reposition themselves for growth through consolidation, management changes and increased investments in e-commerce. 
With that as context, let me turn to our first quarter results. Relative to our expectations, I'm encouraged by our overall performance. We're executing against the plans we described in September. We expanded gross margin and delivered adjusted EBIT and EPS growth, cycling a strong year-ago quarter. Organic sales decreased 1% in the quarter, driven by declines in our Campbell Fresh business, which we expected and which we communicated in early September. Additionally, we remain on track to achieve our $300 million cost savings goal by the end of fiscal 2018. Importantly, we're reinvesting across the business to drive top line growth, including increased advertising support of Chunky Soup and Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers, expanding our digital and e-commerce capabilities and funding long-term innovation initiatives. 
Given our start and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we reaffirmed our full year guidance this morning. Let me now offer my perspective on the performance of each of our 3 divisions. 
Let's start with Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, our largest division. As a reminder, this division's portfolio role is to deliver moderate growth, consistent with the categories in which we operate, and to expand margins. Our sales were mixed this quarter. However, the division delivered strong operating earnings, and I continue to be pleased with the gross margin expansion driven by the improved performance of our supply chain. I'm optimistic about the start to the soup season. U.S. soup sales were comparable to a year ago, which reflects an improvement in trend. Sales of RTS soup and broth increased, while condensed sales declined slightly. Campbell's consumption outpaced the category, largely driven by the performance of the RTS portfolio. Chunky led the way as we dramatically improved our execution. We have corrected the labeling misstep from last year, began airing a new integrated NFL-themed campaign and introduced new stackable cans that are driving increased merchandising opportunities at major customers. It's also important to note that we're cycling net price realization gains that has held in the marketplace. All of this is resulting in improved performance. 
Looking ahead on soup, we continue to expect to deliver modest growth for the full year behind improved performance in Chunky, strong holiday plans for both condensed soups and broth and the upcoming launch of our Well Yes! RTS soup line. This new clean label soup is made with nutritious, recognizable and desirable ingredients and will begin shipping in December. The response from retailers has been overwhelmingly positive, and we have a robust integrated marketing plan to fuel the launch. 
In other parts of the portfolio, we drove double-digit sales gains in Plum with growth in the core pouch portfolio as well as the introduction of Plum organic infant formula. However, our shelf-stable beverage portfolio remains challenged, specifically V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash. On the positive side, V8 +Energy continues to perform well, and we're seeing improving trends in V8 Red, following our decision to increase advertising support. As we previously stated, we do not expect V8 to grow in fiscal 2017. 
While we have more work ahead, I'm encouraged by the start to the year, especially in U.S. soup, and I'm confident in our plans. In short, the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division continues to deliver against its portfolio role. 
Now let's turn to Global Biscuits and Snacks. As a reminder, this division includes our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses, and its portfolio role is to expand and develop in developing markets while improving market -- margins. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm on strong performance of Goldfish crackers and Milano cookies. Operating earnings decreased 2% as we invested in increased advertising. In the U.S., the team delivered sales and share gains in both Goldfish crackers and Milano cookies. Goldfish benefited from increased advertising investment, channel gains leveraging multiple pack sizes and innovative new products. Our efforts to expand our health and wellbeing offerings are performing well. Both multigrain Goldfish and Goldfish made with organic wheat contributed to the sales gains. 
At Investor Day, we shared our plans to focus on building brand equity and increasing our marketing investments in our cookie portfolio, and we're beginning to see results. Effective new advertising and flavor innovation drove sales and consumption gains for Milano cookies. 
Sales in fresh bakery declined in the quarter in the face of intensified competitive activity, and we have taken steps to address this with improved innovation and quality on our Pepperidge Farm Swirl Bread. 
Looking ahead, in the U.S., we're focused on driving growth in Goldfish, increase innovation in cookies, including the relaunch of our Pepperidge Farm American classic cookie line and the new fresh bakery quality improvements to take hold in the market. Additionally, expanding both Tim Tam distribution and our West Coast bakery operations remain top priorities. 
Turning to other parts of the world. In Southeast Asia, we maintained our momentum in Malaysia behind strong sales of sauces. But sales in Indonesia were negatively impacted by aggressive competitive activities in the general trade. In Australia, we delivered sales growth in biscuits, driven by strong performance in our chocolate biscuit portfolio despite declines in Shapes crackers. We've taken action to address Shapes' performance, and we're beginning to see signs of improvement. 
Looking ahead, we're focused on delivering consumer-driven product innovation in Tim Tam chocolate biscuits with a new range of seasonal varieties. We also expect our shapes performance to accelerate behind our new marketing campaign, highlighting both new and original recipes. 
Finally, I'll discuss our Campbell Fresh division. The CPG portion of C-Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and chips, and our refrigerated soups. The Farms' portion of the portfolio includes carrot and natural ingredients. As a reminder, C-Fresh is a strategically important business to Campbell. It addresses a key consumer trend towards fresh foods and health and wellbeing, and its brands resonate with millennial consumers. The business performed as expected to the start of the year as we're continuing to execute the recovery plans related to the voluntary product recall of Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks and the carrot quality and execution issues we experienced in fiscal 2016. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we installed a new leadership team and that increased the integration and oversight of the Campbell Fresh supply chain. There have been other changes since then. As previously announced, Jeff Dunn left the company in October, and we named Ed Carolan, President of Campbell Fresh. Ed has been with Campbell since 2001 in a variety of leadership roles, including the President of U.S. Retail Soup, Sauce and Beverages. Most recently, he was President of Integrated Global Services, where he created and implemented a business model to build new capabilities and deliver faster, more efficient services. Ed and the Campbell Fresh leadership team are focused on returning the business to growth starting in the second half of the year. 
Now let's take a closer look at what drove the declines in the first quarter and our continued recovery from the Protein PLUS beverage recall and the carrot quality and execution issues. 
First, beverages. As we discussed in the fourth quarter, we identified and corrected the primary cause of last year's Protein PLUS recall and implemented enhanced processes to improve quality standards. While we're making progress, we still continue to expect the Protein PLUS supply will be negatively impacted through the end of the calendar year 2016. Our objective is to meet demand through a combination of improved run rates, increased in-house capacity and adding co-packers. Following the recall, we have been steadily increasing production capacity while also working hard to improve our customer service levels. We've made solid progress in the first quarter in improving our run times. To increase capacity, we're in the process of installing a new beverage line in our Bakersfield plant, which we expect will be commissioned by the end of the calendar year. 
Performance was mixed in other parts of the Campbell Fresh CPG portfolio. In the ultra-premium category, sales growth of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms cold-pressed juice was driven by increased distribution and share gains. Sales of Bolthouse Farms salad dressing also continued to grow. 
Turning to Garden Fresh Gourmet. Sales of hummus and salsa declined in the quarter. The team is focused on further product differentiation through regional flavors as we continue to execute our plans to expand Garden Fresh Gourmet beyond the Midwest. 
Another bright spot was the performance of retail fresh soup. Sales increased in the quarter with the introduction of new branded Garden Fresh Gourmet soup, which has been well received by customers. 
Now turning to the Farms business. We are stabilizing our carrot operations and improved quality. The team remains focused on service levels and working to regain lost customers over time. We expect the recovery to continue throughout the year as we demonstrate to customers our ability to deliver sustained quality. While we're making progress, we clearly have more work ahead to get this division back to performing in line with its portfolio role of full-force growth. For the full year, we continue to expect Campbell Fresh sales to grow in the low single digits. 
Before closing, I want to touch upon our efforts to create new models of innovation to define the future real food and drive growth in new ways for Campbell. As I discussed with you in the past, new models continue to emerge and new startup companies are being fueled by an influx of venture capital. Campbell is now more fully participating in venture opportunities through Acre Venture Partners, an independently managed $125 million venture fund where Campbell is the sole limited partner. Acre is investing in a number of promising and innovative food and food-related companies. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we funded $41 million out of our $125 million commitment. 
Another example of how we're investing our cost savings into long-term innovation is a new startup company called Habit, a business backed by Campbell and led by Neil Grimmer, the Co-Founder of Plum. Positioned at the intersection of health and wellbeing, technology and food, Habit will leverage individualized data to create personalized nutrition and meal plans for people who want to harness the transformative power of food to improve their lives. Stay tuned. We will be sharing additional details about Habit at CAGNY in February. 
Finally, we continue to build a robust pipeline of internal innovation focused on the large and growing consumer platforms of health and wellbeing and snacking. And we're also continuing to pursue smart external development to diversify our portfolio in faster-growing spaces. 
Given our expectations and plans for the year, we're satisfied with our performance to start the year and confident in our plans for fiscal '17. We continue to take action to strengthen our core business while also driving growth for the long term through our purpose, growth agenda and strategic imperatives: one, real food transparency and sustainability; two, digital and e-commerce; three, health and wellbeing; and four, snacking, all while continuing to build a high-performance organization focused on talent and culture and transforming the way we work. 
In summary, these unpredictable and uncertain times in which we live are marked by sweeping changes across the food industry landscape. At Campbell, we're guided by our purpose: real food that matters for life's moments and focused on meeting the needs of our consumers, helping our customers grow their business and increasing shareholder value for our investors. 
Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro, for an overview of our financial results."
258458,408983715,1090694,"Campbell Soup Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year.

Before reviewing our results, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year. As Denise stated, organic sales, while down, were in line with our expectations. We anticipated our first quarter sales to be under some pressure as we begin to recover from a capacity constraint on Bolthouse Farms beverages and stabilize the carrot business. Overall, U.S. soup sales were flat, and we were pleased with the performance of Chunky, which is responding well to our marketing program. 
Our adjusted gross margin expanded 120 basis points as our supply chain performed well and delivered significant productivity improvements while cost inflation remained moderate. We continue to make strong progress against our cost savings target of $300 million by the end of fiscal 2018, delevering about $35 million of incremental savings in the first quarter, bringing the program to-date total to $250 million. 
We adopted a new accounting standard that impacts the recognition of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. The tax rate for the quarter reflected a $6 million tax benefit related to the change. 
We are pleased with our first quarter start and are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 guidance that we announced in September. 
Now I'll review our results in more detail. On an as-reported basis, net sales of $2,202,000,000 were comparable to the prior year. Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation, organic net sales declined 1%, driven by declines in Campbell Fresh, partly offset by gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks. Adjusted EBIT increased 1% to $486 million as the benefits of a higher adjusted gross margin percentage and lower administrative expenses were partly offset by increased marketing and selling expenses. Adjusted EPS increased 5% or $0.05 to $1 per share. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Organic sales declined 1%, driven by a 1 point decline from volume and mix. Net price realization, both pricing and promotion, was stable for the quarter compared to last year. Offsetting the organic sales decline was a 1 point favorable impact from currency translation, principally the Australian dollar, resulting in net sales being comparable to the prior year. 
Our adjusted gross margin increased 120 basis points in the quarter. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 70 basis points. Cost inflation on a rate basis increased by about 1.5%. In addition, cost of products sold reflects higher cost in our C-Fresh division. These negative drivers were partly offset by the benefits from our cost savings initiatives. 
Reflecting the increased promotional spending in Pepperidge Farm to support Goldfish and fresh bakery, and in Indonesia to remain competitive, promotional spending had a 20 basis point negative impact, which was offset by list pricing gains of 20 basis points, primarily from our retail business in Canada. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 20 basis points, reflecting the sales decline in our lower-margin C-Fresh segment. 
Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our $300 million cost savings program, contributed 170 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. All in, our gross margin percentage increased 120 basis points to 39.1%. 
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 11% in the quarter, primarily due to higher advertising expenses as we reinvest in our key brands as well as higher selling expenses due largely to timing. The increase in advertising was primarily driven by increased support on Chunky soup behind the new advertising campaign and on Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers. Adjusted administrative expenses declined 4%, reflecting the benefit of our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by inflation and investments we are making in longer-term innovation. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. Adjusted EPS increased $0.05 from $0.95 in the prior year to $1 per share in the current quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, increases in adjusted EBIT had a $0.01 benefit on EPS. Share repurchases lowered our share count, also adding $0.01 benefit. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter decreased by 2 points to 32.1%. The decrease in the tax rate contributed $0.03 to EPS growth, including the benefit from the change in accounting for stock-based compensation. Interest was comparable to the prior year as the impact of higher interest rates was offset by a lower debt level. While slightly favorable, the currency translation benefit rounds to no impact, completing the bridge to $1 per share. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales were comparable to the prior year at $1,297,000,000, as double-digit gains in Plum products were offset by declines in V8 beverages. Sales of U.S. soup were comparable to the prior year as gains in ready-to-serve soups, primarily Chunky, benefiting from increased marketing support, and in broth, were offset by modest decline in condensed soups. Delivering against its portfolio role, operating earnings increased 6%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, driven primarily by productivity improvements, partly offset by increased marketing and selling expense. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending October 30, 2016, the category as a whole declined by 2.3%. Our sales in measured channels declined 2.7%, primarily driven by weakness in ready-to-serve, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share for the 52-week period, declining 20 basis points. Private label grew share by 30 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, down 10 basis points. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 1%, driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm on strong growth in Goldfish crackers, which benefited from increased advertising and promotional activity as well as new items. Operating earnings declined 2% to $112 million, driven primarily by higher advertising expenses, partly offset by the favorable impact of currency translation. The segment gross margin percentage was comparable to last year as the impact of cost inflation and increased promotional spending was partly offset by productivity improvements. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, as expected, organic sales declined 6%, reflecting declines in Bolthouse Farms beverages due to capacity constraints following the recall of Protein PLUS drink in June 2016 as well as declines in carrot and softness in Garden Fresh Gourmet, partly offset by gains in refrigerated soups. Lower carrot sales reflect the market share impact of quality and execution issues from last fiscal year. 
Operating earnings declined by $17 million to $1 million, reflecting higher carrot costs, which were associated with lower volumes and improved quality, the cost impact of lower beverage operating efficiencies and the impact of lower sales. As we've previously stated, we expect a return to growth in C-Fresh starting in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Cash flow from operations was $221 million, $23 million lower than the prior year. The decline reflects lower cash earnings and higher working capital requirement. Capital expenditures declined $23 million to $48 million. We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2017. We paid dividends totaling $100 million, reflecting a quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In September, we announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.35 per share, which, from a cash flow perspective, will be reflected in the second quarter. 
In aggregate, we repurchased $112 million of shares, $100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program, as we've increased our level of share repurchases. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt declined by $522 million compared to year-ago level as cash from operations over the last 4 quarters was well in excess of capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. 
Now I'll review our 2017 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we announced in September. The company expects sales to grow by 0% to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 1% to 4% and adjusted EPS to grow by 2% to 5% or $3 to $3.09 per share. This guidance assumes, based on current exchange rates, that the impact from currency translation will be nominal. We expect gross margin to improve slightly for the year. While inflation on core ingredients and packaging has moderated, we expect inflation and cost of products sold of approximately 2%. 
On our cost savings program, we are ahead of our expectations, having generated $35 million in the first quarter against our full year estimate of $50 million. It's early in the year, so before making any changes to the savings estimate or full year guidance, we'd like to see how our cost savings develop in the second quarter, assess the performance of the business, especially C-Fresh, and evaluate potential reinvestment opportunities. Our EPS guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, which includes the change in  accounting and from the favorable impact of anticipated share repurchases over the course of the year. 
That concludes my remarks. And now I'll turn it back to Ken for Q&A."

And the balance, I would say, is primarily within administrative expenses. We are certainly pleased with the gross margin performance in the quarter. We're a little bit ahead of our expectations. And there's a couple of things we see unfolding in the balance of the year. We are benefiting on our core ingredients and packaging items, a little bit of deflation in the first quarter, and we see that swing to more neutral to slightly positive in the back half. And the categories to think about are -- there's primarily 3 big ones. One is steel can. The other is dairy products. We're currently wrapping the impact of avian flu and wheat prices, which are currently in deflation and we expect that to also to be more neutral. So we see a little bit of a swing front half to back half. The other thing we anticipate, as we unfold some of our real food investments, we are removing artificial colors and ingredients. We are removing BPA from our can liners. And those costs are going to accelerate as we go through the second half of the year relative to the first half. So we see a couple of headwinds ahead. Again, we feel good about our first quarter. We'll see how the second quarter unfolds and make an assessment then."

The one place where we are experiencing declines is in fresh bakery as the competitive environment has heated up, but we will be -- we've introduced a new, improved swirl bread and will be investing against that. So only other 2 things are the expansion of Tim Tam in the United States, which we're really excited about, and that campaign starts in January.

We've been able to hold our price realization on Chunky. And again, we're cycling some poor execution issues in the prior year. So we're very happy to see the response of Chunky.

I mean, as you've seen, the primary contributor to gross margin expansion came out of our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment, and it's driven by a couple of things. One is our supply chain is just running really well, and that is definitely sustainable. There's no reason that should fall back as we go throughout the year here. They're also added a gate pretty well on productivity improvement. So let me give you a couple of examples. We recently expanded one of our warehouses at our major thermal plant, so we've brought in some of the storage that was on third-party sites, so that saved us some money. We've added capacity in product lines like our Prego white sauce, additional capacity in aseptic broth, so we've repatriated some cold pack volume on those 2 products. And that, obviously, is sustainable. So I think the things that are generating the savings in the first quarter are definitely sustainable. The things that we see kind of moving against us as we look ahead: one is on cost inflation. We are, particularly within Americas, benefiting from some deflation in a couple of key categories, things like steel can and dairy, which I don't think is sustainable. And based on our forecast, that's going to move from more deflation to more, I say, flattish in the back half. And the third thing, which I mentioned earlier, we are making investments in the cost line against our real food initiatives, the cost of removing artificial colors and ingredients, cost associated with moving BPA from our can liners.

So I guess my -- as you look at manufacturing centers, so if you look at ready-to-serve going forward, which strikes me the big risk here is only really that it loses shelf space with the retailers because it must be -- I mean, there must be some pretty good momentum in Chunky as you are presumably putting more resources behind us. And so my questions would be, are retailers recognizing the difference? Are they aware of this change in relative sort of commitment to this category? I know you've gotten net price realization there.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal '17 earnings call. I look forward to reviewing and discussing our results with you this morning. I'll start with a high-level overview and then provide my perspective on each",2196,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal '17 earnings call. I look forward to reviewing and discussing our results with you this morning. I'll start with a high-level overview and then provide my perspective on each division's performance. Anthony will follow with a detailed financial review. 
But first, let me start with some context about the external environment. In the United States, the length and tenor of the presidential campaign was unprecedented. There are many important issues the new administration will address that will impact the food industry, including tax policy, regulation, trade agreements, new leadership of the USDA and FDA as well as the upcoming Farm Bill. Meanwhile, the seismic shifts that I've outlined in our previous discussions continue to impact our industry, including a shrinking middle class, major demographic shifts, changing consumer preferences for food with an emphasis on health and wellbeing and the continued evolution of digital media and e-commerce channels. 
Across the industry, top line growth remains sluggish, particularly in center-store categories. Simultaneously, food deflation is pressuring both top and bottom lines and limiting pricing opportunities. This is driving a hypercompetitive environment for market share, along with the continued focus on cost savings measures to deliver earnings. As we've seen, many food companies have reported flat to declining organic sales in their most recent quarters, and that pressure is not limited to manufacturers. Retailers, too, are taking actions to reposition themselves for growth through consolidation, management changes and increased investments in e-commerce. 
With that as context, let me turn to our first quarter results. Relative to our expectations, I'm encouraged by our overall performance. We're executing against the plans we described in September. We expanded gross margin and delivered adjusted EBIT and EPS growth, cycling a strong year-ago quarter. Organic sales decreased 1% in the quarter, driven by declines in our Campbell Fresh business, which we expected and which we communicated in early September. Additionally, we remain on track to achieve our $300 million cost savings goal by the end of fiscal 2018. Importantly, we're reinvesting across the business to drive top line growth, including increased advertising support of Chunky Soup and Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers, expanding our digital and e-commerce capabilities and funding long-term innovation initiatives. 
Given our start and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we reaffirmed our full year guidance this morning. Let me now offer my perspective on the performance of each of our 3 divisions. 
Let's start with Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, our largest division. As a reminder, this division's portfolio role is to deliver moderate growth, consistent with the categories in which we operate, and to expand margins. Our sales were mixed this quarter. However, the division delivered strong operating earnings, and I continue to be pleased with the gross margin expansion driven by the improved performance of our supply chain. I'm optimistic about the start to the soup season. U.S. soup sales were comparable to a year ago, which reflects an improvement in trend. Sales of RTS soup and broth increased, while condensed sales declined slightly. Campbell's consumption outpaced the category, largely driven by the performance of the RTS portfolio. Chunky led the way as we dramatically improved our execution. We have corrected the labeling misstep from last year, began airing a new integrated NFL-themed campaign and introduced new stackable cans that are driving increased merchandising opportunities at major customers. It's also important to note that we're cycling net price realization gains that has held in the marketplace. All of this is resulting in improved performance. 
Looking ahead on soup, we continue to expect to deliver modest growth for the full year behind improved performance in Chunky, strong holiday plans for both condensed soups and broth and the upcoming launch of our Well Yes! RTS soup line. This new clean label soup is made with nutritious, recognizable and desirable ingredients and will begin shipping in December. The response from retailers has been overwhelmingly positive, and we have a robust integrated marketing plan to fuel the launch. 
In other parts of the portfolio, we drove double-digit sales gains in Plum with growth in the core pouch portfolio as well as the introduction of Plum organic infant formula. However, our shelf-stable beverage portfolio remains challenged, specifically V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash. On the positive side, V8 +Energy continues to perform well, and we're seeing improving trends in V8 Red, following our decision to increase advertising support. As we previously stated, we do not expect V8 to grow in fiscal 2017. 
While we have more work ahead, I'm encouraged by the start to the year, especially in U.S. soup, and I'm confident in our plans. In short, the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division continues to deliver against its portfolio role. 
Now let's turn to Global Biscuits and Snacks. As a reminder, this division includes our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses, and its portfolio role is to expand and develop in developing markets while improving market -- margins. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm on strong performance of Goldfish crackers and Milano cookies. Operating earnings decreased 2% as we invested in increased advertising. In the U.S., the team delivered sales and share gains in both Goldfish crackers and Milano cookies. Goldfish benefited from increased advertising investment, channel gains leveraging multiple pack sizes and innovative new products. Our efforts to expand our health and wellbeing offerings are performing well. Both multigrain Goldfish and Goldfish made with organic wheat contributed to the sales gains. 
At Investor Day, we shared our plans to focus on building brand equity and increasing our marketing investments in our cookie portfolio, and we're beginning to see results. Effective new advertising and flavor innovation drove sales and consumption gains for Milano cookies. 
Sales in fresh bakery declined in the quarter in the face of intensified competitive activity, and we have taken steps to address this with improved innovation and quality on our Pepperidge Farm Swirl Bread. 
Looking ahead, in the U.S., we're focused on driving growth in Goldfish, increase innovation in cookies, including the relaunch of our Pepperidge Farm American classic cookie line and the new fresh bakery quality improvements to take hold in the market. Additionally, expanding both Tim Tam distribution and our West Coast bakery operations remain top priorities. 
Turning to other parts of the world. In Southeast Asia, we maintained our momentum in Malaysia behind strong sales of sauces. But sales in Indonesia were negatively impacted by aggressive competitive activities in the general trade. In Australia, we delivered sales growth in biscuits, driven by strong performance in our chocolate biscuit portfolio despite declines in Shapes crackers. We've taken action to address Shapes' performance, and we're beginning to see signs of improvement. 
Looking ahead, we're focused on delivering consumer-driven product innovation in Tim Tam chocolate biscuits with a new range of seasonal varieties. We also expect our shapes performance to accelerate behind our new marketing campaign, highlighting both new and original recipes. 
Finally, I'll discuss our Campbell Fresh division. The CPG portion of C-Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and chips, and our refrigerated soups. The Farms' portion of the portfolio includes carrot and natural ingredients. As a reminder, C-Fresh is a strategically important business to Campbell. It addresses a key consumer trend towards fresh foods and health and wellbeing, and its brands resonate with millennial consumers. The business performed as expected to the start of the year as we're continuing to execute the recovery plans related to the voluntary product recall of Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks and the carrot quality and execution issues we experienced in fiscal 2016. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we installed a new leadership team and that increased the integration and oversight of the Campbell Fresh supply chain. There have been other changes since then. As previously announced, Jeff Dunn left the company in October, and we named Ed Carolan, President of Campbell Fresh. Ed has been with Campbell since 2001 in a variety of leadership roles, including the President of U.S. Retail Soup, Sauce and Beverages. Most recently, he was President of Integrated Global Services, where he created and implemented a business model to build new capabilities and deliver faster, more efficient services. Ed and the Campbell Fresh leadership team are focused on returning the business to growth starting in the second half of the year. 
Now let's take a closer look at what drove the declines in the first quarter and our continued recovery from the Protein PLUS beverage recall and the carrot quality and execution issues. 
First, beverages. As we discussed in the fourth quarter, we identified and corrected the primary cause of last year's Protein PLUS recall and implemented enhanced processes to improve quality standards. While we're making progress, we still continue to expect the Protein PLUS supply will be negatively impacted through the end of the calendar year 2016. Our objective is to meet demand through a combination of improved run rates, increased in-house capacity and adding co-packers. Following the recall, we have been steadily increasing production capacity while also working hard to improve our customer service levels. We've made solid progress in the first quarter in improving our run times. To increase capacity, we're in the process of installing a new beverage line in our Bakersfield plant, which we expect will be commissioned by the end of the calendar year. 
Performance was mixed in other parts of the Campbell Fresh CPG portfolio. In the ultra-premium category, sales growth of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms cold-pressed juice was driven by increased distribution and share gains. Sales of Bolthouse Farms salad dressing also continued to grow. 
Turning to Garden Fresh Gourmet. Sales of hummus and salsa declined in the quarter. The team is focused on further product differentiation through regional flavors as we continue to execute our plans to expand Garden Fresh Gourmet beyond the Midwest. 
Another bright spot was the performance of retail fresh soup. Sales increased in the quarter with the introduction of new branded Garden Fresh Gourmet soup, which has been well received by customers. 
Now turning to the Farms business. We are stabilizing our carrot operations and improved quality. The team remains focused on service levels and working to regain lost customers over time. We expect the recovery to continue throughout the year as we demonstrate to customers our ability to deliver sustained quality. While we're making progress, we clearly have more work ahead to get this division back to performing in line with its portfolio role of full-force growth. For the full year, we continue to expect Campbell Fresh sales to grow in the low single digits. 
Before closing, I want to touch upon our efforts to create new models of innovation to define the future real food and drive growth in new ways for Campbell. As I discussed with you in the past, new models continue to emerge and new startup companies are being fueled by an influx of venture capital. Campbell is now more fully participating in venture opportunities through Acre Venture Partners, an independently managed $125 million venture fund where Campbell is the sole limited partner. Acre is investing in a number of promising and innovative food and food-related companies. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we funded $41 million out of our $125 million commitment. 
Another example of how we're investing our cost savings into long-term innovation is a new startup company called Habit, a business backed by Campbell and led by Neil Grimmer, the Co-Founder of Plum. Positioned at the intersection of health and wellbeing, technology and food, Habit will leverage individualized data to create personalized nutrition and meal plans for people who want to harness the transformative power of food to improve their lives. Stay tuned. We will be sharing additional details about Habit at CAGNY in February. 
Finally, we continue to build a robust pipeline of internal innovation focused on the large and growing consumer platforms of health and wellbeing and snacking. And we're also continuing to pursue smart external development to diversify our portfolio in faster-growing spaces. 
Given our expectations and plans for the year, we're satisfied with our performance to start the year and confident in our plans for fiscal '17. We continue to take action to strengthen our core business while also driving growth for the long term through our purpose, growth agenda and strategic imperatives: one, real food transparency and sustainability; two, digital and e-commerce; three, health and wellbeing; and four, snacking, all while continuing to build a high-performance organization focused on talent and culture and transforming the way we work. 
In summary, these unpredictable and uncertain times in which we live are marked by sweeping changes across the food industry landscape. At Campbell, we're guided by our purpose: real food that matters for life's moments and focused on meeting the needs of our consumers, helping our customers grow their business and increasing shareholder value for our investors. 
Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro, for an overview of our financial results."
258458,408983715,1090928,"Campbell Soup Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year. As Denise stated, organic sales, while down, were in line with our expectations. We anticipated our",1508,"Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year. As Denise stated, organic sales, while down, were in line with our expectations. We anticipated our first quarter sales to be under some pressure as we begin to recover from a capacity constraint on Bolthouse Farms beverages and stabilize the carrot business. Overall, U.S. soup sales were flat, and we were pleased with the performance of Chunky, which is responding well to our marketing program. 
Our adjusted gross margin expanded 120 basis points as our supply chain performed well and delivered significant productivity improvements while cost inflation remained moderate. We continue to make strong progress against our cost savings target of $300 million by the end of fiscal 2018, delevering about $35 million of incremental savings in the first quarter, bringing the program to-date total to $250 million. 
We adopted a new accounting standard that impacts the recognition of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. The tax rate for the quarter reflected a $6 million tax benefit related to the change. 
We are pleased with our first quarter start and are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 guidance that we announced in September. 
Now I'll review our results in more detail. On an as-reported basis, net sales of $2,202,000,000 were comparable to the prior year. Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation, organic net sales declined 1%, driven by declines in Campbell Fresh, partly offset by gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks. Adjusted EBIT increased 1% to $486 million as the benefits of a higher adjusted gross margin percentage and lower administrative expenses were partly offset by increased marketing and selling expenses. Adjusted EPS increased 5% or $0.05 to $1 per share. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Organic sales declined 1%, driven by a 1 point decline from volume and mix. Net price realization, both pricing and promotion, was stable for the quarter compared to last year. Offsetting the organic sales decline was a 1 point favorable impact from currency translation, principally the Australian dollar, resulting in net sales being comparable to the prior year. 
Our adjusted gross margin increased 120 basis points in the quarter. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 70 basis points. Cost inflation on a rate basis increased by about 1.5%. In addition, cost of products sold reflects higher cost in our C-Fresh division. These negative drivers were partly offset by the benefits from our cost savings initiatives. 
Reflecting the increased promotional spending in Pepperidge Farm to support Goldfish and fresh bakery, and in Indonesia to remain competitive, promotional spending had a 20 basis point negative impact, which was offset by list pricing gains of 20 basis points, primarily from our retail business in Canada. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 20 basis points, reflecting the sales decline in our lower-margin C-Fresh segment. 
Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our $300 million cost savings program, contributed 170 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. All in, our gross margin percentage increased 120 basis points to 39.1%. 
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 11% in the quarter, primarily due to higher advertising expenses as we reinvest in our key brands as well as higher selling expenses due largely to timing. The increase in advertising was primarily driven by increased support on Chunky soup behind the new advertising campaign and on Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers. Adjusted administrative expenses declined 4%, reflecting the benefit of our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by inflation and investments we are making in longer-term innovation. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. Adjusted EPS increased $0.05 from $0.95 in the prior year to $1 per share in the current quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, increases in adjusted EBIT had a $0.01 benefit on EPS. Share repurchases lowered our share count, also adding $0.01 benefit. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter decreased by 2 points to 32.1%. The decrease in the tax rate contributed $0.03 to EPS growth, including the benefit from the change in accounting for stock-based compensation. Interest was comparable to the prior year as the impact of higher interest rates was offset by a lower debt level. While slightly favorable, the currency translation benefit rounds to no impact, completing the bridge to $1 per share. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales were comparable to the prior year at $1,297,000,000, as double-digit gains in Plum products were offset by declines in V8 beverages. Sales of U.S. soup were comparable to the prior year as gains in ready-to-serve soups, primarily Chunky, benefiting from increased marketing support, and in broth, were offset by modest decline in condensed soups. Delivering against its portfolio role, operating earnings increased 6%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, driven primarily by productivity improvements, partly offset by increased marketing and selling expense. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending October 30, 2016, the category as a whole declined by 2.3%. Our sales in measured channels declined 2.7%, primarily driven by weakness in ready-to-serve, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share for the 52-week period, declining 20 basis points. Private label grew share by 30 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, down 10 basis points. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 1%, driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm on strong growth in Goldfish crackers, which benefited from increased advertising and promotional activity as well as new items. Operating earnings declined 2% to $112 million, driven primarily by higher advertising expenses, partly offset by the favorable impact of currency translation. The segment gross margin percentage was comparable to last year as the impact of cost inflation and increased promotional spending was partly offset by productivity improvements. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, as expected, organic sales declined 6%, reflecting declines in Bolthouse Farms beverages due to capacity constraints following the recall of Protein PLUS drink in June 2016 as well as declines in carrot and softness in Garden Fresh Gourmet, partly offset by gains in refrigerated soups. Lower carrot sales reflect the market share impact of quality and execution issues from last fiscal year. 
Operating earnings declined by $17 million to $1 million, reflecting higher carrot costs, which were associated with lower volumes and improved quality, the cost impact of lower beverage operating efficiencies and the impact of lower sales. As we've previously stated, we expect a return to growth in C-Fresh starting in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Cash flow from operations was $221 million, $23 million lower than the prior year. The decline reflects lower cash earnings and higher working capital requirement. Capital expenditures declined $23 million to $48 million. We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2017. We paid dividends totaling $100 million, reflecting a quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In September, we announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.35 per share, which, from a cash flow perspective, will be reflected in the second quarter. 
In aggregate, we repurchased $112 million of shares, $100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program, as we've increased our level of share repurchases. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt declined by $522 million compared to year-ago level as cash from operations over the last 4 quarters was well in excess of capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. 
Now I'll review our 2017 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we announced in September. The company expects sales to grow by 0% to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 1% to 4% and adjusted EPS to grow by 2% to 5% or $3 to $3.09 per share. This guidance assumes, based on current exchange rates, that the impact from currency translation will be nominal. We expect gross margin to improve slightly for the year. While inflation on core ingredients and packaging has moderated, we expect inflation and cost of products sold of approximately 2%. 
On our cost savings program, we are ahead of our expectations, having generated $35 million in the first quarter against our full year estimate of $50 million. It's early in the year, so before making any changes to the savings estimate or full year guidance, we'd like to see how our cost savings develop in the second quarter, assess the performance of the business, especially C-Fresh, and evaluate potential reinvestment opportunities. Our EPS guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, which includes the change in  accounting and from the favorable impact of anticipated share repurchases over the course of the year. 
That concludes my remarks. And now I'll turn it back to Ken for Q&A."

Of the $35 million, the majority of those cost savings in Q1 were within the supply chain. Therefore, they're on the cost of products sold line. And the balance, I would say, is primarily within administrative expenses. We are certainly pleased with the gross margin performance in the quarter. We're a little bit ahead of our expectations. And there's a couple of things we see unfolding in the balance of the year. We are benefiting on our core ingredients and packaging items, a little bit of deflation in the first quarter, and we see that swing to more neutral to slightly positive in the back half. And the categories to think about are -- there's primarily 3 big ones. One is steel can. The other is dairy products. We're currently wrapping the impact of avian flu and wheat prices, which are currently in deflation and we expect that to also to be more neutral. So we see a little bit of a swing front half to back half. The other thing we anticipate, as we unfold some of our real food investments, we are removing artificial colors and ingredients. We are removing BPA from our can liners. And those costs are going to accelerate as we go through the second half of the year relative to the first half. So we see a couple of headwinds ahead. Again, we feel good about our first quarter. We'll see how the second quarter unfolds and make an assessment then."

Inventory this quarter was very comparable to year ago. And although retailers are still paid on inventory, it wasn't a meaningful or material shift. So I think the main issues with U.S. soup are we saw a Chunky rebound, particularly towards the latter part of the quarter against the marketing effort. We've been able to hold our price realization on Chunky. And again, we're cycling some poor execution issues in the prior year. So we're very happy to see the response of Chunky.

We took a very robust price realization, which has -- the good news is it has stuck. And -- but we did do that and that cost us some volume. We thought that was really necessary for the price spectrum of soup from value to premium that we are providing now to the consumer. And we didn't advertise Chunky. We literally did not have a consumer advertising campaign. We have remedied that this year. And that's why I believe that if we can continue to keep the stability on condensed soup, continue to grow broth and have a good come back on RTS with Chunky and new Well Yes!, I believe that is a stronger plan going forward."

I mean, as you've seen, the primary contributor to gross margin expansion came out of our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment, and it's driven by a couple of things. One is our supply chain is just running really well, and that is definitely sustainable. There's no reason that should fall back as we go throughout the year here. They're also added a gate pretty well on productivity improvement. So let me give you a couple of examples. We recently expanded one of our warehouses at our major thermal plant, so we've brought in some of the storage that was on third-party sites, so that saved us some money. We've added capacity in product lines like our Prego white sauce, additional capacity in aseptic broth, so we've repatriated some cold pack volume on those 2 products. And that, obviously, is sustainable. So I think the things that are generating the savings in the first quarter are definitely sustainable. The things that we see kind of moving against us as we look ahead: one is on cost inflation. We are, particularly within Americas, benefiting from some deflation in a couple of key categories, things like steel can and dairy, which I don't think is sustainable. And based on our forecast, that's going to move from more deflation to more, I say, flattish in the back half. And the third thing, which I mentioned earlier, we are making investments in the cost line against our real food initiatives, the cost of removing artificial colors and ingredients, cost associated with moving BPA from our can liners. That's going hit more as we progress throughout the year. So again, I think the supply chain is running well, and we've got a couple of things that are going to turn a little bit as we go through the year."

So I guess my -- as you look at manufacturing centers, so if you look at ready-to-serve going forward, which strikes me the big risk here is only really that it loses shelf space with the retailers because it must be -- I mean, there must be some pretty good momentum in Chunky as you are presumably putting more resources behind us. And so my questions would be, are retailers recognizing the difference? Are they aware of this change in relative sort of commitment to this category? I know you've gotten net price realization there.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today, I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. As many of you are aware, the consumer environment continues to be challenging i",1806,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today, I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. 
As many of you are aware, the consumer environment continues to be challenging in many of the markets where we have operations. In the U.S., consumer spending remains cautious. Shoppers are making more frequent trips than a year ago but they're purchasing less per trip. As a result, consumer takeaway of total food and beverage has softened compared to both short- and longer-term comparisons. This has exerted top line pressure on both retailers and manufacturers. In other parts of the world, economic conditions remain volatile. 
In the third quarter, our organic sales declined 2%, which was below our expectations. Key factors that led to the decline include softer-than-expected soup category performance, weakness in V8 beverages and product shortages in our Bolthouse Farms carrot business. 
I continue to be pleased with our adjusted gross margin expansion, driven by supply chain productivity programs despite the negative impact of the weather on our Bolthouse Farms carrot business. Both our sales and the cost of carrots were adversely impacted by the poor growing conditions in California. Cold rainy weather from mid-December through mid-March reduced carrot yields across the industry. The decreased crop yield had a significant impact on our gross margin performance in the quarter. Both Anthony and I will discuss this later in the call. 
Third quarter adjusted EBIT declined, but was better than we expected, reflecting improved gross margin performance. The decline in adjusted EBIT was due to higher levels of planned spending including the increased marketing investments as well as higher incentive compensation costs and investments in long-term innovation. We expected that our adjusted EBIT performance would taper in the second half as we realize the benefits of our cost savings earlier, cycled improved gross margin from a year ago and implemented our plans to increase marketing investment in the second half. 
Now let me share my view on our segment performance for the quarter. Let's start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. Organic sales declined by 2% in the quarter predominantly driven by U.S. Soup and V8 beverages. Our ready-to-serve soup business was challenged by a number of the same factors we discussed last quarter: the mild winter weather, which affected the entire category, the volume impact of our pricing actions and marketing execution on the Chunky brand. We're realistic about these issues and have plans to address those things within our control for the next soup season, namely, we intend to do a better job of driving demand particularly for Chunky ready-to-serve soups. We'll have a more robust marketing plan that fully leverages our NFL sponsorship. We also recognize that we need to bring more excitement to the category and we have new on-trend product innovations planned for fiscal 2017. We'll discuss these plans in greater detail at our Investor Day in July. 
There were several bright spots within Soup and Simple Meals. Sales of Swanson broth, Slow Kettle and Campbell's Organic soup all grew. Also, Campbell's condensed soup gained share. 
Beyond soup, Prego continues to perform well, driven by strong merchandising and growth in white sauces. We also began shipping Prego Farmers' Market, our new premium Italian sauce with a clean label. Additionally, we drove double-digit sales gains in Plum. 
V8 beverages continued to struggle with sales declines in V8 Red, V-Fusion and V8 Splash. There was, however, some good news, particularly in the performance of V8 Veggie Blends and V8 +Energy. 
In the short term, we've taken steps to address the performance of V8 Red and have increased both TV and digital advertising specific to the V8 Red brand. In the past, we've had success with advertising that reminds consumers of the benefits of V8. We're also building on the successful launch of V8 Veggie Blends with new varieties and expanding our V8 +Energy carbonated beverages into the grocery channel. We recognize that these short-term actions are not the complete solution. That said, V8 is a great brand and we believe we have a solid platform to build upon going forward. We're in the process of finalizing our strategy and we'll discuss our longer-term plans to get this business back on track at Investor Day. 
Overall, we feel good about how the Americas division is performing against its portfolio role year-to-date especially its continued margin expansion. Clearly, we have some work to do in several key categories to generate demand for our products. We get it and we're on it.
Turning to Global Biscuits and Snacks. This division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses, and its portfolio role is to manage growth while improving margins in both developed and developing markets. Pepperidge Farm delivered modest sales growth while we experienced some challenges in our Australia and China businesses. The 2 main drivers of the sales decline were Kelsen in China and Arnott's sweet biscuits in and Australia. 
First, China. Despite strong merchandising support and our improved marketing efforts heading into Chinese New Year's, sales were below expectations. We experienced short-term distribution challenges and faced strong competitive activity. Let me explain. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we made changes to our business model, adding salespeople and changing distributors. This new go-to-market model is designed to improve execution while enabling us increase distribution into multiple cities in China over time. However, our new distribution system did not have the same reach as in the past. In spite of the challenges we faced, Kelsen consumer takeaway and share increased in our priority markets. Going forward, we'll need to supplement and expand our distributor network to increase our geographic reach. We're confident that we'll get there and continue to believe in the long-term prospects for Kelsen in this important market. 
In Asia Pacific, excluding currency, sales of Arnott?s biscuits were comparable to the prior year with growth in Indonesia offset by declines in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, we faced competitive pressure in the sweet biscuit category and experienced lower consumer takeaway on special varieties of Arnott's Tim Tam biscuits, which had a negative impact on sales. On the plus side, our savoury biscuit business performed well and we're encouraged by the launch of our new and improved Arnott's Shapes crackers. 
While small, our developing markets in Southeast Asia performed well. Excluding the impact of currency, we grew sales in both Indonesia and Malaysia double digits. As expected, the economic situation in Indonesia started to improve in the quarter. 
Turning to North America. Pepperidge Farm cookies and crackers continued to perform well, driven mainly by Goldfish crackers. Sales declined slightly in our fresh bakery business as we faced increased competition in the quarter. 
Moving on to Campbell Fresh. C-Fresh is anchored by Bolthouse Farms and also includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and our refrigerated soup business. This division's portfolio role is to accelerate sales growth and expand into new Packaged Fresh categories. The CPG portion of this business is the full force growth engine of the division. Reported segment sales increased 6% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales declined 4%. In the quarter, Bolthouse Farms was a tale of 2 cities. Solid performance in our CPG premium juice and salad dressing business was more than offset by significant declines in our farm business, which consists of carrots and carrot ingredients. 
As I mentioned earlier, the carrot supply across the industry was negatively impacted by the adverse weather in California. This led to product shortages and product allocation to customers as we were unable to meet market demand. As a result, our carrot sales were down double digits in the quarter. This weather pattern is irregular. As we looked back, the Bolthouse Farms carrot business experienced similar weather conditions in the winter of 2010 to 2011. Since then, we've significantly diversified our winter crop into multiple growing regions in California, Arizona and Georgia. Today, we're much better equipped to respond and have reduced our recovery time. We're currently back in full supply with customers and don't anticipate any material sales impact going forward as we're now in the prime growing season in California. 
Turning to the CPG side of Bolthouse Farms. We're pleased with the 8% sales growth we delivered in the quarter. As expected, this growth was driven by distribution gains and our spring innovation. We added 14 new items across ultra- and super-premium beverages as well as salad dressings, which increased double digits. 
We're also pleased with the performance of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, our Ultra-Premium Cold-Pressed Organic juice line. We achieved 50% ACV in less than 12 months enabled by our investment in expanded capacity. Due to the success of our spring innovation sell-in, we're well positioned for the fourth quarter and as we look ahead to fiscal 2017. 
A quick word on our Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition. From an integration standpoint, we continue to make progress on bringing the business into the Bolthouse Farms operations platform and we've expanded fresh salsa distribution. We remain very optimistic about the potential of this brand. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to share my thoughts on our year-to-date performance. Year-to-date, organic sales are down slightly, 1%, in what continues to be a very challenging consumer environment. We're clear-eyed about the factors impacting our top line and the actions we need to take to address them. We can and we must do better on driving profitable net sales growth. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and next fiscal year, we expect to grow organic sales. Our year-to-date adjusted EBIT increase of plus 15% reflects our improved gross margin performance and the benefits of our $300 million cost savings initiatives including our move to zero-based budgeting. As we focus on finishing the fiscal year, I feel good about the progress we're making, how we've performed year-to-date and our outlook for the full year. This is reflected in our updated guidance, which Anthony will discuss shortly. 
We've made many important changes to Campbell, completely redesigning our organization, setting up the company by category versus geography and assigning each division a clear portfolio role. We continue to remain focused on strengthening our core business and expanding into faster-growing spaces as we unleash the power of our purpose: real food that matters for life's moments. 
Overall, we're now better positioned to execute our strategies, invest in the areas of our business that hold the greatest profitable growth potential and increase shareholder value. We're proud of the progress we've made, but we know we have more to do. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."
258458,290972500,1933425,"Campbell Soup Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 20, 2016",2016-05-20,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the third quarter. Organic sales in the quarter were below our expectations, reflecting softness in U.S. soup, V8 beverages and the weather-related c",1579,"Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the third quarter. Organic sales in the quarter were below our expectations, reflecting softness in U.S. soup, V8 beverages and the weather-related crop yield issue, which negatively impacted our carrot sales and earnings. 
We continued to make progress on adjusted gross margin. It improved by 40 basis points, better than expected, benefiting from our supply chain performance and moderating cost inflation despite the weather-related yield issue on carrots. The carrot issued negatively impacted sales by approximately $14 million and our adjusted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points or $0.02 per share. 
We continue to make good progress on our cost savings initiative, which delivered approximately $30 million of savings in the third quarter, with these savings impacting multiple P&L lines, bringing the year-to-date total to $110 million. Program to date, we are now at $195 million in cost savings. 
With one quarter to go, we are updating our guidance. We are holding the sales range, narrowing the adjusted EBIT range and raising the adjusted EPS range to reflect our current outlook for adjusted EBIT and a lower adjusted tax rate. 
Now I'll take you through the detailed results and guidance. For the third quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 2% to $1.87 billion. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales also declined 2% driven by lower volume. Net price realization was comparable to the prior year with higher selling prices offset by increased trade promotions. Adjusted EBIT decreased 5% to $312 million, reflecting higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses, higher administrative expenses and lower volumes partly offset by a higher gross margin percentage. Adjusted EPS decreased 2% to $0.65. 
For the 9-month period, net sales on an as-reported basis were down 2% while organic sales decreased 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT of $1,214,000,000 and adjusted EPS of $2.48 both increased by 15%. Year-to-date earnings growth is being driven by our improved gross margin performance and benefits from our cost savings initiatives. 
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Reported net sales and organic sales both declined 2% as the 1-point negative impact of currency translation was offset by the 1-point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. Within organic sales, volume and mix subtracted 2 points, which was primarily driven by declines in V8 beverages and soup within the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment as well as the lost carrot sales in Campbell Fresh. Higher selling prices contributed 1 point of sales growth while higher promotional spending subtracted 1 point. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 40 basis points to 37% exceeding our expectations on overall supply chain performance despite the weather-related carrot issue. Cost inflation and other factors had a negative margin impact of 1.6 points, driven primarily by cost inflation, which, as a rate, increased by approximately 1% and the increase in carrot cost previously discussed. In aggregate, our net price realization reduced adjusted gross margin by 20 basis points as higher promotional spending in the quarter to support U.S. Soup, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Bolthouse Farms beverages was mostly offset by list pricing actions previously taken across several businesses. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 10 basis points. Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our 3-year cost savings program, contributed 210 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. 
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 5% in the quarter primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expense. Advertising and consumer promotion expense increased 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by increases in Pepperidge Farm and V8 beverages. 
Adjusted administrative expenses increased 4% primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, inflation, increased costs to support long-term innovation and the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet partly offset by the benefits from cost savings initiatives. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. As you can see, adjusted EPS decreased $0.01 compared with the prior year from $0.66 to $0.65 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, declines in adjusted EBIT had a $0.03 a negative impact on EPS. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly, but had no impact on EPS for the quarter. And net interest expense was comparable to prior year levels. 
Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 28.5%, down 3.1 points versus the prior year primarily due to lower-than-expected taxes on foreign earnings partly offset by the geographic mix of our earnings with a higher proportion of income in the U.S. The lower tax rate benefited EPS by $0.03. 
Currency had a $0.01 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.65 per share. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 2% to $999 million driven by declines in soup and V8 beverages partly offset by gains in Prego pasta sauces and Plum products. Operating earnings increased 1% reflecting a higher gross margin percentage driven by productivity improvement partly offset by lower volumes and increased advertising expenses. 
In total, U.S. soup sales declined 5% driven by category declines, which, as Denise mentioned, were primarily impacted by warmer weather compared to the year ago quarter, the impact from our pricing actions and marketing execution issues on Chunky. Although our pricing actions had a negative impact on volumes, they have contributed to improved profitability. Within U.S. soup, RTS declined 13% and condensed declined 4% partly offset by a 10% gain in Swanson broth. Estimated changes in retailer inventory levels did not meaningfully impact sales in the quarter. As we previously stated, we will not be providing this subcategory sales performance beyond this fiscal year. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending May 1, 2016, the category as a whole declined 2.4%. Our sales in measured channels declined 3.5% with weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decline of 70 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 29%, up 50 basis points reflecting share gains by smaller brands. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales decreased 1% with declines in Kelsen partly offset by gains in Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers and soups and beverages in Australia. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales from Arnott?s biscuits were comparable to the prior year with gains in Indonesia offset by declines in sweet biscuit varieties in Australia. Operating earnings decreased 8% primarily driven by higher incentive compensation costs and the negative impact of currency translation. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales decreased 4% with declines in carrot partly offset by gains in Bolthouse Farms premium, refrigerated beverages and salad dressings. Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 10 points of sales growth to the segment. Operating earnings declined 28% driven by the higher carrot costs. Excluding the negative impact from the carrot issue and the acquisition, operating earnings for C-Fresh in the quarter would have increased significantly compared to the prior year. Despite the negative impacts in the quarter, year-to-date operating margins in C-Fresh have increased by 1 percentage point. 
We had strong cash flow performance for the first 9 months. Cash from operations increased by $212 million to $1,183,000,000 driven by higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements especially in the area of inventory. 
Capital expenditures decreased $17 million to $225 million. 
We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2016. 
We paid dividends totaling $294 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. 
In aggregate, we repurchased $118 million of shares in the first 9 months, $75 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt declined by approximately $250 million as positive net cash flow generated by the business more than offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Now I'll review our 2016 outlook. Our sales guidance remains unchanged at minus 1% to 0% including a 1-point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet and a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. We're narrowing the range for adjusted EBIT, which we now expect to grow 11% to 13%. The year-over-year growth reflects the benefit of improved gross margin performance and the benefits from our cost savings initiative. We expect adjusted gross margin for the year to expand by approximately 175 to 200 basis points. We're increasing the adjusted EPS growth range to 11% to 13% or $2.93 to $3 per share, in line with EBIT growth. Reflecting lower taxes on foreign earnings, we now expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 32%. Against our cost savings program, and consistent with our prior forecast, we expect to deliver incremental savings in the range of $120 million to $140 million in 2016. Our 2018 annual savings target remains unchanged at $300 million. 
That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

So is it right to think, kind of going forward, that like the bulk of the '17 savings should get reinvested back into the business, Denise? And this would, number one, give you the fuel to reinvigorate the top line; and then, number two, it would just kind of marry up to that big picture comment about 50% reinvestment?

A lot of the money is going to make sure that we have support of our key brands in line with the portfolio roles in each division. One thing that is new is we are channeling some of these dollars into longer-term innovation so that we make sure we have a robust pipeline in a state of readiness.

I talked about the sales decline being due to 3 factors: one being predominantly RTS soup, the second being V8 beverages, and the third, the unfortunate situation we had in carrots with the shortage of organic carrots. The investment that we made was on different things. So we invested A&C, advertising and consumer, in our Global Biscuits and Snacks business against Shapes in Australia, which worked; Tim Tams in Australia, which didn't work; and our cookies and bakery business in Goldfish and Pepperidge Farm, which did work. We invested advertising and consumer in V8, but we focused it on the Veggie Blends and that worked, but what we realized is that we had to put more emphasis going forward on V8 Red and we're course-correcting there. We also spent, predominantly, promotion spending on our Campbell Fresh new product launches and that is going incredibly well. And then, finally, we spent money against Prego and Simple Meals, which also had a very good quarter. So we do believe in the investment of A&C in this business. And with trade spending, it was up against the Arnott's business that I just talked about, Goldfish and C-Fresh new products.

We'll give more specific guidance when we get to our fourth quarter call. In terms of the implied range, it does obviously have a $0.07 delta in the fourth quarter. I think, for perspective and -- we've had a bit of challenge forecasting our year. As you know, we've taken the guidance up a couple of times already. We've just gone through massive change here at the company, probably the largest transformational change in the company's history in terms of reorganizing into 3 divisions, addressing spans and layers and a voluntary headcount reduction, involuntary headcount reduction, the adoption of zero-based budgeting and changing many of the policies we have at the company, changing our operating model and forming an Integrated Global Services function. And given the amount of change, it's just been really difficult or more difficult than usual to forecast, so we're just giving ourselves a little bit of a latitude here in the fourth quarter in terms of where we're going to come out. Some of the variability will likely be in gross margin. That 25 basis point range can take you from the top of the EPS rates to the bottom. Cost savings could be a little bit variable.

Is that something you're trying to work against here in the short run and we could see some improvement in early next soup season?"

But these -- the good news is that these are all execution issues within our control and we are actively addressing them.

So I guess, with that as the starting point, can you just give us an update on the scale of opportunities that you're thinking about, whether the focus is more on bolt-ons and higher growth adjacencies or whether you'd be open to larger, more transformational things that allow you to more aggressively use the balance sheet now that you've delevered a bit?"

Anything we do, obviously, needs to be strategically compelling and has to be financially attractive. And I'd say we're open to both, both the idea of smaller bolt-on acquisitions to build upon our platform, for example, in Campbell Fresh or to expand geographically in Biscuits and Snacks. The overall list is relatively short. We continue to work it and develop relationships with companies around the world. And in the U.S., on the other hand, we do have the financial flexibility to do something a bit larger. So I think it depends more on the attractiveness of the opportunity, first and foremost, on the strategic and a financial perspective, and again, open to varying sizes."

If you go over the past 2 years, it looks like pricing is up about 2.5 points while volume is down about 7.5, that's just for this third quarter, just stack the past 2 years. And I'm wondering, I know costs are down a fair amount in that time and so I understand you've done a great job holding share in those categories, we're mainly talking soup here, but what role do you think higher pricing across the category is having in sort of hurting the volumes in soup? I mean I know you maybe had some weather, but on a 2-year basis, that's not really been the case, some weather this year. And going forward now, the costs are rising a little bit more. Is that going to change your philosophy in thinking about how you balance price and volume in America's Simple Meals?"

I'd say on the cost side, you said they're rising a little bit more. We're seeing moderating cost inflation at least in the back half of this year and probably into next year and that takes a little bit of pressure off the pricing algorithm. I mean, our objective is to expand gross margins through a combination of net pricing and productivity in excess of cost inflation. So as cost inflation moderates, that gives us a little more flexibility. There's no question that if you look back over the last couple of years, we have moved up some of our net pricing, both list and promoted, in an effort to improve the profitability of the soup business, and in fact, we've done that quite successfully. Now that does have a short-term impact on volume. Longer term, we like to think that the broad basket of things that'll drive consumer demand, things like product quality and innovation and robust marketing are all part of that algorithm to drive volume growth over the long term."
