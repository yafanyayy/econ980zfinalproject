As we shared a few weeks ago, fourth quarter results surpassed our expectations with revenue of $592 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year period and our 17th consecutive quarter of sequential growth. During the quarter, we witnessed robust trends across the business, including year-over-year total sequencing growth of 19% and 30% shipment growth to clinical and translational customers. Demand from clinical oncology customers are contributed to the strong Q4 result with approximately 40% growth compared to the prior year quarter. We're very pleased with the commercial uptake of the TST 15 product, and the TST 170 development program remains on track. These panels are based on initial standards defined by the Actionable Genome Consortium and were developed to drive adoption of NGS in the transitional market and biopharma partners in their clinical trials. 
Encouragingly, we recently announced that Amgen will be utilizing the IUO version of TST 15 as part of a new oncology development program, and we're in discussions with other potential pharma partners as well. 
In early January, we formed GRAIL, a new company focused on the cancer screening market. We're currently working to transfer our ctDNA programs, the MSK partnership and the employees working on these projects to GRAIL. We're in the late stages of recruiting a CEO and have identified a potential lab and office space in the Bay Area. We've begun work on the detailed planning necessary to embark on a large-scale clinical trial in 2017 with the goal of demonstrating a stage shift in diagnosis. 
In our Reproductive and Genetic Health business, we saw strong adoption of both our IVF and NIPT products in the fourth quarter. Sales of our preimplantation genetic screening, or PGS products, increased close to 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Further, we completed enrollment in the STAR trial ahead of schedule, which will measure the impact of PGS in embryo morphology on IVF success rates. 
NIPT revenue grew more than 50% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Test send-out volumes were slightly lower sequentially at 45,000 as one of our large customers began to shift testing in-house. This transition will decrease service revenue and increase product sales in the coming quarters. Partially offsetting this impact will be continued penetration of the average risk opportunity. Currently, we estimate more than 70 million lives or 25% of the U.S. population has coverage with Anthem and regional Blue Cross Blue Shield carriers who've made a favorable coverage decision for average risk. 
Moving to arrays. Shipments grew 1% versus the fourth quarter of last year, and revenue was down 2% with ASP sequentially stable for the second quarter in a row. With strong demand from agriculture, DGC and biobanking customers as well as the launch of our new arrays methyl epic in the immuno array, we shipped 1.6 million samples during Q4, a new record. 
We protect slight array growth in 2016, supported by the entering backlog and the availability of Infinium XT later this year. 
In summary, the momentum in the fourth quarter was largely driven by the continued penetration of clinical genomics in the oncology and reproductive health markets. This trend, together with our strategic investments in market and platform development, will enable us to deliver on our mission to unlock the power of the genome and further penetrate the many large and untapped opportunities ahead of us. 
Lastly, as you may have read in our 8-K yesterday, Dr. William stepped off the Illumina board in order to invest and serve as a board member of GRAIL. I would like to thank Bill for his enormous contributions during his 17 years as a board member and 11 years as Chairman. 
I'll now turn the call over to Francis, who will provide a detailed overview of our product results."

I'm pleased to provide further details on the performance of our products in the fourth quarter. To begin, interest in the HiSeq high-throughput portfolio remain strong, with HiSeq 2500 and 4000 orders both exceeding our expectations. Versus the prior year, shipments were lower due to challenging comparisons on HiSeq X and HiSeq 2500. Demand for HiSeq X was generated from customers adding capacity as well as new X sites, which totaled 27 at the end of the fourth quarter. While orders are expected to be relatively steady in the 20 to 30 per quarter range, shipments depend on customer readiness, which we expect will result in fewer than 20 shipments in Q1. 
Demand for HiSeq 2500 exceeded expectations in Q4 due to commercial customers who validated workflows who value their rapid run mode this product offers. During the quarter, we received a multi-unit order from an NIPT customer as well as orders from commercial customers looking to add throughput to their laboratories. HiSeq 4000 also benefited from capacity additions, including multiple unit orders from HiSeq X customers looking to expand the application breadth of their respective fleets. HiSeq 4000, again, was the leading platform sold, which lifted ASPs for the family of instruments compared to the prior year. 
Moving to our benchtop instruments. We saw a rebound in demand in the fourth quarter as MiSeq orders approached record levels and NextSeq orders was the highest in any quarter since launch. These order trends was the result of delivering on the strong pipeline we saw exiting Q3. Heading into 2016, our MiSeq and NextSeq pipelines remain stable, but at a more normalized level than seen entering the fourth quarter. 
Clinical and translational centers drove demand for NextSeq instruments, accounting for more than 40% of orders. Continued interest came from our NIPT partners in China, reproductive health customers focused on PGS and NIPT and oncology customers. New to sequencing customers accounted for approximately 55% of MiSeq orders in the fourth quarter, with our new-to-NGS bundle contributing to this dynamic. 
MiSeqDx orders were also at record levels in the quarter, and we recently submitted our registration document for IVD designation on MiSeq in Korea. We're continuing to work closely with the FDA to update the intended use of the MiSeqDx to include a claim for DNA isolated from multiple sample types. Both of these activities will further support the global demand for DX units. 
Moving out to our newest bench top instruments, I'd like to share some customer feedback on MiniSeq. Approximately 4,600 attendees have signed up for our webinars to learn more about MiniSeq, our largest-ever registration for a new product. Early customer feedback indicates only a slight overlap with MiSeq and as a result, we expect minimal cannibalization in the range of 20% to 25%. In addition, we believe many of the customers who choose MiniSeq over MiSeq will opt for multiple units to optimize the throughput and sample flexibility of their fleets. With these early indicators of demand, we're pleased with how the pipeline for MiniSeq is building and expect its customer-friendly features to further democratize sequencing. 
In informatics, we continue to increase the level of integration with BaseSpace. We have completed the planning and design of the clarity LIMS BaseSpace integration, which we intend to release towards the end of Q1. We believe this will enable better visibility on lab metrics and shorten turnaround time for our customers. BaseSpace now includes more than 70 apps as well as an upgraded dashboard and an analysis manager to improve monitoring and control of reports. These enhancements, combined with the introduction of the BaseSpace Professional and Enterprise Editions, will enable researchers to enrich their informatics experience, while improving efficiency in sequencing labs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our fourth quarter results."

Revenue for the year grew 19% versus the prior year to $2.22 billion, which equates to 23% on a constant-currency basis. Fourth quarter revenue was slightly better than our pre-announcement at $592 million, 15% growth versus the prior year period and 19% constant currency adjusted. The strong quarterly results can be attributed to better-than-forecasted demand for a benchtop instruments as well as strength in sequencing consumables and services. 
Shipments in the Americas grew 25% year-over-year in Q4, while European and APAC shipments increased 5% and 10%, respectively, over the same period. Growth in our international regions was slightly muted due to the impact of currency. Further, Europe faced a challenging HiSeq X comparison, while the Asia Pacific region continued to experience weakness in the Japanese funding environment. Consumable revenue was $346 million, an increase of 19% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as higher demand for sequencing consumables including record IV prep shipments was partially offset by a slight decline in arrays. Consumable revenue represented 59% of total revenue, up from 57% in the prior year period and the 58% we saw in Q3. 
As we previously shared, sequencing consumable revenue was robust, growing to approximately $280 million, up close to 30% over the prior year. This result was driven by our growing installed base of instruments and strength in NextSeq consumables, which saw utilization well above our updated guidance range of 100k to 125k per instrument annually. This is the first quarter the NextSeq has exceeded our range, so we are not updating our utilization guidance at this time. 
MiSeq utilization was in our projected range of 40k to 45k, and HiSeq per instrument excluding HiSeq X was in our projected range of 300k to 350k. HiSeq X utilization fell short of our recently increased pull-through guidance range due to order timing. We continue to predict HiSeq X utilization of 650k to 700k per instrument over the course of 2016. However, the timing of a single order of [indiscernible] would be sufficient to move pull-through outside of our projected range in any quarter given the size of our installed base. 
Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts, grew approximately 50% versus Q4 2014 to $94 million. This improvement was driven by growth in NIPT services, which benefited from increased test send-out revenue fees, extended maintenance contracts associated with a larger sequencing installed base and genotyping services.
Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude noncash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today's earnings release.
Results and projections include Helix and projections also include our GRAIL business. Accordingly, all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refers to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders after noncontrolling interest.
Our adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 71.7%, a decline compared to 73.2% in the third quarter, primarily due to the lower mix of sequencing consumables and a higher mix of arrays and services. Year-over-year, adjusted gross margins contracted 60 basis points due to a higher mix of services revenue. Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $103 million or 17.5% of revenue, higher compared to $90 million or 16.4% of revenue in the third quarter due to the impact of additional headcount and spending associated with the launch of MiniSeq, Project Firefly and clinical trials.
Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $124 million or 20.9% of revenue, an increase compared to $115 million or 20.9% of revenue in the previous quarter due to the impact of additional headcount. Adjusted operating margins were 33.4% compared to 36% in the third quarter and 37.7% in the prior year period due to the impact of lower gross margin, higher headcount and previously mentioned investments. 
In the fourth quarter, our stock-based compensation expense equaled $35 million, better than projected to primarily to cancellations associated with the management changes that we announced in December. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 26.5% compared to 16.2% in the fourth quarter of last year, higher than expected due to a one-time intl restructuring charge. As a reminder, Q4 '14 was impacted by favorable adjustments related to multiple prior year provisions and higher-than-expected stock deductions. Non-GAAP net income was $121 million for Q4, resulting in non-GAAP EPSS of $0.81. This compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $129 million and $0.87, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Included in the Q4 '15 non-GAAP EPS result is approximately $0.01 of dilution from Helix. in addition, the impact of foreign exchange lowered Q4 non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.05 relative to last year. We reported GAAP net income of $104 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter compared to net income of $153 million or $1.03 per diluted share in the prior year period, which reflected the gain associated with the settlement of the Syntrix litigation, partially offset by legal contingency costs related to the sequence patent agreement. Cash flow from operations equaled $240 million in the fourth quarter. Q4 DSO decreased to 64 days compared to 68 days last quarter due primarily to improved shipment linearity. Inventory increased to $271 million, largely due to a buildup of sequencing instruments and safety stock. Capital expenditures in Q4 were $35 million, resulting in $205 million of free cash flow. For the fiscal year, cash flow from operations equaled $660 million, and capital expenditures were $143 million, resulting in $517 million of free cash flow. 
During the quarter, $29 million of the 2016 0.25% convertible bonds were settled, leaving approximately $75 million remaining, which will come due in the first quarter. We repurchased over 1.3 million shares on an average price of $151.44 utilizing $202 million under our previously announced buyback program, leaving us with more than $255 million of authorization remaining under these programs. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.39 billion in cash and short-term investments. 
Moving now to guidance. As we shared a few weeks ago, we expect total company revenue growth of 16% in 2016 or 17% on a constant-currency basis based on today's rates. Underlying this guidance is an assumption that sequencing consumables will generate the vast majority of growth, while sequencing instruments for expected to be relatively flat versus the prior year, given the strong HiSeq X that option in Q1 '15, resulting in a challenging comparison. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $3.55 to $3.65 including the impact of $0.15 and $0.10 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix, respectively. Additionally, we project approximately 73% gross margin of full year pro forma tax rate of 26% and full year weighted average non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding of $149 million. We expect a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest of approximately $30 million. 
Specific to the first quarter, we are projecting flat to slightly higher revenue sequentially as a result of the stronger-than-anticipated Q4 results. Additionally, operating expenses are projected to increase by approximately $20 million sequentially based on the ramping of investment at Helix and GRAIL as well as the additions from strong hiring momentum coming out of 2015. 
We're off to a good start in 2016 and believe that the important investments we are making in the business, including Helix and GRAIL, will catalyze significant long-term revenue growth for the company as we continue to drive the broad adoption of genomics.

So that was a pretty significant impact overall on the instrument number for the year was to make up of that backlog. So we don't have that situation coming into '16. MiniSeq, of course, is going to be a positive lift for the instrument line during the course of the year, partially offset by some cannibalization across the MiSeq part of the product line. But it's really overcoming that extra shipment we had in Q1 on a comparable basis from the HiSeq Xs that caused us to give guidance to relatively flat instruments for the year. With respect to the upgrade cycle, we think it's continuing from the 3000s and 4000s from the 2500. But we've been actually pleasantly surprised, I would say, by the fact that we continue to get more orders for 2500 than we expected. And that's largely because of the clinical customers that have the instrument validated in their workflows and from those customers liking the rapid run mode, which we don't currently have implemented in the 3000s and the 4000s."

And so for them, the MiniSeq is the perfect instrument. And in some cases, if they have even more budget they're more likely to get 2 MiniSeqs because of the flexibility that gives them in terms of managing samples and workflows. The -- if you have a larger volume of samples, then you tend to go to the MiSeq today. And so what we're seeing is either a lab that has more samples or clinical labs that value the DX designation of the MiSeq platform. And so that's sort of how it's breaking out. We had a thesis that the MiniSeq was going to open up a new segment for us and would not be largely cannibalistic. And based on the early feedback we're getting from the interest in the MiniSeq, that thesis seems to be true.

At the end of the day, the key considerations came down to the nature of the business itself.

One being very focused on a new market that being the consumer, and the second being a business that will very likely be a global services company. And neither of those are directly what Illumina does. So that was quite important. We thought both of these needed to operate in sort of the high-velocity startup mode. And we wanted to have the ability to recruit the best possible talents early on into these companies. And so we thought the best structure for that was to spin them out of the core Illumina, have a separate management team, separate board, but retain majority ownership so that Illumina, as these companies be a successful as we hope, will get the majority of the benefit from these. With respect to Helix, we at JPMorgan announced the second set of partners, so a total of 4 now announced. The 2 largest consumer companies so far have not been announced as joining Helix. It's certainly our ambitions to try to get them to join. But you can imagine as an incumbent in the space, there might be some initial reluctance to do that. So it's imperative for us to really build this ecosystem out and to demonstrate that we have the capability to deliver a better experience and better economics to the incumbents and what they do independent of Helix. We're working on a large number of other potential partnerships within Helix as well, and we're very active in recruiting a CEO and hope to get that done here in the next month or 2."

So there should be nothing incremental to what we've done in guidance. So the commercial team have been thinking about this for quite some time. We think it is largely opening up a new market segment. We need to become more efficient to sell systems effectively that are priced at $50,000 and ultimately below with Firefly. And so we're doing a tremendous amount of work in the commercial organization to sort of tune our organization, hire people that perhaps are earlier in their careers and at lower price points. We're working on our services model, and of course, it requires that these instruments be fundamentally more robust to reduce the amount of service and training that's required. So all that commercial work is going on now and is built into the guidance that you've seen. In terms of the addressable market, I think that the -- if you think about the 50,000 labs out there there's probably half of them would want to have a MiniSeq if they could. But the funding won't support that. So getting below the $50,000 price point, we think, opens up certainly the opportunity to get to many, many thousands of these instruments place.

And so the incremental brand-new customers naturally has to be created from scratch almost because they generally want somebody who already exist. The other thing to be a little bit cautious about is the fact that many of these customers are also going to want to run the full breadth of applications. So they maybe opting for 4000s rather than Xs. So that's another consideration in terms of calculating how many Xs we may place. There's a couple of other things that could happen, population sequencing projects. We're tracking these in other places like Australia, which is an interesting opportunity for a PopSeq project. China's announced that they're going to do some very large population programs. Specifics timing around that, but that could certainly be an upside to Xs as well.

Third thing I'd say is getting the clinical trial very well defined and getting it structured in a way that when we push the button, start collecting samples, we have the ability to do that and to do it at scale and that's going to require a lot of background work and potentially some partnerships that GRAIL will need to form to get large-scale sample access. All of those things we hope to finish in 2016 to be able to begin large-scale clinical trial work in 2017."

And so we'll be extending our inside sales capability to sell those products. In addition, we are looking to expand our ability to digitally get to those customers through expanding our e-commerce capability as well as being smarter about using our instruments to drive additional sales. And then we're also looking at target areas where we can add specialization by market into the sales force that will allow us to target some of the smaller labs that we haven't been able to get to get.

So we think that's in the earliest stages of adoption, and we'll get into the higher part of the growth curve during 2016 and 2017. We're waiting for the inflection point yet to happen in the oncology market. And as I said, we're seeing good uptake of TST 15. I think we need to really define what the regulated and reimburse strategy is going to be in the oncology market after we get this next round of guidance from the FDA. And once we get back to, I think it will help us clarify what kinds of products we want to push through the FDA and actually get approved. And that, I think, puts a serious infection in the curve if we can figure how to do that efficiently in ways where the time it takes to get approval doesn't mean that the product you ultimately get approved is obsolete by the time it gets there. And so those are the key issues. But the oncology market is still very, very, very early.

In China, their research markets have been a bit challenging over the past year or 2 in terms of overall funding. But having said that, we have a couple of unique vectors into the Chinese market, one being the X systems. There's sort of disproportionate number of HiSeq X's in China, which gives us good reagent pull-through and incremental potential sales into those customers. And our NextSeq sales are there. They are good because of our NIPT business. So the downward pressure perhaps is the overall health of the research, funding environment but NextSeq's and Xs are the strong uplift. Europe's been pretty steady in Q3, we talked about the fact that we had some business that we think got pushed out to Q4. And you saw that we had very strong adults in Europe in Q4. So I think we recovered that business in more normalized the pipeline we exceeded Q3. We talked about a strong desktop pipeline that didn't quite make it over into Q3 revenue.

As we shared a few weeks ago, fourth quarter results surpassed our expectations with revenue of $592 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year period and our 17th consecutive quarter of sequential growth. During the quarter, we witnessed robust trends across the business, including year-over-year total sequencing growth of 19% and 30% shipment growth to clinical and translational customers. Demand from clinical oncology customers contributed to the strong Q4 result with approximately 40% growth compared to the prior year quarter. 
We're very pleased with the commercial uptake of the TST 15 product, and the TST 170 development program remains on track. These panels are based on initial standards defined by the Actionable Genome Consortium and were developed to drive adoption of NGS in the transitional market and by pharma partners in their clinical trials. Encouragingly, we recently announced that Amgen will be utilizing the IUO version of TST 15 as part of a new oncology development program, and we're in discussions with other potential pharma partners as well.

We're currently working to transfer our ctDNA programs, the MSK partnership and the employees working on these projects to GRAIL. We're in the late stages of recruiting a CEO and have identified a potential lab and office space in the Bay Area. We've begun work on the detailed planning necessary to embark on a large-scale clinical trial in 2017 with the goal of demonstrating a stage shift in diagnosis. 
In our Reproductive and Genetic Health business, we saw strong adoption of both our IVF and NIPT products in the fourth quarter. Sales of our preimplantation genetic screening, or PGS products, increased close to 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Further, we completed enrollment in the STAR trial ahead of schedule, which will measure the impact of PGS and embryo morphology on IVF success rates. 
NIPT revenue grew more than 50% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Test send-out volumes were slightly lower sequentially at 45,000 as one of our large customers began to shift testing in-house. This transition will decrease service revenue and increase product sales in the coming quarters. Partially offsetting this impact will be continued penetration of the average risk opportunity. Currently, we estimate more than 70 million lives or 25% of the U.S. population has coverage with Anthem and regional Blue Cross Blue Shield carriers who've made a favorable coverage decision for average risk. 
Moving to arrays. Shipments grew 1% versus the fourth quarter of last year, and revenue was down 2% with ASP sequentially stable for the second quarter in a row. With strong demand from agriculture, DTC and biobanking customers as well as the launch of our new arrays methyl EPIC and ImmunoArray, we shipped 1.6 million samples during Q4, a new record. We project slight array growth in 2016, supported by the entering backlog and the availability of Infinium XT later this year. 
In summary, the momentum in the fourth quarter was largely driven by the continued penetration of clinical genomics in the oncology and reproductive health markets. This trend, together with our strategic investments in market and platform development, will enable us to deliver on our mission to unlock the power of the genome and further penetrate the many large and untapped opportunities ahead of us. 
Lastly, as you may have read in our 8-K yesterday, Dr. William Rastetter stepped off the Illumina Board in order to invest and serve as a board member of GRAIL. I would like to thank Bill for his enormous contributions during his 17 years as a board member and 11 years as Chairman. 
I'll now turn the call over to Francis, who will provide a detailed overview of our product results."

I'm pleased to provide further details on the performance of our products in the fourth quarter. To begin, interest in the HiSeq high-throughput portfolio remained strong with HiSeq 2500 and 4000 orders both exceeding our expectations. Versus the prior year, shipments were lower due to challenging comparisons on HiSeq X and HiSeq 2500. Demand for HiSeq X was generated from customers adding capacity as well as new X sites, which totaled 27 at the end of the fourth quarter. While orders are expected to be relatively steady in the 20 to 30 per quarter range, shipments depend on customer readiness, which we expect will result in fewer than 20 shipments in Q1. 
Demand for HiSeq 2500 exceeded expectations in Q4 due to commercial customers with validated workflows who value the rapid run mode this product offers. During the quarter, we received a multi-unit order from an NIPT customer as well as orders from commercial customers looking to add throughput to their laboratories. HiSeq 4000 also benefited from capacity additions, including multiple-unit orders from HiSeq X customers looking to expand the application breadth of their respective fleets. HiSeq 4000 again was the leading platform sold, which lifted ASPs for the family of instruments compared to the prior year. 
Moving to our benchtop instruments. We saw a rebound in demand in the fourth quarter as MiSeq orders approached record levels and NextSeq orders were the highest in any quarter since launch. These order trends were the result of delivering on the strong pipeline we saw exiting Q3. Heading into 2016, our MiSeq and NextSeq pipelines remain stable but at a more normalized level than seen entering the fourth quarter. 
Clinical and translational centers drove demand for NextSeq instruments, accounting for more than 40% of orders. Continued interest came from our NIPT partners in China, reproductive health customers focused on PGS and NIPT and oncology customers. New-to-sequencing customers accounted for approximately 55% of MiSeq orders in the fourth quarter with our new-to-NGS bundle contributing to this dynamic. 
MiSeqDx orders were also at record levels in the quarter, and we recently submitted our registration document for IVD designation on MiSeq in Korea. We're continuing to work closely with the FDA to update the intended use of the MiSeqDx to include a claim for DNA isolated from multiple sample types. Both of these activities will further support the global demand for DX units. 
Moving now to our newest benchtop instruments, I'd like to share some customer feedback on MiniSeq. Approximately 4,600 attendees have signed up for our webinars to learn more about MiniSeq, our largest-ever registration for a new product. Early customer feedback indicates only a slight overlap with MiSeq. And as a result, we expect minimal cannibalization in the range of 20% to 25%. In addition, we believe many of the customers who choose MiniSeq over MiSeq will opt for multiple units to optimize the throughput and sample flexibility of their fleets. With these early indicators of demand, we're pleased with how the pipeline for MiniSeq is building and expect its customer-friendly features to further democratize sequencing. 
In informatics, we continued to increase the level of integration with BaseSpace. We have completed the planning and design of the Clarity LIMS BaseSpace integration, which we intend to release towards the end of Q1. We believe this will enable better visibility on lab metrics and shorten turnaround time for our customers. BaseSpace now includes more than 70 apps as well as an upgraded dashboard and analysis manager to improve monitoring and control of reports. These enhancements, combined with the introduction of the BaseSpace Professional and Enterprise Editions, will enable researchers to enrich their informatics experience while improving efficiency in sequencing labs.

Fourth quarter revenue was slightly better tha",1295,"Thanks, Francis. As we shared a few weeks ago, Q4 closed out a solid year for Illumina. Revenue for the year grew 19% versus the prior year to $2.22 billion, which equates to 23% on a constant currency basis. Fourth quarter revenue was slightly better than our pre-announcement at $592 million, 15% growth versus the prior year period and 19% constant currency adjusted. This strong quarterly results can be attributed to better-than-forecasted demand for benchtop instruments as well as strength in sequencing consumables and services. 
Shipments in the Americas grew 25% year-over-year in Q4, while European and APAC shipments increased 5% and 10%, respectively, over the same period. Growth in our international regions was slightly muted due to the impact of currency. Further, Europe faced a challenging HiSeq X comparison, while the Asia Pacific region continued to experience weakness in the Japanese funding environment. 
Consumable revenue was $346 million, an increase of 19% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as higher demand for sequencing consumables, including record library prep shipments, was partially offset by a slight decline in arrays. Consumable revenue represented 59% of total revenue, up from 57% in the prior year period and the 58% we saw in Q3. 
As we previously shared, sequencing consumable revenue was robust, growing to approximately $280 million, up close to 30% over the prior year. This result was driven by our growing installed base of instruments and strength in NextSeq consumables, which saw utilization well above our updated guidance range of $100,000 to $125,000 per instrument annually. This is the first quarter that NextSeq has exceeded our range, so we are not updating our utilization guidance at this time. 
MiSeq utilization was in our projected range of $40,000 to $45,000, and HiSeq pull-through per instrument, excluding HiSeq X, was in our projected range of $300,000 to $350,000. HiSeq X utilization fell short of our recently increased pull-through guidance range due to order timing. We continue to predict HiSeq X utilization of $650,000 to $700,000 per instrument over the course of 2016. However, the timing of a single order of formalin or more would be sufficient to move pull-through outside of our projected range in any quarter given the size of our installed base. 
Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts, grew approximately 50% versus Q4 2014 to $94 million. This improvement was driven by growth in NIPT services, which benefited from increased test send-out revenue IP fees, extended maintenance contracts associated with a larger sequencing installed base and genotyping services.
Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude noncash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today's earnings release.
Results and projections include Helix, and projections will now also include our GRAIL business. Accordingly, all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refers to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders after noncontrolling interests.
Our adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 71.7%, a decline compared to 73.2% in the third quarter primarily due to the lower mix of sequencing consumables and a higher mix of arrays and services. Year-over-year, adjusted gross margins contracted 60 basis points due to a higher mix of services revenue. 
Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $103 million or 17.5% of revenue, higher compared to $90 million or 16.4% of revenue in the third quarter due to the impact of additional headcount and spending associated with the launch of MiniSeq, Project Firefly and clinical trials.
Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $124 million or 20.9% of revenue, an increase compared to $115 million or 20.9% of revenue in the previous quarter due to the impact of additional headcount. 
Adjusted operating margins were 33.4% compared to 36% in the third quarter and 37.7% in the prior year period due to the impact of lower gross margin, higher headcount and previously mentioned investments. 
In the fourth quarter, our stock-based compensation expense equaled $35 million, better than projected due primarily to cancellations associated with the management changes that we announced in December. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 26.5% compared to 16.2% in the fourth quarter of last year, higher than expected due to a onetime international restructuring charge. As a reminder, Q4 '14 was impacted by favorable adjustments related to multiple prior year provisions and higher-than-expected stock deductions. 
Non-GAAP net income was $121 million for Q4, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.81. This compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $129 million and $0.87, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Included in the Q4 '15 non-GAAP EPS result is approximately $0.01 of dilution from Helix. In addition, the impact of foreign exchange lowered Q4 non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.05 relative to last year. 
We reported GAAP net income of $104 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter compared to net income of $153 million or $1.03 per diluted share in the prior year period, which reflected a gain associated with the settlement of the Syntrix litigation, partially offset by legal contingency costs related to the Sequenom patent pool agreement. 
Cash flow from operations equaled $240 million in the fourth quarter. 
Q4 DSO decreased to 64 days compared to 68 days last quarter due primarily to improved shipment linearity. 
Inventory increased to $271 million largely due to a buildup of sequencing instruments and safety stock. 
Capital expenditures in Q4 were $35 million, resulting in $205 million of free cash flow.  For the fiscal year, cash flow from operations equaled $660 million, and capital expenditures were $143 million, resulting in $517 million of free cash flow. 
During the quarter, $29 million of the 2016 0.25% convertible bonds were settled, leaving approximately $75 million remaining, which will come due in the first quarter. 
We repurchased over 1.3 million shares on an average price of $151.44, utilizing $202 million under our previously announced buyback program, leaving us with more than $255 million of authorization remaining under these programs. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.39 billion in cash and short-term investments. 
Moving now to guidance. As we shared a few weeks ago, we expect total company revenue growth of 16% in 2016 or 17% on a constant currency basis based on today's rates. Underlying this guidance is an assumption that sequencing consumables will generate the vast majority of growth, while sequencing instruments were expected to be relatively flat versus the prior year given the strong HiSeq X back -- adoption in Q1 '15, resulting in a challenging comparison. 
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $3.55 to $3.65, including the impact of $0.15 and $0.10 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix, respectively. Additionally, we project approximately 73% gross margin, a full year pro forma tax rate of 26% and full year weighted average non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding of 149 million. We expect a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest of approximately $30 million. 
Specific to the first quarter, we are projecting flat to slightly higher revenue sequentially as a result of the stronger-than-anticipated Q4 results. Additionally, operating expenses are projected to increase by approximately $20 million sequentially based on the ramping of investment in Helix and GRAIL as well as the [indiscernible] additions from strong hiring momentum coming out of 2015. 
We're off to a good start in 2016 and believe that the important investments we are making in the business, including Helix and GRAIL, will catalyze significant long-term revenue growth for the company as we continue to drive the broad adoption of genomics.

When we entered 2015, we saw -- had a very large backlog of HiSeq Xs, which we shipped largely out in the first quarter. So that was a pretty significant impact overall on the instrument number for the year was the makeup of that backlog. So we don't have that situation coming into '16. MiniSeq, of course, is going to be a positive lift for the instrument line during the course of the year, partially offset by some cannibalization across the MiSeq part of the product line. But it's really overcoming that extra shipment we had in Q1 on a comparable basis from the HiSeq Xs that caused us to give guidance to relatively flat instruments for the year. With respect to the upgrade cycle, we think it's continuing from the 3000s and 4000s from the 2500. But we've been actually pleasantly surprised, I would say, by the fact that we continue to get more orders for 2500s than we expected, and that's largely because of clinical customers that have the instrument validated in their workflows and from those customers liking the rapid run mode, which we don't currently have implemented in the 3000s and the 4000s."

You can imagine on both Helix and GRAIL, we had significant internal debate about what the right structure for these entities should be. At the end of the day, the key considerations came down to the nature of the business itself. And in the case of both Helix and GRAIL, those businesses are fundamentally different than Illumina's core business, one being very focused on a new market that being the consumer and the second being a business that will very likely be a global services company. And neither of those are directly what Illumina does. So that was quite important. We thought both of these needed to operate in sort of a high-velocity startup mode. And we wanted to have the ability to recruit the best possible talent early on into these companies. And so we thought the best structure for that was to spin them out of the core of Illumina, have a separate management team, separate board but retain majority ownership so that Illumina, as these companies be a successful as we hope, will get the majority of the benefit from these. With respect to Helix, we at JPMorgan announced the second set of partners, so a total of 4 now announced. The 2 largest consumer companies so far have not been announced as joining Helix. It's certainly our ambitions to try to get them to join. But you can imagine as an incumbent in the space, there might be some initial reluctance to do that. So it's imperative for us to really build this ecosystem out and to demonstrate that we have the capability to deliver a better experience and better economics to the incumbents and what they do independent of Helix. We're working on a large number of other potential partnerships within Helix as well, and we're very active in recruiting a CEO and hope to get that done here in the next month or 2."

So there should be nothing incremental to what we've done in guidance. So the commercial team closed, been thinking about this for quite some time. We think it is largely opening up a new market segment. We need to become more efficient to sell systems effectively that are priced at $50,000 and ultimately below with Firefly. And so we're doing a tremendous amount of work in the commercial organization to sort of tune our organization, hire people that perhaps are earlier in their careers and at lower price points. We're working on our services model, and of course, it requires that these instruments be fundamentally more robust to reduce the amount of service and training that's required. So all that commercial work is going on now and is built into the guidance that you've seen. In terms of the addressable market, I think that the -- if you think about the 50,000 labs out there, there's probably half of them would want to have a MiniSeq if they could. But the funding won't support that. So getting below the $50,000 price point, we think, opens up certainly the opportunity to get to many, many thousands of these instruments placed. We talked about our installed base of the MiSeq at the JPMorgan conference. And I would suspect if we went out a few years on MiniSeq that the installed base would be some multiple of the installed base of MiSeqs."

And so we hit an awful lot of the large customers around the world with this. And so the incremental brand-new customers naturally has to be created from scratch almost because they generally won't be somebody who already exist. The other thing to be a little bit cautious about is the fact that many of these customers are also going to want to run the full breadth of applications. So they may be opting for 4000s rather than Xs. So that's another consideration in terms of calculating how many Xs we may place. There's a couple of other things that could happen, population sequencing projects. We're tracking these in other places like Australia, which is an interesting opportunity for a PopSeq project. China's announced that they're going to do some very large population programs. There will be quite -- no specifics or timing around that, but that could certainly be an upside to Xs as well.

And also primarily people that are working the phones, and so we'll be extending our inside sales capability to sell those products. In addition, we are looking to expand our ability to digitally get to those customers through expanding our e-commerce capability as well as being smarter about using our instruments to drive additional sales. And then we're also looking at target areas where we can add specialization by market into the sales force that will allow us to target some of the smaller labs that we haven't been able to get to yet.

So we think that's in the earliest stages of adoption, and we'll get into the higher part of the growth curve during 2016 and 2017. We're waiting for the inflection point yet to happen in the oncology market. And as I said, we're seeing good uptake of TST15. I think we need to really define what the regulated and reimburse strategy is going to be in the oncology market after we get this next round of guidance from the FDA. And once we get that, I think it will help us clarify what kinds of products we want to push through the FDA and actually get approved. And that, I think, puts a serious inflection in the curve if we can figure how to do that efficiently in ways where the time it takes to get approval doesn't mean that the product you ultimately get approved is obsolete by the time it gets there.

In China, the research markets have been a bit challenging over the past year or 2 in terms of overall funding. But having said that, we have a couple of unique vectors into the Chinese market, one being the X systems. There's a sort of a disproportionate number of HiSeq Xs in China, which gives us good reagent pull-through and incremental potential sales into those customers. And our NextSeq sales are there. They are good because of our NIPT business. So the downward pressure perhaps is the overall health of the research funding environment, but NextSeqs and Xs are the strong uplift. Europe's been pretty steady. In Q3, we talked about the fact that we had some business that we think got pushed out to Q4. And you saw that we had very strong results in Europe in Q4. So I think we recovered that business and more normalized the pipeline. When we exited Q3, we talked about a strong desktop pipeline that didn't quite make it over into Q3 revenue.

As we shared a few weeks ago, fourth quarter results surpassed our expectations with revenue of $592 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year period and our 17th consecutive quarter of sequential growt",638,"Thanks, Rebecca, and good afternoon, everyone. As we shared a few weeks ago, fourth quarter results surpassed our expectations with revenue of $592 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year period and our 17th consecutive quarter of sequential growth. During the quarter, we witnessed robust trends across the business, including year-over-year total sequencing growth of 19% and 30% shipment growth to clinical and translational customers. Demand from clinical oncology customers contributed to the strong Q4 result with approximately 40% growth compared to the prior year quarter. 
We're very pleased with the commercial uptake of the TST 15 product, and the TST 170 development program remains on track. These panels are based on initial standards defined by the Actionable Genome Consortium and were developed to drive adoption of NGS in the translational market and by pharma partners in their clinical trials. Encouragingly, we recently announced that Amgen will be utilizing the IUO version of TST 15 as part of a new oncology development program, and we're in discussions with other potential pharma partners as well. 
In early January, we formed GRAIL, a new company focused on the cancer screening market. We're currently working to transfer our ctDNA programs, the MSK partnership and the employees working on these projects to GRAIL. We're in the late stages of recruiting a CEO and have identified a potential lab and office space in the Bay Area. We've begun work on the detailed planning necessary to embark on a large-scale clinical trial in 2017 with the goal of demonstrating a stage shift in diagnosis. 
In our Reproductive and Genetic Health business, we saw strong adoption of both our IVF and NIPT products in the fourth quarter. Sales of our preimplantation genetic screening, or PGS products, increased close to 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Further, we completed enrollment in the STAR trial ahead of schedule, which will measure the impact of PGS and embryo morphology on IVF success rates. 
NIPT revenue grew more than 50% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Test send-out volumes were slightly lower sequentially at 45,000 as one of our large customers began to shift testing in-house. This transition will decrease service revenue and increase product sales in the coming quarters. Partially offsetting this impact will be continued penetration of the average risk opportunity. Currently, we estimate more than 70 million lives or 25% of the U.S. population has coverage with Anthem and regional Blue Cross Blue Shield carriers who've made a favorable coverage decision for average risk. 
Moving to arrays. Shipments grew 1% versus the fourth quarter of last year, and revenue was down 2% with ASP sequentially stable for the second quarter in a row. With strong demand from agriculture, DTC and biobanking customers as well as the launch of our new arrays methyl EPIC and ImmunoArray, we shipped 1.6 million samples during Q4, a new record. We project slight array growth in 2016, supported by the entering backlog and the availability of Infinium XT later this year. 
In summary, the momentum in the fourth quarter was largely driven by the continued penetration of clinical genomics in the oncology and reproductive health markets. This trend, together with our strategic investments in market and platform development, will enable us to deliver on our mission to unlock the power of the genome and further penetrate the many large and untapped opportunities ahead of us. 
Lastly, as you may have read in our 8-K yesterday, Dr. William Rastetter stepped off the Illumina Board in order to invest and serve as a board member of GRAIL. I would like to thank Bill for his enormous contributions during his 17 years as a board member and 11 years as Chairman. 
I'll now turn the call over to Francis, who will provide a detailed overview of our product results."

I'm pleased to provide further details on the performance of our products in the fourth quarter. To begin, interest in the HiSeq high-throughput portfolio remained strong with HiSeq 2500 and 4000 orders both exceeding our expectations. Versus the prior year, shipments were lower due to challenging comparisons on HiSeq X and HiSeq 2500. Demand for HiSeq X was generated from customers adding capacity as well as new X sites, which totaled 27 at the end of the fourth quarter. While orders are expected to be relatively steady in the 20 to 30 per quarter range, shipments depend on customer readiness, which we expect will result in fewer than 20 shipments in Q1. 
Demand for HiSeq 2500 exceeded expectations in Q4 due to commercial customers with validated workflows who value the rapid run mode this product offers. During the quarter, we received a multi-unit order from an NIPT customer as well as orders from commercial customers looking to add throughput to their laboratories. HiSeq 4000 also benefited from capacity additions, including multiple-unit orders from HiSeq X customers looking to expand the application breadth of their respective fleets. HiSeq 4000 again was the leading platform sold, which lifted ASPs for the family of instruments compared to the prior year. 
Moving to our benchtop instruments. We saw a rebound in demand in the fourth quarter as MiSeq orders approached record levels and NextSeq orders were the highest in any quarter since launch. These order trends were the result of delivering on the strong pipeline we saw exiting Q3. Heading into 2016, our MiSeq and NextSeq pipelines remain stable but at a more normalized level than seen entering the fourth quarter. 
Clinical and translational centers drove demand for NextSeq instruments, accounting for more than 40% of orders. Continued interest came from our NIPT partners in China, reproductive health customers focused on PGS and NIPT and oncology customers. New-to-sequencing customers accounted for approximately 55% of MiSeq orders in the fourth quarter with our new-to-NGS bundle contributing to this dynamic. 
MiSeqDx orders were also at record levels in the quarter, and we recently submitted our registration document for IVD designation on MiSeq in Korea. We're continuing to work closely with the FDA to update the intended use of the MiSeqDx to include a claim for DNA isolated from multiple sample types. Both of these activities will further support the global demand for DX units. 
Moving now to our newest benchtop instruments, I'd like to share some customer feedback on MiniSeq. Approximately 4,600 attendees have signed up for our webinars to learn more about MiniSeq, our largest-ever registration for a new product. Early customer feedback indicates only a slight overlap with MiSeq. And as a result, we expect minimal cannibalization in the range of 20% to 25%. In addition, we believe many of the customers who choose MiniSeq over MiSeq will opt for multiple units to optimize the throughput and sample flexibility of their fleets. With these early indicators of demand, we're pleased with how the pipeline for MiniSeq is building and expect its customer-friendly features to further democratize sequencing. 
In informatics, we continued to increase the level of integration with BaseSpace. We have completed the planning and design of the Clarity LIMS BaseSpace integration, which we intend to release towards the end of Q1. We believe this will enable better visibility on lab metrics and shorten turnaround time for our customers. BaseSpace now includes more than 70 apps as well as an upgraded dashboard and analysis manager to improve monitoring and control of reports. These enhancements, combined with the introduction of the BaseSpace Professional and Enterprise Editions, will enable researchers to enrich their informatics experience while improving efficiency in sequencing labs.

Fourth quarter revenue was slightly better tha",1297,"Thanks, Francis. As we shared a few weeks ago, Q4 closed out a solid year for Illumina. Revenue for the year grew 19% versus the prior year to $2.22 billion, which equates to 23% on a constant currency basis. Fourth quarter revenue was slightly better than our pre-announcement at $592 million, 15% growth versus the prior year period and 19% constant currency adjusted. This strong quarterly result can be attributed to better-than-forecasted demand for benchtop instruments as well as strength in sequencing consumables and services. 
Shipments in the Americas grew 25% year-over-year in Q4, while European and APAC shipments increased 5% and 10%, respectively, over the same period. Growth in our international regions was slightly muted due to the impact of currency. Further, Europe faced a challenging HiSeq X comparison, while the Asia Pacific region continued to experience weakness in the Japanese funding environment. 
Consumable revenue was $346 million, an increase of 19% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as higher demand for sequencing consumables, including record library prep shipments, was partially offset by a slight decline in arrays. Consumable revenue represented 59% of total revenue, up from 57% in the prior year period and the 58% we saw in Q3. 
As we previously shared, sequencing consumable revenue was robust, growing to approximately $280 million, up close to 30% over the prior year. This result was driven by our growing installed base of instruments and strength in NextSeq consumables, which saw utilization well above our updated guidance range of $100,000 to $125,000 per instrument annually. This is the first quarter that NextSeq has exceeded our range, so we are not updating our utilization guidance at this time. 
MiSeq utilization was in our projected range of $40,000 to $45,000, and HiSeq pull-through per instrument, excluding HiSeq X, was in our projected range of $300,000 to $350,000. HiSeq X utilization fell short of our recently increased pull-through guidance range due to order timing. We continue to project HiSeq X utilization of $650,000 to $700,000 per instrument over the course of 2016. However, the timing of a single order of 4 million or more would be sufficient to move pull-through outside of our projected range in any quarter given the size of our installed base. 
Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts, grew approximately 50% versus Q4 2014 to $94 million. This improvement was driven by growth in NIPT services, which benefited from increased test send-out revenue and IP fees, extended maintenance contracts associated with a larger sequencing installed base and genotyping services.
Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude noncash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today's earnings release.
Results and projections include Helix, and projections will now also include our GRAIL business. Accordingly, all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refers to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders after noncontrolling interests.
Our adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 71.7%, a decline compared to 73.2% in the third quarter primarily due to the lower mix of sequencing consumables and a higher mix of arrays and services. Year-over-year, adjusted gross margins contracted 60 basis points due to a higher mix of services revenue. 
Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $103 million or 17.5% of revenue, higher compared to $90 million or 16.4% of revenue in the third quarter due to the impact of additional headcount and spending associated with the launch of MiniSeq, Project Firefly and clinical trials.
Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $124 million or 20.9% of revenue, an increase compared to $115 million or 20.9% of revenue in the previous quarter due to the impact of additional headcount. 
Adjusted operating margins were 33.4% compared to 36% in the third quarter and 37.7% in the prior year period due to the impact of lower gross margin, higher headcount and previously mentioned investments. 
In the fourth quarter, our stock-based compensation expense equaled $35 million, better than projected due primarily to cancellations associated with the management changes that we announced in December. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 26.5% compared to 16.2% in the fourth quarter of last year, higher than expected due to a onetime international restructuring charge. As a reminder, Q4 '14 was impacted by favorable adjustments related to multiple prior year provisions and higher-than-expected stock deductions. 
Non-GAAP net income was $121 million for Q4, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.81. This compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $129 million and $0.87, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Included in the Q4 '15 non-GAAP EPS result is approximately $0.01 of dilution from Helix. In addition, the impact of foreign exchange lowered Q4 non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.05 relative to last year. 
We reported GAAP net income of $104 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter compared to net income of $153 million or $1.03 per diluted share in the prior year period, which reflected a gain associated with the settlement of the Syntrix litigation, partially offset by legal contingency costs related to the Sequenom patent pool agreement. 
Cash flow from operations equaled $240 million in the fourth quarter. 
Q4 DSO decreased to 64 days compared to 68 days last quarter due primarily to improved shipment linearity. 
Inventory increased to $271 million largely due to a buildup of sequencing instruments and safety stock. 
Capital expenditures in Q4 were $35 million, resulting in $205 million of free cash flow.  For the fiscal year, cash flow from operations equaled $660 million, and capital expenditures were $143 million, resulting in $517 million of free cash flow. 
During the quarter, $29 million of the 2016 0.25% convertible bonds were settled, leaving approximately $75 million remaining, which will come due in the first quarter. 
We repurchased over 1.3 million shares at an average price of $151.44, utilizing $202 million under our previously announced buyback program, leaving us with more than $255 million of authorization remaining under these programs. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.39 billion in cash and short-term investments. 
Moving now to guidance. As we shared a few weeks ago, we expect total company revenue growth of 16% in 2016 or 17% on a constant currency basis based on today's rates. Underlying this guidance is an assumption that sequencing consumables will generate the vast majority of growth, while sequencing instruments were expected to be relatively flat versus the prior year given the strong HiSeq X backlog shipments in Q1 '15, resulting in a challenging comparison. 
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $3.55 to $3.65, including the impact of $0.15 and $0.10 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix, respectively. Additionally, we project approximately 73% gross margin, a full year pro forma tax rate of 26% and full year weighted average non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding of 149 million. We expect a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest of approximately $30 million. 
Specific to the first quarter, we are projecting flat to slightly higher revenue sequentially as a result of the stronger-than-anticipated Q4 results. Additionally, operating expenses are projected to increase by approximately $20 million sequentially based on the ramping of investment in Helix and GRAIL as well as the high count additions from strong hiring momentum coming out of 2015. 
We're off to a good start in 2016 and believe that the important investments we are making in the business, including Helix and GRAIL, will catalyze significant long-term revenue growth for the company as we continue to drive the broad adoption of genomics.

When we entered 2015, we still had a very large backlog of HiSeq Xs, which we shipped largely out in the first quarter. So that was a pretty significant impact overall on the instrument number for the year was the makeup of that backlog. So we don't have that situation coming into '16. MiniSeq, of course, is going to be a positive lift for the instrument line during the course of the year, partially offset by some cannibalization across the MiSeq part of the product line. But it's really overcoming that extra shipment we had in Q1 on a comparable basis from the HiSeq Xs that caused us to give guidance to relatively flat instruments for the year. With respect to the upgrade cycle, we think it's continuing from -- to 3000s and 4000s from the 2500. But we've been actually pleasantly surprised, I would say, by the fact that we continue to get more orders for 2500s than we expected, and that's largely because of clinical customers that have the instrument validated in their workflows and from those customers liking the rapid run mode, which we don't currently have implemented in the 3000s and the 4000s."

We expect it to start ramping significantly in '16. But in '15, it's probably gone a little bit slower than we might have expected. As we look at services revenues for '16, there are going to be some offsetting factors. We have some consumer business there that will continue to be very robust, we expect, through 2016.

You can imagine on both Helix and GRAIL, we had significant internal debate about what the right structure for these entities should be. At the end of the day, the key considerations came down to the nature of the business itself. And in the case of both Helix and GRAIL, those businesses are fundamentally different than Illumina's core business, one being very focused on a new market that being the consumer and the second being a business that will very likely be a global services company. And neither of those are directly what Illumina does. So that was quite important. We thought both of these needed to operate in sort of a high-velocity startup mode. And we wanted to have the ability to recruit the best possible talent early on into these companies. And so we thought the best structure for that was to spin them out of the core of Illumina, have a separate management team, separate board but retain majority ownership so that Illumina, as these companies be as successful as we hope, we'll get the majority of the benefit from these. With respect to Helix, we at JPMorgan announced the second set of partners, so a total of 4 now announced. The 2 largest consumer companies so far have not been announced as joining Helix. It's certainly our ambitions to try to get them to join. But you can imagine as an incumbent in the space, there might be some initial reluctance to do that. So it's imperative for us to really build this ecosystem out and to demonstrate that we have the capability to deliver a better experience and better economics to the incumbents and what they do independent of Helix. We're working on a large number of other potential partnerships within Helix as well, and we're very active in recruiting a CEO and hope to get that done here in the next month or 2."

So there should be nothing incremental to what we've done in guidance. So the commercial team closed, been thinking about this for quite some time. We think it is largely opening up a new market segment. We need to become more efficient to sell systems effectively that are priced at $50,000 and ultimately below with Firefly. And so we're doing a tremendous amount of work in the commercial organization to sort of tune our organization, hire people that perhaps are earlier in their careers and at lower price points. We're working on our services model, and of course, it requires that these instruments be fundamentally more robust to reduce the amount of service and training that's required. So all that commercial work is going on now and is built into the guidance that you've seen. In terms of the addressable market, I think that the -- if you think about the 50,000 labs out there, there's probably half of them would want to have a MiniSeq if they could. But the funding won't support that. So getting below the $50,000 price point, we think, opens up certainly the opportunity to get to many, many thousands of these instruments placed. We talked about our installed base of the MiSeq at the JPMorgan conference. And I would suspect if we went out a few years on MiniSeq that the installed base would be some multiple of the installed base of MiSeqs."

And so we've hit an awful lot of the large customers around the world with this. And so the incremental brand-new customer is naturally -- has to be created from scratch almost because they generally won't be somebody who already exists. The other thing to be a little bit cautious about is the fact that many of these customers are also going to want to run the full breadth of applications. So they may be opting for 4000s rather than Xs. So that's another consideration in terms of calculating how many Xs we may place. There's a couple of other things that could happen, population sequencing projects. We're tracking these in other places like Australia, which is an interesting opportunity for a PopSeq project. China's announced that they're going to do some very large population programs. But nobody quite knows the specifics or timing around that, but that could certainly be an upside to Xs as well.

And we let them be essentially market animals to go figure that out. But I think for the first time, we're going to have to develop a sales force that sells just the desktop platforms. So Francis, maybe you want to give an update on where you guys are on this?"

And also primarily people that are working the phones, and so we'll be expanding our inside sales capability to sell those products. In addition, we are looking to expand our ability to digitally get to those customers through expanding our e-commerce capability as well as being smarter about using our instruments to drive additional sales. And then we're also looking at target areas where we can add specialization by market into the sales force that will allow us to target some of the smaller labs that we haven't been able to get to yet. So those are the kinds of things that we're doing in the commercial team."

So we think that's in the earliest stages of adoption, and we'll get into the higher part of the growth curve during 2016 and 2017. We're waiting for the inflection point yet to happen in the oncology market. And as I said, we're seeing good uptake of TST 15. I think we need to really define what the regulated and reimbursed strategy is going to be in the oncology market after we get this next round of guidance from the FDA. And once we get that, I think it will help us clarify what kinds of products we want to push through the FDA and actually get approved. And that, I think, puts a serious inflection in the curve if we can figure how to do that efficiently in ways where the time it takes to get approval doesn't mean that the product you ultimately get approved is obsolete by the time it gets there. And so those are the key issues. But the oncology market is still very, very, very early.

In China, the research markets have been a bit challenging over the past year or 2 in terms of overall funding. But having said that, we have a couple of unique vectors into the Chinese market, one being the X systems. There's a sort of a disproportionate number of HiSeq Xs in China, which gives us good reagent pull-through and incremental potential sales into those customers. And our NextSeq sales are there. They are good because of our NIPT business. So the downward pressure perhaps is the overall health of the research funding environment, but NextSeqs and Xs are the strong uplift. Europe's been pretty steady. In Q3, we talked about the fact that we had some business that we think got pushed out to Q4. And you saw that we had very strong results in Europe in Q4. So I think we recovered that business and more normalized the pipeline. When we exited Q3, we talked about a strong desktop pipeline that didn't quite make it over into Q3 revenue.

As we shared a few weeks ago, first quarter revenue was $572 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year period and lower than the guidance we provided in January. Our analysis subsequent to the preannounc",1158,"Thanks, Rebecca, and good afternoon, everyone. As we shared a few weeks ago, first quarter revenue was $572 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year period and lower than the guidance we provided in January. Our analysis subsequent to the preannouncement have identified 2 key contributors to the shortfall: Orders we booked that were not recognizable as revenue; and instrument orders that we were expecting, but did not receive. Additionally, after quarter end, we received a disappointing outlook from Europe, which is central to the guidance reduction for the remainder of the year. I will address the Q1 factors, and Francis will address our outlook and action plan. 
The majority of the shortfall in Q1 resulted from orders booked that did not translate to revenue. A combination of factors contributed, including capacity constraints in array manufacturing resulting in back orders; orders that were received late in the quarter, resulting in systems in transit and therefore, not converted to revenue; customer-initiated requests for delayed shipment or conditions outside our control for delayed revenue recognition; and partial revenue deferrals due to increasing complexity of large deal structures, particularly in the case of high-throughput instruments, including the HiSeq X. Some of these deferrals will be recognized in Q2, while others will convert to revenue over the rest of the year. Some were controllable by us, and some were not, but none are related to fundamental market demand. Individually, each was less than 1% of revenue, and that happens to a degree every quarter, but the combined effect was larger than we expected.
The second factor was HiSeq orders that were forecasted but were not perceived, accounting for $9 million of the shortfall. As a consequence, we shipped 19 fewer HiSeq 2500, 3000 and 4000 instruments anticipated valued at $14 million, which was partially offset by strength in other portions of the portfolio. We had anticipated sequential growth of 11 units rather than a decline of 8 units, which led to flat placement year-over-year.
Over the last several weeks, we've gone through a detailed analysis of the underlying drivers deal by deal. There were no dominant themes, but we did see a collection of factors, including delays in funding release, customers opting to purchase NextSeqs and one-off situations such as pending lab moves, financing deliberations, contract reviews or an upcoming regulatory audit.
While outsourcing the service providers were also cited by a few customers, this is not a significant driver of our forward projection. This feedback confirmed our view on questions of competition and market capacity. While we can never be certain, a few customers did not delay purchases to assess other platforms, our win rates remain stable and to our knowledge, we did not lose competitive deal in Q1. 
We also did not get any information to indicate that excess market capacity was a factor. As you can see in our investor deck, high-throughput utilization as a percentage of available sequencing capacity has been on an upward trend since Q3 '14 when normalized for one large order that we shipped in Q3 '15. data collected from BaseSpace, which represents about 1/3 of the high-throughput installed base confirms this analysis showing roughly flat utilization for legacy HiSeq instruments like HiSeq X 3000 and 4000. 
announced initiatives like the Chinese precision medicine program to sequence millions of genomes and the AstraZeneca project to access 2 million genomes create the confidence that today's sequencing capacity represents a small fraction of that necessary to meet the growing demand for populations in sequencing programs. 
Focusing now on products. Orders for HiSeq X exceeded our expectations, and we added 4 new customers, bringing the total to 31. Our outlook remains robust at 20 to 30 instrument orders per quarter. HiSeq X consumables also beat our forecast despite the timing of customer shipments, lower pull-through to below the guidance range. On a per quarter basis, which normalizes the impact of shipment timing, X utilization averaged 650,000 to 750,000 annually, a range we feel comfortable with going forward.
HiSeq pull-through projected range of $300,000 to $350,000. For modeling purposes, we have removed 95 HiSeqs from our installed installed base, bringing this figure to just over 2,000 instruments reflecting the units taken off-line due to adoption of newer machines. 
Our benchtop instrument portfolio performed well in the quarter, and the outlook is consistent with our expectations coming into the year. This is being driven by lower-than-expected cannibalization of MiSeq, strong initial interest in MiniSeq and NextSeq adoption for NIPT in China. Benchtop consumables were strong in Q1, as both MiSeq and NextSeq saw utilization above their respective guidance ranges.
Microarrays were also an emerging bright spot this quarter as revenue grew 1% versus the prior year period to almost $90 million, and orders dramatically exceeded our expectations with growth of 85%.
A new consortium array, which will be in shipping in Q4 and the demand for DTC customers, contributed to the strong order results. Shipments to our clinical customers grew approximately 20% in the quarter. As we've noted on multiple earnings calls, we've been expecting some NIPT services customers to ship to running samples in-house on our sequencers, a significant part of that shift occurred this quarter. Normalizing the effect of the lower revenue because we're not getting the full service revenue, our remaining clinical customer base revenue grew 24%. NIPT shipments grew 10% or 28% after adjusting for the shift versus the prior year. We now believe most payers will next assess average risk coverage decisions in 2017, which is later than we had anticipated. Despite this, the rate of adoption is meeting our forecast, and we expect further acceleration as reimbursement decisions are made. We believe the delays a matter of focus by the labs that are working to obtain a network designation for existing coverages as opposed to driving incremental average risk coverage for faster return on investment.
Oncology shipments grew 9% adjusted for the large HiSeq X shipment seen in the first quarter last year. This growth rate is lower than that we typically see from this market due to a large number of orders shipped in the prior year period. We continue to expect expanded adoption in 2016, which will be fueled in part by the launch of TruSight Tumor 170 later this year. 
In summary, while we're not happy with our performance in Q1, we do not believe our results are related to a change in fundamental market demand. Instead, timing of instrument orders is creating late quarter revenue uncertainty, some of which we can and will take specific actions to mitigate and unique customer situations impacting the HiSeq order rate. With a lower European forecast, it was important that we are realign our full year expectations. We continue to believe that the demand for the next-generation sequencing is far more robust than our first quarter result or the outlook our European forecast suggests. 
I'll now turn the call over to Francis."

Today I plan to provide further details on our outlook and action plan. Europe revenue declined year-over-year in Q1, meeting our projections and we are forecasting low to mid-single-digit growth for the full yea",630,"Thanks, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I plan to provide further details on our outlook and action plan. Europe revenue declined year-over-year in Q1, meeting our projections and we are forecasting low to mid-single-digit growth for the full year. Revenue from the Americas grew 14%, representing a slightly slower start than we anticipated for the reasons Jay outlined. But we remain confident in the region's full year projection of mid-teens growth. Asia Pacific revenue declined 5% as forecasted due primarily to a large HiSeq X comparable. During the quarter, we began to see customer purchasing patterns in Japan improved as research funds are now being released. It's too early to call this a resurgence, but the signs are certainly more positive.
Our Asia Pacific region is also forecasting mid-teens growth for the year. The Q1 challengers are responsible for a minimal change in full year outlook. With the benefit of 2 additional weeks of analysis in other preannouncement, we are more confident that Q1 was a result of operational challenges and not market demand. By far, the largest driver of our lower guidance is our lack of visibility in Europe as evidenced by the drop in the regions full year forecast 3 months after we completed our budget. We're taking steps to enhance visibility and improve our execution in the region. In the meantime, we have incorporated the reduced outlook from Europe into our projections. We're focusing on 3 areas to deliver on our full year: first, we are making improvements to our sales process. To address the variability in instrument orders and shipments during the last months of the quarters, we're focusing the sales team on early closure of instrument orders. In addition, large instrument contract, including those for HiSeq X, have become more complex, particularly in Europe. And so we are simplifying and standardizing deals. 
Finally, we are building out our manufacturing capacity for arrays so that we're able to clear the backorders and meet the increasing demand. 
Second, we are committed to improving the execution and outlook in Europe. As we mentioned a few weeks ago, we recently brought in an interim sales leader in Europe who has already established accountability and ownership for the revised forecast and is driving to the updated expectations. He has already put in place greater discipline around opportunity management, accuracy of our CRM data and quoting. 
In addition, we're making good progress in our search for a permanent General Manager with large global company experience to ensure that our European organization realizes its full potential. 
The last step in our plan is focused on expense management. Last year, we added close to 900 employees, 500,000 square feet of real estate commitments and a new global ERP system. While these investments were necessary to support both of the growth we have experienced and our ongoing market opportunities, we recognized the need to meaningfully slow down the pace of investment in 2016, given our updated outlook. We do not expect to have broad changes to our product portfolio or development pipeline, but do have other opportunities to delay initiatives that are less impactful to the long-term outlook. We are working on our 2016 rebrand and have incorporated those improvements into our guidance for the remainder of the year. As a result, excluding GRAIL and Helix, our operating margin targets for the year is expected to be 34.5%. 
While disappointing, our Q1 results have not dampened our conviction in our market opportunity or our ability to deliver innovative technology to capture those markets. I am personally committed and excited to move this organization to realize our mission: Benefit patients and deliver shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our first quarter results."
29753,331335788,971481,"Illumina Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Illumina, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Francis. While revenue for the quarter met our guidance, orders of over $700 million significantly beat our expectations. We built more than $100 million of sequencing consumable backlog, most of which is expected to be delivered this year. As a r",1254,"Thanks, Francis. While revenue for the quarter met our guidance, orders of over $700 million significantly beat our expectations. We built more than $100 million of sequencing consumable backlog, most of which is expected to be delivered this year. As a reminder, we typically see higher sequencing consumables in the first quarter, ahead of annual price increases. Instrument revenue declined 20% year-over-year to $118 million given the large HiSeq X shipments in the first quarter last year, which accounts for more than $30 million decline.
Consumable revenue was $361 million, an increase of 17% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Sequencing consumable revenue grew 24% over Q1 of last year to approximately $300 million. 
Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts were approximately 12% versus Q1 2015 to $89 million. This improvement was driven by extended maintenance contracts associated with our larger sequencing installed base and genotyping services largely offset by decline in NIPT service revenue given the shift to in-house testing as expected. Going forward, we expect new to at least partially offset the further impact from the transition of these 2 customers. 
Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude noncash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures as well as our GAAP EPS guidance, both of which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation.
Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders. Our adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 71.7%, flat compared to the fourth quarter as the benefit of favorable consumables mix was offset by lower absorption. Year-over-year, adjusted gross margins contracted 50 basis points as the positive impact on consumables mix was more than offset by lower instrument margin associated with fewer HiSeq X shipments as well as a decline in services margin.
Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $113 million or 19.8% of revenue, including $5 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $103 million or 17.5% revenue in the fourth quarter higher due to headcount addition and investment in GRAIL, Helix and development projects, including Project Firefly. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $125 million or 21.9% of revenue, including $3 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $124 million or 20.9% of revenue in Q4.
Adjusted operating margins were 30.1% compared to 33.4% in the fourth quarter and 39.3% in the prior year period. Excluding GRAIL and Helix, operating margins were 31.6% in the first quarter. The year-over-year decline is attributable to the lower gross margins and increased employee-related expenses. Stock-based compensation expense equaled $35 million, flat compared to Q4. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.5% compared to 24.5% in the first quarter of last year, and non-GAAP net income was $106 million. This resulted in Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.71, which included approximately $0.04 and $0.02 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix, respectively. This quarterly results compared to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $125 [ph] million and $0.91 [ph] in the first quarter of 2015, respectively.
We reported first quarter and GAAP net income of $90 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared to net income of $137 million or $0.92 per diluted share in the prior year period. As a reminder, prior period results include a pretax gain of $15 million from the of a minority interest in when acquired by biotechnologies. 
Cash flow from operations equaled $40 million, lower versus the prior year due to the impact of operating expense growth. Q1 DSO totaled 64 days equal to last quarter, and inventory rose to $298 [ph] million given the quarterly shortfall in sequencing instruments and the continued buildup of consumable safety stock.
Capital expenditures in Q1 were $53 million, higher than the $37 million in the prior year quarter due primarily to our real estate build outs. Consequently, Q1 free cash flow was negative $14 million. During the quarter, we retired the remaining $76 million at 0.25% 2015 convertible notes and ended the quarter approximately in cash and investments, including the cash balances of GRAIL and Helix.
Looking forward, we now expect total company revenue growth of 12% year-over-year. We ended the first quarter word, the additional decline versus our original expectation of 16% due to the lower outlook in Europe, which range from high teens growth to the low to mid-single digits, including small contribution of from the Genome England project. Our outlook in the Americas and Asia Pacific region is much more robust as both are expected to grow in the mid-teens for full year, roughly in line with our expectations due in part to strong orders in the first quarter. These regions in the second half, we expect to see HiSeq X increase but remain short of our original expectation. We believe this it will be more than offset planned MiSeq placements given more than expected cannibalization as well as an increase in array revenue, NextSeq consumables and HiSeq acquisitions. We also continue to expect strong adoption of clinical markets in 2016. We are forecasting Q2 revenue $590 million to $595 million, driven by sequential seasonality in roughly flat HiSeq shipments. We're not forecasting an uptick in other HiSeq instrument shipments until the second half. The Q2 revenue guidance implies a meaningful backlog acceleration. Our confidence in delivering to these projections our existing backlog shippable in Q3 and Q4 and our pipeline.
We are projecting Q2 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.74 as higher revenue is expected to be largely offset by sequential increase in operating expenses both from the headcount additions in the first quarter and additional GRAIL and Helix spend. The steps we are taking to reduce spending will have a marginal impact in Q2 and a more meaningful impact in the second half of the year.
We significant EPS leverage in the second half driven by the acceleration of the revenue growth and our spending actions. For the full year non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $3.25 to $3.45, which includes GRAIL dilution of $0.20 an increase of $0.05 versus our prior estimate. Illumina is retaining almost all the GRAIL losses in net income attributable to Illumina shareholders significantly greater than our majority ownership word due to an unexpected accounting treatment. We are in discussions with GRAIL regarding our base equity structure, were updated non-GAAP EPS guidance on GRAIL commentary includes our expectation we will continue to recognize losses in the second quarter and backdrops sequentially in the second half closer to our ownership structural change contemplated in Q2 and the accounting treatment we are anticipating. Any delays in this time line could have a negative impact of up to $0.04 per quarter in the second half.
In closing, the management team, we have a number of matters to address that we have outlined today including our linearity, our execution in Europe, our rate of investment and the GRAIL equity structure. We are setting our outlook to significantly uncharacteristic of our company and unacceptable to us as a team. We are committed to delivering strong results consistent with our track records and our confidence and the long-term opportunity our business remains high.

For example, we may restaff some of our research at a bit slower pace because we move a lot of people over into GRAIL and much of that research work has in effect 3 to 5 years from now. So those are the kind of things we can slow down for some short number of quarters until we get back into the revenue growth rates that we believe we should be at.

And so that is key for us to do more than it ever has been. And the big markets we're opening up now have each their own unique set of issues whether its reimbursement or regulatory or in the case of GRAIL, clinical trial work. And so it is -- it does take some time to open up those new markets. Having said that, there's no question that Illumina is still driven by product innovation in all of our businesses, we analytically see a cycle that's related to product cycles and that whenever we launched new platforms, we get a surge of new orders for those instruments and then the following year, the consumables begin to catch up and then that platform begins to level out over time. So every platform has an S-curve associated with it. It is true that we are a larger company now and therefore, each individual S-curve has a smaller reflect on the total revenue of the company. So there's no getting around that fact and so we have much greater diversity in our business now, which is a good thing, but each individual product launch probably has less of an impact than it might have been back when we had only one sequencer. for example, you replace the GA with the HiSeq everybody but a HiSeq product in the market.

Firstly, the capacity calculation, which is based on of the actual mix of types of kit that our customers buy and word. But clearly, that's increasing quarter-over-quarter as a result of both the installed base, a little bit of the change in mix coming with higher-throughput instruments, which outcome back to when I look at the capacity utilization chart. If you think about the percentage, what you probably -- what you don't want to see is a very low percentage of utilization, that would reflect a lot of spare capacity in the market, which has our read-through, I think, to future instrument purchases. You're obviously, not been as utilization based on our trajectory, our past history, our trajectory of much over 50% on an ongoing basis due to the decentralization of the market. I don't mean a centralized market you will see much, much higher than this. So if you look at the data, what you are seeing is a couple of inflection points where the utilization tends to stabilize. That happens to [indiscernible] in fact, when trades go down, if you look at 3Q '14, that coincides when we put new capacity in the market. So back then, it was the [indiscernible] lung kit and that created an instant increase in available capacity, which caused the dip in utilization. You have seen of that recovery. Same thing as when we introduced the HiSeq 4000. That had an effect on the growth in utilization because we introduced new capacity into the market with that instruments as well. And then what you're seeing if you see normalized for that one large order is a fairly consistent growth rate, which is exactly what you would want to see, which I believe -- we believe reflects the capacity is not excess capacity in the market. It's being utilized rate increasing over time in spite of the increased volumes or capacity that we're putting out there with the higher-throughput instruments and kits. Is that right?"

The way that I would think about that is kind of an advanced ordering of reagent purchase we're going to get ship anyway throughout the year confidence, but I wouldn't think of it is necessarily incremental. It is relative to last year and prior year. It is larger than we've traditionally seen. And so give us all bit more of the backlog normally have at this time. And then I also mentioned that we have about 1/3 of our ending backlog for the quarter roll over into the second half, which gives us some confidence. Obviously, that includes a portion of those sequencing consumables that I just talked about. So nothing more kind of quantitative than that at this point. But the sequencing consumables, I would say it is pretty clear to be the [indiscernible] business consumer-driven activity there, which has been another helpful part of building backlog. What it wasn't necessarily was a significant proportion of instrument backlog. That's not -- it has become much more of a -- instruments become more of a turn in the quarter type of activity. We don't necessarily come into the quarter with significant levels of backlog like you saw us have in Q1 of '15. And it's much more normalized now."

And so that growth in of the backlog was more than we've typically seen in Q1. So we felt really good about that order rate. In respect of NIPT. What we're seeing is that the large payers, the majors there tend to assess coverage decisions on specific dates. The on a cycle and so if they're not cycled to do this in 2016, there is little to no chance that they're going to go off cycle to approve this. And so as we've mapped out all those cycles, there still remains a possibility of some of them late in 2016, but the majority of them fall in 2017, which is why we decided that we think the bolus of these coverage decisions will be made in 2017. With respect to cancer, the narrative really isn't about stable reimbursement because the vast majority of the cancer tests aren't reimbursed today even Foundation Medicine isn't. So most of that market is being driven by labs running these tests for market share reasons. Most of the labs are losing money out of cancer test. So the reimbursement opportunity in oncology lies ahead of us and it's something that many of our customers are working on. It's an area that I'll be spending a fair amount of my time on in the next year. And it is related to the standardization challenges that I think exists here. We're in the phase of the oncology market where it is becoming increasingly fragmented with a lots and lots of different panel products. And one of the things that Illumina used to do is begin to reconverge that market into a more standard set of products and more standard set of processes so that payers can get their heads around what is something they should be paying for and that is something our TST 15 is attempting to do initially and that great reception, our TSE 170 will begin to move in that direction as well. Remember the products we can't sell those for clinical use. And so we are evaluating what's happening with the FDA before we begin to push those toward regulatory approval."

As we shared a few weeks ago, first quarter revenue was $572 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year period and lower than the guidance we provided in January. Our analysis, subsequent to the preannoun",1161,"Thanks, Rebecca, and good afternoon, everyone. As we shared a few weeks ago, first quarter revenue was $572 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year period and lower than the guidance we provided in January. Our analysis, subsequent to the preannouncement, has identified 2 key contributors to the shortfall: orders we booked that were not recognizable as revenue, and instrument orders that we were expecting but did not receive. Additionally, after quarter end, we received a disappointing outlook from Europe, which is central to the guidance reduction for the remainder of the year. I will address the Q1 factors, and Francis will address our outlook and action plan. 
The majority of the shortfall in Q1 resulted from orders booked that did not translate to revenue. A combination of factors contributed, including: capacity constraints in array manufacturing, resulting in back orders; orders that were received late in the quarter, resulting in systems in transit, and therefore, not converted to revenue; customer-initiated requests for delayed shipment or conditions outside our control for delayed revenue recognition; and partial revenue deferrals due to increasing complexity of large deal structures, particularly in the case of high-throughput instruments, including the HiSeq X. Some of these deferrals will be recognized in Q2, while others will convert to revenue over the rest of the year. Some were controllable by us and some were not, but none are related to fundamental market demand. Individually, each was less than 1% of revenue, and that happens to a degree every quarter, but the combined effect was larger than we expected.
The second factor was HiSeq orders that were forecasted but were not perceived, accounting for $9 million of the shortfall. As a consequence, we shipped 19 fewer HiSeq 2500, 3000 and 4000 instruments than anticipated, valued at $14 million, which was partially offset by strength in other portions of the portfolio. We had anticipated sequential growth of 11 units rather than a decline of 8 units, which led to flat placements year-over-year.
Over the last several weeks, we've gone through a detailed analysis of the underlying drivers deal-by-deal. There were no dominant themes, but we did see a collection of factors, including: delays in funding release; customers opting to purchase NextSeqs; and one-off situations, such as pending lab moves, financing deliberations, contract reviews or an upcoming regulatory audit.
While outsourcing the service providers was also cited by a few customers, this is not a significant driver of our forward projection. This feedback confirmed our view on questions of competition and market capacity. While we can never be certain a few customers did not delay purchases to assess other platforms, our win rates remained stable, and to our knowledge, we did not lose competitive deal in Q1. 
We also did not get any information to indicate that excess market capacity was a factor. As you can see in our investor deck, high throughput utilization as a percentage of available sequencing capacity has been on an upward trend since Q3 '14, when normalized for one large order that we shipped in Q3 '15. One data collected from BaseSpace, which represents about 1/3 of the high-throughput installed base, confirms this analysis, showing roughly flat utilization for legacy HiSeq instruments, like HiSeq X, 3000 and 4000. 
Will-be announced initiatives like the Chinese precision medicine program to sequence millions of genomes and the AstraZeneca project to access 2 million genomes create the confidence that today's sequencing capacity represents for a small fraction of that necessary to meet the growing demand for populations' sequencing programs. 
Focusing now on products. Orders for HiSeq X exceeded our expectations, and we added 4 new customers, bringing the total to 31. Our outlook remains robust at 20 to 30 instrument orders per quarter. HiSeq X consumables also beat our forecast, despite the timing of customer shipments, lowering pull-through to below the guidance range. On a 4-quarter basis, which normalizes the impact of shipment timing, X utilization averaged 650,000 to 750,000 annually, a range we feel comfortable with going forward.
HiSeq pull-through is in our projected range of $300,000 to $350,000. For modeling purposes, we have removed 95 HiSeqs from our installed base, bringing the figure to just over 2,000 instruments, reflecting the units taken offline due to adoption of newer machines. 
Our benchtop instrument portfolio performed well in the quarter, and the outlook is consistent with our expectations coming into the year. This is being driven by lower-than-expected cannibalization of MiSeq, strong initial interest in MiniSeq and NextSeq adoption for NIPT in China. Benchtop consumables were strong in Q1, as both MiSeq and NextSeq saw utilization above their respective guidance ranges.
Microarrays were also an emerging bright spot this quarter, as revenue grew 1% versus the prior year period to almost $90 million, and orders dramatically exceeded our expectations with growth of 85%.
A new consortium array, which will be in shipping in Q4, and the demand for DTC customers, contributed to the strong order results. 
Shipments to our clinical customers grew approximately 20% in the quarter. As we've noted on multiple earnings calls, we've been expecting some NIPT services customers to ship to run samples in-house on our sequencers, a significant part of that shift occurred this quarter. Normalizing for the effect of the lower revenue, because we're not getting the full service revenue, our remaining clinical customer base revenue grew 24%. 
NIPT shipments grew 10%, or 28% after adjusting for the shift, versus the prior year. We now believe most payers will next assess average risk coverage decisions in 2017, which is later than we had anticipated. Despite this, the rate of adoption is meeting our forecast, and we expect further acceleration as reimbursement decisions are made. We believe the delay is a matter of focus by the labs that are working to obtain a network designation for existing coverages as opposed to driving incremental average risk coverage for faster return on investment.
Oncology shipments grew 9% adjusted for the large HiSeq X shipments seen in the first quarter of last year. This growth rate is lower than that we typically see from this market, due to a large number of orders shipped in the prior year period. We continue to expect expanded adoption in 2016, which will be fueled in part by the launch of TruSight Tumor 170 later this year. 
In summary, while we're not happy with our performance in Q1, we do not believe our results are related to a change in fundamental market demand. Instead, timing of instrument orders is creating late-quarter revenue uncertainty, some of which we can and will take specific actions to mitigate and unique customer situations impacting the HiSeq order rate. With a lower European forecast, it was important that we realign our full year expectations. We continue to believe that demand for the next-generation sequencing is far more robust than our first quarter result or the outlook our European forecast suggests. 
I'll now turn the call over to Francis."

Today, I plan to provide further details on our outlook and action plan. 
Europe revenue declined year-over-year in Q1, missing our projections, and we are forecasting low- to mid-single-digit growth for the full year. Revenue from the Americas grew 14%, representing a slightly slower start than we anticipated for the reasons Jay outlined. But we remain confident in the region's full year projection of mid-teens growth. 
Asia Pacific revenue declined 5%, as forecasted, due primarily to a large HiSeq X comparable. During the quarter, we began to see customer purchasing patterns in Japan improved, as research funds are now being released. It's too early to call this a resurgence, but the signs are certainly more positive.  Our Asia Pacific region is also forecasting mid-teens growth for the year. 
The Q1 challengers are responsible for a minimal change in full year outlook. With the benefit of 2 additional weeks of analysis since our preannouncement, we are more confident that Q1 was a result of operational challenges and not market demand. By far, the largest driver of our lower guidance is our lack of visibility in Europe, as evidenced by the drop in the region's full year forecast 3 months after we completed our budget. We're taking steps to enhance visibility and improve our execution in the region.  In the meantime, we have incorporated the reduced outlook from Europe into our projections. 
We are focusing on 3 areas to deliver on our full year. First, we are making improvements to our sales process. To address the variability in instrument orders and shipments during the last months of the quarters, we are focusing the sales team on early closure of instrument orders. In addition, large instrument contracts, including those for HiSeq X, have become more complex, particularly in Europe. And so we are simplifying and standardizing deals.  Finally, we are building out our manufacturing capacity for arrays so that we are able to clear the backorders and meet the increasing demand. 
Second, we are committed to improving the execution and outlook in Europe. As we mentioned a few weeks ago, we recently brought in an interim sales leader in Europe, who has already established accountability and ownership for the revised forecast and is driving to the updated expectations. He has already put in place greater discipline around opportunity management, accuracy of our CRM data and quoting. 
In addition, we're making good progress in our search for a permanent General Manager with large global company experience to ensure that our European organization realizes its full potential. 
The last step in our plan is focused on expense management. Last year, we added close to 900 employees, 500,000 square feet of real estate commitments and a new global ERP system. While these investments were necessary to support both of the growth we have experienced and our ongoing market opportunities, we recognized the need to meaningfully slow down the pace of investment in 2016, given our updated outlook. We do not expect to have broad changes to our product portfolio or development pipeline, but do have other opportunities to delay initiatives that are less impactful to the long-term outlook. We are working on our 2016 rebrand and have incorporated those improvements into our guidance for the remainder of the year. As a result, excluding GRAIL and Helix, our operating margin target for the year is expected to be 34.5%. 
While disappointing, our Q1 results have not dampened our conviction in our market opportunity or our ability to deliver innovative technology to capture those markets. I am personally committed and excited to move this organization to realize our mission: benefit patients and deliver shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our first quarter results."
29753,331335788,971679,"Illumina Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Illumina, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Francis.

While revenue for the quarter miss our guidance, orders of over $700 million significantly beat our expectations. We built more than $100 million of sequencing consumable backlog, most of which is expected to be delivered this year. As a reminder, we typically see higher sequencing consumable orders in the first quarter, ahead of annual list of price increases. 
Instrument revenue declined 20% year-over-year to $118 million, given the large HiSeq X shipments in the first quarter last year, which accounts for more than $30 million of decline.
Consumable revenue was $361 million, an increase of 17% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Sequencing consumable revenue grew 24% over Q1 of last year to approximately $300 million. 
Services and other revenue, which include genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts, grew approximately 12% versus Q1 2015 to $89 million. This improvement was driven by extended maintenance contracts associated with our larger sequencing installed base of genotyping services, partially offset by decline in NIPT service revenue, given the shift to in-house testing as expected. Going forward, we expect new tests and our partners [ph] to least partially offset the further impact from the transition of these 2 customers. 
Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude noncash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures as well as our GAAP EPS guidance, both of which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation.  Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders. 
Our adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 71.7%, flat compared to the fourth quarter, as the benefit of favorable consumables mix was offset by lower absorption. Year-over-year, adjusted gross margins contracted 50 basis points, as the positive impact on consumables mix was more than offset by lower instrument margin associated with fewer HiSeq X shipments as well as a decline in services margin.
Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $113 million or 19.8% of revenue, including $5 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $103 million or 17.5% revenue in the fourth quarter, higher due to headcount additions and investment in GRAIL, Helix and development projects, including Project Firefly. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $125 million or 21.9% of revenue, including $3 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $124 million or 20.9% of revenue in Q4.
Adjusted operating margins were 30.1% compared to 33.4% in the fourth quarter and 39.3% in the prior year period. Excluding GRAIL and Helix, operating margins were 31.6% in the first quarter. The year-over-year decline is attributable to the lower gross margins and increased employee-related expenses. 
Stock-based compensation expense equaled $35 million, flat compared to Q4. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.5% compared to 24.5% in the first quarter of last year, and non-GAAP net income was $106 million. This resulted in Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.71, which included approximately $0.04 and $0.02 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix, respectively. This quarterly results compared to non-GAAP net income and EPS was $135 million and $0.91 in the first quarter of 2015, respectively.
We reported first quarter GAAP net income of $90 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared to net income of $137 million or $0.92 per diluted share in the prior year period. As a reminder, prior period results include a pretax gain of $15 million from the positive [ph] sale of our minority interest in Sequenta, when acquired by Adaptive Biotechnologies.
Cash flow from operations equaled $40 million, lower versus the prior year due to the impact of operating expense growth. Q1 DSO totaled 64 days, equal to last quarter, and inventory rose to $288 million given the quarterly shortfall in sequencing instruments and a continued buildup of consumable safety stock.
Capital expenditures in Q1 were $53 million, higher than the $37 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to our real estate build-outs. Consequently, Q1 free cash flow was negative $14 million. During the quarter, we retired the remaining $76 million at 0.25% 2015 convertible notes and ended the quarter with approximately $1.34 billion in cash and short-terms investments, including the cash balances of GRAIL and Helix.
Looking forward, we now expect total company revenue growth of 12% year-over-year. Beyond the first quarter NIPT [ph], the additional decline versus our original expectation of 16% is due to the lowered outlook in Europe, which range from high teens growth to the low to mid-single digits, including a smaller contribution of fund from the Genome England project. 
Our outlook in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions is much more robust as both are expected to grow in the mid-teens for full year, roughly in line with our expectations, due in part of strong orders in the first quarter. For these regions, in the second half, we expect to see HiSeq sales increase, but remain short of our original expectation. We believe this will be more than offset by our planned MiSeq placements, given more than expected cannibalization, as well as an increase in array revenue, NextSeq consumables and HiSeq X placements.  We also continued to expect strong adoption of [indiscernible] 4 clinical markets in 2016. 
We are forecasting Q2 revenue of $590 million to $595 million, driven by sequential seasonality in Japan and roughly flat HiSeq X shipments. We're not forecasting an uptick in other HiSeq instrument shipments until the second half. This Q2 revenue guidance implies a meaningful back-half acceleration. Our confidence in delivering to these projections stems from our existing backlog, 1/3 of which is shippable in Q3 and Q4, and our pipeline.
We are projecting Q2 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.74, as higher revenue is expected to be largely offset by a sequential increase in operating expenses, both from the headcount additions in the first quarter and additional GRAIL and Helix spend. The steps we are taking to reduce spending will have a marginal impact in Q2 and a more meaningful impact in the second half of the year.
We anticipate significant EPS leverage in the second half, driven by the acceleration of the revenue growth and our spending actions. For the full year, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $3.25 to $3.45, which includes GRAIL dilution of $0.20, an increase of $0.05 versus our prior estimate. Illumina is retaining almost all the GRAIL losses in net income attributable to Illumina shareholders, significantly greater than our majority ownership percentage due to an unexpected accounting treatment. We are in discussions with GRAIL regarding update to the equity structure. 
Our updated non-GAAP EPS guidance on GRAIL dilution commentary includes our expectation that we will continue to recognize most of the losses in the second quarter, and that drops substantially in the second half to closer to our ownership, thanks [ph] structural change [indiscernible] contemplated in Q2 and the accounting treatment we are anticipating. Any delays to this time line could have a negative impact of up to $0.04 per quarter in the second half.
In closing, from the management team, we have a number of matters to address that we have outlined today, including our in-quarter linearity, our execution in Europe, our rate of investment and the GRAIL equity structure. We are setting our outlook so significantly as uncharacteristic to our company and unacceptable to us as a team. We are committed to delivering strong results consistent with our track records and our confidence in the long-term opportunity for our business remain high.

So the first one is maybe as a follow-up to Tycho, regarding your guidance for the year. Some seem to be focused on what seems to be some back-end loading of the guidance. Does your guidance reflect an assumption that demand gets better or execution gets a lot better in the second half? Or is your guidance simply reflecting that comparisons get a lot more favorable in the second half? Keeping in mind first half growth, last year was around 30% and second half growth was 17%. It doesn't seem like you're baking in a whole lot more for the second half than the first half. It seems like it's more comps-driven? Is that fair?

Yes, I've highlighted over the past year or 18 months, that much of the market development that has to happen now in sequencing falls on Illumina that we don't have a lot of other large companies we're spending marketing dollars developing markets, and so that is a key for us to do more than it ever has been. And the big markets we're opening up now have each their own unique set of issues, whether its reimbursement or regulatory, or in the case of GRAIL, clinical trial work. And so it is -- it does take some time to open up those new markets. Having said that, there's no question that Illumina is still driven by product innovation. In all of our businesses, we analytically see a cycle that's related to product cycles in that whenever we launch new platforms, we get a surge of new orders for those instruments and then the following year, the consumables begin to catch up and then that platform begins to level out over time. So every platform has an S-curve associated with it. It is true that we are a larger company now and therefore, each individual S-curve has a smaller effect on the total revenue of the company. So there's no getting around that fact, and so we have much greater diversity in our business now, which is a good thing, but each individual product launch probably has less of an impact than it might have been back when we had only one sequencer. For example, you replace the GA with the HiSeq. Everybody but a HiSeq is the only product in the market. That's not quite where we are today."

I'm just trying to exactly understand how we should interpret short of the various levels of capacity utilization across the base, and then how we should think about certain points, typically, if you think that past utilization it sort of signals capital purchasing depending on what level it is. So how do we interpret what levels for you to signal that you should see an increase in instrumentation demand versus maybe a moderation at a certain level and how you used sort of attempt to manage them. I'm just trying to exactly interpret what we're supposed to gain from this."

Firstly, the capacity calculation itself, which is based on the actual mix of types of kit that our customers buy and run. Clearly, that's increasing quarter-over-quarter as a result of the -- both the install base, a little bit of the change in mix, and that's coming out with higher throughput instruments, which I'll outcome back to when I look at the capacity utilization chart. If you think about the percentages, what you probably -- what you don't want to see is a very low percentage of utilization. That would reflect a lot of spare capacity in the market, which would have read-through, I think, to future instrument purchases. You're obviously, not going to see utilizations based on our trajectory, our past history, our trajectory of much over 50% on an ongoing basis due to the decentralization of the market. Only in a centralized market would you see it much, much higher than this. So if you look at the data, what you're seeing is -- you see a couple of inflection points where the utilization tends to stabilize. That happens to coincide, in fact, in one case, go down, if you look at 3Q '14. That coincides with when we put new capacity in the market. So back then was the B4 run kit, and that created an instant increase in available capacity, which caused the dip in utilization. You can see that recovered. Same thing as when we introduced the HiSeq 4000. That had an effect on the growth and utilization because we introduced new capacity into the market with that instrument as well. And then, what you're seeing, if you see it normalize for that one large order is a fairly consistent growth rate, which is exactly what you would want to see, which I believe -- we believe reflects that capacity is not -- there's not excess capacity in the market. It's being utilized as a rate that is increasing over time in spite of the increased volumes or capacities that we're putting out there with the higher throughput instruments and kits. Is that right?"

But we have a broad product line now. And over time, various portions of that product line will age out and they'll be replaced by brand-new products that we bring into the market that, of course, will have dramatic new innovations built into them. And we've been working on the fundamental technologies around these and we see continued improvements in what we did in NextSeq and then how we learned from MiSeq and NextSeq and made a MiniSeq. And many of those kinds of improvements will get bundled into the whatever the next system architecture is. And clearly, we are working across the entire product portfolio and we'll launch products into the segments we think are the richest opportunities there are in.

So I'll start with the order conversation, Steve. Obviously, a large part of the orders that we booked in the first quarter were shipped in the first quarter as you would normally expect, but we've built significant backlog and I called out specifically sequencing consumable backlog. And that will ship mostly through this year, in fact almost entirely there's some that carries over into 2017 and beyond, but most of that is going to ship this year. So the way that I would think about that is it's kind of an advanced ordering of reagent purchases that we're going to get or we should get anyway throughout the year. So it gives us some confidence, but I wouldn't think of it as necessarily incremental. It is relative to last year and prior years. It is larger than we've traditionally seen. And so it gives us all bit more of the backlog than we would normally have at this time. And then I also mentioned that we have about 1/3 of our ending backlog for the quarter, rolling over into the second half, which gives us some confidence. Obviously, that includes a portion of those sequencing consumables that I just talked about. So nothing more kind of quantitative than that at this point. But other than the sequencing consumables, I would say pretty pleased with the array business and the consumer-driven activity there, which has been another helpful part of building backlog. What it wasn't necessarily was a significant proportion of instrument backlog. That's not -- it's become much more of a -- instruments have become more of a turn in the quarter type of activity. We don't necessarily come into the quarter with significant levels of backlog like you saw us have in Q1 of '15, and it's much more normalized now."

And so as we've mapped out all those cycles, there still remains a possibility of some of them late in 2016, but the majority of them fall in 2017, which is why we decided that we think the bolus of these coverage decisions will be made in 2017. With respect to cancer, the narrative really isn't about stable reimbursement because the vast majority of the cancer tests aren't reimbursed today, even Foundation Medicine isn't. And so most of that market is being driven by labs running these tests for market share reasons. Most of the labs are losing money on the cancer tests. So the reimbursement opportunity in oncology lies ahead of us, and it's something that many of our customers are working on. It's an area that I'll be spending a fair amount of my time on in the next year, and it's related to the standardization challenges that I think exists here. We're in the phase of the oncology market where it's becoming increasingly fragmented with lots and lots of different panel products. And one of the things that Illumina needs to do is begin to re-converge that market into a more standard set of products and more standard set of processes so that payers can get their heads around what is a -- something they should be paying for, and that's something our TST 15 is attempting to do initially and that's a great reception. Our TST 170 will begin to move in that direction as well. But remember, those are already low products because we can't sell those for clinical use. And so we are evaluating what's happening with the FDA before we begin to push those toward regulatory approval."

As we shared a few weeks ago, first quarter revenue was $572 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year period and lower than the guidance we provided in January. Our analysis, subsequent to the preannoun",1160,"Thanks, Rebecca, and good afternoon, everyone. As we shared a few weeks ago, first quarter revenue was $572 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year period and lower than the guidance we provided in January. Our analysis, subsequent to the preannouncement, has identified 2 key contributors to the shortfall: orders we booked that were not recognizable as revenue, and instrument orders that we were expecting but did not receive. Additionally, after quarter end we received a disappointing outlook from Europe, which is central to the guidance reduction for the remainder of the year. I will address the Q1 factors, and Francis will address our outlook and action plan. 
The majority of the shortfall in Q1 resulted from orders booked that did not translate to revenue. A combination of factors contributed, including: capacity constraints in array manufacturing, resulting in back orders; orders that were received late in the quarter, resulting in systems in transit, and therefore not converted to revenue; customer-initiated requests for delayed shipment or conditions outside our control that delayed revenue recognition; and partial revenue deferrals due to increasing complexity of large deal structures, particularly in the case of high-throughput instruments, including the HiSeq X. Some of these deferrals will be recognized in Q2, while others will convert to revenue over the rest of the year. Some were controllable by us and some were not, but none are related to fundamental market demand. Individually, each was less than 1% of revenue, and that happens to a degree every quarter, but the combined effect was larger than we expected.
The second factor was HiSeq orders that were forecasted but were not received, accounting for $9 million of the shortfall. As a consequence, we shipped 19 fewer HiSeq 2500, 3000 and 4000 instruments than anticipated, valued at $14 million, which was partially offset by strength in other portions of the portfolio. We had anticipated sequential growth of 11 units rather than a decline of 8 units, which led to flat placements year-over-year.
Over the last several weeks we've gone through a detailed analysis of the underlying drivers deal-by-deal. There were no dominant themes, but we did see a collection of factors, including delays in funding release; customers opting to purchase NextSeqs; and one-off situations, such as pending lab moves, financing deliberations, contract reviews or an upcoming regulatory audit.
While outsourcing the service providers was also cited by a few customers, this is not a significant driver of our forward projection. This feedback confirmed our view on questions of competition and market capacity. While we can never be certain a few customers did not delay purchases to assess other platforms, our win rates remain stable, and to our knowledge we did not lose a competitive deal in Q1. 
We also did not get any information to indicate that excess market capacity was a factor. As you can see in our investor deck, high throughput utilization as a percentage of available sequencing capacity has been on an upward trend since Q3 '14, when normalized for one large order that we shipped in Q3 '15. Run data collected from BaseSpace, which represents about 1/3 of the high-throughput installed base, confirms this analysis, showing roughly flat utilization for legacy HiSeq instruments, like HiSeq X, 3000 and 4000. 
Newly announced initiatives like the Chinese precision medicine program to sequence millions of genomes and the AstraZeneca project to access 2 million genomes create the confidence that today's sequencing capacity represents but a small fraction of that necessary to meet the growing demand for populations' sequencing programs. 
Focusing now on products. Orders for HiSeq X exceeded our expectations, and we added 4 new customers, bringing the total to 31. Our outlook remains robust at 20 to 30 instrument orders per quarter. HiSeq X consumables also beat our forecast, despite the timing of customer shipments lowering pull-through to below the guidance range. On a 4-quarter basis, which normalizes the impact of shipment timing, X utilization averaged $650,000 to $750,000 annually, a range we feel comfortable with going forward.
HiSeq pull-through is in our projected range of $300,000 to $350,000. For modeling purposes, we have removed 95 HiSeqs from our installed base, bringing the figure to just over 2,000 instruments, reflecting the units taken offline due to adoption of newer machines. 
Our benchtop instrument portfolio performed well in the quarter, and the outlook is consistent with our expectations coming into the year. This is being driven by lower-than-expected cannibalization of MiSeq, strong initial interest in MiniSeq and NextSeq adoption for NIPT in China. Benchtop consumables were strong in Q1, as both MiSeq and NextSeq saw utilization above their respective guidance ranges.
Microarrays were also an emerging bright spot this quarter, as revenue grew 1% versus the prior year period to almost $90 million, and orders dramatically exceeded our expectations with growth of 85%.
A new consortium array which will begin shipping in Q4, and demand from DTC customers, contributed to the strong order results. 
Shipments to our clinical customers grew approximately 20% in the quarter. As we've noted on multiple earnings calls, we've been expecting some NIPT services customers to shift to running samples in-house on our sequencers, and a significant part of that shift occurred this quarter. Normalizing for the effect of the lower revenue, because we're not getting the full service revenue, our remaining clinical customer base revenue grew 24%. 
NIPT shipments grew 10%, or 28% after adjusting for the shift, versus the prior year. We now believe most payers will next assess average risk coverage decisions in 2017, which is later than we had anticipated. Despite this, the rate of adoption is meeting our forecast, and we expect further acceleration as reimbursement decisions are made. We believe the delay is a matter of focus by the labs that are working to obtain a network designation for existing coverages as opposed to driving incremental average risk coverage for faster return on investment.
Oncology shipments grew 9% adjusted for the large HiSeq X shipments seen in the first quarter of last year. This growth rate is lower than that we typically see from this market, due to a large number of orders shipped in the prior year period. We continue to expect expanded adoption in 2016, which will be fueled in part by the launch of TruSight Tumor 170 later this year. 
In summary, while we're not happy with our performance in Q1, we do not believe our results are related to a change in fundamental market demand. Instead, timing of instrument orders is creating late-quarter revenue uncertainty, some of which we can and will take specific actions to mitigate, and unique customer situations impacting the HiSeq order rate. With a lower European forecast, it was important that we realign our full year expectations. We continue to believe that demand for next-generation sequencing is far more robust than our first quarter result or the outlook our European forecast suggests. 
I'll now turn the call over to Francis."

Today I plan to provide further details on our outlook and action plan. 
Europe revenue declined 2% year-over-year in Q1, missing our projections, and we are forecasting low- to mid-single-digit growth for the full year. Revenue from the Americas grew 14%, representing a slightly slower start than we anticipated, for the reasons Jay outlined. But we remain confident in the region's full year projection of mid-teens growth. 
Asia Pacific revenue declined 5%, as forecasted, due primarily to a large HiSeq X comparable. During the quarter we began to see customer purchasing patterns in Japan improved, as research funds are now being released. It's too early to call this a resurgence, but the signs are certainly more positive.  Our Asia Pacific region is also forecasting mid-teens growth for the year. 
The Q1 challenges are responsible for a minimal change in full year outlook. With the benefit of 2 additional weeks of analysis since our preannouncement, we are more confident that Q1 was a result of operational challenges and not market demand. By far, the largest driver of our lower guidance is our lack of visibility in Europe, as evidenced by the drop in the region's full year forecast 3 months after we completed our budget. We're taking steps to enhance visibility and improve our execution in the region.  In the meantime, we have incorporated the reduced outlook from Europe into our projections. 
We are focusing on 3 areas to deliver on our full year. First, we are making improvements to our sales process. To address the variability in instrument orders and shipments during the last months of the quarters, we are focusing the sales team on early closure of instrument orders. In addition, large instrument contracts, including those for HiSeq X, have become more complex, particularly in Europe. And so we are simplifying and standardizing deals.  Finally, we are building out our manufacturing capacity for arrays so that we are able to clear the back orders and meet the increasing demand. 
Second, we are committed to improving the execution and outlook in Europe. As we mentioned a few weeks ago, we recently brought in an interim sales leader in Europe, who has already established accountability and ownership for the revised forecast and is driving to the updated expectations. He has already put in place greater discipline around opportunity management, accuracy of our CRM data and quoting. 
In addition, we're making good progress in our search for a permanent General Manager with large global company experience to ensure that our European organization realizes its full potential. 
The last step in our plan is focused on expense management. Last year we added close to 900 employees, 500,000 square feet of real estate commitments and a new global ERP system. While these investments were necessary to support both the growth we have experienced and our ongoing market opportunities, we recognize the need to meaningfully slow down the pace of investment in 2016, given our updated outlook. We do not expect to have broad changes to our product portfolio or development pipeline but do have other opportunities to delay initiatives that are less impactful to the long-term outlook. We are working on our 2016 rebrand and have incorporated those improvements into our guidance for the remainder of the year. As a result, excluding GRAIL and Helix, our operating margin target for the year is expected to be 34.5%. 
While disappointing, our Q1 results have not dampened our conviction in our market opportunity or our ability to deliver innovative technology to capture those markets. I am personally committed and excited to move this organization to realize our mission: benefit patients and deliver shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our first quarter results."
29753,331335788,971731,"Illumina Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Illumina, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Francis.

While revenue for the quarter missed our guidance, orders of over $700 million significantly beat our expectations. We built more than $100 million of sequencing consumable backlog, most of which is expected to be delivered this year. As a reminder, we typically see higher sequencing consumable orders in the first quarter, ahead of annual list price increases. 
Instrument revenue declined 20% year-over-year to $118 million, given the large HiSeq X shipments in the first quarter last year, which accounts for more than $30 million of decline.
Consumable revenue was $361 million, an increase of 17% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Sequencing consumable revenue grew 24% over Q1 of last year to approximately $300 million. 
Services and other revenue, which include genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts, grew approximately 12% versus Q1 2015 to $89 million. This improvement was driven by extended maintenance contracts associated with our larger sequencing installed base of genotyping services, partially offset by a decline in NIPT service revenue, given the shift to in-house testing as expected. Going forward, we expect new tests and our partners [ph] to at least partially offset the further impact from the transition of these 2 customers. 
Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude noncash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures as well as our GAAP EPS guidance, both of which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation.  Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders. 
Our adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 71.7%, flat compared to the fourth quarter, as the benefit of favorable consumables mix was offset by lower absorption. Year-over-year, adjusted gross margins contracted 50 basis points, as the positive impact of consumables mix was more than offset by lower instrument margin associated with fewer HiSeq X shipments as well as a decline in services margin.
Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $113 million or 19.8% of revenue, including $5 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $103 million or 17.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter, higher due to headcount additions and investment in GRAIL, Helix and development projects, including Project Firefly. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $125 million or 21.9% of revenue, including $3 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $124 million or 20.9% of revenue in Q4.
Adjusted operating margins were 30.1% compared to 33.4% in the fourth quarter and 39.3% in the prior year period. Excluding GRAIL and Helix, operating margins were 31.6% in the first quarter. The year-over-year decline is attributable to the lower gross margins and increased employee-related expenses. 
Stock-based compensation expense equaled $35 million, flat compared to Q4. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.5% compared to 24.5% in the first quarter of last year, and non-GAAP net income was $106 million. This resulted in Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.71, which included approximately $0.04 and $0.02 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix, respectively. This quarterly result compared to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $135 million and $0.91 in the first quarter of 2015, respectively.
We reported first quarter GAAP net income of $90 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared to net income of $137 million or $0.92 per diluted share in the prior year period. As a reminder, prior period results include a pretax gain of $15 million from the partial sale of our minority interest in Sequenta when acquired by Adaptive Biotechnologies.
Cash flow from operations equaled $40 million, lower versus the prior year due to the impact of the operating expense growth. Q1 DSO totaled 64 days, equal to last quarter, and inventory rose to $288 million, given the quarterly shortfall in sequencing instruments and a continued buildup of consumable safety stock.
Capital expenditures in Q1 were $53 million, higher than the $37 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to our real estate build-outs. Consequently, Q1 free cash flow was negative $14 million. During the quarter we retired the remaining $76 million at 0.25% 2016 convertible notes and ended the quarter with approximately $1.34 billion in cash and short-term investments, including the cash balances of GRAIL and Helix.
Looking forward, we now expect total company revenue growth of 12% year-over-year. Beyond the first quarter [indiscernible] the additional decline versus our original expectation of 16% is due to the lowered outlook for Europe, which went from high teens growth to low to mid-single digits, including a smaller contribution than planned from the Genome England project. 
Our outlook in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions is much more robust as both are expected to grow in the mid-teens for the full year, roughly in line with our expectations, due in part of strong orders in the first quarter. For these regions, in the second half we expect to see HiSeq sales increase but remain short of our original expectations. We believe this will be more than offset by overplanned [ph] MiSeq placements, given more than expected cannibalization, as well as an increase in array revenue, NextSeq consumables and HiSeq X placements.  We also continue to expect strong adoption of [indiscernible] for clinical markets in 2016. 
We are forecasting Q2 revenue of $590 million to $595 million, driven by sequential seasonality in Japan and roughly flat HiSeq X shipments. We're not forecasting an uptick in other HiSeq instrument shipments until the second half. This Q2 revenue guidance implies a meaningful back-half acceleration. Our confidence in delivering to these projections stems from our existing backlog, 1/3 of which is shippable in Q3 and Q4, and our pipeline.
We are projecting Q2 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.74, as higher revenue is expected to be largely offset by a sequential increase in operating expenses, both from the headcount additions in the first quarter and additional GRAIL and Helix spend. The steps we are taking to reduce spending will have a marginal impact in Q2 and a more meaningful impact in the second half of the year.
We anticipate significant EPS leverage in the second half, driven by the acceleration of the revenue growth and our spending actions. For the full year, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $3.35 to $3.45, which includes GRAIL dilution of $0.20, an increase of $0.05 versus our prior estimate. Illumina is retaining almost all the GRAIL losses in net income attributable to Illumina shareholders significantly greater than our majority ownership percentage due to an unexpected accounting treatment. We are in discussions with GRAIL regarding updates to the equity structure. 
Our updated non-GAAP EPS guidance and GRAIL dilution commentary includes our expectation that we will continue to recognize most of the losses in the second quarter, and that drops substantially in the second half to closer to our ownership, based on the structural changes that are being contemplated in Q2 and the accounting treatment we are anticipating. Any delay to this timeline could have a negative impact of up to $0.04 per quarter in the second half.
In closing, from the management team, we have a number of matters to address that we have outlined today, including our in-quarter linearity, our execution in Europe, our rate of investment and the GRAIL equity structure. Resetting our outlook so significantly is uncharacteristic of our company and unacceptable to us as a team. We are committed to delivering strong results consistent with our track record, and our confidence in the long-term opportunity for our business remain high.

He has also instituted a process that frankly we use in the U.S. around managing the pipeline for some of our lower-end instruments. And so that alone has started to give us better visibility into when deals are expected to close over the course of this quarter and allowed us to add urgency and also manage more for a weekly close process rather than a close process that's so heavily tailored towards the end of the quarter. That does a few things. One, it give us much better visibility into what we're working for the course of the quarter, it helps drive urgency into the team, and it helps make sure that we understand whether we have the pipe to get the deals we need."

I've highlighted over the past year or 18 months that much of the market development that has to happen now in sequencing falls on Illumina, that we don't have a lot of other large companies who are spending marketing dollars developing markets. And so that is key for us to do more than it ever has been. And the big markets we're opening up now have each their own unique set of issues, whether it's reimbursement or regulatory or, in the case of GRAIL, clinical trial work. And so it is -- it does take some time to open up those new markets. 
Having said that, there's no question that Illumina is still driven by product innovation. In all of our businesses we analytically see a cycle that's related to product cycles, in that whenever we launch new platforms we get a surge of new orders for those instruments and then the following year the consumables begin to catch up and then that platform begins to level out over time. So every platform has an S-curve associated with it. 
It is true that we are a larger company now and therefore each individual S-curve has a smaller effect on the total revenue of the company. So there's no getting around that fact. And so we have much greater diversity in our business now, which is a good thing, but each individual product launch probably is less of an impact than it might have been back when we had only one sequencer. For example, when we replaced the GA with the HiSeq, everybody bought a HiSeq because it's the only product in the market. That's not quite where we are today."

One is there is an opportunity for us to get more actively involved in the development of those markets so we can accelerate the adoption of NGS into the different markets we play in and work with our customers to help them with things like the trial that we're doing, the STAR trial we're doing in the PGS space in the IVF world, for example. We're also getting more engaged with our customers in the payer community and market access programs. And part, as Jay said, of what we do to develop the market is actually bring new instruments into the market, which can catalyze the market through access to a lower price point. So certainly a set of things we are doing to operationalize developing those markets. 
Separate from that, there is a change in how you sell at this scale and that, in addition to sort of tracking the big deals that get a high level of visibility at the executive level, a scalable sales process needs to make sure that we're taking care of the flow business and that we do have a really good visibility into pipeline, how pipelines are progressing, the opportunities.

Firstly, the capacity calculation itself, which is based on the actual mix of types of kit that our customers buy and run, clearly that's increasing quarter-over-quarter as a result of the -- both the installed base, a little bit of a change in mix, and us coming out with higher throughput instruments, which I'll come back to when I look at the capacity utilization chart. 
If you think about the percentages, what you probably -- what you don't want to see is a very low percentage of utilization. That would reflect a lot of spare capacity in the market, which would have a read-through, I think, to future instrument purchases. You're obviously not going to see utilizations based on our trajectory, our past history and our trajectory of much over 50% on an ongoing basis due to the decentralization of the market. Only in a centralized market would you see it much, much higher than this. 
So if you look at the data, what you're seeing is -- you see a couple of inflection points where the utilization tends to stabilize. That happens to coincide -- in fact in one case go down, if you look at 3Q '14. That coincides with when we put new capacity in the market. So back then was the B4 run kit, and that created an instant increase in available capacity, which caused a dip in utilization. As you can see that recovered. 
Same thing as when we introduced the HiSeq 4000. That had an effect on the growth and utilization because we introduced new capacity into the market with that instrument as well. And then what you're seeing, if you see it normalize for that one large order, is a fairly consistent growth rate, which is exactly what you would want to see, which I believe -- we believe reflects that the capacity is not -- there's not excess capacity in the market. It's being utilized at a rate that is increasing over time in spite of the increased volumes or capacities that we're putting out there with the higher throughput instruments and kits. Does that..."

There's obviously a couple of -- some very strong candidates to participate, and those are large entities, some of which own instruments already, some of which don't. So we think they will buy in advance to have some installation, and perhaps the pull-through will be a little bit lower on those in the early stages. But they should get very highly utilized once the program begins to ramp up. So sure, we could have a little bit of lower utilization locally on some instruments, but that's not atypical. I mean, people sometimes do that for other programs as well. And we'll take that into account in our forecast and our planning."

Just so we can, again, put it in a little bit more context. 
And then, Jay, I wanted to follow up on a couple of comments you made in the prepared remarks on clinical. First, on NIPT, I was a little surprised that, given that we're here in May of 2016, that you talked about some reimbursement decisions around NIPT getting delayed out to '17. Maybe I'm just overly optimistic there, but I wonder if there might be some hope for the second half of '16. Curious what it is you're seeing there. And then, just to round it out on clinical, on the clinical cancer side, I just want to make sure I understand the narrative. Is it stable reimbursement, new products drives re-acceleration? Is that the way to think about it?"

Obviously, a large part of the orders that we booked in the first quarter were shipped in the first quarter, as you would normally expect. But we built significant backlog and I called out specifically sequencing consumable backlog. And that will ship mostly through this year, in fact almost entirely. There's some that carries over into 2017 and beyond, but most of that is going to ship this year. 
So the way that I would think about that is it's kind of an advanced ordering of reagent purchases that we're going to get or we should get, anyway, throughout the year. So it gives us some confidence, but I wouldn't think of it as necessarily incremental. It is, relative to last year and prior years, it is larger than we've traditionally seen. And so it gives us a little bit more of the backlog than we would normally have at this time. 
And then I also mentioned that we have about 1/3 of our ending backlog for the quarter rolling over into the second half, which gives us some confidence. Obviously that includes a portion of those sequencing consumables that I just talked about. 
So nothing more kind of quantitative than that at this point. But other than the sequencing consumables, I would say been pretty pleased with the array business and the consumer-driven activity there, which has been another helpful part of building backlog. What it wasn't, necessarily, was a significant proportion of instrument backlog. That's not -- it's become much more of a -- instruments have become more of a turn in the quarter type of activity. We don't necessarily come into the quarter with significant levels of backlog like you saw us have in Q1 of '15. And it's much more normalized now."

And so that growth in the backlog was more than we've typically seen in Q1. So we felt really good about the incoming order rate. 
With respect to NIPT, what we're seeing is that the large payers, the majors there tend to assess coverage decisions on specific dates. So they're on a cycle. And so if they're not on cycle to do this in 2016, there's little to no chance they're going to go off-cycle to approve this. And so as we've mapped out all those cycles, there still remained the possibility of some of them late in 2016, but the majority of them fall in 2017, which is why we've cited that we think the bolus of these coverage decisions will be made in 2017. 
With respect to cancer, the narrative really isn't about stable reimbursement because the vast majority of the cancer tests aren't reimbursed today, even Foundation Medicine's isn't. And so most of that market is being driven by labs running these tests for market share reasons. Most of the labs are losing money on the cancer tests. 
So the reimbursement opportunity in oncology lies ahead of us, and it's something that many of our customers are working on. It's an area that I'll be spending a fair amount of my time on in the next year. And it's related to the standardization challenges that I think exists here. We're in the phase of the oncology market where it's becoming increasingly fragmented with lots and lots of different panel products. And one of the things that Illumina needs to do is begin to re-converge that market into a more standard set of products and more standard set of processes so that payers can get their heads around what is a -- something they should be paying for. And that's something our TST 15 is attempting to do initially and that's had great reception. Our TST 170 will begin to move in that direction as well. But remember, those are RUO products because we can't sell those for clinical use. And so we are evaluating what's happening with the FDA before we begin to push those toward regulatory approval."

I'm pleased to report that Q2 exceeded our financial guidance as revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $600 million. In the Americas, revenue grew 13% versus the prior year, slightly exceeding our forecast. And Asia Pacific revenue grew 29%, driven primarily by China, which grew 70% on the back of demand for HiSeq X, benchtop measurements from clinical customers and ara and sequencing consumables. In Europe, revenue declined 4% versus Q2 of last year, a slight miss to forecast. We are making good progress in the action plan reenacted post the first quarter. 
Last quarter, we shared three areas that we're focusing on to deliver on our full year. The first area was improving our sales processes and specifically, lessening deal complexity and ensuring early closure of orders. We are making progress on deal structure and saw tangible results on the timing of deal closure. As a result, this quarter's linearity was the best we've experienced since the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Second, a commitment to improving the execution and outlook in EMEA. We are pleased with the early impact of the leadership and execution changes, including the now permanent appointment of Scott Thomas as Head of Sales and Paula Dowdy as the Regional General Manager. The turnaround will take time, even a bit longer than originally projected. We continue to believe the region's first half result and outlook is primarily reflective of execution challenges and not the result of changing demand or increasing competition. And we are confident in the ability of our EMEA leadership to achieve its full potential. 
Our third area of focus was expense management. I'm pleased to report that our expense replanning efforts were completed during the quarter, slowing down our pace of hiring, discretionary travel and other external spend without materially affecting our product development portfolio. This is partially reflected in our results for Q2 and fully reflected in our forecast for the year. 
In addition to the progress made on these three areas of focus, our manufacturing and supply chain execution also improved. Specifically, the back order situation for arrays has now been resolved and incremental capacity has been built to handle the increased demand. More broadly, our manufacturing and supply chain teams executed flawlessly due in part to new leadership. 
I'll now move on to an update in our markets. Our strategy to catalyze clinical markets is to deliver market-leading technologies and tailored solutions that enable customers to personalize patient care through genomics. In oncology, this strategy has resulted in pharma partnerships to develop and bring to market custom panels, including TruSight Tumor 15 which has been launched as a research use only and investigational use only product and TruSight Tumor 170, which will be launched as the research use only product later this year. We have also partnered with Amgen to develop a companion diagnostic test for Vectibix. The product development is complete and we're preparing the final module of our premarket approval application for the FDA. We expect this to be the first BMA submission based on next-generation sequencing, an exciting step towards fulfilling the promise of genomics and personalized medicine. 
With our sample-to-answer solutions and technology leadership, we expect our oncology revenue to grow, even as reimbursement and regulation play out over time. For example, this quarter saw a rebound in oncology testing shipments during the second quarter, which grew at more than 4x the rate of total company revenue growth although from a small base. In NIPT, as expected, we continue to see customer shift to in-house testing in our sequencers. As a result, the number of samples running through our testing facilities decreased to about 25,000 and we saw an offsetting uptick in sequencing consumables from these customers. Test fee revenue paid by customers to access the NIPT IP pool grew 19% year-over-year. We gained further traction in driving NIPT penetration in China as sample volumes accelerate and are on pace to double year-on-year. 
With the launch of our CE IDD VeriSeq and IPT assay in Europe late this year, we expect to see a further acceleration in that region. The launch of this product will be well timed, given the Dutch Health Council's recent endorsement of NIPT for all pregnancies. 
Focusing now on new products. Orders placed across our high throughput instrument portfolio increased sequentially and shipments were roughly flat. HiSeq X orders exceeded our guidance range and we added 3 new customers, bringing the total to 34. Again, this quarter demand came from new customers preparing to take part in the China PMI program, which has now allocated funding to more than 60 projects over the next 3 to 5 years. In fact, Chinese customers drove the majority of our HiSeq X shipments in the quarter. Going forward, our HiSeq X outlook remains robust at 20 to 30 instrument orders per quarter and we expect to see an increase in HiSeq placement in the Americas during the latter part of this year, which is supported by a solid pipeline. 
Our bench top instrument portfolio performed well in the quarter, driven by ramping interest in MiniSeq, NextSeq adoption for NIPT in the U.S. and China and lower-than-expected cannibalization of MiSeq. Additionally, during the quarter, we received two regulatory approvals for our MiSeqDx instrument from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea and from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. These regulatory milestones will enable our customers to use our NGS technology in a clinical setting and are examples of how our regulatory strategy is enabling markets globally. 
Micro arrays were again a bright spot as our revenue grew 30% year-over-year driven by both consumables and services which resulted in the highest quarter of array shipments since 2011. There were two main drivers to this result, the direct-to-consumer market, which grew more than 100% and medical research and biobanking customers. Additionally, array orders grew more than 60% year-over-year due to orders for our Global Screening Array, or GSA, and Infinium XD product family, both of which will launch in the second half. Given strong orders in the last 2 quarters, our outlook for arrays for the year is much more optimistic. The impact of these products, coupled with a strong first half result is expected to lead to double-digit array growth this year which is clearly a turnaround for this business. 
Before closing, I would like to thank Jay for his 17 incredible years as CEO of Illumina. Through his vision, leadership and determination, Jay led our company from a San Diego start up to a global market leader with over $2 billion in revenue, powering the genomics revolution. I look forward to partnering with him in his new role as Executive Chairman to further our mission of improving human health through unlocking the power of the genome. 
Today, we're still at the beginning of realizing the impact genomics will have in human health. As we march towards our mission, our top priority is to continue to deliver breakthrough products that enable the adoption of genomics in large and unpenetrated markets. Innovation has always been and will always be one of our core values and a core part of our culture. And as the saying goes, culture each strategy for breakfast and I'm committed to fostering our strong culture as we scale. I'm also focused on scaling the organization, our infrastructure, process and our people. Taking on some of the world's hardest problems requires the world's best team. We have an incredibly talented team and are seeing the benefit of continuing to strengthen the organization. I'm excited about the pipeline of talent being pursued across the company. 
From an operational perspective, I'm focused on simplifying our business and focusing our resources on activities that will have the greatest impact. It is important that we stop doing things that don't matter. So these are some of my early priorities in the new role. At Illumina, we are passionate about making this great company even greater. The second quarter was a positive step along this path but we have more work to do as we continue to execute on our mission. 
I will now turn the call over to Marc who will provide a detailed overview of our second quarter results."
29753,374020549,1012666,"Illumina Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Illumina, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Francis. As Francis mentioned, total revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $600 million, slightly exceeding our quarterly guidance.

As Francis mentioned, total revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $600 million, slightly exceeding our quarterly guidance. This result was driven by growth in sequencing consumables and strong demand for micro arrays. Instrument revenue declined 19% year-over-year to $126 million, primarily due to a challenging HiSeq comparison given the 3000 and 4000 launch in the prior year. 
Sequentially, instruments grew 7%, primarily driven by our bench top portfolio. As predicted, HiSeq instruments were roughly flat sequentially and we continue to expect to see an uptick in the second half primarily Q4 in the Americas, as Francis mentioned. 
Consumable revenue represented 63% of total revenue to equal $379 million, an increase of 25% compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by strength in both the array and sequencing product lines. 
Sequencing consumable revenue also grew 25% year-over-year to approximately $310 million, driven by our growing install base of instruments and particular strength in NextSeq consumables. Again, this quarter, NextSeq utilization was above our guidance range of 100k to 125k per instrument annually. As a result of this outperformance and our increasing forecast, we are now projecting annual pull through of 100k to 150k per NextSeq instrument. MiSeq utilization was in our projected range of 40k to 45k and HiSeq pull through per instrument fell within the guidance range of 300k to 350k. 
For modeling purposes, we removed approximately 45 HiSeqs from our installed base in the second quarter, reflecting the units taken offline due to adoption of new machines. 
HiSeq X utilization fell just shy of our pull through guidance range as a large customer continues to work down inventory as we've previously shared. On a full quarter rolling basis, which normalizes for the impact of shipment timing, X utilization was within our range of 650k to 700k. Given customer ship schedules and the relative size of the install base, we are widening the guidance range to 625k to 725k annually per instrument. 
Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services, as well as instrument maintenance contracts, grew approximately 18% versus Q2 2015 to $19 [ph] million. This improvement was driven by maintenance contracts associated with the largest sequencing install base and genotyping services, partially offset by a decline in NIPT service revenue given customers migrating to in-house testing as expected. 
Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude noncash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures as well as our GAAP EPS guidance, both of which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share I'll refer to the results which you can pull through Illumina stockholders. 
Our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72.8%, a sequential increase of 110 basis points, driven by an improvement in sequencing consumable margin and favorable micro array pricing. Year-over-year, adjusted gross margin expanded 40 basis points, primarily due to higher consumables mix partially offset by lower services margin. 
Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $114 million or 19% of revenue including $8.6 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $113 million or 19.8% of revenue in the first quarter. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $127 million or 21.2% of revenue, including $6.5 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $125 million or 21.9% of revenue in Q1. 
Adjusted operating margins were 32.6% compared to 30.1% in the first quarter, driven by an increase in revenue, gross margin expansion and our operating expense revamp. Operating margin was lower compared to the 37.4% reported in the second quarter of last year due to increased investment in headcount in GRAIL and Helix. 
Core Illumina operating margin adjusted for expenses associated with GRAIL and Helix was approximately 35% in the second quarter. Stock-based compensation expense equaled $32 million. In the second half, we expect to see an increase in this expense driven by a number of key hires and the annual employee equity grants in Q4. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.7% compared to 28.9% in second quarter of last year and non-GAAP net income was $127 million. This resulted in Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.86, better-than-expected due to higher revenue and lower expenses compared to our forecast. 
This quarterly result compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $120 million and $0.80 in the second quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS this quarter included approximately $0.06 and $0.02 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix, respectively. 
We reported second quarter GAAP net income of $120 million and EPS of $0.82 per diluted share compared to net income of $102 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the prior-year period. I'm pleased to announce that late in the quarter, we completed our plan to enter into a common to preferred share exchange transaction related to our shareholding in GRAIL. As a result, our GAAP diluted EPS included $0.01 benefit from the exchange. And while Q2 net income reflected approximately 90% of the GRAIL losses, going forward, net income will include approximately 50% of GRAIL losses which is more in line with our ownership. 
Cash flows from operations equaled $217 million. The Q2 DSO totaled 56 days compared to 64 days last quarter. This return to pre SAP levels was driven by continued processing enhancements, focused collection efforts and improved linearity in the quarter. Q3 linearity is expected to drive an uptick in DSOs given the summer vacation season. 
Inventory rose to $311 million due to the continued buildup of consumable safety stock to enhance our supply chain performance. This increase in inventory is expected to continue into the second half of the year as we build safety stocks in preparation for the relocation of our San Diego reagent manufacturing to our new building in the headquarters campus. Capital expenditures in Q2 were $68 million, and we reported an additional $75 million increase in property and equipment related to construction expenditures paid for by our landlord and capitalized by us, under build-to-suit lease accounting. Consequently, Q2 free cash flow is $149 million. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $100 million of common stock under the previously announced discretionary program and ended the quarter with approximately $1.43 billion in cash and short-term investments, including the consolidated cash balances of GRAIL and Helix. 
We have approximately $155 million of repurchase authorization remaining, of which $70 million is discretionary. 
Turning now to expectations for the remainder of 2016. We continue to project total company revenue growth of approximately 12% year-over-year. Included in this projection is the expectation that EMEA will experience a slower pace of recovery which will be offset by an improved outlook in Asia-Pacific. We are forecasting Q3 revenue of $625 million to $630 million and are anticipating high year-over-year growth in Q4 than in Q3. We have increased our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $3.48 to $3.58, up from $3.35 to $3.45 given our outperformance in Q2. 
In conclusion, I would like to punctuate a number of key fundamental performance indicators related to the second quarter results. 
Firstly, we experienced robust sequencing and array consumable growth. Secondly, we saw strong growth in oncology testing shipments, up more than 45%. Thirdly, Asia Pacific outperformed significantly and we saw strong Americas performance, offsetting underperformance in EMEA. And finally, we completed our expense replan and sold better-than-expected non-GAAP EPS. 
We believe these fundamentals will enable accelerating growth through 2016. Execution continues to be a major imperative. And our teams are focused on rebuilding growth on Europe while continuing the strong performance in the other regions.

We have new leadership out in EMEA, as Scott's now the permanent head of sales there. Paula is the new regional GM. And when Scott first went out there at the beginning of Q2, we asked him to look through the pipeline and validate the strength of that pipeline. And his response and his report back to us was that the deal from the pipeline are real, those are real opportunities for us. And 3 months in, those are real. And in fact, we've added to that pipeline. What we're finding though is that there are some big deals in that pipeline that are taking a little bit longer to close. So in Q2, we had a couple of those deals that slipped out of Q2, resulting in EMEA coming in slightly short of the forecast. And so what we've done looking forward is we've looked at all these big binary deals in the pipeline and we've done a probability weighting on those deals. And so, that's caused us to take back a little bit our forecast for the year in EMEA. Now that's been offset by the strength that we've been seeing in the Americas and APAC. And so that's the commentary. The dynamics we're seeing in the market are still strong and the issues I'm talking about are primarily our own internal issues that we're working through. The demand environment seems strong. We talked about the fact that the Dutch Health Council has approved or endorsed NIPT for all pregnancies. The research environment seems stable. The Brexit impact hasn't really shown up yet. And so it didn't really impact us for Q2. There have been some anecdotes of a couple of instances where it showed up. For example, we've had a couple of research teams that were questioning whether they should include collaborators PIs in the U.K. on their collaborations. And we expect those kinds of conversations could possibly slow down some deals. But we expect those deals to go forward anyway. We've also had 1 case where our customer, because of the exchange rate volatility, wanted us to -- wanted to pay us quarterly rather than annually. And so really, we're seeing pretty minimal impact at this point from Brexit on our business. We're also not seeing any change in the competitive environment in EMEA."

We have asked about, certainly in the clinical market, we have been asked about, as you pointed out, the demand environment for complex genetic testing. And as we look through the data we have and the results we announced, we really don't see any dampening of the demand. neither in the reproductive health market, so NIPT specifically, nor in oncology. In NIPT, we, overall, saw a continued growth in the number of NIPT samples. The dynamic playing out there is as we expected, and we've noted before, we see more of our big customers starting to take the testing in-house. And so that results in a decline in our test send out revenue for NIPT. But we see a commensurate increase in the sequencing consumables that we get from those customers. In addition, we saw a really strong growth in the test fees that NIPT customers pay to access the IP associated with NIPT. So we continue to see strong demand and growth in samples. And if you look at some of the market dynamics playing out, we expect that demand to continue to increase. We're still in the U.S. only about 26% of covered lives that are covered for NIPT and we expect that to increase overtime. And we expect to see other markets come online like we saw in the Netherlands. So we believe that there is a strong demand environment and headroom in the NIPT space. In oncology, as we pointed out, we saw really strong growth, so 45% year-over-year in oncology testing. And we know from a market perspective, we're still at the very early stages of every tumor being sequenced for example. And so we expect to continue to see strong demand growing from both those clinical markets. As we look at capacity and utilization, we've done a lot of work to try and understand what the impact of putting more capacity into the market has done in terms of utilization. And last quarter, we put out an analysis to show what happens as every quarter we put more capacity in the market, what happens to the utilization of our instruments. And we saw that the capacity utilization has remained roughly flat and slightly gone up. And as we've updated that data for this quarter, we saw that play out again. We saw both an increase in capacity in the market, as we put out more instruments and we saw the utilizations slightly pick up as well. And so we feel confident that even as we put out more capacity into the market, there is demand for that capacity."

On the China situation specifically, I would expect that to normally be a headwind as that -- to the utilization rate, as the number of instruments get placed and the projects come at a slower pace than you might normally expect. But on the other hand, we're still seeing those high-end customers increase. So I would expect them to offset that. And so stay within this new range that we provided."

In terms of our guidance for the year, the reason we feel confident with 12%, even though you're looking at the big deals in Europe and applying a probabilistic view on them is that we're seeing slightly stronger than expected pipelines coming out of both the Americas and forecasts coming out of both the Americas and Asia. We, in general, do apply some probability weighting to deals across the globe. But we have leaders that have been in place longer in EMEA and in APAC. And so we feel like we have a much better handle on where those deals are and what their likelihood of closing is. We applied a little bit of a heavier weighting, probably waiting in Europe than we do right now in the Americas and APAC, until we have the team on the ground, and our -- and has some track record behind us in terms of the forecasting there. But the strength in EMEA and the strength in Asia and the Americas, sort of more than compensates for that from our perspective. In terms of Helix and the consumer business, so the way we set Helix up is that we -- Helix goes out and recruits direct-to-consumer businesses to build on the Helix platform. The intent is that anybody who's looking to set up a direct-to-consumer genomics business will go talk to Helix. And there are incredibly compelling reasons about why you would want to go to Helix and get set up with Helix rather than set up your own sequencing lab environment, your own informatics pipeline, and your own operation. If, however, a customer feels like Helix is not the right fit for them and their certainly -- they can certainly buy from us equipment and consumables. We do have customers that are outside Helix that are direct-to-consumer. They are terrific customers and we're going to continue to support them going forward."

And if you look at our entire portfolio, over time, each of those instruments needs to be upgraded. And whatever we can drive a big upgrade cycle, that contributes to growth. Now in previous years where we've had one instrument, you have a single, big upgrade cycle that will drive a lot of growth. Clearly now, we have a much bigger portfolio. And so while any one upgrade cycle will drive growth, that will play out over multiple instruments rather than a single, big upgrade cycle. There is, we believe, opportunity, further opportunity in placing clinical offices and so you see us continue to look to get clearance in the various markets around the world. We are very optimistic on the clinical market being a driver of purchases of new -- new purchases of our instruments. And then, in the longer term, we do expect to see the low end of the market to drive instrument growth. And so we talked about FireFly and instrument we are launching at the end of next year. We believe that there are a number of segments that will bring you to sequencing that will be opened up by FireFly. So there are tens of thousands of lots for example around the world, that the majority of that, the vast majority of which don't use sequencing at all. And they are capital constrained and in some cases, they are sample constrained. So that a purchase of even MiniSeq or a MiSeq doesn't make sense for them today. But FireFly would be perfect for that market. So we see a number of markets that we think are low-end sequencer will be very attractive for. And that will all be incremental instrument revenue."

And so while we are processing their samples, while these customers are actively building out their own lab and over time, the intent is to mold the samples from being processed by us to being run by the customers themselves in their own labs. To do that, they obviously had to buy instruments as well as consumables from us. And so that's what you see playing out in that market.

I'm pleased to report that Q2 exceeded our financial guidance as revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $600 million. In the Americas, revenue grew 13% versus the prior year, slightly exceeding our forecast. And Asia Pacific revenue grew 29%, driven primarily by China, which grew 70% on the back of demand for HiSeq X, benchtop instruments from clinical customers and array and sequencing consumables. In Europe, revenue declined 4% versus Q2 of last year, a slight miss to forecast. We are making good progress in the action plan reenacted post the first quarter. 
Last quarter, we shared three areas that we're focusing on to deliver on our full year. The first area was improving our sales processes and specifically, lessening deal complexity and ensuring early closure of orders. We're making progress on deal structure and saw tangible results on the timing of deal closure. As a result, this quarter's linearity was the best we've experienced since the fourth quarter of 2014.
Second, a commitment to improving the execution and outlook in EMEA. We are pleased with the early impact of the leadership and execution changes, including the now permanent appointment of Scott Thomas as Head of Sales and Paula Dowdy as the Regional General Manager. The turnaround will take time, even a bit longer than originally projected. We continue to believe the region's first half result and outlook is primarily reflective of execution challenges and not the result of changing demand or increasing competition. And we are confident in the ability of our EMEA leadership to achieve its full potential. 
Our third area of focus was expense management. I'm pleased to report that our expense replanning efforts were completed during the quarter, slowing down our pace of hiring, discretionary travel and other external spend without materially affecting our product development portfolio. This is partially reflected in our results for Q2 and fully reflected in our forecast for the year. 
In addition to the progress made on these three areas of focus, our manufacturing and supply chain execution also improved. Specifically, the backorder situation for arrays has now been resolved and incremental capacity has been built to handle the increased demand. More broadly, our manufacturing and supply chain teams executed flawlessly due in part to new leadership. 
I'll now move on to an update in our markets. Our strategy to catalyze clinical markets is to deliver market-leading technologies and tailored solutions that enable customers to personalize patient care through genomics. In oncology, this strategy has resulted in pharma partnerships to develop and bring to market custom panels, including TruSight Tumor 15 which has been launched as a research use only and investigational-use only product and TruSight Tumor 170, which will be launched as a research use only product later this year. We have also partnered with Amgen to develop a companion diagnostic test for Vectibix. The product development is complete, and we're preparing the final module of our premarket approval application for the FDA. We expect this to be the first PMA submission based on next-generation sequencing, an exciting step towards fulfilling the promise of genomics in personalized medicine. 
With our sample-to-answer solutions and technology leadership, we expect our oncology revenue to grow, even as reimbursement and regulation play out over time. For example, this quarter saw a rebound in oncology-testing shipments during the second quarter, which grew at more than 4x the rate of total company revenue growth although from a small base. In NIPT, as expected, we continue to see customer shift to in-house testing on our sequencers. As a result, the number of samples running through our testing facility decreased to about 25,000, and we saw an offsetting uptick in sequencing consumables from these customers. Test fee revenue paid by customers to access the NIPT IP pool grew 19% year-over-year. We gained further traction in driving NIPT penetration in China as sample volumes accelerate and are on pace to double year-on-year. 
With the launch of our CE-IVD VeriSeq NIPT assay in Europe late this year, we expect to see a further acceleration in that region. The launch of this product will be well timed, given the Dutch Health Council's recent endorsement of NIPT for all pregnancies. 
Focusing now on new products. Orders placed across our high-throughput instrument portfolio increased sequentially and shipments were roughly flat. HiSeq X orders exceeded our guidance range, and we added 3 new customers, bringing the total to 34. Again, this quarter demand came from new customers, preparing to take part in the China PMI program, which has now allocated funding to more than 60 projects over the next 3 to 5 years. In fact, Chinese customers drove the majority of our HiSeq X shipments in the quarter. Going forward, our HiSeq X outlook remains robust at 20 to 30 instrument orders per quarter, and we expect to see an increase in HiSeq placement in the Americas during the latter part of this year, which is supported by a solid pipeline. 
Our benchtop instrument portfolio performed well in the quarter, driven by ramping interest in MiniSeq, NextSeq adoption for NIPT in the U.S. and China and lower-than-expected cannibalization of MiSeq. Additionally, during the quarter, we received 2 regulatory approvals for our MiSeqDx instrument from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea and from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. These regulatory milestones will enable our customers to use our NGS technology in a clinical setting and are examples of how our regulatory strategy is enabling markets globally. 
Microarrays were again a bright spot as our revenue grew 30% year-over-year, driven by both consumables and services which resulted in the highest quarter of array shipments since 2011. There were two main drivers to this result, the direct-to-consumer market, which grew more than 100% and medical research and biobanking customers. Additionally, array orders grew more than 60% year-over-year due to orders for our Global Screening Array, or GSA, and Infinium XT product family, both of which will launch in the second half. Given strong orders in the last 2 quarters, our outlook for arrays for the year is much more optimistic. The impact of these products, coupled with a strong first half result, is expected to lead to double-digit array growth this year, which is clearly a turnaround for this business. 
Before closing, I would like to thank Jay for his 17 incredible years as CEO of Illumina. Through his vision, leadership and determination, Jay led our company from a San Diego start up to a global market leader with over $2 billion in revenue, powering the genomics revolution. I look forward to partnering with him in his new role as Executive Chairman to further our mission of improving human health through unlocking the power of the genome. 
Today, we're still at the beginning of realizing the impact genomics will have in human health. As we march towards our mission, our top priority is to continue to deliver breakthrough products that enable the adoption of genomics in large and unpenetrated markets. Innovation has always been and will always be one of our core values and a core part of our culture. And as the saying goes, ""culture eats strategy for breakfast"", and I'm committed to fostering our strong culture as we scale. I'm also focused on scaling the organization, our infrastructure, process and our people. Taking on some of the world's hardest problems requires the world's best team. We have an incredibly talented team and are seeing the benefit of continuing to strengthen the organization. I'm excited about the pipeline of talent being pursued across the company. 
From an operational perspective, I'm focused on simplifying our business and focusing our resources on activities that will have the greatest impact. It is important that we stop doing things that don't matter. So these are some of my early priorities in the new role. At Illumina, we are passionate about making this great company even greater. The second quarter was a positive step along this path, but we have more work to do as we continue to execute on our mission. 
I will now turn the call over to Marc who will provide a detailed overview of our second quarter results."

As Francis mentioned, total revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $600 million, slightly exceeding our quarterly guidance. This result was driven by growth in sequencing consumables and strong demand for microarrays. Instrument revenue declined 19% year-over-year to $126 million, primarily due to a challenging HiSeq comparison, given the 3000 or 4000 launch in the prior year. 
Sequentially, instruments grew 7%, primarily driven by our benchtop portfolio. As predicted, HiSeq instruments were roughly flat sequentially, and we continue to expect to see an uptick in the second half, primarily Q4 in the Americas, as Francis mentioned. 
Consumable revenue represented 63% of total revenue to equal $379 million, an increase of 25% compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by strength in both the array and sequencing product lines. 
Sequencing consumable revenue also grew 25% year-over-year to approximately $310 million, driven by our growing installed base of instruments and particular strength in NextSeq consumables. Again, this quarter, NextSeq utilization was above our guidance range of 100k to 125k per instrument annually. As a result of this outperformance and our increasing forecast, we are now projecting annual pull-through of 100k to 150k per NextSeq instrument. MiSeq utilization was in our projected range of 40k to 45k and HiSeq pull-through per instrument fell within the guidance range of 300k to 350k. 
For modeling purposes, we removed approximately 45 HiSeqs from our installed base in the second quarter, reflecting the units taken offline due to adoption of newer machines. 
HiSeq X utilization fell just shy of our pull-through guidance range as a large customer continues to work down inventory as we've previously shared. On a full-quarter rolling basis, which normalizes for the impact of shipment timing, X utilization was within our range of 650k to 700k. Given customer ship schedules and the relative size of the installed base, we are widening the guidance range to 625k to 725k annually per instrument. 
Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts, grew approximately 18% versus Q2 2015 to $90 million. This improvement was driven by maintenance contracts associated with the largest sequencing installed base and genotyping services, partially offset by a decline in NIPT service revenue, given customers migrating to in-house testing as expected. 
Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude noncash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures as well as our GAAP EPS guidance, both of which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders. 
Our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72.8%, a sequential increase of 110 basis points, driven by an improvement in sequencing consumable margin and favorable microarray pricing. Year-over-year, adjusted gross margin expanded 40 basis points, primarily due to higher consumables mix partially offset by lower services margin. 
Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $114 million or 19% of revenue including $8.6 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $113 million or 19.8% of revenue in the first quarter. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $127 million or 21.2% of revenue, including $6.5 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $125 million or 21.9% of revenue in Q1.
Adjusted operating margins were 32.6% compared to 30.1% in the first quarter, driven by an increase in revenue, gross margin expansion and our operating expense revamp. Operating margin was lower compared to the 37.4% reported in the second quarter of last year due to increased investment in headcount in GRAIL and Helix. 
Core Illumina operating margin adjusted for expenses associated with GRAIL and Helix was approximately 35% in the second quarter. Stock-based compensation expense equaled $32 million. In the second half, we expect to see an increase in this expense driven by a number of key hires and the annual employee equity grants in Q4. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.7% compared to 28.9% in second quarter of last year, and non-GAAP net income was $127 million. This resulted in Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.86, better than expected due to higher revenue and lower expenses compared to our forecast. 
This quarterly result compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $120 million and $0.80 in the second quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS this quarter included approximately $0.06 and $0.02 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix, respectively. 
We reported second quarter GAAP net income of $120 million and EPS of $0.82 per diluted share compared to net income of $102 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the prior year period. I'm pleased to announce that late in the quarter, we completed our plan to enter into a common to preferred share exchange transaction related to our shareholding in GRAIL. As a result, our GAAP diluted EPS included $0.01 benefit from the exchange. And while Q2 net income reflected approximately 90% of the GRAIL losses, going forward, net income will include approximately 50% of GRAIL losses which is more in line with our ownership. 
Cash flows from operations equaled $217 million. Q2 DSO totaled 56 days compared to 64 days last quarter. This return to pre-SAP levels was driven by continued processing enhancements, focused collection efforts and improved linearity in the quarter. Q3 linearity is expected to drive an uptick in DSO, given the summer vacation season. 
Inventory rose to $311 million due to the continued buildup of consumable safety stock to enhance our supply chain performance. This increase in inventory is expected to continue into the second half of the year as we build safety stocks in preparation for the relocation of our San Diego reagent manufacturing to our new building on the headquarters campus. Capital expenditures in Q2 were $68 million, and we reported an additional $75 million increase in property and equipment related to construction expenditures paid for by our landlord and capitalized by us, under build-to-suit lease accounting. Consequently, Q2 free cash flow is $149 million. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $100 million of common stock under the previously announced discretionary program and ended the quarter with approximately $1.43 billion in cash and short-term investments, including the consolidated cash balances of GRAIL and Helix. We have approximately $155 million of repurchase authorization remaining, of which $70 million is discretionary. 
Turning now to expectations for the remainder of 2016. We continue to project total company revenue growth of approximately 12% year-over-year. Included in this projection is the expectation that EMEA will experience a slower pace of recovery which will be offset by an improved outlook in Asia Pacific. We are forecasting Q3 revenue of $625 million to $630 million and are anticipating high year-over-year growth in Q4 than in Q3. We have increased our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $3.48 to $3.58, up from $3.35 to $3.45 given our outperformance in Q2. 
In conclusion, I would like to punctuate a number of key fundamental performance indicators related to the second quarter results. Firstly, we experienced robust sequencing and array consumable growth. Secondly, we saw strong growth in oncology testing shipments, up more than 45%. Thirdly, Asia Pacific outperformed significantly and we saw strong Americas performance, offsetting underperformance in EMEA. We -- finally, we completed our expense replan and sold better-than-expected non-GAAP EPS. 
We believe these fundamentals will enable accelerating growth through 2016. Execution continues to be a major imperative. And our teams are focused on rebuilding growth in Europe while continuing the strong performance in the other regions.

We have new leadership out in EMEA, as Scott's now the permanent head of sales there. Paula is the new regional GM. And when Scott first went out there at the beginning of Q2, we asked him to look through the pipeline and validate the strength of that pipeline. And his response and his report back to us was that the deals from the pipeline are real, those are real opportunities for us. And 3 months in, those are real. And in fact, we've added to that pipeline. What we are finding, though, is that there are some big deals in that pipeline that are taking a little bit longer to close. So in Q2, we had a couple of those deals that slipped out of Q2, resulting in EMEA coming in slightly short of the forecast. And so what we've done looking forward is we've looked at all these big binary deals in the pipeline and we've done a probability weighting on those deals. And so that's caused us to take back a little bit our forecast for the year in EMEA. Now that's been offset by the strength that we've been seeing in the Americas and APAC. And so that's the commentary. The dynamics we're seeing in the market are still strong and the issues I'm talking about are primarily our own internal issues that we're working through. The demand environment seems strong. We talked about the fact that the Dutch Health Council has approved or endorsed NIPT for all pregnancies. The research environment seems stable. The Brexit impact hasn't really shown up yet. And so it didn't really impact us for Q2. There have been some anecdotes of a couple of instances where it showed up. For example, we had a couple of research teams that were questioning whether they should include collaborators, PIs in the U.K., on their collaborations. And we expect those kinds of conversations could possibly slow down some deals. But we expect those deals to go forward anyway. We've also had one case where our customer, because of the exchange rate volatility, wanted us to -- wanted to pay us quarterly rather than annually. And so really, we're seeing pretty minimal impact at this point from Brexit on our business. We're also not seeing any change in the competitive environment in EMEA."

Obviously, that's -- you've covered a lot of ground in those areas we spend a lot of time thinking through. We have been asked about, certainly in the clinical market, people have asked about, as you pointed out, the demand environment for complex-genetic testing. And as we look through the data we have and the results we announced, we really don't see any dampening of the demand, neither in the reproductive health market, so NIPT specifically, nor in oncology. In NIPT, we, overall, saw a continued growth in the number of NIPT samples. The dynamic playing out there is as we expected, and we've noted before, we are seeing more of our big customers start to take the testing in-house. And so that results in a decline in our test send-out revenue for NIPT. But we see a commensurate increase in the sequencing consumables that we get from those customers. In addition, we saw a really strong growth in the test fees that NIPT customers pay to access the IP associated with NIPT. So we continue to see strong demand and a growth in samples. And if you look at some of the market dynamics playing out, we expect that demand to continue to increase. We're still in the U.S. only about 26% of covered lives that are covered for NIPT, and we expect that to increase overtime. And we expect to see other markets come online like we saw in the Netherlands. So we believe that there is a strong demand environment and headroom in the NIPT space. In oncology, as we pointed out, we saw a really strong growth, so 45% year-on-year in oncology testing. And we know from a market perspective, we're still at the very early stages of every tumor being sequenced for example. And so we expect to continue to see strong demand growing from both those clinical markets. As we look at capacity and utilization, we've done a lot of work to try and understand what the impact of putting more capacity into the market has done in terms of utilization. And last quarter, we put out analysis to show what happens as every quarter we put more capacity in the market, what happens to the utilization of our instruments. And we saw that the capacity utilization has remained roughly flat and slightly gone up. And as we've updated that data for this quarter, we saw that play out again. We saw both an increase in capacity in the market, as we put out more instruments and we saw the utilizations slightly tick up as well. And so we feel confident that even as we put out more capacity into the market, there is demand for that capacity."

In terms of our guidance for the year, the reason we feel confident with 12%, even though except that we're looking at the big deals in Europe and applying sort of a probability-based view on them is that we are seeing slightly stronger-than-expected pipelines coming out of both the Americas and forecasts coming out of both the Americas and Asia. We, in general, do apply some probability weighting to deals across the globe. But we have leaders that have been in place longer in EMEA and in APAC. And so we feel like we have a much better handle on where those deals are and what their likelihood of closing is. We applied a little bit of a heavier weighting, probability weighting in Europe than we do right now in the Americas and in APAC, until we have the team on the ground, and our -- and has some track record behind us in terms of the forecasting there. But the strength in EMEA and the strength in Asia and the Americas sort of more than compensates for that from our perspective. In terms of Helix and the consumer business, so the way we set Helix up is that we -- Helix goes out and recruits direct-to-consumer businesses to build on the Helix platform. The intent is that anybody who's looking to set up a direct-to-consumer genomics business will go talk to Helix. And there are incredibly compelling reasons about why you would want to go to Helix and get set up with Helix rather than set up your own sequencing lab environment, your own informatics pipeline, your own operation. If, however, a customer feels like Helix is not the right fit for them and their certainly -- they can certainly buy from us equipment and consumables. We do have customers that are outside Helix that are direct to consumer. They are terrific customers, and we're going to continue to support them going forward."

We're getting, though, requests from customers that are saying that that's not the whole problem for them.

And so as we look to how we want to evolve our portfolio over time, there are segments of the market where we're looking to provide the complete set of sample-to-answer solution all the way down to potentially, a validated clinical report. And so for some segments, that's going to be the key enabling component of that segment. And then in a bunch of cases, the enablers are things that we can influence indirectly. And so working with the regulators, working with the payers on reimbursement, driving the data needed to demonstrate analytical clinical validity and clinical utility. So those are things that are enabling to the market that are not maybe directly driving our business today, but an area where we feel we can be productively involved to help catalyze certain markets.

I think there are a few parts to how we think growth is going to come out of the instrument market. One is over -- and we've seen this before, one of the big drivers of growth there is the upgrade cycle. And if you look at our entire portfolio, over time, each of those instruments needs to be upgraded. And whenever we can drive a big upgrade cycle, that contributes to growth. Now in previous years where we've had one instrument, you have a single, big upgrade cycle that will drive a lot of growth. Clearly now, we have a much bigger portfolio. And so while any one upgrade cycle will drive growth, that will play out over a multiple instruments rather than a single, big upgrade cycle. There is, we believe, opportunity -- further opportunity in placing clinical boxes, and so you'll see us continue to look to get clearance in the various markets around the world. We are very optimistic on the clinical market being a driver of purchases of new -- new purchases of our instruments. And then in the longer term, we do expect to see the low end of the market to drive instrument growth. And so we talked about FireFly and the instrument we are launching at the end of next year. We believe that there are a number of segments that will be new to sequencing that will be opened up by FireFly. So there are tens of thousands of labs, for example, around the world, that the majority, the vast majority of which don't use sequencing at all. And they are capital constrained and in some cases, they are sample constrained. So that a purchase of even a MiniSeq or a MiSeq really doesn't make sense for them today. But FireFly would be perfect for that market. So we see a number of markets that we think a low-end sequencer would be very attractive for. And that will all be incremental instrument revenue."

I'm pleased to report that Q2 exceeded our financial guidance as revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $600 million.

I'm pleased to report that Q2 exceeded our financial guidance as revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $600 million. In the Americas, revenue grew 13% versus the prior year, slightly exceeding our forecast. And Asia Pacific revenue grew 29%, driven primarily by China, which grew 70% on the back of demand for HiSeq X, benchtop instruments from clinical customers and array and sequencing consumables. In Europe, revenue declined 4% versus Q2 of last year, a slight miss to forecast. We are making good progress in the action plan reenacted post the first quarter. 
Last quarter, we shared three areas that we're focusing on to deliver on our full year. The first area was improving our sales processes and specifically, lessening deal complexity and ensuring early closure of orders. We're making progress on deal structure and saw tangible results on the timing of deal closure. As a result, this quarter's linearity was the best we have experienced since the fourth quarter of 2014.
Second, a commitment to improving the execution and outlook in EMEA. We are pleased with the early impact of the leadership and execution changes, including the now permanent appointment of Scott Thomas as Head of Sales and Paula Dowdy as the Regional General Manager. The turnaround will take time, even a bit longer than originally projected. We continue to believe the region's first half result and outlook is primarily reflective of execution challenges and not the result of changing demand or increasing competition. And we are confident in the ability of our EMEA leadership to achieve its full potential. 
Our third area of focus was expense management. I'm pleased to report that our expense replanning efforts were completed during the quarter, slowing down our pace of hiring, discretionary travel and other external spend without materially affecting our product development portfolio. This is partially reflected in our results for Q2 and fully reflected in our forecast for the year. 
In addition to the progress made on these three areas of focus, our manufacturing and supply chain execution also improved. Specifically, the backorder situation for arrays has now been resolved and incremental capacity has been built to handle the increased demand. More broadly, our manufacturing and supply chain teams executed flawlessly due in part to new leadership. 
I'll now move on to an update in our markets. Our strategy to catalyze clinical markets is to deliver market-leading technologies and tailored solutions that enable customers to personalize patient care through genomics. In oncology, this strategy has resulted in pharma partnerships to develop and bring to market custom panels, including TruSight Tumor 15 which has been launched as a research use only and investigational-use only product and TruSight Tumor 170, which will be launched as a research use only product later this year. We have also partnered with Amgen to develop a companion diagnostic test for Vectibix. The product development is complete, and we're preparing the final module of our premarket approval application for the FDA. We expect this to be the first PMA submission based on next-generation sequencing, an exciting step towards fulfilling the promise of genomics in personalized medicine. 
With our sample-to-answer solutions and technology leadership, we expect our oncology revenue to grow, even as reimbursement and regulation play out over time. For example, this quarter saw a rebound in oncology-testing shipments during the second quarter, which grew at more than 4x the rate of total company revenue growth although from a small base. In NIPT, as expected, we continue to see customer shift to in-house testing on our sequencers. As a result, the number of samples running through our testing facility decreased to about 25,000, and we saw an offsetting uptick in sequencing consumables from these customers. Test fee revenue paid by customers to access the NIPT IP pool grew 90% year-over-year. We gained further traction in driving NIPT penetration in China as sample volumes accelerate and are on pace to double year-on-year. 
With the launch of our CE-IVD VeriSeq NIPT assay in Europe late this year, we expect to see a further acceleration in that region. The launch of this product will be well timed, given the Dutch Health Council's recent endorsement of NIPT for all pregnancies. 
Focusing now on new products. Orders placed across our high-throughput instrument portfolio increased sequentially and shipments were roughly flat. HiSeq X orders exceeded our guidance range, and we added 3 new customers, bringing the total to 34. Again, this quarter demand came from new customers, preparing to take part in the China PMI program, which has now allocated funding to more than 60 projects over the next 3 to 5 years. In fact, Chinese customers drove the majority of our HiSeq X shipments in the quarter. Going forward, our HiSeq X outlook remains robust at 20 to 30 instrument orders per quarter, and we expect to see an increase in HiSeq placements in the Americas during the latter part of this year, which is supported by a solid pipeline. 
Our benchtop instrument portfolio performed well in the quarter, driven by ramping interest in MiniSeq, NextSeq adoption for NIPT in the U.S. and China and lower-than-expected cannibalization of MiSeq. Additionally, during the quarter, we received 2 regulatory approvals for our MiSeqDx instrument from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea and from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. These regulatory milestones will enable our customers to use our NGS technology in a clinical setting and are examples of how our regulatory strategy is enabling markets globally. 
Microarrays were again a bright spot as our revenue grew 30% year-over-year, driven by both consumables and services which resulted in the highest quarter of array shipments since 2011. There were two main drivers to this result, the direct-to-consumer market, which grew more than 100% and medical research and biobanking customers. Additionally, array orders grew more than 60% year-over-year due to orders for our Global Screening Array, or GSA, and Infinium XT product family, both of which will launch in the second half. Given strong orders in the last 2 quarters, our outlook for arrays for the year is much more optimistic. The impact of these products, coupled with a strong first half result, is expected to lead to double-digit array growth this year, which is clearly a turnaround for this business. 
Before closing, I would like to thank Jay for his 17 incredible years as CEO of Illumina. Through his vision, leadership and determination, Jay led our company from a San Diego start up to a global market leader with over $2 billion in revenue, powering the genomics revolution. I look forward to partnering with him in his new role as Executive Chairman to further our mission of improving human health through unlocking the power of the genome. 
Today, we're still at the beginning of realizing the impact genomics will have in human health. As we march towards our mission, our top priority is to continue to deliver breakthrough products that enable the adoption of genomics in large and unpenetrated markets. Innovation has always been and will always be one of our core values and a core part of our culture. And as the saying goes, ""culture eats strategy for breakfast"", and I'm committed to fostering our strong culture as we scale. I'm also focused on scaling the organization, our infrastructure, process and our people. Taking on some of the world's hardest problems requires the world's best team. We have an incredibly talented team and are seeing the benefit of continuing to strengthen the organization. I'm excited about the pipeline of talent being pursued across the company. 
From an operational perspective, I'm focused on simplifying our business and focusing our resources on activities that will have the greatest impact. It is important that we stop doing things that don't matter. So these are some of my early priorities in the new role. At Illumina, we are passionate about making this great company even greater. The second quarter was a positive step along this path, but we have more work to do as we continue to execute on our mission. 
I will now turn the call over to Marc who will provide a detailed overview of our second quarter results."
29753,374020549,1012996,"Illumina Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Illumina, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Francis.

As Francis mentioned, total revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $600 million, slightly exceeding our quarterly guidance. This result was driven by growth in sequencing consumables and strong demand for microarrays. Instrument revenue declined 19% year-over-year to $126 million, primarily due to a challenging HiSeq comparison, given the 3000 and 4000 launch in the prior year. 
Sequentially, instruments grew 7%, primarily driven by our benchtop portfolio. As predicted, HiSeq instruments were roughly flat sequentially, and we continue to expect to see an uptick in the second half, primarily Q4 in the Americas, as Francis mentioned. 
Consumable revenue represented 63% of total revenue to equal $379 million, an increase of 25% compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by strength in both the array and sequencing product lines. 
Sequencing consumable revenue also grew 25% year-over-year to approximately $310 million, driven by our growing installed base of instruments and particular strength in NextSeq consumables. Again, this quarter, NextSeq utilization was above our guidance range of $100,000 to $125,000 per instrument annually. As a result of this outperformance and our increasing forecast, we are now projecting annual pull-through of $100,000 to $150,000 per NextSeq instrument. MiSeq utilization was in our projected range of $40,000 to $45,000 and HiSeq pull-through per instrument fell within the guidance range of $300,000 to $350,000.
For modeling purposes, we removed approximately 45 HiSeqs from our installed base in the second quarter, reflecting the units taken offline due to adoption of newer machines. 
HiSeq X utilization fell just shy of our pull-through guidance range as a large customer continues to work down inventory as we've previously shared. On a full-quarter rolling basis, which normalizes for the impact of shipment timing, X utilization was within our range of $650,000 to $700,000. Given customer ship schedules and the relative size of the installed base, we are widening the guidance range to $625,000 to $725,000 annually per instrument. 
Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts, grew approximately 18% versus Q2 2015 to $90 million. This improvement was driven by maintenance contracts associated with the larger sequencing installed base and genotyping services, partially offset by a decline in NIPT service revenue, given customers migrating to in-house testing as expected. 
Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude noncash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures as well as our GAAP EPS guidance, both of which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders. 
Our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72.8%, a sequential increase of 110 basis points, driven by an improvement in sequencing consumable margin and favorable microarray pricing. Year-over-year, adjusted gross margin expanded 40 basis points, primarily due to higher consumables mix partially offset by lower services margin. 
Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $114 million or 19% of revenue including $8.6 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $113 million or 19.8% of revenue in the first quarter. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $127 million or 21.2% of revenue, including $6.5 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $125 million or 21.9% of revenue in Q1.
Adjusted operating margins were 32.6% compared to 30.1% in the first quarter, driven by an increase in revenue, gross margin expansion and our operating expense revamp. Operating margin was lower compared to the 37.4% reported in the second quarter of last year due to increased investment in headcount in GRAIL and Helix. 
Core Illumina operating margin adjusted for expenses associated with GRAIL and Helix was approximately 35% in the second quarter. Stock-based compensation expense equaled $32 million. In the second half, we expect to see an increase in this expense driven by a number of key hires and the annual employee equity grants in Q4. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.7% compared to 28.9% in second quarter of last year, and non-GAAP net income was $127 million. This resulted in Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.86, better than expected due to higher revenue and lower expenses compared to our forecast. 
This quarterly result compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $120 million and $0.80 in the second quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS this quarter included approximately $0.06 and $0.02 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix, respectively. 
We reported second quarter GAAP net income of $120 million and EPS of $0.82 per diluted share compared to net income of $102 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the prior year period. I'm pleased to announce that late in the quarter, we completed our plan to enter into a common to preferred share exchange transaction related to our shareholding in GRAIL. As a result, our GAAP diluted EPS included $0.01 benefit from the exchange. And while Q2 net income reflected approximately 90% of the GRAIL losses, going forward, net income will include approximately 50% of GRAIL losses which is more in line with our ownership. 
Cash flows from operations equaled $217 million. Q2 DSO totaled 56 days compared to 64 days last quarter. This return to pre-SAP levels was driven by continued processing enhancements, focused collection efforts and improved linearity in the quarter. Q3 linearity is expected to drive an uptick in DSOs, given the summer vacation season. 
Inventory rose to $311 million due to the continued buildup of consumable safety stock to enhance our supply chain performance. This increase in inventory is expected to continue into the second half of the year as we build safety stocks in preparation for the relocation of our San Diego reagent manufacturing to our new building on the headquarters campus. Capital expenditures in Q2 were $68 million, and we reported an additional $75 million increase in property and equipment related to construction expenditures paid for by our landlord and capitalized by us, under build-to-suit lease accounting. Consequently, Q2 free cash flow is $149 million. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $100 million of common stock under the previously announced discretionary program and ended the quarter with approximately $1.43 billion in cash and short-term investments, including the consolidated cash balances of GRAIL and Helix. We have approximately $155 million of repurchase authorization remaining, of which $70 million is discretionary. 
Turning now to expectations for the remainder of 2016. We continue to project total company revenue growth of approximately 12% year-over-year. Included in this projection is the expectation that EMEA will experience a slower pace of recovery which will be offset by an improved outlook in Asia Pacific. We are forecasting Q3 revenue of $625 million to $630 million and are anticipating higher year-over-year growth in Q4 than in Q3. We have increased our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $3.48 to $3.58, up from $3.35 to $3.45 given our outperformance in Q2. 
In conclusion, I would like to punctuate a number of key fundamental performance indicators related to the second quarter results. Firstly, we experienced robust sequencing and array consumable growth. Secondly, we saw strong growth in oncology testing shipments, up more than 45%. Thirdly, Asia Pacific outperformed significantly and we saw strong Americas performance, offsetting underperformance in EMEA. We -- finally, we completed our expense replan and saw better-than-expected non-GAAP EPS. 
We believe these fundamentals will enable accelerating growth through 2016. Execution continues to be a major imperative. And our teams are focused on rebuilding growth in Europe while continuing the strong performance in the other regions.

We have new leadership out in EMEA, as Scott's now the permanent head of sales there. Paula is the new regional GM. And when Scott first went out there at the beginning of Q2, we asked him to look through the pipeline and validate the strength of that pipeline. And his response and his report back to us was that the deals from the pipeline are real, those are real opportunities for us. And 3 months in, those are real. And in fact, we've added to that pipeline. What we are finding, though, is that there are some big deals in that pipeline that are taking a little bit longer to close. So in Q2, we had a couple of those deals that slipped out of Q2, resulting in EMEA coming in slightly short of the forecast. And so what we've done looking forward is we've looked at all these big binary deals in the pipeline and we've done a probability weighting on those deals. And so that's caused us to take back a little bit our forecast for the year in EMEA. Now that's been offset by the strength that we've been seeing in the Americas and APAC. And so that's the commentary. The dynamics we're seeing in the market are still strong and the issues I'm talking about are primarily our own internal issues that we're working through. The demand environment seems strong. We talked about the fact that the Dutch Health Council has approved or endorsed NIPT for all pregnancies. The research environment seems stable. The Brexit impact hasn't really shown up yet. And so it didn't really impact us for Q2. There have been some anecdotes of a couple of instances where it showed up. For example, we had a couple of research teams that were questioning whether they should include collaborators, PIs in the U.K., on their collaborations. And we expect those kinds of conversations could possibly slow down some deals. But we expect those deals to go forward anyway. We've also had one case where a customer, because of the exchange rate volatility, wanted us to -- wanted to pay us quarterly rather than annually. And so really, we're seeing pretty minimal impacts at this point from Brexit on our business. We're also not seeing any change in the competitive environment in EMEA."

Obviously, that's -- you've covered a lot of ground in those areas we spend a lot of time thinking through. We have been asked about, certainly in the clinical market, people have asked about, as you pointed out, the demand environment for complex-genetic testing. And as we look through the data we have and the results we announced, we really don't see any dampening of the demand, neither in the reproductive health market, so NIPT specifically, nor in oncology. In NIPT, we, overall, saw a continued growth in the number of NIPT samples. The dynamic playing out there is as we expected, and we've noted before, we are seeing more of our big customers start to take the testing in-house. And so that results in a decline in our test send-out revenue for NIPT. But we see a commensurate increase in the sequencing consumables that we get from those customers. In addition, we saw a really strong growth in the test fees that NIPT customers pay to access the IP associated with NIPT. So we continue to see strong demand and a growth in samples. And if you look at some of the market dynamics playing out, we expect that demand to continue to increase. We're still, in the U.S., only about 26% of covered lives that are covered for NIPT, and we expect that to increase overtime. And we expect to see other markets come online like we saw in the Netherlands. So we believe that there is a strong demand environment and headroom in the NIPT space. 
In oncology, as we pointed out, we saw a really strong growth, so 45% year-on-year in oncology testing. And we know from a market perspective, we're still at the very early stages of every tumor being sequenced for example. And so we expect to continue to see strong demand growing from both those clinical markets. As we look at capacity and utilization, we've done a lot of work to try and understand what the impact of putting more capacity into the market has done in terms of utilization. And last quarter, we put out analysis to show what happens as every quarter we put more capacity in the market, what happens to the utilization of our instruments. And we saw that the capacity utilization has remained roughly flat and slightly gone up. And as we have updated that data for this quarter, we saw that play out again. We saw both an increase in capacity in the market, as we put out more instruments and we saw the utilizations slightly tick up as well. And so we feel confident that even as we put out more capacity into the market, there is demand for that capacity."

And as new customers come on board, they've dragged the number down. But existing customers increase their utilization, takes it back up. And so it's working out pretty well. 
On the China situation specifically, I would expect that to normally be a headwind as that -- to the utilization rate as the number of instruments get placed and the projects come at a slower pace than you might normally expect. But on the other hand, we're still seeing those high-end customers increase. So I would expect them to offset that. And so stay within this new range that we provided."

In terms of our guidance for the year, the reason we feel confident with 12%, even though I've said that look we're looking at the big deals in Europe and applying sort of a probability-based view on them is that we are seeing slightly stronger-than-expected pipelines coming out of both the Americas -- and forecasts coming out of both the Americas and Asia. We, in general, do apply some probability weighting to deals across the globe. But we have leaders that have been in place longer in EMEA and in APAC. And so we feel like we have a much better handle on where those deals are and what their likelihood of closing is. We applied a little bit of a heavier weighting, probability weighting in Europe than we do right now in the Americas and in APAC, until we have the team on the ground, and our -- and have some track record behind us in terms of the forecasting there. But the strength in EMEA and -- the strength in Asia and the Americas sort of more than compensates for that from our perspective. 
In terms of Helix and the consumer business, so the way we set Helix up is that we -- Helix goes out and recruits direct-to-consumer businesses to build on the Helix platform. The intent is that anybody who's looking to set up a direct-to-consumer genomics business will go talk to Helix.

Because right now, we're seeing -- as our business sort of expands, we are getting requests across the board. There are still segments of the market that want to continue to see us drive the cost of sequencing down, drive the throughput up, shorten turnaround time. And so there's still an elasticity in the market that customers want us to enable them to access. And so clearly, a part of our portfolio is always going to be around delivering the world's best sequencing offering. We're getting, though, requests from customers that are saying that that's not the whole problem for them. Increasingly, we're seeing some of our clinical customers ask us to focus on helping them, for example, on the clinical reporting side. And so as we look to how we want to evolve our portfolio over time, there are segments of the market where we're looking to provide the complete set of sample-to-answer solution all the way down to potentially, a validated clinical report. And so for some segments that's going to be the key enabling component of that segment. And then in a bunch of cases, the enablers are things that we can influence indirectly. And so working with the regulators, working with the payers on reimbursement, driving the data needed to demonstrate analytical clinical validity and clinical utility. So those are things that are enabling to the market that are not maybe directly driving our business today, but an area where we feel we can be productively involved to help catalyze certain markets. So as our business has gotten bigger, there are a number of strategic levers that we are focused on to drive the adoption of genomics in the various markets we're in."

I think there are a few parts to how we think growth is going to come out of the instrument market. One is over -- and we've seen this before, one of the big drivers of growth there is the upgrade cycle. And if you look at our entire portfolio, over time, each of those instruments needs to be upgraded. And whenever we can drive a big upgrade cycle, that contributes to growth. Now in previous years where we've had one instrument, you have a single, big upgrade cycle that will drive a lot of growth. Clearly now, we have a much bigger portfolio. And so while any one upgrade cycle will drive growth, that will play out over a multiple instruments rather than a single, big upgrade cycle. There is, we believe, opportunity -- further opportunity in placing clinical boxes, and so you'll see us continue to look to get clearance in the various markets around the world. We are very optimistic on the clinical market being a driver of purchases of new -- new purchases of our instruments. And then in the longer term, we do expect to see the low end of the market to drive instrument growth. And so we talked about Firefly and the instrument we are launching at the end of next year. We believe that there are a number of segments that will be new to sequencing that will be opened up by Firefly. So there are tens of thousands of labs, for example, around the world, that the majority, the vast majority of which don't use sequencing at all. And they are capital constrained and in some cases, they are sample constrained. So that a purchase of even a MiniSeq or a MiSeq really doesn't make sense for them today. But Firefly would be perfect for that market. So we see a number of markets that we think a low-end sequencer would be very attractive for. And that will all be incremental instrument revenue."

As we shared a few weeks ago, our third quarter revenue was $607 million, a 10% increase over Q3 of last year and we expect Q4 revenue to be flat to slightly up sequentially. This is lower than the outlook we",1301,"Thanks, Rebecca and good afternoon, everyone. As we shared a few weeks ago, our third quarter revenue was $607 million, a 10% increase over Q3 of last year and we expect Q4 revenue to be flat to slightly up sequentially. This is lower than the outlook we provided in July. Since the close of the quarter, we have analyzed market and funding dynamics, capacity utilization, competition and outsourcing trends. Based on these reviews, we do not believe that excess market capacity, outsourcing or competition materially affected our results or outlook. 
Utilization of our high throughput installed base continues to trend upward, normalizing for the large annual stocking orders received in Q3, both this year and last. Additionally, purchasing patterns at customers who have only HiSeq 2500s have been stable, supporting the view that these labs are not increasing their outsourcing to service providers. 
Lastly, from a competition standpoint, while we do compete for the allocation of funds, our win rates remain steady and we do not believe this has been a significant factor. We have identified the factors we believe drove our Q3 miss and lower fourth quarter revenue guidance. 
First, in the second half, we have been tracking opportunities for more than 90 HiSeq X instruments between funnel and backlog and previously forecasted that more than 60 would shift. Due to a shift in certain U.S. government institutions funding practices and 2 customer-specific situations, approximately 35 of these instruments have moved out of the second half. For the academic and government opportunities, projects of these institutions were previously awarded in 3 to 5 year commitments, enabling customers to purchase instruments upon award. This year, smaller portions of these projects were awarded with shorter or uncertain time frames, affecting our customers' the ability to make capital commitments. Ultimately, we do not believe that this change will affect the size of these programs, which plan to sequence more than 100,000 genomes in the coming years. 
Based on these programs, as well as other personalized medicine projects, including France's plans to establish population scale sequencing operations and the Cancer Moonshot Initiative, we believe that sequencing sample growth remains robust. 
Furthermore, as we shared in the preannouncement, 1 HiSeq X system that was expected to close in Q3 did not materialize due to capital constraints, specific to that customer. Additionally, we removed the HiSeq X Ten associated with a nation scale project that was originally anticipated in Q4 and has since pushed to 2017 due to lab readiness. 
The other factor that contributed to the second half shortfall was lower-than-anticipated HiSeq 2500 and 4000 orders which we believe was driven by legacy HiSeq customers favoring the HiSeq X and NextSeq platforms. The introduction of HiSeq X Ten -- HiSeq X at January 2014 enables whole genome sequencing to be performed much more economically. And as a result, samples have shifted to whole genome sequencing at the expense of other applications. 
Whole genome sequencing on HiSeq X now represents approximately 15% of all high throughput runs compared to 2% just 2 years ago. Additionally, the release of NextSeq's V2 [ph] reagent in 2015 brought the quality on par with HiSeq. As a result, some high throughput customers have been adopting NextSeq given its flexible workflow which enables batching fewer samples at attractive operating costs. As a result, we will not see the second half uptick in high throughput instrument placements we had previously expected. 
To better identify trends like this earlier, we have initiated a global forecast improvement project with [indiscernible] that will enhance both our visibility and forecast accuracy. Over time, we are relatively indifferent to these shifts. As in both of these cases, the lower operating cost of HiSeq X and NextSeq enables our customers to sequence more samples. However, the timing of the elasticity taking effect or the customer completing their transition varies across customers and can create a temporary dip in spending. Given this, HiSeq consumable utilization was slightly below our guidance range of $300,000 to $350,000, driven primarily by a few customers shifting to other platforms in the Americas, including the HiSeq 4000 and not a decline in utilization across the broader install base. These new platform implementations take time, sometimes several quarters, and are expected to impact utilization in Q4. 
Moving now to the rest of our portfolio. Benchtop instruments performed well in the quarter. NextSeq benefited from commercial customers scaling capacity, including NIPT customers in the U.S. and China and saw continued strength in consumable utilization with pull through at the top end of the guidance range of $100,000 to $150,000. Additionally, both instruments and reagents sales of MiSeq and MiniSeq performed in line with our expectations. 
Microarrays grew more than 35% year-over-year quarter driven by another quarter of strong direct-to-consumer demand as well as robust interest from agriculture customers which increased 20%. Array orders grew more than 90% versus the third quarter of last year as we received orders for another 2 million samples for our Global Screening Array, or GSA, during the quarter, bringing the total to over 5 million samples. Additionally, Infinium XD [ph] gained traction in Q3 and as this product continues to contribute to order growth. Both of these new products are now shipping and have backlogs that extend over the next few years, which has led to an improved multiyear outlook for arrays. 
I will now move to an update on a few of our key markets. Oncology testing shipments grew 24% versus the prior year as our broad enablement strategy continues to drive the penetration of the oncology market. Importantly, the research-use only launch of our TruSight Tumor 170 panel remains on our expected schedule for later this quarter. Additionally, we have submitted our companion diagnostic test for Vectibix, developed through our partnership with Amgen to the FDA for premarket approval. In NIPT, we continue to see customers shifting to testing in-house in our sequencers. And as a result, we performed about 20,000 samples through our testing facility. 
Over the last four quarters, we have transitioned two large customers. And going forward, expect more stable TSO volumes as well as continued growth in sequencing instruments and consumable sales. Our multiyear outlook for these markets remains optimistic, driven by oncology reimbursement and regulation playing out over time in our ability to penetrate the average risk and global NIPT opportunities. 
I would like to take a moment to discuss the announcement we filed today that Christian Henry will be leaving the company at the end of January. As many of you know, Christian has been an integral part of our team since joining Illumina as Chief Financial Officer in 2005. He has held many different leadership roles, including General Manager of the Genomic Solutions and Life Sciences business, as well as most recently, our Chief Commercial Officer. I would like to thank Christian for his many contributions over the years and wish him and his family the best as they embark on their next chapter. 
Effective immediately, I've asked Mark Van Oene, currently the General Manager of our Americas business, to step in as interim Chief Commercial Officer while we conduct a search. Mark has been a member of the Illumina team since 2006 and has successfully led our Americas commercial team to remarkable growth. I am confident that with Mark's help, supported by the strong commercial team that Christian has built, we're in good hands during this transition phase. 
In closing, the current product lifecycle dynamics may take several quarters to resolve but they are temporal in nature. We remain in the beginning stages of the large and untapped genomics market and remain committed to introducing innovative technology over the coming years. 
I will now turn the call over to Marc who will provide a detailed overview of our third quarter results."

As Francis mentioned, total revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $607 million, consistent with our preliminary estimates on October 10. Sequencing consumables and strong demand for microarrays drove the growth, offset by a decline in sequencing instruments. 
Geographically, revenue in the Americas grew 2% versus the prior year due to lower-than-expected HiSeq 2500 and 4000 instruments and HiSeq 2500 reagent shipments as well as a challenging HiSeq X comparison. Asia-Pacific revenue increased 35% versus Q3 '15 as China grew more than 85%. European revenue grew 16%, a slight [indiscernible] to forecast and we believe the region's positive progress in execution will continue over the coming quarters. 
Sequencing instrument revenue declined 26% year-over-year to $106 million. While the year-over-year drop was predicted due to the challenging HiSeq X comparison, this result was lower than our projection given the miss in high throughput instruments, as Francis discussed. 
Consumable revenue represented 65% of total revenue to equal [ph] $396 million, an increase of 23% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Sequencing consumable revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $333 million, driven by our growing installed base of instruments and particular strength in HiSeq X and NextSeq consumables. 
Please note that we removed approximately 64 HiSeq estimates for our ending Q3 install base to reflect the units taken off-line due to the adoption of newer machines. 
Services and other revenue grew approximately 18% versus Q3 2015 to $93 million, led by strength in genotyping services and sequencing instrument maintenance contracts associated with the large install base, partially offset by an expected decline in NIPT service revenue given customer migrations to in-house testing. 
Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results which excludes noncash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures as well as our GAAP EPS guidance, which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders. 
Our adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.5%, a sequential decrease of 30 basis points. Year-over-year, gross margin decreased 70 basis points, given investment in sequencing consumable and array manufacturing capacity as well as our clinical capabilities which was partially offset by favorable consumable mix. 
Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $114 million or 18.8% of revenue, including $14 million or 2.4% attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $114 million or 19% of revenue in the second quarter. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $117 million or 19.3% of revenue, including $9 million or 1.5% attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $127 million or 21.2% of revenue in Q2. 
Given our updated revenue and earnings forecast for the year, we booked a $16 million benefit in Q3, primarily to operating expense resulting from adjustments to our annual variable compensation plan accrual. Additionally, we removed $6 million of compensation expense from our Q4 forecast, neither of these adjustments were anticipated in our previous forecast or guidance. For 2017 planning purposes, investors should contemplate an incremental $0.22 EPS headwind as the actual returns to normal levels for the full year. 
Adjusted operating margins were 34.4% compared to 32.6% in the second quarter, higher primarily due to the variable compensation accrual benefit as well as lower legal expenses. Operating margin was lower compared to the 36% reported in the third quarter of last year due to increased investments in headcount, GRAIL and Helix. Excluding GRAIL and Helix, operating margin was 38.2%, stock-based compensation expense equaled $35 million, up sequentially from $32 million. 
We reported third quarter GAAP net income of $129 million, an EPS of $0.87 per diluted share compared to net income of $118 million or $0.79 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Our non-GAAP net income was $144 million, which led to $0.97 in earnings per diluted share, which includes an $0.08 benefit from the compensation adjustment mentioned previously. Non-GAAP EPS this quarter included approximately $0.05 and $0.02 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix, respectively. This quarterly result compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $120 million and $0.80 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Cash flow from operations equaled $150 million, reduced by 100% of the GRAIL and Helix cash burn of $20 million this quarter. Q3 DSO totaled 57 days, up slightly compared to 56 days last quarter but still healthy given the unfavorable linearity we experience. Capital expenditures in Q3 was $57 million as we reported an additional $84 million increase in property and equipment recorded under build-to-suit lease accounting where such expenses are paid for by the landlord. Consequently, Q3 free cash flow was $93 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, including the consolidated cash balances of GRAIL and Helix. 
During the quarter, our Board of Directors authorized a new $250 million stock repurchase program, under which we repurchased 13 million of common stock and have $237 million of authorization remaining. 
Turning now to expectations for the remainder of 2016. We expect fourth quarter revenues to be flat to slightly up sequentially. To be more precise, slightly up should be considered an increase of up to $5 million. This guidance no longer reflects our previously expected uptick in high-throughput sequencing instruments. For fiscal 2016, we are now projecting GAAP earnings per diluted share to be attributable to Illumina stockholders of $2.92 to $2.97 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.27 to $3.32. 
Please refer to our Investor deck for details as to the drivers [indiscernible] updated guidance. 
We have updated our GRAIL dilution for the year to be approximately $0.30, primarily as a result of the weight of the common shares issued by GRAIL in the first half compared to the reduced check out in the second half driving an inflated full year share calculation. Our share of the GRAIL losses on a quarterly basis including in Q3 continues to be at approximately 50% as communicated at our last earnings call. Helix dilution is expected to be $0.10. 
In closing, I would like to spend a minute on the forecast process improvement project that Francis mentioned. We have already started the initial phase which is expected to run until mid-December. And we'll identify key opportunities for improvement including any immediate changes that we can make to enhance our visibility. We will [indiscernible] the good work already underway in Europe until this process and identify areas of improvement for global consistency, taking the best of the best practices from each region and adding best-in-class practices when needed. This will inevitably lead to a second stage of the project next year which we anticipate will incorporate longer-term tool and process implementations. I look forward to updating you on our progress periodically.

The volatility that we have seen has been primarily driven on the instrument side over the last few quarters. We talked about some of the dynamics playing out in the Americas in Q3 where, in some cases, there were changes in funding practices that caused some customers to not spring for the capital purchase but still look to do sequencing. In other cases, we talked about dynamics where customers who are purchasing either Xs or going to NextSeqs instead of 4000.

So I continue to deeply believe in the elasticity of the demand in the research customers. So the reality is we understand so little of the functionality of the genome in almost any area that you can think of that I believe that there is a lot more sequencing to be done and a lot of it will be enabled through lower price points. So that's sort of one point. I think that what we are seeing is customers making the decision to do whole genome have the potential to look at both the 4000 and the X. And the economics associated with the X are still significantly better than the 4000. And so that's why they're -- that's what's driving the decision I talked about in my remarks where, as if they have any kind of volume around whole genome or they have access to a whole genome sequencing service, those economics may be very compelling for some customers."

And we expected that would be further along than it is. That's still coming. And so we expect that will play out in '17 and beyond. But we did expect to be further on than we are today. There are areas that did perform a lot better. So for example, the growth that we're seeing in China has been ahead of where we expect it to be. Some of it is driven by the Chinese PMI and customers buying as part of the Chinese PMI. Some of it has been customers buying in anticipation of being a service provider to the Chinese PMI projects. But a lot of it is driven by adoption, clinical adoption in the Chinese market. And that has been further ahead than where we'd expected. China is already now our #2 market, country market in the world. And so that's been an area that has moved faster than we expected. The whole genome sequencing market has moved further and faster than we'd expected. We've touched on in the remarks that today, whole genome sequencing represents 15% of the sequencing done in high throughput instruments. That is up from 2% just 2 years ago. And that's vastly exceeded our expectations. We're starting to hear from a lot of customers on the research side, certainly, that they do want to move to whole genome sequencing and that they see that as a very evolutionary sort of natural next step for them in their research to get a better handle on the biology involved.

So when you do that weighted average effect over 4 quarters, for a full year, it equates to more like 80%, even above 80% of the losses that we would record instead of the 50% that we are now down to for the quarter. So what that means, if you take this [indiscernible] conclusion, if the 4 quarters done some to the full year EPS. And there's a chart in our investor deck that clearly shows that that happens. And that is, that's the way the accounting works."

And that is a phenomenal [indiscernible] in building and it's been, it's not summit has been building over time and I think it was important, the V2 chemistry was sort of an important step for us with the NextSeq where there was an initial period where looking, -- where people were looking to see the quality of the runs on NextSeq compared to the other instruments of the 4 channel instruments. And with the V2, customers started to get comfortable that we had achieved parity and the quality of the output that they could get and they started trialing those instruments and validating them. And so this was a trend that's been building. There are definitely things we are taking away from that on a number of areas. One is we are very pleased with the traction that we're seeing for example with the 2 channel chemistry and the benefit that it gives to our customers. And so internally, that's something we're thinking through how we leverage that even more broadly. There are other lessons we're taking around -- NIPT is one of those markets where we have focused specifically around the end to end workflow and making our solution easy for our customers the consume in the NIPT market. And you see that with the VeriSeq launch that we're doing as well. And for us, that represents a good way for us to get good traction in the applied markets.

So there are a number of different things that we can do including connecting the market insights that we have as well as improving the market insights that we have and connecting those to the forecasted pipeline and driving more discipline around our CRM database, around pipeline definitions and so on. It's much broader than just forecasting, which is why I said this can continue into next year. I mean, it's between the sales -- the sales process and the forecasting process itself, I think we might need to make changes in both areas. I think we do it really well in certain spots in a number of regions. And as we've always said, we felt like Americas had a very disciplined process. But I think we do it -- we don't do it as consistently globally as we probably -- as I know we can. And so driving global consistency in the way that we -- that we do with the items we look at, the dashboards we use, even the taxonomy, the -- what do you mean by defining opportunity versus upside and those kinds of things. I'll say, in some places we do that really well. But I'd like to drive more global consistency around that. And then your second question on transitions. I think, generally, it's okay, for us if our customers are transitioning to other products and platforms. There's normally good reason for that and we still believe in elasticity. And over time, that revenue comes back. The fact that it causes a dip as those customers transition, I think it's just part, kind of, goes with the territory. And so key there, again, back to the forecast process, is our ability to predict that versus being surprised by that. But the actual dynamic itself, I don't think is one that we need to worry about as long as our customers don't take multiple years to transition, which will be more damaging to their business than it is to ours."

This is lower than the outlook w",1308,"Thanks, Rebecca, and good afternoon, everyone. As we shared a few weeks ago, our third quarter revenue was $607 million, a 10% increase over Q3 of last year, and we expect Q4 revenue to be flat to slightly up sequentially. This is lower than the outlook we provided in July. Since the close of the quarter, we have analyzed market and funding dynamics, capacity utilization, competition and outsourcing trends. Based on these reviews, we do not believe that excess market capacity, outsourcing or competition materially affected our results or outlook. 
Utilization of our high throughput installed base continues to trend upward, normalizing for the large annual stocking orders received in Q3, both this year and last. Additionally, purchasing patterns at customers who have only HiSeq 2500s have been stable, supporting the view that these labs are not increasing their outsourcing to service providers. 
Lastly, from a competition standpoint, while we do compete for the allocation of funds, our win rates remain steady, and we do not believe this has been a significant factor. We have identified the factors we believe drove our Q3 miss and lower fourth quarter revenue guidance. 
First, in the second half, we have been tracking opportunities for more than 90 HiSeq X instruments between funnel and backlog and previously forecasted that more than 60 would shift. Due to a shift in certain U.S. government institutions funding practices and 2 customer-specific situations, approximately 35 of these instruments have moved out of the second half. For the academic and government opportunities, projects of these institutions were previously awarded in 3- to 5-year commitments, enabling customers to purchase instruments upon award. This year, smaller portions of these projects were awarded with shorter or uncertain time frames, affecting our customers' ability to make capital commitments. Ultimately, we do not believe that this will -- this change will affect the size of these programs, which plan to sequence more than a 100,000 genomes in the coming years. 
Based on these programs, as well as other personalized medicine projects, including Francis plans to establish population scale sequencing operations and the Cancer Moonshot Initiative, we believe that sequencing sample growth remains robust. 
Furthermore, as we shared in the preannouncement, 1 HiSeq X system that was expected to close in Q3 did not materialize due to capital constraints, specific to that customer. Additionally, we removed at our HiSeq X Ten associated with the nation scale project that was originally anticipated in Q4 and has since pushed to 2017 due to lab readiness. 
The other factor that contributed to the second half shortfall was lower-than-anticipated HiSeq 2500 and 4000 orders, which we believe was driven by legacy HiSeq customers favoring the HiSeq X and NextSeq platforms. The introduction of HiSeq X Ten -- HiSeq X in January 2014 enables whole genome sequencing to be performed much more economically. And as a result, samples have shifted to whole genome sequencing at the expense of other applications. 
Whole genome sequencing on HiSeq X now represents approximately 15% of all high throughput runs, compared to 2% just 2 years ago. Additionally, the release of NextSeq's v2 reagents in 2015 brought the quality on par with HiSeq. As a result, some high throughput customers have been adopting NextSeq given its flexible workflow, which enables batching fewer samples and attractive operating costs. As a result, we will not see the second half uptick in high throughput instrument placements we had previously expected. 
To better identify trends like this earlier, we have initiated a global forecast improvement project, which I've asked Marc to lead, that will enhance both our visibility and forecast accuracy. Over time, we are relatively indifferent to these shifts. As in both of these cases, the lower operating costs of HiSeq X and NextSeq enables our customers to sequence more samples. However, the timing of the elasticity taking effect or the customer completing their transition varies across customers and can create a temporary dip in spending. Given this, HiSeq consumable utilizations was slightly below our guidance range of $300,000 to $350,000, driven primarily by a few customers shifting to other platforms in the Americas, including the HiSeq 4000 and not a decline in utilization across the broader installed base. These new platform implementations take time, sometimes several quarters, and are expected to impact utilization in Q4. 
Moving now to the rest of our portfolio. Benchtop instruments performed well in the quarter. NextSeq benefited from commercial customers scaling capacity, including NIPT customers in the U.S. and China, and saw continued strength in consumable utilization with pull through at the top end of the guidance range of $100,000 to $150,000. Additionally, both instruments and reagents sales of MiSeq and MiniSeq performed in line with our expectations. 
Microarrays grew more than 35% year-over-year quarter, driven by another quarter of strong direct-to-consumer demand as well as robust interest from agriculture customers, which increased 20%. Array orders grew more than 90% versus the third quarter of last year, as we received orders for another 2 million samples for our Global Screening Array, or GSA, during the quarter, bringing the total to over 5 million samples. Additionally, Infinium XT gained traction in Q3, and as this product continues to contribute to order growth. Both of these new products are now shipping and have backlogs that extend over the next few years, which has led to an improved multiyear outlook for arrays. 
I will now move to an update on a few of our key markets. Oncology testing shipments grew 24% versus the prior year as our broad enablement strategy continues to drive the penetration of the oncology market. Importantly, the research-use only launch of our TruSight Tumor 170 panel remains on our expected schedule for later this quarter. Additionally, we have submitted our companion diagnostic test for Vectibix, developed through our partnership with Amgen to the FDA for premarket approval. In NIPT, we continue to see customers shifting to testing in-house in our sequencers. And as a result, we performed about 20,000 samples through our testing facility. 
Over the last four quarters, we have transitioned two large customers. And going forward, expect more stable TSO volumes as well as continued growth in sequencing instruments and consumable sales. Our multiyear outlook for these markets remains optimistic, driven by oncology reimbursement and regulation playing out over time, and our ability to penetrate the average risk and global NIPT opportunities. 
I would like to take a moment to discuss the announcement we filed today that Christian Henry will be leaving the company at the end of January. As many of you know, Christian has been an integral part of our team since joining Illumina as Chief Financial Officer in 2005. He has held many different leadership roles, including General Manager of the Genomic Solutions and Life Sciences business as well as most recently, our Chief Commercial Officer. I would like to thank Christian for his many contributions over the years and wish him and his family the best as they embark on their next chapter. 
Effective immediately, I've asked Mark Van Oene, currently the General Manager of our Americas business to step in as interim Chief Commercial Officer while we conduct a search. Mark has been a member of the Illumina team since 2006, and has successfully led our Americas commercial team to a remarkable growth. I am confident that with Mark's help, supported by the strong commercial team that Christian has built, we are in good hands during this transition phase. 
In closing, the current product lifecycle dynamics may take several quarters to resolve, but they are temporal in nature. We remain in the beginning stages of the large and untapped genomics market, and remain committed to introducing innovative technology over the coming years. 
I will now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our third quarter results."

As Francis mentioned, total revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $607 million, consistent with our preliminary estimates on October 10. Sequencing consumables and strong demand for microarrays drove the growth, offset by a decline in sequencing instruments. 
Geographically, revenue in the Americas grew 2% versus the prior year due to lower-than-expected HiSeq 2500 and 4000 instruments and HiSeq 2500 reagent shipments as well as the challenging HiSeq X comparison. Asia-Pacific revenue increased 35% versus Q3 '15, as China grew more than 85%. European revenue grew 16%, a slight dip to forecast and we believe that the region's positive progress in execution will continue over the coming quarters. 
Sequencing instrument revenue declined 26% year-over-year to $106 million. While the year-over-year drop was predicted due to the challenging HiSeq X comparison, this result was lower than our projection given the miss in high throughput instruments, as Francis discussed. 
Consumable revenue represented 65% of total revenue to equal $396 million, an increase of 23% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Sequencing consumable revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $333 million, driven by our growing installed base of instruments and particular strength in HiSeq X and NextSeq consumables. 
Please note that we have removed approximately 64 HiSeq estimates from our ending Q3 installed base to reflect the units taken off-line due to the adoption of newer machines. 
Services and other revenue grew approximately 18% versus Q3 2015 to $93 million, led by strength in genotyping services and sequencing instrument maintenance contracts associated with the large installed base, partially offset by an expected decline in NIPT service revenue given customer migrations to in-house testing. 
Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which excludes noncash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures as well as our GAAP EPS guidance, which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refers to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders. 
Our adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.5%, a sequential decrease of 30 basis points. Year-over-year, gross margin decreased 70 basis points, given investment in sequencing consumable and array manufacturing capacity as well as our clinical capabilities, which was partially offset by favorable consumable mix. 
Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $114 million or 18.8% of revenue, including $14 million or 2.4% attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $114 million or 19% of revenue in the second quarter. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $117 million or 19.3% of revenue, including $9 million or 1.5% attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $127 million or 21.2% of revenue in Q2. 
Given our updated revenue and earnings forecast for the year, we booked a $16 million benefit in Q3, primarily to operating expense resulting from adjustments to our annual variable compensation plan accrual. Additionally, we removed $6 million of compensation expense from our Q4 forecast, neither of these adjustments were anticipated in our previous forecast or guidance. For 2017 planning purposes, investors should contemplate an incremental $0.22 EPS headwind as the accrual returns to normal levels for the full year. 
Adjusted operating margins were 34.4% compared to 32.6% in the second quarter, higher primarily due to the variable compensation accrual benefit as well as lower legal expenses. Operating margin was lower compared to the 36% reported in the third quarter of last year due to increased investments in headcount, GRAIL and Helix. Excluding GRAIL and Helix, operating margin was 38.2%, stock-based compensation expense equaled $35 million, up sequentially from $32 million. 
We reported third quarter GAAP net income of $129 million, an EPS of $0.87 per diluted share compared to net income of $118 million or $0.79 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Our non-GAAP net income was $144 million, which led to $0.97 in earnings per diluted share, which includes an $0.08 benefit from the compensation adjustment mentioned previously. Non-GAAP EPS this quarter included approximately $0.05 and $0.02 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix, respectively. This quarterly result compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $120 million and $0.80 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Cash flow from operations equaled to $150 million, reduced by 100% of the GRAIL and Helix cash burn of $20 million this quarter. Q3 DSO totaled 57 days, up slightly compared to 56 days last quarter, but still healthy given the unfavorable linearity we experienced. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $57 million and we reported an additional $84 million increase in property and equipment recorded under build-to-suit lease accounting where such expenses were paid for by the landlord. Consequently, Q3 free cash flow was $93 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, including the consolidated cash balances of GRAIL and Helix. 
During the quarter, our Board of Directors authorized a new $250 million stock repurchase program, under which we repurchased 13 million of common stock and have $237 million of authorization remaining. 
Turning now to expectations for the remainder of 2016. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be flat to slightly up sequentially. To be more precise, slightly up should be considered an increase of up to $5 million. This guidance no longer reflects our previously expected uptick in high-throughput sequencing instruments. For fiscal 2016, we are now projecting GAAP earnings per diluted share to be attributable to Illumina stockholders of $2.92 to $2.97 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.27 to $3.32. 
Please refer to our Investor deck for details as to the drivers of our updated guidance. 
We have updated our GRAIL dilution for the year to be approximately $0.30, primarily as a result of the weight of the common shares issued by GRAIL in the first half compared to the reduced share count in the second half, driving an inflated full year share calculation. Our share of the GRAIL losses on a quarterly basis including in Q3 continues to be at approximately 50% as communicated on our last earnings call. Helix dilution is expected to be $0.10. 
In closing, I would like to spend a minute on the forecast process improvement project that Francis mentioned. We have already started the initial phase, which is expected to run until mid-December. And we'll identify key opportunities for improvement including any immediate changes that we can make to enhance our visibility. We will hold the good work already underway in Europe into this process and identify areas for improving global consistency, taking the best of the best practices from each region and adding best-in-class practices where needed. This will inevitably lead to a second stage of the project next year, which we anticipate will incorporate longer-term tool and process implementations. I look forward to updating you on our progress periodically. 
Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question and rejoin the queue, if you have additional questions. Operator, we will now open the lines."

What we -- so what we are seeing is as people are making choices around which high throughput instrument to go for.

Based on your prepared remarks, it seems like, while consumable revenue growth may be lumpy from line to line in the model that you have a lot of conviction in the outlook for sustained consumable revenue momentum. And then the second part is, related to that, recognizing that in spite of the fact that consumables revenue growth has been robust and that you are the world's premier sequencing company, you keep missing numbers. So with that in mind, are there business model changes that need to be made to make you less susceptible to capital cycles? Thank you."

The volatility that we have seen has been primarily driven on the instrument side over the last few quarters. We talked about some of the dynamics playing out in the Americas in Q3 where, in some cases, there were changes in funding practices that caused some customers to not spring for the capital purchase, but still look to do sequencing. In other cases, we talked about dynamics where customers who are purchasing either Xs or going to NextSeqs instead of 4000. So a lot of the volatility has been around the instrument dynamics, and we've seen a fairly strong growth in consumables throughout that whole period. We expect that to continue.

So we continue to hear from our research customers especially that there are lots of projects that they would like to take on, and they will do that as the price of sequencing comes down.

They're looking forward to the price points continuing to go down. So I continue to deeply believe in the elasticity of the demand in the research customers. The reality is we understand so little of the functionality of the genome in almost any area that you can think of that I believe that there is a lot more sequencing to be done, and a lot of it will be enabled through lower price points. So that's sort of one point. I think that what we are seeing is customers making the decision to do whole genome have the potential to look at both the 4000 and the X. And the economics associated with the X are still significantly better than the 4000, and so that's why they're -- that's what's driving the decision I talked about in my remarks where as if they have any kind of volume around whole genome or they have access to a whole genome sequencing service, those economics may be very compelling for some customers."

And we expected that would be further along than it is. That's still coming, and so we expect that will play out in '17 and beyond. But we did expect to be further on than we are today. There are areas that did perform a lot better. So for example, the growth that we're seeing in China has been ahead of where we expect it to be. Some of it is driven by the Chinese PMI and customers buying as part of the Chinese PMI. Some of it has been customers buying in anticipation of being a service provider to the Chinese PMI projects. But a lot of it is driven by adoption -- clinical adoption in the Chinese market, and that has been further ahead than where we'd expected. China is already now our #2 market -- country market in the world, and so that's been an area that has moved faster than we expected. The whole genome sequencing market has moved further and faster than we'd expected. We've touched on in the remarks that today, whole genome sequencing represents 15% of the sequencing done in high-throughput instruments. That's up from 2% just 2 years ago, and that's vastly exceeded our expectations. We're starting to hear from a lot of customers on the research side, certainly, that they do want to move to whole genome sequencing and that they see that as a very evolutionary sort of natural next step for them in their research to get a better handle on the biology involved.

But when you do either a year-to-date or a full year basis, you take the weighted average of the shares over the number of quarters included. So on a full year, it's over 4 quarters. On a year-to-date, it's over 3 quarters. And of course, in the first -- the way we did that particular transaction in the first 2 quarters, there were more shares in that calculation than there are in the second 2 quarters. So when you do that weighted average effect over 4 quarters for a full year, it equates to more like 80%, even above 80% of the losses that we would record instead of the 50% that we're now down to for the quarter. So what that means, if you take it to its natural conclusion, it's the 4 quarters done some to the full year EPS. And there's a chart in our investor deck that clearly shows that, that happens.

And so you see a lot of our customers that are running LDTs move to the NextSeq. And what they like is the flexible workflows. They like the fact that they don't have to batch as many samples than they would have to with the HiSeq. And that's a phenomena that's been building, and so it's been -- it's not been shocks at me this quarter, and it's been building over time. And I think it was important -- the v2 chemistry was sort of an important step for us with the NextSeq where there was an initial period where looking -- where people were looking to see the quality of the runs on NextSeq compared to the other instruments of the 4 channel instruments. And with the v2, customers started to get comfortable that we had achieved parity in the quality of the output that they could get, and they started trialing those instruments and validating them. And so this was a trend that's been building. There are definitely things we are taking away from that on a number of areas. One is we are very pleased with the traction that we're seeing, for example, with 2 channel chemistry and the benefit that it gives to our customers. And so internally, that's something we're thinking through how we leverage that even more broadly. There are other lessons we're taking around. NIPT is one of those markets where we have focused specifically around the end-to-end workflow and making our solution easy for our customers to consume in the NIPT market. And you see that with the VeriSeq launch that we're doing as well. And for us, that represents a good way for us to get good traction in the applied markets. And so that's another lesson we're taking from the success we're seeing in NextSeq."

So there are a number of different things that we can do, including connecting the market insights that we have as well as improving the market insights that we have and connecting those to the forecasted pipeline and driving more discipline around our CRM database, around pipeline definitions and so on. And it's much broader than just forecasting, but -- which is why I said this can continue into next year. I mean, it's between the sales process and the forecasting process itself. We might need to make changes in both areas. I think we do it really well in certain spots in a number of region. And as we've always said, we felt like Americas had a very disciplined process. But I think we do it -- we don't do it as consistently globally as we probably -- as we -- as I know we can. And so driving global consistency in the way that we -- that we do at the items we look at, the dashboards we use, even the taxonomy, the -- what do you mean by defining opportunity versus upside and those kinds of things. And I'll say, in some places, we do that really well. But I'd like to drive more global consistency around that. And then your second question on transitions. I think generally, it's okay for us if our customers are transitioning to other products and platforms. There's normally good reason for that, and we still believe in elasticity. And over time, that revenue comes back. The fact that it causes a dip as those customers transition, I think, is just part -- kind of, it goes with the territory. And so key there, again, back to the forecast process, is our ability to predict that versus being surprised by that. But the actual dynamic itself, I don't think is one we need to worry about as long as our customers don't take multiple years to transition, which would be more damaging to their business than it is to ours."

And we are going to continue to invest in sales team and people who carry a quota. That's clear. But the normal balance we go through every year is trading off between how much can we spend on R&D. And as you can tell, it's trending up quite high and much higher than our peer group for -- because we believe in the technology and the headroom that Francis mentioned earlier. But the trade-off might be with sales and marketing or even G&A. I tried to drive G&A down and provide leverage to drive it down as a percentage of revenue.

As we shared a few weeks ago, our third quarter revenue was $607 million, a 10% increase over Q3 of last year, and we expect Q4 revenue to be flat to slightly up sequentially. This is lower than the outlook w",1303,"Thanks, Rebecca, and good afternoon, everyone. As we shared a few weeks ago, our third quarter revenue was $607 million, a 10% increase over Q3 of last year, and we expect Q4 revenue to be flat to slightly up sequentially. This is lower than the outlook we provided in July. Since the close of the quarter, we have analyzed market and funding dynamics, capacity utilization, competition and outsourcing trends. Based on these reviews, we do not believe that excess market capacity, outsourcing or competition materially affected our results or outlook. 
Utilization of our high throughput installed base continues to trend upward, normalizing for the large annual stocking orders received in Q3, both this year and last. Additionally, purchasing patterns at customers who have only HiSeq 2500s have been stable, supporting the view that these labs are not increasing their outsourcing to service providers. 
Lastly, from a competition standpoint, while we do compete for the allocation of funds, our win rates remain steady, and we do not believe this has been a significant factor. We have identified the factors we believe drove our Q3 miss and lower fourth quarter revenue guidance. 
First, in the second half, we have been tracking opportunities for more than 90 HiSeq X instruments between funnel and backlog and previously forecasted that more than 60 would shift. Due to a shift in certain U.S. government institutions funding practices and 2 customer-specific situations, approximately 35 of these instruments have moved out of the second half. For the academic and government opportunities, projects of these institutions were previously awarded in 3- to 5-year commitments, enabling customers to purchase instruments upon award. This year, smaller portions of these projects were awarded with shorter or uncertain time frames, affecting our customers' ability to make capital commitments. Ultimately, we do not believe that this will -- this change will affect the size of these programs, which plan to sequence more than 100,000 genomes in the coming years. 
Based on these programs, as well as other personalized medicine projects, including France's plans to establish population-scale sequencing operations and the Cancer Moonshot initiative, we believe that sequencing sample growth remains robust. 
Furthermore, as we shared in the preannouncement, one HiSeq X system that was expected to close in Q3 did not materialize due to capital constraints, specific to that customer. Additionally, we removed our HiSeq X Ten associated with the nation scale project that was originally anticipated in Q4 and has since pushed to 2017 due to lab readiness. 
The other factor that contributed to the second half shortfall was lower-than-anticipated HiSeq 2500 and 4000 orders, which we believe was driven by legacy HiSeq customers favoring the HiSeq X and NextSeq platforms. The introduction of HiSeq X Ten -- HiSeq X in January 2014 enables whole genome sequencing to be performed much more economically. And as a result, samples have shifted to whole genome sequencing at the expense of other applications. 
Whole genome sequencing on HiSeq X now represents approximately 15% of all high throughput runs, compared to 2% just 2 years ago. Additionally, the release of NextSeq's v2 reagents in 2015 brought the quality on par with HiSeq. As a result, some high throughput customers have been adopting NextSeq given its flexible workflow, which enables batching fewer samples and attractive operating costs. As a result, we will not see the second half uptick in high throughput instrument placements we had previously expected. 
To better identify trends like this earlier, we have initiated a global forecast improvement project, which I've asked Marc to lead, that will enhance both our visibility and forecast accuracy. Over time, we are relatively indifferent to these shifts. As in both of these cases, the lower operating costs of HiSeq X and NextSeq enables our customers to sequence more samples. However, the timing of the elasticity taking effect or the customer completing their transition varies across customers and can create a temporary dip in spending. Given this, HiSeq consumable utilization was slightly below our guidance range of $300,000 to $350,000, driven primarily by a few customers shifting to other platforms in the Americas, including the HiSeq 4000 and not a decline in utilization across the broader installed base. These new platform implementations take time, sometimes several quarters, and are expected to impact utilization in Q4. 
Moving now to the rest of our portfolio, benchtop instruments performed well in the quarter. NextSeq benefited from commercial customers scaling capacity, including NIPT customers in the U.S. and China, and saw continued strength in consumable utilization with pull-through at the top end of the guidance range of $100,000 to $150,000. Additionally, both instruments and reagents sales of MiSeq and MiniSeq performed in line with our expectations. 
Microarrays grew more than 35% year-over-year, driven by another quarter of strong direct-to-consumer demand as well as robust interest from agriculture customers, which increased 20%. Array orders grew more than 90% versus the third quarter of last year, as we received orders for another 2 million samples for our Global Screening Array, or GSA, during the quarter, bringing the total to over 5 million samples. Additionally, Infinium XT gained traction in Q3, and as this product continues to contribute to order growth. Both of these new products are now shipping and have backlogs that extend over the next few years, which has led to an improved multiyear outlook for arrays. 
I will now move to an update on a few of our key markets. Oncology testing shipments grew 24% versus the prior year as our broad enablement strategy continues to drive the penetration of the oncology market. Importantly, the research-use only launch of our TruSight Tumor 170 panel remains on our expected schedule for later this quarter. Additionally, we have submitted our companion diagnostic test for Vectibix, developed through our partnership with Amgen to the FDA for premarket approval. In NIPT, we continue to see customers shifting to testing in-house in our sequencers. And as a result, we performed about 20,000 samples through our testing facility. 
Over the last 4 quarters, we have transitioned 2 large customers, and going forward, expect more stable TSO volumes as well as continued growth in sequencing instruments and consumable sales. Our multiyear outlook for these markets remains optimistic, driven by oncology reimbursement and regulation playing out over time, and our ability to penetrate the average risk and global NIPT opportunities. 
I would like to take a moment to discuss the announcement we filed today that Christian Henry will be leaving the company at the end of January. As many of you know, Christian has been an integral part of our team since joining Illumina as Chief Financial Officer in 2005. He has held many different leadership roles, including General Manager of the Genomic Solutions and Life Sciences business as well as most recently, our Chief Commercial Officer. I would like to thank Christian for his many contributions over the years and wish him and his family the best as they embark on their next chapter. 
Effective immediately, I've asked Mark Van Oene, currently the General Manager of our Americas business to step in as interim Chief Commercial Officer while we conduct a search. Mark has been a member of the Illumina team since 2006, and has successfully led our Americas commercial team to a remarkable growth. I am confident that with Mark's help, supported by the strong commercial team that Christian has built, we are in good hands during this transition phase. 
In closing, the current product lifecycle dynamics may take several quarters to resolve, but they are temporal in nature. We remain in the beginning stages of the large and untapped genomics market, and remain committed to introducing innovative technology over the coming years. 
I will now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our third quarter results."

As Francis mentioned, total revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $607 million, consistent with our preliminary estimates on October 10. Sequencing consumables and strong demand for microarrays drove the growth, offset by a decline in sequencing instruments. 
Geographically, revenue in the Americas grew 2% versus the prior year due to lower-than-expected HiSeq 2500 and 4000 instruments and HiSeq 2500 reagent shipments as well as the challenging HiSeq X comparison. Asia-Pacific revenue increased 35% versus Q3 '15, as China grew more than 85%. European revenue grew 16%, a slight dip [ph] to forecast and we believe that the region's positive progress in execution will continue over the coming quarters. 
Sequencing instrument revenue declined 26% year-over-year to $106 million. While the year-over-year drop was predicted due to the challenging HiSeq X comparison, this result was lower than our projection given the miss in high throughput instruments, as Francis discussed. 
Consumable revenue represented 65% of total revenue to equal $396 million, an increase of 23% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Sequencing consumable revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $333 million, driven by our growing installed base of instruments and particular strength in HiSeq X and NextSeq consumables. 
Please note that we have removed approximately 64 HiSeq instruments from our ending Q3 installed base to reflect the units taken off line due to the adoption of newer machines. 
Services and other revenue grew approximately 18% versus Q3 2015 to $93 million, led by strength in genotyping services and sequencing instrument maintenance contracts associated with the large installed base, partially offset by an expected decline in NIPT service revenue given customer migrations to in-house testing. 
Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which excludes noncash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures as well as our GAAP EPS guidance, which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refers to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders. 
Our adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.5%, a sequential decrease of 30 basis points. Year-over-year, gross margin decreased 70 basis points, given investment in sequencing consumable and array manufacturing capacity as well as our clinical capabilities, which was partially offset by favorable consumable mix. 
Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $114 million or 18.8% of revenue, including $14 million or 2.4% attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $114 million or 19% of revenue in the second quarter. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $117 million or 19.3% of revenue, including $9 million or 1.5% attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $127 million or 21.2% of revenue in Q2. 
Given our updated revenue and earnings forecast for the year, we booked a $16 million benefit in Q3, primarily to operating expense resulting from adjustments to our annual variable compensation plan accrual. Additionally, we removed $6 million of compensation expense from our Q4 forecast. Neither of these adjustments were anticipated in our previous forecast or guidance. For 2017 planning purposes, investors should contemplate an incremental $0.22 EPS headwind as the accrual returns to normal levels for the full year. 
Adjusted operating margins were 34.4% compared to 32.6% in the second quarter, higher primarily due to the variable compensation accrual benefit as well as lower legal expenses. Operating margin was lower compared to the 36% reported in the third quarter of last year due to increased investments in headcount, GRAIL and Helix. Excluding GRAIL and Helix, operating margin was 38.2%.  Stock-based compensation expense equaled $35 million, up sequentially from $32 million. 
We reported third quarter GAAP net income of $129 million, an EPS of $0.87 per diluted share compared to net income of $118 million or $0.79 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Our non-GAAP net income was $144 million, which led to $0.97 in earnings per diluted share, which includes an $0.08 benefit from the compensation adjustment mentioned previously. Non-GAAP EPS this quarter included approximately $0.05 and $0.02 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix, respectively. This quarterly result compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $120 million and $0.80 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Cash flow from operations equaled $150 million, reduced by 100% of the GRAIL and Helix cash burn of $20 million this quarter. Q3 DSO totaled 57 days, up slightly compared to 56 days last quarter, but still healthy given the unfavorable linearity we experienced. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $57 million and we reported an additional $84 million increase in property and equipment recorded under build-to-suit lease accounting where such expenses were paid for by the landlord. Consequently, Q3 free cash flow was $93 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, including the consolidated cash balances of GRAIL and Helix. 
During the quarter, our Board of Directors authorized a new $250 million stock repurchase program, under which we repurchased 13 million of common stock and have $237 million of authorization remaining. 
Turning now to expectations for the remainder of 2016. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be flat to slightly up sequentially. To be more precise, slightly up should be considered an increase of up to $5 million. This guidance no longer reflects our previously expected uptick in high-throughput sequencing instruments. For fiscal 2016, we are now projecting GAAP earnings per diluted share to be attributable to Illumina stockholders of $2.92 to $2.97 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.27 to $3.32. 
Please refer to our Investor deck for details as to the drivers of our updated guidance. 
We have updated our GRAIL dilution for the year to be approximately $0.30, primarily as a result of the weight of the common shares issued by GRAIL in the first half compared to the reduced share count in the second half, driving an inflated full year share calculation. Our share of the GRAIL losses on a quarterly basis including in Q3 continues to be at approximately 50% as communicated on our last earnings call. Helix dilution is expected to be $0.10. 
In closing, I would like to spend a minute on the forecast process improvement project that Francis mentioned. We have already started the initial phase, which is expected to run until mid-December. And we'll identify key opportunities for improvement including any immediate changes that we can make to enhance our visibility. We will hold the good work already underway in Europe into this process and identify areas for improving global consistency, taking the best of the best practices from each region and adding best-in-class practices where needed. This will inevitably lead to a second stage of the project next year, which we anticipate will incorporate longer-term tool and process implementations. I look forward to updating you on our progress periodically. 
Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, we will now open the lines."

The volatility that we have seen has been primarily driven on the instrument side over the last few quarters. We talked about some of the dynamics playing out in the Americas in Q3 where, in some cases, there were changes in funding practices that caused some customers to not spring for the capital purchase, but still look to do sequencing. In other cases, we talked about dynamics where customers who are purchasing either Xs or going to NextSeqs instead of 4000. So a lot of the volatility has been around the instrument dynamics, and we've seen a fairly strong growth in consumables throughout that whole period. We expect that to continue.

So we continue to hear from our research customers especially that there are lots of projects that they would like to take on, and they will do that as the price of sequencing comes down.

They're looking forward to the price points continuing to go down. So I continue to deeply believe in the elasticity of the demand in the research customers. The reality is we understand so little of the functionality of the genome in almost any area that you can think of that I believe that there is a lot more sequencing to be done, and a lot of it will be enabled through lower price points. So that's sort of one point. I think that what we are seeing is customers making the decision to do with whole genome have the potential to look at both the 4000 and the X. And the economics associated with the X are still significantly better than the 4000, and so that's why they're -- that's what's driving the decision I talked about in my remarks where as if they have any kind of volume around whole-genome or they have access to a whole-genome sequencing service, those economics may be very compelling for some customers."

And we expected that would be further along than it is. That's still coming, and so we expect that will play out in '17 and beyond. But we did expect to be further on than we are today. There are areas that did perform a lot better. So for example, the growth that we're seeing in China has been ahead of where we expect it to be. Some of it is driven by the Chinese PMI and customers buying as part of the Chinese PMI. Some of it has been customers buying in anticipation of being a service provider to the Chinese PMI projects. But a lot of it is driven by adoption -- clinical adoption in the Chinese market, and that has been further ahead than where we'd expected. China is already now our #2 market -- country market in the world, and so that's been an area that has moved faster than we expected. The whole genome sequencing market has moved further and faster than we'd expected. We've touched on, in the remarks, that today, whole-genome sequencing represents 15% of the sequencing done in high-throughput instruments. That's up from 2% just 2 years ago, and that's vastly exceeded our expectations. We're starting to hear from a lot of customers on the research side certainly, that they do want to move to whole-genome sequencing and that -- they see that as a very evolutionary sort of natural next step for them in their research to get a better handle on the biology involved.

But when we do either a year-to-date or a full year basis, you take the weighted average of the shares over the number of quarters included. So on a full year, it's over 4 quarters. On a year-to-date, it's over 3 quarters. And of course, in the first -- the way we did that particular transaction in the first 2 quarters, there were more shares in that calculation than there are in the second 2 quarters. So when you do that weighted average effect over 4 quarters for a full year, it equates to more like 80%, even above 80% of the losses that we would record instead of the 50% that we're now down too for the quarter. So what that means, if you take it to its natural conclusion, it's the 4 quarters lump some to the full year EPS. And there's a chart in our investor deck that clearly shows that, that happens.

And so you see a lot of our customers that are running LDTs move to the NextSeq. And what they like are the flexible workflows. They like the fact that they don't have to batch as many samples than they would have to with the HiSeq. And that's a phenomena that's been building, and so it's been -- it's not been a shock certainly this quarter, and it's been building over time. And I think it was important -- the v2 chemistry was sort of an important step for us with the NextSeq, where there was an initial period where looking -- where people were looking to see the quality of the runs on NextSeq compared to the other instruments, the 4 channel instruments. And with the v2, customers started to get comfortable that we had achieved parity in the quality of the output that they could get, and they started trialing those instruments and validating them. And so this is a trend that's been building. There are definitely things we are taking away from that on a number of areas. One is we are thoroughly pleased with the traction that we're seeing, for example, with 2-channel chemistry and the benefit that it gives to our customers. And so internally, that's something we're thinking through how we leverage that even more broadly. There are other lessons we're taking around -- NIPT is one of those markets where we have focused specifically around the end-to-end workflow and making our solution easy for our customers to consume in the NIPT market. And you see that with the VeriSeq launch that we're doing as well. And for us, that represents a good way for us to get good traction in the applied markets. And so that's another lesson we're taking from the success we're seeing in NextSeq."

So there are a number of different things that we can do, including connecting the market insights that we have, as well as improving the market insights that we have and connecting those to the forecasted pipeline and driving more discipline around our CRM database, around our pipeline definitions and so on. And it's much broader than just forecasting, but -- which is why I said this can continue into next year. I mean, it's between the sales process and the forecasting process itself. We might need to make changes in both areas. I think we do it really well in certain spots in a number of regions. And as we've always said, we felt like America has had a very disciplined process. But I think we do it -- we don't do it as consistently globally as we probably -- as we -- as I know we can. And so driving global consistency in the way that we do with the items we look at, the dashboards we use, even the taxonomy, the -- what do you mean by defining opportunity versus upside and those kinds of things. And I'd say, in some places, we do that really well. But I'd like to drive more global consistency around that. And then to your second question on transitions. I think generally, it's okay for us if our customers are transitioning to other products and platforms. There's normally good reason for that, and we still believe in elasticity. And over time, that revenue comes back. The fact that it causes a dip as those customers transition, I think, is just part -- kind of, it goes with the territory. And so key there, again, back to the forecast process, is our ability to predict that versus being surprised by that. But the actual dynamic itself, I don't think is one we need to worry about as long as our customers don't take multiple years to transition, which would be more damaging to their business than it is to ours."

And we are going to continue to invest in our sales team and people who carry a quota. That's clear.

This is lower than the outlook we provided in July. Since the close of the quarter, we have analyzed market and funding dynamics, capacity utilization, competition and outsourcing trends. Based on these reviews, we do not believe that excess market capacity, outsourcing or competition materially affected our results or outlook. 
Utilization of our high throughput installed base continues to trend upward, normalizing for the large annual stocking orders received in Q3, both this year and last. Additionally, purchasing patterns at customers who have only HiSeq 2500s have been stable, supporting the view that these labs are not increasing their outsourcing to service providers. 
Lastly, from a competition standpoint, while we do compete for the allocation of funds, our win rates remain steady, and we do not believe this has been a significant factor. We have identified the factors we believe drove our Q3 miss and lower fourth quarter revenue guidance. 
First, in the second half, we have been tracking opportunities for more than 90 HiSeq X instruments between funnel and backlog and previously forecasted that more than 60 would shift. Due to a shift in certain U.S. government institutions funding practices and 2 customer-specific situations, approximately 35 of these instruments have moved out of the second half. For the academic and government opportunities, projects of these institutions were previously awarded in 3- to 5-year commitments, enabling customers to purchase instruments upon award. This year, smaller portions of these projects were awarded with shorter or uncertain time frames, affecting our customers' ability to make capital commitments. Ultimately, we do not believe that this will -- this change will affect the size of these programs, which plan to sequence more than 100,000 genomes in the coming years. 
Based on these programs, as well as other personalized medicine projects, including France's plans to establish population-scale sequencing operations and the Cancer Moonshot initiative, we believe that sequencing sample growth remains robust. 
Furthermore, as we shared in the preannouncement, one HiSeq X system that was expected to close in Q3 did not materialize due to capital constraints, specific to that customer. Additionally, we removed our HiSeq X Ten associated with the nation scale project that was originally anticipated in Q4 and has since pushed to 2017 due to lab readiness. 
The other factor that contributed to the second half shortfall was lower-than-anticipated HiSeq 2500 and 4000 orders, which we believe was driven by legacy HiSeq customers favoring the HiSeq X and NextSeq platforms. The introduction of HiSeq X Ten -- HiSeq X in January 2014 enables whole genome sequencing to be performed much more economically. And as a result, samples have shifted to whole genome sequencing at the expense of other applications. 
Whole genome sequencing on HiSeq X now represents approximately 15% of all high throughput runs, compared to 2% just 2 years ago. Additionally, the release of NextSeq's v2 reagents in 2015 brought the quality on par with HiSeq. As a result, some high throughput customers have been adopting NextSeq given its flexible workflow, which enables batching fewer samples and attractive operating costs. As a result, we will not see the second half uptick in high throughput instrument placements we had previously expected. 
To better identify trends like this earlier, we have initiated a global forecast improvement project, which I've asked Marc to lead, that will enhance both our visibility and forecast accuracy. Over time, we are relatively indifferent to these shifts. As in both of these cases, the lower operating costs of HiSeq X and NextSeq enables our customers to sequence more samples. However, the timing of the elasticity taking effect or the customer completing their transition varies across customers and can create a temporary dip in spending. Given this, HiSeq consumable utilization was slightly below our guidance range of $300,000 to $350,000, driven primarily by a few customers shifting to other platforms in the Americas, including the HiSeq 4000 and not a decline in utilization across the broader installed base. These new platform implementations take time, sometimes several quarters, and are expected to impact utilization in Q4. 
Moving now to the rest of our portfolio, benchtop instruments performed well in the quarter. NextSeq benefited from commercial customers scaling capacity, including NIPT customers in the U.S. and China, and saw continued strength in consumable utilization with pull-through at the top end of the guidance range of $100,000 to $150,000. Additionally, both instruments and reagents sales of MiSeq and MiniSeq performed in line with our expectations. 
Microarrays grew more than 35% year-over-year, driven by another quarter of strong direct-to-consumer demand as well as robust interest from agriculture customers, which increased 20%. Array orders grew more than 90% versus the third quarter of last year, as we received orders for another 2 million samples for our Global Screening Array, or GSA, during the quarter, bringing the total to over 5 million samples. Additionally, Infinium XT gained traction in Q3, and as this product continues to contribute to order growth. Both of these new products are now shipping and have backlogs that extend over the next few years, which has led to an improved multiyear outlook for arrays. 
I will now move to an update on a few of our key markets. Oncology testing shipments grew 24% versus the prior year as our broad enablement strategy continues to drive the penetration of the oncology market. Importantly, the research-use only launch of our TruSight Tumor 170 panel remains on our expected schedule for later this quarter. Additionally, we have submitted our companion diagnostic test for Vectibix, developed through our partnership with Amgen to the FDA for premarket approval. In NIPT, we continue to see customers shifting to testing in-house in our sequencers. And as a result, we performed about 20,000 samples through our testing facility. 
Over the last 4 quarters, we have transitioned 2 large customers, and going forward, expect more stable TSO volumes as well as continued growth in sequencing instruments and consumable sales. Our multiyear outlook for these markets remains optimistic, driven by oncology reimbursement and regulation playing out over time, and our ability to penetrate the average risk and global NIPT opportunities. 
I would like to take a moment to discuss the announcement we filed today that Christian Henry will be leaving the company at the end of January. As many of you know, Christian has been an integral part of our team since joining Illumina as Chief Financial Officer in 2005. He has held many different leadership roles, including General Manager of the Genomic Solutions and Life Sciences business as well as most recently, our Chief Commercial Officer. I would like to thank Christian for his many contributions over the years and wish him and his family the best as they embark on their next chapter. 
Effective immediately, I've asked Mark Van Oene, currently the General Manager of our Americas business to step in as interim Chief Commercial Officer while we conduct a search. Mark has been a member of the Illumina team since 2006, and has successfully led our Americas commercial team to a remarkable growth. I am confident that with Mark's help, supported by the strong commercial team that Christian has built, we are in good hands during this transition phase. 
In closing, the current product lifecycle dynamics may take several quarters to resolve, but they are temporal in nature. We remain in the beginning stages of the large and untapped genomics market, and remain committed to introducing innovative technology over the coming years. 
I will now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our third quarter results."

As Francis mentioned, total revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $607 million, consistent with our preliminary estimates on October 10. Sequencing consumables and strong demand for microarrays drove the growth, offset by a decline in sequencing instruments. 
Geographically, revenue in the Americas grew 2% versus the prior year due to lower-than-expected HiSeq 2500 and 4000 instruments and HiSeq 2500 reagent shipments as well as the challenging HiSeq X comparison. Asia-Pacific revenue increased 35% versus Q3 '15, as China grew more than 85%. European revenue grew 16%, a slight dip [ph] to forecast and we believe that the region's positive progress in execution will continue over the coming quarters. 
Sequencing instrument revenue declined 26% year-over-year to $106 million. While the year-over-year drop was predicted due to the challenging HiSeq X comparison, this result was lower than our projection given the miss in high throughput instruments, as Francis discussed. 
Consumable revenue represented 65% of total revenue to equal $396 million, an increase of 23% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Sequencing consumable revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $333 million, driven by our growing installed base of instruments and particular strength in HiSeq X and NextSeq consumables. 
Please note that we have removed approximately 64 HiSeq instruments from our ending Q3 installed base to reflect the units taken off line due to the adoption of newer machines. 
Services and other revenue grew approximately 18% versus Q3 2015 to $93 million, led by strength in genotyping services and sequencing instrument maintenance contracts associated with the large installed base, partially offset by an expected decline in NIPT service revenue given customer migrations to in-house testing. 
Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which excludes noncash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures as well as our GAAP EPS guidance, which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refers to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders. 
Our adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.5%, a sequential decrease of 30 basis points. Year-over-year, gross margin decreased 70 basis points, given investment in sequencing consumable and array manufacturing capacity as well as our clinical capabilities, which was partially offset by favorable consumable mix. 
Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $114 million or 18.8% of revenue, including $14 million or 2.4% attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $114 million or 19% of revenue in the second quarter. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $117 million or 19.3% of revenue, including $9 million or 1.5% attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $127 million or 21.2% of revenue in Q2. 
Given our updated revenue and earnings forecast for the year, we booked a $16 million benefit in Q3, primarily to operating expense resulting from adjustments to our annual variable compensation plan accrual. Additionally, we removed $6 million of compensation expense from our Q4 forecast. Neither of these adjustments were anticipated in our previous forecast or guidance. For 2017 planning purposes, investors should contemplate an incremental $0.22 EPS headwind as the accrual returns to normal levels for the full year. 
Adjusted operating margins were 34.4% compared to 32.6% in the second quarter, higher primarily due to the variable compensation accrual benefit as well as lower legal expenses. Operating margin was lower compared to the 36% reported in the third quarter of last year due to increased investments in headcount, GRAIL and Helix. Excluding GRAIL and Helix, operating margin was 38.2%.  Stock-based compensation expense equaled $35 million, up sequentially from $32 million. 
We reported third quarter GAAP net income of $129 million, an EPS of $0.87 per diluted share compared to net income of $118 million or $0.79 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Our non-GAAP net income was $144 million, which led to $0.97 in earnings per diluted share, which includes an $0.08 benefit from the compensation adjustment mentioned previously. Non-GAAP EPS this quarter included approximately $0.05 and $0.02 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix, respectively. This quarterly result compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $120 million and $0.80 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Cash flow from operations equaled $150 million, reduced by 100% of the GRAIL and Helix cash burn of $20 million this quarter. Q3 DSO totaled 57 days, up slightly compared to 56 days last quarter, but still healthy given the unfavorable linearity we experienced. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $57 million and we reported an additional $84 million increase in property and equipment recorded under build-to-suit lease accounting where such expenses were paid for by the landlord. Consequently, Q3 free cash flow was $93 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, including the consolidated cash balances of GRAIL and Helix. 
During the quarter, our Board of Directors authorized a new $250 million stock repurchase program, under which we repurchased 13 million of common stock and have $237 million of authorization remaining. 
Turning now to expectations for the remainder of 2016. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be flat to slightly up sequentially. To be more precise, slightly up should be considered an increase of up to $5 million. This guidance no longer reflects our previously expected uptick in high-throughput sequencing instruments. For fiscal 2016, we are now projecting GAAP earnings per diluted share to be attributable to Illumina stockholders of $2.92 to $2.97 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.27 to $3.32. 
Please refer to our Investor deck for details as to the drivers of our updated guidance. 
We have updated our GRAIL dilution for the year to be approximately $0.30, primarily as a result of the weight of the common shares issued by GRAIL in the first half compared to the reduced share count in the second half, driving an inflated full year share calculation. Our share of the GRAIL losses on a quarterly basis including in Q3 continues to be at approximately 50% as communicated on our last earnings call. Helix dilution is expected to be $0.10. 
In closing, I would like to spend a minute on the forecast process improvement project that Francis mentioned. We have already started the initial phase, which is expected to run until mid-December. And we'll identify key opportunities for improvement including any immediate changes that we can make to enhance our visibility. We will hold the good work already underway in Europe into this process and identify areas for improving global consistency, taking the best of the best practices from each region and adding best-in-class practices where needed. This will inevitably lead to a second stage of the project next year, which we anticipate will incorporate longer-term tool and process implementations. I look forward to updating you on our progress periodically. 
Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, we will now open the lines."

The volatility that we have seen has been primarily driven on the instrument side over the last few quarters. We talked about some of the dynamics playing out in the Americas in Q3 where, in some cases, there were changes in funding practices that caused some customers to not spring for the capital purchase, but still look to do sequencing. In other cases, we talked about dynamics where customers who are purchasing either Xs or going to NextSeqs instead of 4000. So a lot of the volatility has been around the instrument dynamics, and we've seen a fairly strong growth in consumables throughout that whole period. We expect that to continue.

So we continue to hear from our research customers especially that there are lots of projects that they would like to take on, and they will do that as the price of sequencing comes down.

They're looking forward to the price points continuing to go down. So I continue to deeply believe in the elasticity of the demand in the research customers. The reality is we understand so little of the functionality of the genome in almost any area that you can think of that I believe that there is a lot more sequencing to be done, and a lot of it will be enabled through lower price points. So that's sort of one point. I think that what we are seeing is customers making the decision to do with whole genome have the potential to look at both the 4000 and the X. And the economics associated with the X are still significantly better than the 4000, and so that's why they're -- that's what's driving the decision I talked about in my remarks where as if they have any kind of volume around whole-genome or they have access to a whole-genome sequencing service, those economics may be very compelling for some customers."

And we expected that would be further along than it is. That's still coming, and so we expect that will play out in '17 and beyond. But we did expect to be further on than we are today. There are areas that did perform a lot better. So for example, the growth that we're seeing in China has been ahead of where we expect it to be. Some of it is driven by the Chinese PMI and customers buying as part of the Chinese PMI. Some of it has been customers buying in anticipation of being a service provider to the Chinese PMI projects. But a lot of it is driven by adoption -- clinical adoption in the Chinese market, and that has been further ahead than where we'd expected. China is already now our #2 market -- country market in the world, and so that's been an area that has moved faster than we expected. The whole genome sequencing market has moved further and faster than we'd expected. We've touched on, in the remarks, that today, whole-genome sequencing represents 15% of the sequencing done in high-throughput instruments. That's up from 2% just 2 years ago, and that's vastly exceeded our expectations. We're starting to hear from a lot of customers on the research side certainly, that they do want to move to whole-genome sequencing and that -- they see that as a very evolutionary sort of natural next step for them in their research to get a better handle on the biology involved.

But when we do either a year-to-date or a full year basis, you take the weighted average of the shares over the number of quarters included. So on a full year, it's over 4 quarters. On a year-to-date, it's over 3 quarters. And of course, in the first -- the way we did that particular transaction in the first 2 quarters, there were more shares in that calculation than there are in the second 2 quarters. So when you do that weighted average effect over 4 quarters for a full year, it equates to more like 80%, even above 80% of the losses that we would record instead of the 50% that we're now down too for the quarter. So what that means, if you take it to its natural conclusion, it's the 4 quarters lump sum to the full year EPS. And there's a chart in our investor deck that clearly shows that, that happens.

And so you see a lot of our customers that are running LDTs move to the NextSeq. And what they like are the flexible workflows. They like the fact that they don't have to batch as many samples than they would have to with the HiSeq. And that's a phenomena that's been building, and so it's been -- it's not been a shock certainly this quarter, and it's been building over time. And I think it was important -- the v2 chemistry was sort of an important step for us with the NextSeq, where there was an initial period where looking -- where people were looking to see the quality of the runs on NextSeq compared to the other instruments, the 4 channel instruments. And with the v2, customers started to get comfortable that we had achieved parity in the quality of the output that they could get, and they started trialing those instruments and validating them. And so this is a trend that's been building. There are definitely things we are taking away from that on a number of areas. One is we are thoroughly pleased with the traction that we're seeing, for example, with 2-channel chemistry and the benefit that it gives to our customers. And so internally, that's something we're thinking through how we leverage that even more broadly. There are other lessons we're taking around -- NIPT is one of those markets where we have focused specifically around the end-to-end workflow and making our solution easy for our customers to consume in the NIPT market. And you see that with the VeriSeq launch that we're doing as well. And for us, that represents a good way for us to get good traction in the applied markets. And so that's another lesson we're taking from the success we're seeing in NextSeq."

So there are a number of different things that we can do, including connecting the market insights that we have, as well as improving the market insights that we have and connecting those to the forecasted pipeline and driving more discipline around our CRM database, around our pipeline definitions and so on. And it's much broader than just forecasting, but -- which is why I said this can continue into next year. I mean, it's between the sales process and the forecasting process itself. We might need to make changes in both areas. I think we do it really well in certain spots in a number of regions. And as we've always said, we felt like America has had a very disciplined process. But I think we do it -- we don't do it as consistently globally as we probably -- as we -- as I know we can. And so driving global consistency in the way that we do with the items we look at, the dashboards we use, even the taxonomy, the -- what do you mean by defining opportunity versus upside and those kinds of things. And I'd say, in some places, we do that really well. But I'd like to drive more global consistency around that. And then to your second question on transitions. I think generally, it's okay for us if our customers are transitioning to other products and platforms. There's normally good reason for that, and we still believe in elasticity. And over time, that revenue comes back. The fact that it causes a dip as those customers transition, I think, is just part -- kind of, it goes with the territory. And so key there, again, back to the forecast process, is our ability to predict that versus being surprised by that. But the actual dynamic itself, I don't think is one we need to worry about as long as our customers don't take multiple years to transition, which would be more damaging to their business than it is to ours."

And we are going to continue to invest in our sales team and people who carry a quota. That's clear. But the normal balance we go through every year is trading off between how much can we spend on R&D. And as you can tell, it's trending up quite high and much higher than our peer group for -- because we believe in the technology and the headwind that Francis mentioned earlier. But the trade-off might be with sales and marketing or even G&A. I tried to drive G&A down and provide leverage to drive it down as a percentage of revenue.
