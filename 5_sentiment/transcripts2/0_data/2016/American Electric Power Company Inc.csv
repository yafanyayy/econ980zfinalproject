Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining AEP's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. 2015 if you've remembered is a year of significant transition that culminated a 4-year process of focusing on the fundamentals of our business",2033,"Okay. Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining AEP's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. 2015 if you've remembered is a year of significant transition that culminated a 4-year process of focusing on the fundamentals of our business to drive consistency, execution and discipline while driving toward a strategic vision of what the next premium regulated utility should look like. 
The balance sheet of AEP is strong and we continue to deliver for our shareholders quarter after quarter from a dividend and earnings growth perspective, despite various headwinds that have occurred along the way. This quarter and the year, 2015 are no exceptions. 
First let's talk about the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter '15 GAAP and operating earnings came in at $0.96 per share and $0.48 per share, respectively, compared with fourth quarter '14 GAAP and operating earnings of $0.39 per share and $0.48 per share, respectively. The difference in fourth quarter 2015 GAAP and operating earnings were mainly driven by the sale of AEP River Operations. Fourth quarter was unusual in the sense that winter particularly in December never occurred. It is more like an April. Even so, operating earnings were consistent with fourth quarter last year, even though we gave back approximately $0.11 per share cold-weather related load margins, finishing the year solidly within our revised guidance range at $3.69 per share operating. 
The year finished at $4.17 per share on a GAAP basis as well compared with '14 results of $3.34 per share and $3.43 per share GAAP and operating earnings, respectively. 
As can be seen on the graph on the right of Page 3 of the presentation, AEP has consistently performed better than Utility Index with 1, 3 and 5 year periods and as well outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the last 3 and 5 year periods and lagged the index over the last year given the interest rate and other sensitivities in the electric utility sector in general. Overall, AEP continues to perform very well as the story of the stock continues to become more clear and resonate in the market. 
Operating earnings growth year-on-year was 7.6% and we achieved our expected regulated ROE of 9.6% for the year which increased from the 9% experienced in 2014. During 2015, we also increased the dividend by 5.7% on an annualized basis, consistent with our earnings growth and within our stated dividend payout range of 60% to 70%. 
I mentioned AEP is in transition earlier. There were a couple of important milestones that we achieved during the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. Namely, AEP completed the sale of River Operations that we discussed during the Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call and we reached the settlement with several parties regarding the AEP Ohio PPA. 
AEP's sale of River Operations occurred during the fourth quarter and the transaction occurred according to plan. The cash proceeds were redeployed in advance of the sale by raising our capital forecast for transmission and then by raising our overall capital plan to $5 billion for 2016 at the November EEI Financial Conference, focusing on additional regulated operating company and transmission activities. So we had successfully converted that portion of volatile earnings to a more consistent, regulated earnings profile. 
Regarding the AEP Ohio PPA case. We made significant progress by completing a settlement among the parties, including the staff of the PECO, along with the industrials, Sierra Club, retail providers and others that defines the PPA relationship and the unregulated generation to AEP Ohio customers. The agreement answers the question of how long is long term. 8 years with a cost of -- with a cost base agreement with the return and an adjustment mechanism that works much like the fuel cost pass-through provision. AEP does guarantee up to $100 million credit to customers at the end of the agreement if in the unexpected event, the anticipated savings do not materialize. 
This deal is a great deal for AEP, our customers and the state of Ohio to ensure capacity is maintained for the benefit of customers during a transition period where markets do not have a lot of capacity product and during the movement toward the clean energy future contemplated by the Clean Power Plan. 
AEP also expects to repower, retire or fuel generation as part of this transition and built up the 900 megawatts of renewable solar and wind generation to achieve a balanced generation portfolio for Ohio's future. This arrangement, when approved by the Ohio Commission, will be a model that can be used nationally to assess the tone for parties with substantially different positions about generation resources and the pace of change to come together, focusing on the clean energy future and the mitigation of transition cost increases that our customers and the public expect. AEP and the utilities in the U.S. are the ones that can bring the parties together to work with the states, defined as clean energy future and deploy advanced technologies to improve our customer's experience while ensuring that the benefits are universal to all customers. 
As with any agreement, AEP and the other parties didn't get everything they wanted. But this overall is a good deal that provides clarity and will ultimately benefit our customers and should be approved by the PECO as quickly as possible. We expect the record to be concluded by February 8. And an order from the commission shortly thereafter. Assuming that's the case, the spot [indiscernible] will move to the remaining unregulated generation which we expect the ongoing strategic process to rapidly move to completion. This will set the stage for the next phase of AEP development with a firm financial foundation and position the company for the future. 
Moving to expectations for 2016. We reaffirmed our guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share and we'll continue our focus on disciplined capital allocation, emphasizing investment in our related companies and transmission with CapEx budget of $5 billion for 2016. 
AEP continues to project long-term earnings growth of 4% to 6%. Additionally, as a result of the available bonus depreciation, as a result of the 2015 tax bill from Congress, our -- and our ability to invest as a result the incremental cash, we are raising our capital budgets for the succeeding years to $5 billion in 2017 and $5 billion in 2018. This will enable us to put money to work on behalf of our customers for needed infrastructure, including transmission, means basically interest-free while maintaining rate base levels that support earnings growth. 
Brian will be covering the subject of customer load in a few minutes. But I'd like to say, since the economic recovery began post-2008, we have seen quarter after quarter of inconsistent results, indicating the economy, while generally getting better, is still challenged in several sectors. Also, we have moved from 1 extreme to another from another perspective, from the polar vortex in 2014 to the warmest fourth quarter in the last 30 years in 2015. So it's difficult to evaluate sustaining trends at this point. 
We continue to believe load will increase overall doing 2016, albeit at a slower -- slightly slower pace than originally forecasted but not enough for AEP to adjust guidance. During 2016, we will focus on obtaining approval for the Ohio PPA settlement, continue our strategic review of competitive generation and continue to work with our states on ways to comply with the Clean Power Plan, all with the continued focus on driving efficiencies through lean initiatives, capital allocation, disciplined operation of excellence and continual focus on cultural initiatives that I believe is a prerequisite to remain agile and innovative for the future. 
Now I'll move over to the equalizer graph, which we go over every quarter. And this sort of rolls out for the year. The 2015 earned regulated ROE on the left side of the page and then what we anticipate for the 2016 pro forma regulated ROE on the right side of the page. 
So let's talk about Ohio power for the Ohio area. AEP Ohio is in line with expectations and we expect to finish the year in line with the 12% ROE that's forecasted. As far as APCo is concerned, the West Virginia rate case that we got achieved in 2015 addressed the weak returns in West Virginia. So it helped the ROEs in APCo as well. Rates were implemented in June of 2015, so we expect to see that the rate case will also help improve the ROE in 2016 for APCo. 
Kentucky, it's good to see it coming out. We are seeing the expected improvement at year-end. The commission authorized the $45 million rate increase in July with a 10.25% ROE to be used in weighted average cost of capital for riders in AFUC. So we continue to see an increase from that perspective, which last quarter, as you recall, it was locally short. 
INM achieved an ROE of 10.2%. This is a result of positive regulatory outcomes associated long-term capital investment programs and generation, Rockport, SCR, solar, nuclear with a [indiscernible] cycle management and transmission projects as well. So INM is well-positioned for another positive year in 2016. 
PSO's ROE are generally line with expectations. The economy in Oklahoma experienced a slowdown due in part to low oil prices and the reduced oil and gas activity in the state. In December though, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented interim rates of $75 million at the first of the year. So a final commission order is expected in the second -- during the second quarter of this year. 
SWEPCO continues to be somewhat of a challenge. The operations are strong. But is challenged in the oil and gas area, natural gas price area and as well, the continued issue with Arkansas portion of the Turk plant which we continue to analyze alternatives for that. Hopefully, a retail rate case in Arkansas at some point would be helpful from that perspective. 
AEP Texas. The ongoing distribution capital investment in TCC to serve higher levels of electric load and to maintain the reliability of the grid has gradually lowered the regulated ROE overtime. AEP Texas continues to monitor the earnings levels and the jurisdictions. They basically have 3 avenues available to them. One is the transmission T-cost transmission capital case that they been involved with currently and then also, whether it's a traditional rate case filing or under legislated approach of the distribution cost recovery factor, that's another opportunity for them as well. So they can look at earnings and will focus on those alternatives. 
As far as the AEP Transco -- Transmission Holdco, transmission was at 11.1%. It should drop to 10.2% during the year. But obviously, we're spending a huge amount of capital in the transmission area so you do have some lag there. 
So with that said, or overall, the regulated ROEs are moving from 9.6% to an expected 10.1% for the year. So overall, we should have a good year from a regulatory standpoint. 
Now that we are in 2016 and before I turn it over to Brian, I'll end by saying, I was recently struck by an article I was reading on the 2016 commemoration of 50 years of Star Trek. While it all started with the original series in 1966 with a 5-year mission, it has, over the last 50 years, consistently reinvented itself to remain relevant. AEP, after 110 years, is doing the same thing. This team started out in 2012 after a rough period in Ohio on a 5-year mission of our own that's set a course toward a firm foundation around execution and discipline to advance operationally, financially and culturally. AEP has performed well since the [indiscernible] significant headwinds and as we move into 2016, our focus remains the same, to complete our mission to position AEP as the next premium regulated utility. This will provide AEP the firm foundation to reinvent itself by focusing on the customer experience, resources and technologies of the future and disciplined capital allocation to become the model utility of the future. So the next generation is about to begin. 
So Brian, make it so, number 1."
135470,321463476,922543,"American Electric Power Co., Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","American Electric Power Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and good morning everyone. I will be taking us through the financial results for both the quarter and the year with most of the focus on the annual results. let's begin on Slide 6 where the fourth quarter comparison where operating earn",2391,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning everyone. I will be taking us through the financial results for both the quarter and the year with most of the focus on the annual results. 
let's begin on Slide 6 where the fourth quarter comparison where operating earnings for both years were $0.48 per share. Despite extremely mild temperatures which adversely affected the quarter by $0.11 per share as well as lower earnings from our competitive businesses. Total company earnings were unchanged from last year. These unfavorable drivers were effectively offset by favorable rate proceedings, the absence of unfavorable regulatory provisions from 2014 and the decline in the effective tax rate, each of which added $0.09 to the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 7. You'll see that the fourth quarter's earnings when added to the results through September, pushed our annual operating earnings to $3.69 per share compared to $3.43 per share in 2014, an increase of 7.6%. The increase in earnings for our largest segment, Vertically Integrated Utilities, was the primary factor contributing to the overall increase in earnings. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effects of rate changes, regulatory provisions and lower O&M and income tax expenses, partially offset by reduced margins from retail and wholesale energy sales. 
Rate changes were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.31 per share to the year. This favorable effect on earnings is related to incremental investment to serve our customers as well as the successful transfer of the Mitchell plant to Wheeling Power. The effective regulatory provisions boosted earnings by $0.12 per share due to the Virginia legislative change and the unfavorable Kentucky fuel order in 2014. 
Lower O&M expense for this segment favorably affected comparison by $0.06 per share, primarily driven by lower employee-related cost. Similar to the quarterly comparison, the annual effective tax rate for this segment was lower than 2015 due to the impact of annual tax rate adjustments and the effect of accounting for tax items on a flow-through basis. 
Partially offsetting these favorable items were declines in normalized margins in off-system sales, net of PJM charges. The lower normalized margins which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share were driven by lower usage across most of our operating regions. I will talk more about loading the economy in a few minutes. 
The $0.17 per share decline in off-system sales reflects the significant margins realized during the polar vortex events in early 2014 and the soft power prices in 2015. The Transmission and Distribution Utility segment earned $0.72 per share for the year, matching the results for 2014. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effective of rate changes and regulatory provisions, offset by lower off-system sales margins and higher O&M expenses. 
Rate changes added $0.04 per share to earnings, primarily related to the recovery of distribution investment in Ohio. Unfavorable Ohio regulatory provisions in 2014 that did not repeat, created a favorable variance, adding $0.04 per share. The decline of $0.04 per share in earnings-related off-system sales margins was related to the Ohio Commission's order on [indiscernible]. O&M expense was higher than last year, which lowered the results for the segment by $0.05 per share. This was due in part to intentional incremental spending with the remaining change related to regulatory commitments in Ohio. 
The Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.39 per share for the year, an improvement of $0.08 or 26%, reflecting our continued significant investment in this area. In the past 12 months, this segment's net plant less deferred taxes grew by buy approximately $1 billion, an increase of 49%. 
The Generation and Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.75 per share, down $0.09. However, this segment exceeded expectations in several areas. The lower capacity revenues in Ohio, beginning in June, contributed to Generation Resource's decline in earnings of $0.11 per share. This was partially offset by the favorable effect of lower fuel costs and favorable hedging activity, helping to add energy margins in the period of soft power prices. In addition, expenses were lower due to unit retirements and the sale of properties which allowed for the reversal of certain ARO reliabilities. 
Our trading and marketing organizations also performed well, exceeding last year's results by $0.03. Our retail business exceeded 2014 results by $0.04. 
AEP River Operations, which was sold in mid-November, contributed $0.06 per share to this year's results, $0.04 lower than 2014. We have been deploying the proceeds from this transaction is our regulated businesses. Corporate and other produced a loss of $0.06 per share, down $0.07 for the year. The decline was driven by higher O&M expenses, franchise taxes and other costs. 
Our performance throughout the year resulted in our raising guidance twice with the final results solidly in the latest range. Despite the headwinds associated with lower capacity revenue in Ohio, 2015 was a successful year for AEP, both financially and operationally. 
Now let's take a look at Slide 8 to review normalized load performance for the quarter. Before we go into particulars by class, I like to provide some context around the load as depicted on the slide. If just look at the bars, you will notice that they're volatile from 1 quarter to the next. It's important to remember that these comparisons are not to the prior quarter but to the prior year. So this year's fourth quarter is being compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 which, as you can see, was particularly strong across all classes. 
With that context, let's now plow to the detail in fourth quarter of 2015. Starting in the lower right, you see that their load decreased by 3.7% compared to the strong fourth quarter results in 2014. This brings the annual normalized load contraction to 0.8%. The upper left quadrant shows that our residential sales were down 4% for the quarter and 1.8% for the year. While we are starting to see the impact of lower energy prices on a regional economy, most of the decreases resulted to the unusually strong 2014. If you compare our normalized residential sales in 2015 to 2013, volumes were down only by an average of 0.4% per year. In the upper right corner, commercial sales were down 3.9% for the quarter compared to 2014. Both commercial and residential sales were stronger in our Eastern and Western territories, which is consistent with the economic indicators I'll share with you on the next slide. 
For the year, commercial sales were down 0.2%. The strongest growth in commercial sales happened in Ohio Power and in I&M where the majority of our auto related jobs are located. As you know, 2015 was a banner year for domestic auto sales. This was certainly one of the bright spots in our regional economy. 
Finally, the lower left quadrant shows that our industrial sales were down 3.3% for the quarter and 0.2% for the year. We saw the biggest decline in our largest sector, Primary Metals, which was down 21% this quarter. The weak global demand, strong dollar and oversupply of Chinese steel has created a challenging market for our metals customers and our export manufacturing. Fortunately, we continue to see robust growth for our customers in oil and gas related sectors to help offset the decline in manufacturing load. I'll provide more detail on this later in the presentation. 
Now let's review the most recent economic data for AEP Service Territory on Slide 9. Let's start on the left-hand side of the page where we compare the economy of the U.S. to that of AEP Service Territory. For both GDP growth and employment growth, AEP service territory trails the U.S. but both indicators for AEP have been relatively stable for the last several quarters. The interesting detail is on the right side of the slide where we compare the U.S. indicators to AEP East and AEP West, separately. What this shows is U.S. and AEP with GDP unemployment growth are slowing while rates are improving for AEP East. The deceleration in AEP's western service area is associated with energy sector job losses. The acceleration in AEP's Eastern territory is associated with auto, health care and professional service sectors. U.S. auto sales in 2015 were at their highest levels since 2000. We're also seeing exceptional growth in recreational vehicle shipments, which have tripled over the last 5 years. This has been an important boost for places like [indiscernible] Indiana, whose economy is largely independent on transportation manufacture. 
And finally, the relatively low business costs, along with higher educated workforce in places like Columbus, Ohio, have created an attractive business environment resulting in over 11,000 new health care and professional service jobs in 2015. 
Turning to Slide 10. I'll provide an update on the domestic shale gas activity within AEP's footprint. Given the impact of low energy prices are having on our regional economy, one might expect our electricity sales to the oil and gas related sectors to be down. However, as you can see in the upper left chart, we're still seeing over 10% growth in our sales to oil and gas sectors this quarter despite oil prices being down 40% from last year, rig counts being down by nearly 2/3 and the fact that there is significantly fewer oil and gas workers today than we had at the end of 2014. In fact, the bottom left chart shows that our sales to oil and gas sectors are at all-time highs. The upper right chart shows that growth in oil and gas loads was spread across all major shale place with an AEP service territory with the strongest growth coming from the Permian, Woodford and Eagle Ford shales. If we dissect the oil and gas growth into those components as shown in the bottom left chart, we continue to see the strongest growth from the Pipeline Transportation sector which grew by over 33% in 2015. This was mostly due to the expanding infrastructure in West Virginia, Ohio and Texas to support the Marcellus, Utica and Texas shales. 
Our oil and gas extraction volumes were up nearly 7% while petroleum and coal products sales grew by approximately 1% in 2015. We still have a number of oil and gas related expansions expected to come online over the next 18 months that should drive our industrial sales growth through 2016. Obviously, we are monitoring the situation closely, given current oil prices and we'll update you on these segments throughout the year. 
In contrast, to the oil and gas sectors, the red bars in the upper left chart show that sales to the remaining industrial sectors are not growing as they were last year at this point, down 5.3% for the quarter. 
Now let's turn to slide 11 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital improved by 0.2% this quarter and is now in a healthy 53.2%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 5.5x and 20.8%, respectively. Our qualified pension funding helped firm this quarter at 97%. During the quarter, a slight decrease in asset returns was offset by a slight increase in the discount rate. Our pension assets are now weighted at 60% and duration matching fixed income securities with a balance being held in global equity and alternative investments. We adopted this more conservative investment stance in 2014 to better align the investment portfolio with the pension obligation. 
Our OPAB [ph] obligations remain fully funded but decreased from 112% to 109% during the quarter. Although plain investment returns were positive, they were more than offset by the increase in higher health care costs. 
Finally, our net liquidity stands at $3.5 billion and is supported by our 2 revolving credit facilities that extend over for the summers of 2017 and 2018. 
Let's see if we can wrap this up on Slide 12 and then quickly get to your questions. The employees of American Electric Power have a proven track record. Over the last 7 years, they've delivered operating earnings growth within our targeted 4% to 6% range and we have grown the dividend in line with earnings. At the current dividend at the reported annual operating's guidance, we anticipate paying out 61% of total earnings and 68% of regulated earnings in 2016. Our employees have executed continuous improvement initiatives, lean activities and have begun the cultural transformation that has allowed us to keep expenses in a very tight range of $2.8 million to $3.1 billion net of earnings offsets since 2011. We forecast expenses net of offsets this year to be in the $2.8 billion range. 
In addition, our employees have been thoughtful about every dollar of investment in our system. We have allocated more dollars to the wire side of our business and designed our Transco business to allow for the efficient deployment of low-cost capital for the benefit of our customers. 
At this point, let me say a about bonus depreciation. This cash saving vehicle is not new to us. For several years now, AEP has elected bonus depreciation. During this time, the company has consistently grown rate base and earnings. Earlier, you heard Nick announce that we will increase our capital spending by $1 billion in both 2017 and 2018. Our customers will realize improved service at a savings due to the rate reducing impact of the regulatory rollback of accumulated deferred income taxes and AEP will be able to grow earnings. In this way, our community's benefit through increased economic activity, our customers benefit through savings and our debt and equity holders benefit through the maintenance of our cash flow metrics as we grow our net plants and service. The ability to make incremental investment in our own system for the benefit of our customers differentiates AEP. 
Looking ahead to 2016. We are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of between $3.60 to $3.80 per share. We're keeping our CapEx plans for 2016 at $5 billion while increasing our CapEx forecast in 2017 and 2018 to $5 billion per year. And finally, as Nick said, we anticipate getting clarity on the Ohio PPA and the strategic review of our competitive businesses. We experienced the successful 2015 and are poised for success in 2016 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

And so we will go through that process very quickly. And there's -- certainly, there's an opportunity there. But we obviously want to understand what the economics look like, where that kind of transaction, and what it means to our business going forward. And in this is not a [indiscernible] sale. So we're going to be very mindful about what it means to our shareholders in terms of not just any potential dilution that may exist or what should do with the proceeds. It's just as important of what you assets there's there's a multitude of different things to think about in the process. We are in a pretty good care of [indiscernible] capital position right now. And to us through that process, it could be more cash associated with that. So we have to really think about just as much on the use of proceeds and obviously what it does to shareholders as well. So we'll go through that process and really, that's the nature of it. It's relatively simple process for the sale of units."

They can choose any supplier. So -- and that has not changed. So I think we feel good about it."

And that's where -- how we're looking at this as well. I mean, it's a volatile. It may be great, it may be positive but it's still volatile.

Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining AEP's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. 2015 will be remembered as a year of significant transition that culminated a 4-year process of focusing on the fundamentals of our business",2043,"Okay. Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining AEP's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. 
2015 will be remembered as a year of significant transition that culminated a 4-year process of focusing on the fundamentals of our business to drive consistency, execution and discipline while driving toward a strategic vision of what the next premium regulated utility should look like. 
The balance sheet of AEP is strong, and we continue to deliver for our shareholders, quarter after quarter, from a dividend and earnings growth perspective, despite various headwinds that have occurred along the way. This quarter and the year 2015 are no exceptions. 
First, let's talk about the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter '15 GAAP and operating earnings came in at $0.96 per share and $0.48 per share, respectively, compared with fourth quarter '14 GAAP and operating earnings of $0.39 per share and $0.48 per share, respectively. The difference in fourth quarter 2015 GAAP and operating earnings being mainly driven by the sale of AEP River Operations. Fourth quarter was unusual in the sense that winter, particularly in December, never occurred. It was more like an April. 
Even so, operating earnings were consistent with fourth quarter last year, even though we gave back approximately $0.11 per share cold weather-related load margins, finishing the year solidly within our revised guidance range at $3.69 per share, operating. 
The year finished at $4.17 per share on a GAAP basis as well compared with '14 results of $3.34 per share and $3.43 per share GAAP and operating earnings, respectively. 
As can be seen on the graph on the right of Page 3 of the presentation, AEP has consistently performed better than utility index with the 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, and as well outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the last 3- and 5-year periods and lagged the index over the last year given interest rate and other sensitivities in the electric and utilities sector in general. Overall, AEP continues to perform very well as the story of the stock continues to become more clear and resonate in the market. 
Operating earnings growth year-on-year was 7.6% and we achieved our expected regulated ROE of 9.6% for the year, which increased from the 9% experienced in 2014. During 2015, we also increased the dividend by 5.7% on an annualized basis, consistent with our earnings growth and within our stated dividend payout range of 60% to 70%. 
I mentioned AEP is in transition earlier. There were a couple of important milestones that we achieved during the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. Namely, AEP completed the sale of River Operations that we discussed during the third quarter 2015 earnings call and we reached the settlement with several parties regarding the AEP Ohio PPA. 
The AEP sale of River Operations occurred during the fourth quarter and the transaction occurred according to plan. The cash proceeds were redeployed in advance of the sale by raising our capital forecast for transmission and then by raising our overall capital plan to $5 billion for 2016 at the November EEI Financial Conference, focused on additional regulated operating company and transmission activities. So we have successfully converted that portion of volatile earnings to a more consistent, regulated earnings profile. 
Regarding the AEP Ohio PPA case. We made significant progress by completing a settlement among the parties, including the staff of the PUCO, along with the industrials, Sierra Club, retail providers and others that defines the PPA relationship and the unregulated generation to AEP Ohio customers. The agreement answers the question of, how long is long term? 8 years with a cost of -- with a cost-based agreement with a return and an adjustment mechanism that works much like a fuel cost pass-through provision. AEP does guarantee up to $100 million credit to customers at the end of the agreement if, in the unexpected event, the anticipated savings do not materialize. 
This deal is a great deal for AEP, our customers and the state of Ohio to ensure capacity is maintained for the benefit of customers during a transition period where markets do not have a long-term capacity product, and during the movement towards a clean energy future contemplated by the Clean Power Plan.  
AEP also expects to repower, retire, or refuel generation as part of this transition and build up the 900 megawatts of renewable solar and wind generation to achieve a balanced generation portfolio for Ohio's future. This arrangement, when approved by the Ohio Commission, will be a model that can be used nationally to assess the tone for parties with substantially different positions about generation resources and the pace of change to come together, focusing on the clean energy future and the mitigation of transition cost increases that our customers and the public expect. AEP and the utilities in the U.S. are the ones that can bring the parties together to work with the states to find this clean energy future and deploy advanced technologies to improve our customer's experience while ensuring that the benefits are universal to all customers. 
As with any agreement, AEP and the other parties didn't get everything they wanted. But this, overall, is a good deal that provides clarity and will ultimately benefit our customers and should be approved by the PUCO as quickly as possible. We expect the record to be concluded by February 8 and an order from the commission shortly thereafter. Assuming that's the case, the spotlight will move to the remaining unregulated generation, which we expect the ongoing strategic process to rapidly move to completion. This will set the stage for the next phase of AEP development with a firm financial foundation and position the company for the future. 
Moving to expectations for 2016. We reaffirmed our guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share, and we'll continue our focus on disciplined capital allocation, emphasizing investments in our regulated companies and transmission, with CapEx budget of $5 billion for 2016. 
AEP continues to project long-term earnings growth of 4% to 6%. Additionally, as a result of the available bonus depreciation, as a result of the 2015 tax bill from Congress, our -- and our ability to invest as a result of the incremental cash, we are raising our capital budgets for the succeeding years to $5 billion in 2017 and $5 billion in 2018. This will enable us to put money to work on behalf of our customers for needed infrastructure, including transmission needs, basically interest-free while maintaining rate base levels that support earnings growth. 
Brian would be covering the subject of customer load in a few minutes. But I'd like to say, since the economic recovery began post-2008, we have seen quarter after quarter of inconsistent results, indicating the economy, while generally getting better, is still challenged in several sectors. Also, we have moved from one extreme to another from a weather perspective, from the polar vortex in 2014 to the warmest fourth quarter in the last 30 years in 2015. So it's difficult to evaluate sustaining trends at this point. 
We continue to believe load will increase overall doing 2016, albeit at a slower -- slightly slower pace than originally forecasted, but not enough for AEP to adjust guidance. During 2016, we will focus on obtaining approval for the Ohio PPA settlement, continue our strategic review of competitive generation and continue to work with our states on ways to comply with the Clean Power Plan, all with the continued focus of driving efficiencies through lean initiatives, capital allocation, disciplined operation of excellence and continual focus on cultural initiatives that I believe is a prerequisite to remain agile and innovative for the future. 
Now I'll move over to the equalizer graph, which we go over every quarter, and this sort of rolls out for the year. The 2015 earned regulated ROE on the left side of the page and then what we anticipate for the 2016 pro forma regulated ROE on the right side of the page. 
So let's talk about Ohio Power. For the Ohio area, AEP Ohio is in line with expectations and we expect to finish the year in line with the 12% ROE that's forecasted. As far as APCo is concerned, the West Virginia rate case that we got achieved in 2015 addressed the weak returns in West Virginia. So it helped the ROEs in APCo as well. Rates were implemented in June of 2015, so we expect to see that the rate case will also help improve the ROE in 2016 for APCo. 
Kentucky, it's good to see it coming up. We're seeing the expected improvement at year-end. The commission authorized the $45 million rate increase in July with a 10.25% ROE to be used in weighted average cost of capital for riders in AFUDC. So we continue to see an increase from that perspective, which last quarter, as you recall, it was woefully short. 
I&M achieved an ROE of 10.2%. This is a result of positive regulatory outcomes associated with long-term capital investment programs and generation, Rockport, SCR, solar, nuclear with a cook life cycle management and transmission projects as well. So I&M is well positioned for another positive year in 2016. 
PSO's ROE is generally in line with the expectations. The economy in Oklahoma has experienced a slowdown due in part to low oil prices and reduced oil and gas activity in the state. In December, though, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented interim rates of $75 million at the first of the year. So a final commission order is expected in the second -- during the second quarter of this year. 
SWEPCO continues to be somewhat of a challenge. The operations are strong, but it's challenged in the oil and gas area, natural gas price area, and as well, the continued issue with Arkansas portion of the Turk Plant which we continue to analyze alternatives for that. Hopefully, a retail rate case in Arkansas, at some point, would be helpful from that perspective. 
AEP Texas. The ongoing distribution capital investment in TCC to serve higher levels of electric load and to maintain the reliability of the grid has gradually lowered the regulated ROE over time. AEP Texas continues to monitor the earnings levels and the jurisdictions. They basically have 3 avenues available to them. One is the transmission -- T-cost, transmission capital cases, that they've been involved with currently and then also whether it's a traditional rate case filing or under the legislated approach of the distributed -- distribution cost recovery factor. That's another opportunity for them as well. So they can look at earnings and we'll focus on those alternatives. 
As far as the AEP Transco -- Transmission Holdco, transmission was at 11.1%. It should drop to 10.2% during the year. But obviously, we're spending a huge amount of capital in the transmission area so you do have some lag there. 
So with that said, or overall, the regulated ROEs are moving from 9.6% to an expected 10.1% for the year. So overall, we should have a good year from a regulatory standpoint. 
Now that we are in 2016, and before I turn it over to Brian, I'll end by saying, I was recently struck by an article I was reading on the 2016 commemoration of 50 years of Star Trek. While it all started with the original series in 1966 with a 5-year mission, it has, over the last 50 years, consistently reinvented itself to remain relevant. AEP, after 110 years, is doing the same thing. This team started out in 2012 after a rough period in Ohio on a 5-year mission of our own that's set a course toward a firm foundation around execution and discipline to advance operationally, financially and culturally. AEP has performed well since then despite some significant headwinds, and as we move into 2016, our focus remains the same: to complete our mission to position AEP as the next premium regulated utility. This will provide AEP the firm foundation to reinvent itself by focusing on the customer experience, resources and technologies of the future and disciplined capital allocation to become the model utility of the future. So the next generation is about to begin.

I will be taking us through the financial results for both the quarter and the year, with most of our focus on the annual results. let's begin on Slide 6 with the fourth quarter comparison, where operating ear",2392,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning everyone. I will be taking us through the financial results for both the quarter and the year, with most of our focus on the annual results. 
let's begin on Slide 6 with the fourth quarter comparison, where operating earnings for both years were $0.48 per share. Despite extremely mild temperatures, which adversely affected the quarter by $0.11 per share, as well as lower earnings from our competitive businesses, total company earnings were unchanged from last year. These unfavorable drivers were effectively offset by favorable rate proceedings, the absence of unfavorable regulatory provisions from 2014 and the decline in the effective tax rate, each of which added $0.09 to the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 7. You'll see that the fourth quarter's earnings when added to the results through September, pushed our annual operating earnings to $3.69 per share compared to $3.43 per share in 2014, an increase of 7.6%. The increase in earnings for our largest segment, Vertically Integrated Utilities, was the primary factor contributing to the overall increase in earnings. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effects of rate changes, regulatory provisions and lower O&M and income tax expenses, partially offset by reduced margins from retail and wholesale energy sales. 
Rate changes were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.31 per share to the year. This favorable effect on earnings is related to incremental investment to serve our customers as well as the successful transfer of the Mitchell plant to Wheeling Power. The effect of regulatory provisions bolstered earnings by $0.12 per share due to a Virginia legislative change and the unfavorable Kentucky fuel order in 2014. 
Lower O&M expense for this segment favorably affected comparison by $0.06 per share, primarily driven by lower employee-related costs. Similar to the quarterly comparison, the annual effective tax rate for this segment was lower than 2015 due to the impact of annual tax rate adjustments and the effect of accounting for tax items on a flow-through basis. 
Partially offsetting these favorable items were declines in normalized margins in off-system sales, net of PJM charges. The lower normalized margins which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share were driven by lower usage across most of our operating regions. I will talk more about loading the economy in a few minutes. 
The $0.17 per share decline in off-system sales reflects the significant margins realized during the polar vortex events in early 2014 and the soft power prices in 2015. 
The Transmission and Distribution Utility segment earned $0.72 per share for the year, matching the results for 2014. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effect of rate changes and regulatory provisions, offset by lower off-system sales margins and higher O&M expenses. 
Rate changes added $0.04 per share to earnings, primarily related to the recovery of distribution investment in Ohio. Unfavorable Ohio regulatory provisions in 2014 that did not repeat created a favorable variance, adding $0.04 per share. The decline of $0.04 per share in earnings-related off-system sales margins was related to the Ohio Commission's order on OVEC. O&M expense was higher than last year, which lowered the results for the segment by $0.05 per share. This was due in part to intentional incremental spending with the remaining change related to regulatory commitments in Ohio. 
The Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.39 per share for the year, an improvement of $0.08 or 26%, reflecting our continued significant investment in this area. In the past 12 months, this segment's net plant less deferred taxes grew by approximately $1 billion, an increase of 49%. 
The Generation & Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.75 per share, down $0.09. However, this segment exceeded expectations in several areas. The lower capacity revenues in Ohio, beginning in June, contributed to Generation Resource's decline in earnings of $0.11 per share. This was partially offset by the favorable effect of lower fuel costs and favorable hedging activity, helping to add energy margins in the period of soft power prices. In addition, expenses were lower due to unit retirements and the sale of properties which allowed for the reversal of certain ARO reliabilities. 
Our trading and marketing organizations also performed well, exceeding last year's results by $0.03. Our retail business exceeded 2014 results by $0.04. 
AEP River Operations, which was sold in mid-November, contributed $0.06 per share to this year's results, $0.04 lower than 2014. We have been deploying the proceeds from this transaction into our regulated businesses. 
Corporate and other produced a loss of $0.06 per share, down $0.07 for the year. The decline was driven by higher O&M expenses, franchise taxes and other costs. 
Our performance throughout the year resulted in our raising guidance twice with the final results solidly in the latest range. Despite the headwinds associated with lower capacity revenue in Ohio, 2015 was a successful year for AEP, both financially and operationally. 
Now let's take a look at Slide 8 to review normalized load performance for the quarter. Before we go into the particulars by class, I'd like to provide some context around the load as depicted on the slide. If just look at the bars, you will notice that they're volatile from 1 quarter to the next. It's important to remember that these comparisons are not to the prior quarter but to the prior year. So this year's fourth quarter is being compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 which, as you can see, was particularly strong across all classes. 
With that context, let's now plow into the detail for the fourth quarter of 2015. Starting in the lower right, you see that our load decreased by 3.7% compared to the strong fourth quarter results in 2014. This brings the annual normalized load contraction to 0.8%. The upper left quadrant shows that our residential sales were down 4% for the quarter and 1.8% for the year. While we are starting to see the impact of lower energy prices on a regional economy, most of the decreases resulted to the unusually strong 2014. If you compare our normalized residential sales in 2015 to 2013, volumes were down only by an average of 0.4% per year. In the upper right corner, commercial sales were down 3.9% for the quarter compared to 2014. Both commercial and residential sales were stronger in our Eastern and Western territories, which is consistent with the economic indicators I'll share with you on the next slide. 
For the year, commercial sales were down 0.2%. The strongest growth in commercial sales happened in Ohio Power and in I&M where the majority of our auto related jobs are located. As you know, 2015 was a banner year for domestic auto sales. This was certainly one of the bright spots in our regional economy. 
Finally, the lower left quadrant shows that our industrial sales were down 3.3% for the quarter and 0.2% for the year. We saw the biggest decline in our largest sector, Primary Metals, which was down 21% this quarter. The weak global demand, strong dollar and oversupply of Chinese steel has created a challenging market for our metals customers and our export manufacturing. Fortunately, we continue to see robust growth from our customers in oil and gas-related sectors to help offset the decline in manufacturing load. I'll provide more detail on this later in the presentation. 
Now let's review the most recent economic data for AEP Service Territory on Slide 9. Let's start on the left-hand side of the page where we compare the economy of the U.S. to that of AEP service territory. For both GDP growth and employment growth, AEP service territory trails the U.S. but both indicators for AEP have been relatively stable for the last several quarters. The interesting detail is on the right side of the slide where we compare the U.S. indicators to AEP East and AEP West, separately. What this shows is U.S. and AEP West GDP unemployment growth are slowing, while rates are improving for AEP East. The deceleration in AEP's western service area is associated with energy sector job losses. The acceleration in AEP's Eastern territory is associated with auto, health care and professional service sectors. U.S. auto sales in 2015 were at their highest levels since 2000. We're also seeing exceptional growth in recreational vehicle shipments, which have tripled over the last 5 years. This has been an important boost for places like Elkhart, Indiana, whose economy is largely independent on transportation manufacture. 
And finally, the relatively low business costs, along with higher educated workforce in places like Columbus, Ohio, have created an attractive business environment resulting in over 11,000 new health care and professional service jobs in 2015. 
Turning to Slide 10. I will provide an update on the domestic shale gas activity within AEP's footprint. Given the impact of low energy prices are having on our regional economy, one might expect our electricity sales to the oil and gas related sectors to be down. However, as you can see in the upper-left chart, we are still seeing over 10% growth in our sales to oil and gas sectors this quarter despite oil prices being down 40% from last year, rig counts being down by nearly 2/3 and the fact that there is significantly fewer oil and gas workers today than we had at the end of 2014. In fact, the bottom left chart shows that our sales to oil and gas sectors are at all-time highs. 
The upper-right chart shows that growth in oil and gas loads was spread across all major shale plays within an AEP service territory with the strongest growth coming from the Permian, Woodford and Eagle Ford shales. If we dissect the oil and gas growth into its components as shown in the bottom-left chart, we continue to see the strongest growth from the Pipeline Transportation sector, which grew by over 33% in 2015. This was mostly due to the expanding infrastructure in West Virginia, Ohio and Texas to support the Marcellus, Utica and Texas shales. 
Our oil and gas extraction volumes were up nearly 7%, while petroleum and coal products sales grew by approximately 1% in 2015. We still have a number of oil and gas related expansions expected to come online over the next 18 months that should drive our industrial sales growth through 2016. Obviously, we are monitoring the situation closely, given current oil prices, and we'll update you on these segments throughout the year. In contrast, to the oil and gas sectors, the red bars in the upper-left chart show that sales to the remaining industrial sectors are not growing as they were last year at this point, down 5.3% for the quarter. 
Now let's turn to slide 11 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital improved by 0.2% this quarter and is now in a healthy 53.2%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 5.5x and 20.8%, respectively. Our qualified pension funding helped firm this quarter at 97%. 
During the quarter, a slight decrease in asset returns was offset by a slight increase in the discount rate. Our pension assets are now weighted at 60% and duration-matching fixed income securities, with the balance being held in global equity and alternative investments. We adopted this more conservative investment stance in 2014 to better align the investment portfolio with the pension obligation. 
Our OPEB obligations remain fully funded but decreased from 112% to 109% during the quarter. Although plain investment returns were positive, they were more than offset by an increase in higher health care costs. 
Finally, our net liquidity stands at $3.5 billion and is supported by our 2 revolving credit facilities that extended into the summers of 2017 and 2018. 
Let's see if we can wrap this up on Slide 12 and then quickly get to your questions. The employees of American Electric Power have a proven track record. Over the last 7 years, they have delivered operating earnings growth within our targeted 4% to 6% range, and we have grown the dividend in line with earnings. With the current dividend at the midpoint of annual operating earnings guidance, we anticipate paying out 61% of total earnings and 68% of regulated earnings in 2016. Our employees have executed continuous improvement initiatives, lean activities and have begun the cultural transformation that has allowed us to keep expenses in a very tight range of $2.8 million to $3.1 billion net of the earnings offsets since 2011. We forecast expenses net of offsets this year to be in the $2.8 billion range. 
In addition, our employees have been thoughtful about every dollar of investment in our system. We have allocated more dollars to the wire side of our business and designed our Transco business to allow for the efficient deployment of low-cost capital for the benefit of our customers. 
At this point, let me say a word about bonus depreciation. This cash-saving vehicle is not new to us. For several years now, AEP has elected bonus depreciation. During this time, the company has consistently grown rate base and earnings. Earlier, you heard Nick announced that we will increase our capital spending by $1 billion in both 2017 and 2018. Our customers will realize improved service at a savings due to the rate-reducing impacts of the regulatory flowback of accumulated deferred income taxes, and AEP will be able to grow earnings. In this way, our communities benefit through increased economic activity. Our customers benefit through rate savings, and our debt and equity holders benefit through the maintenance of our cash flow metrics as we grow our net plant and service. The ability to make incremental investment in our own system for the benefit of our customers differentiates AEP. 
Looking ahead to 2016. We are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of between $3.60 to $3.80 per share. We are keeping our CapEx plans for 2016 at $5 billion while increasing our CapEx forecast in 2017 and 2018 to $5 billion per year. And finally, as Nick said, we anticipate getting clarity on the Ohio PPA and the strategic review of our competitive businesses. We experienced the successful 2015 and are poised for success in 2016 and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

Then you have the other 6,000 out there, an anomaly that would be associated with the remaining unregulated. So if there's a case out there, yes, I think anyone that would look at it, if it's only unregulated part of the generation, they're -- there will be people who are buying unregulated assets and fully understand the risks associated with that. As far as the PPA is concerned, we'll continue to progress associated with the PPA. Those cases will work themselves through. We feel like we're in very good shape. From a legal perspective, there's a lot of dust being kicked up. But that's what happens when you try to do progressive things, particularly things that have the state-supported sale as opposed to waiting on a federal outcome for a long-term capacity market, for example. So I think any prospective buyer in a transaction on unregulated generation, they'd fully understand what the issues are and the risks involved."

And then also, on your ability to finance that capital, kind of how do you think about the moving parts there, especially in '17 and '18, given the fact that you're not assuming any kind of asset sale proceeds, any PPA incremental cash? And I think my understanding of your tax situation was that even though bonus depreciation is certainly adding to your potential in outer years, you probably wouldn't have been a cash taxpayer in '17 and '18 anyway. So how does the bonus depreciation going to help your cash in those years to finance some of its incremental capital?"

But there's also a piece in there associated with, as you mentioned, renewable projects but it's not related to the PPA. It's really not to the Ohio PPA. It's related to other arrangements. There are other PPA arrangements that we have for long-term PPAs with solar projects, universities and that kind of thing. So it very much supports what we're trying to achieve from a customer side of things. We go out and we participate in arrangements with long-term PPAs with creditworthy counterparties to ensure that we can put those kinds of facilities in place. And you see the category there, I think that's competitive parts. Well, that competitive part is really around our on-site partners, opportunities associated with projects that they're doing with their support of our long-term PPAs."

Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining AEP's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. 2015 will be remembered as a year of significant transition that culminated a 4-year process of focusing on the fundamentals of our business",2046,"Okay. Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining AEP's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. 
2015 will be remembered as a year of significant transition that culminated a 4-year process of focusing on the fundamentals of our business to drive consistency, execution and discipline while driving toward a strategic vision of what the next premium regulated utility should look like. 
The balance sheet of AEP is strong, and we continue to deliver for our shareholders, quarter after quarter, from a dividend and earnings growth perspective, despite various headwinds that have occurred along the way. This quarter and the year 2015 are no exceptions. 
First, let's talk about the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter '15 GAAP and operating earnings came in at $0.96 per share and $0.48 per share, respectively, compared with fourth quarter '14 GAAP and operating earnings of $0.39 per share and $0.48 per share, respectively. The difference in fourth quarter 2015 GAAP and operating earnings being mainly driven by the sale of AEP River Operations. Fourth quarter was unusual in the sense that winter, particularly in December, never occurred. It was more like an April. 
Even so, operating earnings were consistent with fourth quarter last year, even though we gave back approximately $0.11 per share cold weather-related load margins, finishing the year solidly within our revised guidance range at $3.69 per share, operating. 
The year finished at $4.17 per share on a GAAP basis as well -- compared with '14 results of $3.34 per share and $3.43 per share GAAP and operating earnings, respectively. 
As can be seen on the graph on the right of Page 3 of the presentation, AEP has consistently performed better than utility index with the 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, and as well outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the last 3- and 5-year periods and lagged the index over the last year given interest rate and other sensitivities in the electric and utilities sector in general. Overall, AEP continues to perform very well as the story of the stock continues to become more clear and resonate in the market. 
Operating earnings growth year-on-year was 7.6%, and we achieved our expected regulated ROE of 9.6% for the year, which increased from the 9% experienced in 2014. During 2015, we also increased the dividend by 5.7% on an annualized basis, consistent with our earnings growth and within our stated dividend payout range of 60% to 70%. 
I mentioned AEP is in transition earlier. There were a couple of important milestones that we achieved during the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. Namely, AEP completed the sale of River Operations that we discussed during the third quarter 2015 earnings call, and we reached the settlement with several parties regarding the AEP Ohio PPA case.
The AEP sale of River Operations occurred during the fourth quarter, and the transaction occurred according to plan. The cash proceeds were redeployed in advance of the sale by raising our capital forecast for transmission and then by raising our overall capital plan to $5 billion for 2016 at the November EEI Financial Conference, focused on additional regulated operating company and transmission activities. So we have successfully converted that portion of volatile earnings to a more consistent, regulated earnings profile. 
Regarding the AEP Ohio PPA case. We made significant progress by completing a settlement among the parties, including the staff of the PUCO, along with the industrials, Sierra Club, retail providers and others that defines the PPA relationship from the unregulated generation to AEP Ohio customers. The agreement answers the question of, how long is long term? 8 years with a cost of -- with a cost-based agreement with a return and an adjustment mechanism that works much like a fuel cost pass-through provision. AEP does guarantee up to $100 million credit to customers at the end of the agreement if, in the unexpected event, the anticipated savings do not materialize. 
This deal is a great deal for AEP, our customers and the state of Ohio to ensure capacity is maintained for the benefit of customers during a transition period where markets do not have a long-term capacity product, and during the movement towards a clean energy future contemplated by the Clean Power Plan.  
AEP also expects to repower, retire, or refuel generation as part of this transition and build up the 900 megawatts of renewable solar and wind generation to achieve a balanced generation portfolio for Ohio's future. This arrangement, when approved by the Ohio Commission, will be a model that can be used nationally that sets the tone for parties with substantially different positions about generation resources and the pace of change to come together, focusing on the clean energy future and the mitigation of transition cost increases that our customers and the public expect. AEP and the utilities in the U.S. are the ones that can bring the parties together to work with the states to define this clean energy future and deploy advanced technologies to improve our customer's experience while ensuring that the benefits are universal to all customers. 
As with any agreement, AEP and the other parties didn't get everything they wanted. But this, overall, is a good deal that provides clarity and will ultimately benefit our customers and should be approved by the PUCO as quickly as possible. We expect the record to be concluded by February 8 and an order from the commission shortly thereafter. Assuming that's the case, the spotlight will move to the remaining unregulated generation, which we expect the ongoing strategic process to rapidly move to completion. This will set the stage for the next phase of AEP development with a firm financial foundation and position the company for the future. 
Moving to expectations for 2016. We reaffirm our guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share, and we'll continue our focus on disciplined capital allocation, emphasizing investments in our regulated companies and transmission, with CapEx budget of $5 billion for 2016. 
AEP continues to project long-term earnings growth of 4% to 6%. Additionally, as a result of the available bonus depreciation, as a result of the 2015 tax bill from Congress, our -- and our ability to invest as a result of the incremental cash, we are raising our capital budgets for the succeeding years to $5 billion in 2017 and $5 billion in 2018. This will enable us to put money to work on behalf of our customers for needed infrastructure, including transmission needs, basically interest-free while maintaining rate base levels that support earnings growth. 
Brian will be covering the subject of customer load in a few minutes. But I'd like to say, since the economic recovery began post-2008, we have seen quarter after quarter of inconsistent results, indicating the economy, while generally getting better, is still challenged in several sectors. Also, we have moved from one extreme to another from a weather perspective, from the polar vortex in 2014 to the warmest fourth quarter in the last 30 years in 2015. So it's difficult to evaluate sustaining trends at this point. 
We continue to believe load will increase overall doing 2016, albeit at a slower -- a slightly slower pace than originally forecasted, but not enough for AEP to adjust guidance. During 2016, we will focus on obtaining approval for the Ohio PPA settlement, continue our strategic review of competitive generation and continue to work with our states on ways to comply with the Clean Power Plan, all with the continued focus of driving efficiencies through lean initiatives, capital allocation, disciplined operational excellence and continual focus on cultural initiatives that I believe is a prerequisite to remain agile and innovative for the future. 
Now I'll move over to the equalizer graph, which we go over every quarter. And this sort of rolls out for the year. The 2015 earned regulated ROE on the left side of the page and then what we anticipate for the 2016 pro forma regulated ROE on the right side of the page. 
So let's talk about Ohio Power. For the Ohio area, AEP Ohio is in line with expectations and we expect to finish the year in line with the 12% ROE that's forecasted. As far as APCo is concerned, the West Virginia rate case that we got -- achieved in 2015 addressed the weak returns in West Virginia. So it helped the ROEs in APCo as well. Rates were implemented in June of 2015, so we expect to see that the rate case will also help improve the ROE in 2016 for APCo. 
Kentucky, it's good to see it coming up. We're seeing the expected improvement at year-end. The commission authorized the $45 million rate increase in July with a 10.25% ROE to be used in weighted average cost of capital for riders in AFUDC. So we continue to see an increase from that perspective, which last quarter, as you recall, it was woefully short. 
I&M achieved an ROE of 10.2%. This is a result of positive regulatory outcomes associated with long-term capital investment programs and generation, Rockport, SCR, solar, nuclear with a Cook life cycle management and transmission projects as well. So I&M is well positioned for another positive year in 2016. 
PSO's ROE is generally in line with expectations. The economy in Oklahoma has experienced a slowdown due in part to low oil prices and reduced oil and gas activity in the state. In December, though, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission heard the rate case, and PSO implemented interim rates of $75 million at the first of the year. So a final commission order is expected in the second -- during the second quarter of this year. 
SWEPCO continues to be somewhat of a challenge. The operations are strong, but it's challenged in the oil and gas area, natural gas price area, and as well, the continued issue with Arkansas portion of the Turk Plant, which we continue to analyze alternatives for that. Hopefully, a retail rate case in Arkansas, at some point, would be helpful from that perspective. 
AEP Texas. The ongoing distribution capital investment in TCC to serve higher levels of electric load and to maintain the reliability of the grid has gradually lowered the regulated ROE over time. AEP Texas continues to monitor the earnings levels in the jurisdiction, and they basically have 3 avenues available to them. One is the transmission -- T-cost, transmission capital cases, that they've been involved with currently. And then also whether it's a traditional rate case filing or under the legislated approach of the distributed -- distribution cost recovery factor, that's another opportunity for them as well. So they're taking a look at earnings and will focus on those alternatives. 
As far as the AEP Transco -- Transmission Holdco, transmission was at 11.1%. It should drop to 10.2% during the year. But obviously, we're spending a huge amount of capital in the transmission area, so you do have some lag there. 
So with that said, overall, the regulated ROEs are moving from 9.6% to an expected 10.1% for the year. So overall, we should have a good year from a regulatory standpoint. 
Now that we are in 2016, and before I turn it over to Brian, I'll end by saying, I was recently struck by an article I was reading on the 2016 commemoration of 50 years of Star Trek. While it all started with the original series in 1966 with a 5-year mission, it has, over the last 50 years, consistently reinvented itself to remain relevant. AEP, after 110 years, is doing the same thing. This team started out in 2012 after a rough period in Ohio on a 5-year mission of our own that set a course toward a firm foundation around execution and discipline to advance operationally, financially and culturally. AEP has performed well since then, despite some significant headwinds. And as we move into 2016, our focus remains the same: to complete our mission to position AEP as the next premium regulated utility. This will provide AEP the firm foundation to reinvent itself by focusing on the customer experience, resources and technologies of the future and disciplined capital allocation to become the model utility of the future. So the next generation is about to begin. 
So Brian, make it so, number one."

I will be taking us through the financial results for both the quarter and the year, with most of our focus on the annual results. Let's begin on Slide 6 with the fourth quarter comparison, where operating ear",2393,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning everyone. I will be taking us through the financial results for both the quarter and the year, with most of our focus on the annual results. 
Let's begin on Slide 6 with the fourth quarter comparison, where operating earnings for both years were $0.48 per share. Despite extremely mild temperatures, which adversely affected the quarter by $0.11 per share, as well as lower earnings from our competitive businesses, total company earnings were unchanged from last year. These unfavorable drivers were effectively offset by favorable rate proceedings, the absence of unfavorable regulatory provisions from 2014 and the decline in the effective tax rate, each of which added $0.09 to the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 7. You'll see that the fourth quarter's earnings when added to the results through September, pushed our annual operating earnings to $3.69 per share compared to $3.43 per share in 2014, an increase of 7.6%. The increase in earnings for our largest segment, Vertically Integrated Utilities, was the primary factor contributing to the overall increase in earnings. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effects of rate changes, regulatory provisions and lower O&M and income tax expenses, partially offset by reduced margins from retail and wholesale energy sales. 
Rate changes were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.31 per share to the year. This favorable effect on earnings is related to incremental investment to serve our customers as well as the successful transfer of the Mitchell plant to Wheeling Power. The effect of regulatory provisions bolstered earnings by $0.12 per share due to a Virginia legislative change and the unfavorable Kentucky fuel order in 2014. 
Lower O&M expense for this segment favorably affected comparison by $0.06 per share, primarily driven by lower employee-related costs. Similar to the quarterly comparison, the annual effective tax rate for this segment was lower in 2015 due to the impact of annual tax rate adjustments and the effect of accounting for tax items on a flow-through basis. 
Partially offsetting these favorable items were declines in normalized margins in off-system sales, net of PJM charges. The lower normalized margins, which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share, were driven by lower usage across most of our operating regions. I will talk more about load in the economy in a few minutes. 
The $0.17 per share decline in off-system sales reflects the significant margins realized during the polar vortex events in early 2014 and the soft power prices in 2015. 
The Transmission and Distribution Utility segment earned $0.72 per share for the year, matching the results for 2014. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effect of rate changes and regulatory provisions, offset by lower off-system sales margins and higher O&M expenses. 
Rate changes added $0.04 per share to earnings, primarily related to the recovery of distribution investment in Ohio. Unfavorable Ohio regulatory provisions in 2014 that did not repeat created a favorable variance, adding $0.04 per share. The decline of $0.04 per share in earnings-related off-system sales margins was related to the Ohio Commission's order on OVEC. O&M expense was higher than last year, which lowered the results for this segment by $0.05 per share. This was due in part to intentional incremental spending with the remaining change related to regulatory commitments in Ohio. 
The Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.39 per share for the year, an improvement of $0.08 or 26%, reflecting our continued significant investment in this area. In the past 12 months, this segment's net plant less deferred taxes grew by approximately $1 billion, an increase of 49%. 
The Generation & Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.75 per share, down $0.09. However, this segment exceeded expectations in several areas. The lower capacity revenues in Ohio, beginning in June, contributed to Generation Resource's decline in earnings of $0.11 per share. This was partially offset by the favorable effect of lower fuel costs and favorable hedging activity, helping to add energy margins in the period of soft power prices. In addition, expenses were lower due to unit retirements and the sale of properties, which allowed for the reversal of certain ARO reliabilities. 
Our trading and marketing organization also performed well, exceeding last year's results by $0.03. Our retail business exceeded 2014 results by $0.04. 
AEP River Operations, which was sold in mid-November, contributed $0.06 per share to this year's results, $0.04 lower than 2014. We have been deploying the proceeds from this transaction into our regulated businesses. 
Corporate and other produced a loss of $0.06 per share, down $0.07 for the year. The decline was driven by higher O&M expenses, franchise taxes and other costs. 
Our performance throughout the year resulted in our raising guidance twice with the final results solidly in the latest range. Despite the headwinds associated with lower capacity revenue in Ohio, 2015 was a successful year for AEP, both financially and operationally. 
Now let's take a look at Slide 8 to review normalized load performance for the quarter. Before we go into the particulars by class, I'd like to provide some context around the load as depicted on the slide. If just look at the bars, you will notice that they're volatile from 1 quarter to the next. It's important to remember that these comparisons are not to the prior quarter but to the prior year. So this year's fourth quarter is being compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 which, as you can see, was particularly strong across all classes. 
With that context, let's now plow into the detail for the fourth quarter of 2015. Starting in the lower right, you see that our load decreased by 3.7% compared to the strong fourth quarter results in 2014. This brings the annual normalized load contraction to 0.8%. The upper left quadrant shows that our residential sales were down 4% for the quarter and 1.8% for the year. While we are starting to see the impact of lower energy prices on a regional economy, most of the decreases were a result of the unusually strong 2014. If you compare our normalized residential sales in 2015 to 2013, volumes were down only by an average of 0.4% per year. In the upper right corner, commercial sales were down 3.9% for the quarter compared to 2014. Both commercial and residential sales were stronger in our Eastern than Western territories, which is consistent with the economic indicators I'll share with you on the next slide. 
For the year, commercial sales were down 0.2%. The strongest growth in commercial sales happened in Ohio Power and in I&M, where the majority of our auto related jobs are located. As you know, 2015 was a banner year for domestic auto sales. This was certainly one of the bright spots in our regional economy. 
Finally, the lower left quadrant shows that our industrial sales were down 3.3% for the quarter and 0.2% for the year. We saw the biggest decline in our largest sector, Primary Metals, which was down 21% this quarter. The weak global demand, strong dollar and oversupply of Chinese steel has created a challenging market for our metals customers and our export manufacturers. Fortunately, we continue to see robust growth from our customers in oil and gas-related sectors to help offset the decline in manufacturing load. I'll provide more detail on this later in the presentation. 
Now let's review the most recent economic data for AEP Service Territory on Slide 9. Let's start on the left-hand side of the page, where we compare the economy of the U.S. to that of AEP service territory. For both GDP growth and employment growth, AEP service territory trails the U.S., but both indicators for AEP have been relatively stable for the last several quarters. The interesting detail is on the right side of the slide where we compare the U.S. indicators to AEP East and AEP West, separately. What this shows is U.S. and AEP West GDP unemployment growth are slowing, while rates are improving for AEP East. The deceleration in AEP's western service area is associated with energy sector job losses. The acceleration in AEP's Eastern territory is associated with auto, health care and professional service sectors. U.S. auto sales in 2015 were at their highest levels since 2000. We're also seeing exceptional growth in recreational vehicle shipments, which have tripled over the last 5 years. This has been an important boost for places like Elkhart, Indiana, whose economy is largely independent on transportation manufacture. 
And finally, the relatively low business costs, along with higher educated workforce in places like Columbus, Ohio, have created an attractive business environment, resulting in over 11,000 new health care and professional service jobs in 2015. 
Turning to Slide 10. I will provide an update on the domestic shale gas activity within AEP's footprint. Given the impact of low energy prices are having on our regional economy, one might expect our electricity sales to the oil and gas related sectors to be down. However, as you can see in the upper-left chart, we are still seeing over 10% growth in our sales to oil and gas sectors this quarter, despite oil prices being down 40% from last year, rig counts being down by nearly 2/3 and the fact that there are significantly fewer oil and gas workers today than we had at the end of 2014. In fact, the bottom left chart shows that our sales to oil and gas sectors are at all-time highs. 
The upper-right chart shows that growth in oil and gas loads was spread across all major shale plays within AEP service territory, with the strongest growth coming from the Permian, Woodford and Eagle Ford shales. If we dissect the oil and gas growth into its components, as shown in the bottom-left chart, we continue to see the strongest growth from the Pipeline Transportation sector, which grew by over 33% in 2015. This was mostly due to the expanding infrastructure in West Virginia, Ohio and Texas to support the Marcellus, Utica and Texas shales. 
Our oil and gas extraction volumes were up nearly 7%, while petroleum and coal product sales grew by approximately 1% in 2015. We still have a number of oil and gas-related expansions expected to come online over the next 18 months that should drive our industrial sales growth through 2016. Obviously, we are monitoring the situation closely, given current oil prices, and we'll update you on these segments throughout the year. In contrast, to the oil and gas sectors, the red bars in the upper-left chart show that sales to the remaining industrial sectors are not growing as they were last year at this point, down 5.3% for the quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 11 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital improved by 0.2% this quarter and is now at a healthy 53.2%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 5.5x and 20.8%, respectively. Our qualified pension funding held firm this quarter at 97%. 
During the quarter, a slight decrease in asset returns was offset by a slight increase in the discount rate. Our pension assets are now weighted at 60% in duration-matching fixed income securities, with the balance being held in global equity and alternative investments. We adopted this more conservative investment stance in 2014 to better align the investment portfolio with the pension obligation. 
Our OPEB obligations remain fully funded but decreased from 112% to 109% during the quarter. Although plain investment returns were positive, they were more than offset by an increase in higher health care costs. 
Finally, our net liquidity stands at $3.5 billion and is supported by our 2 revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018. 
Let's see if we can wrap this up on Slide 12 and then quickly get to your questions. The employees of American Electric Power have a proven track record. Over the last 7 years, they have delivered operating earnings growth within our targeted 4% to 6% range, and we have grown the dividend in line with earnings. With the current dividend at the midpoint of annual operating earnings guidance, we anticipate paying out 61% of total earnings and 68% of regulated earnings in 2016. Our employees have executed continuous improvement initiatives, lean activities and have begun the cultural transformation that has allowed us to keep expenses in a very tight range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion net of the earnings offsets since 2011. We forecast expenses net of offsets this year to be in the $2.8 billion range. 
In addition, our employees have been thoughtful about every dollar of investment in our system. We have allocated more dollars to the wire side of our business and designed our Transco business to allow for the efficient deployment of low-cost capital for the benefit of our customers. 
At this point, let me say a word about bonus depreciation. This cash-saving vehicle is not new to us. For several years now, AEP has elected bonus depreciation. During this time, the company has consistently grown rate base and earnings. Earlier, you heard Nick announce that we will increase our capital spending by $1 billion in both 2017 and 2018. Our customers will realize improved service at a savings due to the rate-reducing impacts of the regulatory flowback of accumulated deferred income taxes, and AEP will be able to grow earnings. In this way, our communities benefit through increased economic activity. Our customers benefit through rate savings, and our debt and equity holders benefit through the maintenance of our cash flow metrics as we grow our net plant and service. The ability to make incremental investment in our own system for the benefit of our customers differentiates AEP. 
Looking ahead to 2016. We are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of between $3.60 to $3.80 per share. We are keeping our CapEx plans for 2016 at $5 billion while increasing our CapEx forecast in 2017 and 2018 to $5 billion per year. And finally, as Nick said, we anticipate getting clarity on the Ohio PPA and the strategic review of our competitive businesses. We experienced the successful 2015 and are poised for success in 2016 and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

So if there's a case out there, yes, I think anyone that would look at it, if it's on the unregulated part of the generation, they're -- there will be people who are buying unregulated assets and fully understand the risks associated with that. 
As far as the PPA is concerned, we'll continue the progress associated with the PPA. Those cases will work themselves through. We feel like we're in very good shape.

It's related to other arrangements, other PPA arrangements that we have for long-term PPAs with solar projects, universities and that kind of thing. So it very much supports what we're trying to achieve from a customer side of things. We go out, and we participate in arrangements with long-term PPAs with creditworthy counterparties to ensure that we can put those kinds of facilities in place.

We were already in a strategic process around the unregulated generation, the question is what's in and what's out. So we will get through the PPA approach with Ohio. Hopefully, they'll make a decision here. And it should be, after over 2 years, be in a decent decision to make a decision quickly. And then we know and understand what we're dealing with, with the rest of the fleet. And so that process, we would expect, would move very quickly, and I would expect us to be in a good position to get that done as quickly as possible as well. And that is a focus to make sure we complete that activity in 2016."

So we feel pretty strongly about our position. 
I think as far as FERC is concerned, it's ask and answer. And I think when you look at the case that's been filed, I would presume they proceed [ph] of trying to address it there when they maybe have difficulty addressing Ohio when we have had a case for 2 years where they could have been involved with that.

And certainly, it's one that addresses the Ohio issues and that's what we're about. 
Now I don't know -- they have their own motivations about what they want to achieve. But we're wanting to achieve consistency from a pricing perspective for consumers, protection for consumers for a sliver of their energy needs. But customers still have the ability to choose in Ohio. They can choose any supplier. So -- and that has not changed. So I think we feel good about it."

Financially, 2016 is off to a steady start that delivered earnings consistent with our plan for the year. So all is in good shape there. It was not without challenges, though. We overcame the winter that never happened. And, of course, the anticipated changes from 2015 such as loss of capacity revenues related to the Ohio transition order that ended in May 2015 and the loss of AEP River Operations revenue due to sale that occurred late last year, positive changes, continued benefits of managing expenses and disciplined market hedging activities enabled GAAP and operating earnings to come in at $1.02 per share. This compares with $1.29 and $1.28 per share of GAAP and operating earnings, respectively for 2015. 
The impact of weather was significant for the quarter, Brian will cover this in detail a bit later. But we had the sixth warmest winter in the last 30 years in 2016. And remember, we're comparing against the second coldest winter in 2015. So considering this difference, I would say we had a great quarter from an earnings perspective but it showed the resiliency of our plan for the year and the strength of our foundation for continued growth. 
We are reaffirming our guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share and our 4% to 6% growth rate to further signal our confidence in how the year is likely to shape up for AEP. 
I'm sure many of you have questions concerning last night's FERC order. So let me put some perspective on that. Obviously, we are disappointed with the FERC decision to review our PPA arrangement under the EDGAR rules based upon the presence of non-[indiscernible] charges. But that being said, we embarked on the best mechanism within the existing Ohio legislation that we felt could withstand legal scrutiny that would allow the Ohio commission to have a say regarding the long-term viability of resources and the development of new resources within the state. 
And the positive note regarding Ohio activities during the first quarter is that the PUCO did the right thing. They approved the PPA, and not only sent a message regarding investment and resources located within the state, but also focused on moving toward a balanced set of resources that included renewable development that would have advanced any potential Clean Power Plan objectives. But FERC has spoken and unless we have the patience for what could be a lengthy review process by FERC, this option could be off the table. 
So here's what I would like to be absolutely clear about. AEP is moving toward being a premium regulated utility. One that is advancing toward being the next-generation energy provider that has a vibrant energy grid with not only a balanced set of generation resources but the technology deployment of tomorrow to enable a clean, reliable and affordable energy product to our customers. We have no interest in getting involved in a protracted FERC state jurisdictional dispute so we will move as expeditiously on Plan B as possible to resolve any uncertainty regarding our being the next premium regulated utility. 
So this is a two-pronged approach that will be pursued in parallel. So we can still meet our objectives as quickly as possible. Number 1, we already have a strategic review that I will update you later regarding the non-PPA assets. We will begin a strategy -- a strategic process for the PPA assets as well. Number 2, we'll push for reregulation in the Ohio legislature to repeal and replace SP221 or enable the transfer of and cost recovery for certain resources in AEP Ohio, thereby eliminating the need for PPA. This will ensure -- this will secure Ohio's role in determining it's own resource mix with a structure that enables long and short-term deployment of generation rig-related resources in the state. These 2 prongs will progress in parallel. And whichever results in AEP becoming fully regulated earliest, will be completed. 
All of these state-related issues are occurring out of frustration with organized markets such as PJM that have an inherent inability to allow states to make decisions regarding their own resources. Ohio needs to decide expeditiously if it wants to control its own development of resources within a state or leave it to PJM and the federal government who have conflicting multistate interests. 
Regarding the Ohio Supreme Court decisions, we believe that these two [indiscernible] cases should be taken up together at the PUCO because they clearly are interrelated. The first order concerning the capacity charge and the energy credit set by the PUCO, the court said clearly that the AEP should recover our generation capacity cost and that the PUCO aired and its use of the energy energy credit and should have listened to AEP's concerns. The second order concerning the rate stabilization recovery mechanism said that it was permissible to have deferred capacity costs recovered in the RSR, but not the component of the RSR that reflect the transition or financial integrity revenue. All of these together say that the [indiscernible] of the PUCO requires the recovery of all of AEP's capacity calls. Therefore, once the duck settles on which buckets costs are exhibited to, AEP expects the results to be neutral or positive to earnings. 
The last topic to review is an update of our strategic process. So that you will know where we are at, we have opened a confidential data room. There is considerable interest by several parties and the process is moving according to schedule with final bids in the third quarter and aggressively completing the transaction by the end of the year. 
Now at this point, I'll move to the equalizer chart on the next page to talk about some of the state regulatory activities. 
So overall, we're seeing a 9.4% return. As you recall from the last quarter, it was 9.6%. But we expected it to come down during the first half of the year and then move back up toward that approximately 10% that we had discussed earlier. So everything is still on plan for that. 
Looking at the Ohio Power. The ROE for AEP Ohio is in line with our expectations and we expect to finish this year in line with the 11.9% ROE forecasted. 
For APCo, the decrease in ROE from December to March is primarily due to unfavorable weather this winter, the 2015 reversal of previous regulatory provisions as well as the performance of the merchant portion of the Mitchell plant. The 2015 West Virginia base rate case included a delayed billing of $25 million of the annual base rate increase to residential customers until July 2016. So we'll see that start to kick in. And as these -- as they phase in, the company's ROE is expected to trend at or near the 2016 forecasted ROE. 
For Kentucky Power, we're seeing the expected continual improvement at quarter end. The commission authorized the $45 million rate increase that was effective in July 2015 and this rate case will continue to improve the ROE during 2016 as the year goes on. 
For I&M, achieved an ROE of 10.2%. I&M continues to benefit from good regulatory frameworks in place for the major capital investment programs that it has going on. Rockport, SCR, Solar, the nuclear lifecycle management at Cook and transmission PJM-related projects. So I&M is well-positioned for another positive year in 2016. 
PSO's ROE is generally in line with expectations. In December, as you may recall, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented an interim base rate increase of $35 [ph] million that's subject to refi on January 15. So that's kicked in and we should expect that ROE to continue to improve. 
SWEPCO, we expect to see some improvement in ROEs from some recent filings. But they continue to be challenged by some of the wholesale revenue that's rolling off there. But also, the positive indications are that their filing an application in Arkansas that went into effect March 24 to recover retrofit investments in [indiscernible] power plants. And then in Texas, we filed transmission distributional writers there as well. 
In AEP Texas, the ongoing distribution capital investment in TCC to serve higher levels of electric loads and to maintain the reliability of the grid has gradually lowered the regulated ROE overtime. So on April 6, TCC and TNC filed a distribution cost recovery factor following seeking recovery of distribution of investment from July '06 through December 2015 with rates expected to go in effect September 1. 
AEP Transmission Holdco, the transmission side of things, has returned 10.9%, which is in line with expectations. 2016 forecast is that 10.2% because of the heavy investments being made there as well. 
So all in all, it's been a great quarter, I think. The fundamentals are showing through the company. And certainly, it's -- we have several opportunities and we'll continue to work on those. But it has been an eventful. But our employees' discipline and execution toward a common strategic objective is becoming more evident everyday. No doubt, our progress will continue toward being that next premium regulated utility and I can't help but saying, because I just got back from the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. I'll end with a quote from a famous Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame inductee and it was, it says, ""You will always tell when the groove is working or not."" That was from 2004 inductee, Prince. At American Electric Power, I can tell you the groove is working. So Brian, pick it up."

I will take us through the financial results for the first quarter, provide our latest insight on loading the economy and finish with a review of our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. Turning to Sl",1688,"Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. I will take us through the financial results for the first quarter, provide our latest insight on loading the economy and finish with a review of our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. 
Turning to Slide 5. Operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.02 per share or $501 million compared to $625 million or $1.28 per share in 2015. At the highest level, the decline in earnings this year was driven by unfavorable weather conditions and the expected decline in earnings in the Generation & Marketing segment due to the reduction in Ohio capacity revenues. These unfavorable drivers were partially offset by rate changes, growth in normalized margins in our regulated businesses and higher earnings in our AEP Transmission Holdco segment. 
With that as an overview, let's look at the drivers by segment. 
Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.57 per share, down $0.04 with the single largest driver being winter weather, which negatively impacted earnings for this segment by $0.11 per share. As Nick said earlier, 2016 was the sixth warmest winter and 2015 was the second coldest winter for AEP in the last 30 years. Other major drivers for this segment include the reversal of a 2015 regulatory provision in APCo produced a drag on earnings of $0.03 per share. Off-system sales declined by $0.02 per share due to substantially lower power prices. Higher O&M expense unfavorably affected this segment by $0.04 per share, primarily driven by higher employee-related cost. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were rate changes which were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.06 per share to the quarter and higher margins on retail sales, mostly related to the timing and mix of sales which added $0.04 per share. We will look in detail of loading the economy in the next 3 slides. 
Finally, this quarter was bolstered by $0.04 per share from the lower effective income tax rate due to prior-year tax adjustments and tax versus booked timing differences accounted for on a flow-through basis. 
The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.22 per share for the quarter, up $0.02 from last year. This major -- this segment's major drivers include rate changes, higher transmission revenues in the Texas companies and lower O&M expense, each of which added $0.01 per share for this segment. The O&M reduction was due in large part to a contribution to the Ohio growth fund made in 2015 that was not repeated this year. 
Partially offsetting these favorable items is a decline of $0.01 per share related to milder weather in Texas compared to last year. 
Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.09 per share for the quarter, an improvement of $0.02. Net plant less deferred taxes grew by approximately $910 million, an increase of 39% since last March. 
The Generation & Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.14 per share, down $0.24 from last year. Capacity revenues were lower by $0.12 per share due to plant retirements and the transition of Ohio standard service offer to full market pricing. Energy margins were lower by $0.07 per share due to power prices liquidating 32% lower than last year. While the trading and marketing organization performed well, it was not able to replicate last year's exceptional results and was off $0.03 per share. 
Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share from last year, primarily the result of having no earnings from AEP River Operations due to its sale in late 2015. Despite mild weather, softness in residential sales and power prices, our performance for the quarter were solid. We had been planning for a couple of years to be ready for the capacity revenue challenges in 2016 and our actions and planning leave us well positioned to achieve our earnings targets for the year. 
Now let's take a look at Slide 6 to review normalized load performance. Starting in the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales were essentially flat for the quarter. However, the other charts on this slide show that the growth in commercial and industrial sales is being offset by the decline in residential sales. 
Normalized residential sales were down 1.6% for the quarter. Although we experienced modest growth in our residential customer accounts compared to last year, most of the customer account growth was concentrated in Texas where favorable demographic support new household formation. This was partially offset by fewer customers in our Eastern territory, specifically around the Appalachian coal basin. 
On the positive side, commercial sales grew by 0.7%. This growth was spread across most of our operating companies which is consistent with the growth in the service sector employment that we experienced across AEP service territory. 
Finally, industrial sales grew by 0.9% this quarter. The majority of this growth came from the oil and gas sectors which I will discuss in more detail later. The growth in these sectors helped offset the drag from the primary metals and mining sectors. The weak global demand, oversupply of Asian steel and strong dollar, combined to create challenging markets for export manufacturers within our footprint. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to look at the most recent economic data for AEP service territory. Starting at the top with GDP, you see that the estimated 1.8% growth for AEP service area is now only 0.3% behind the U.S. For the first time since 2014, our Eastern territory is now growing faster than the U.S. This was not the case for our Western territory where there's greater exposure to lower oil and gas prices. While the nation benefited from lower fuel prices, AEP's regional economy supporting these shale plays are experiencing the negative impact of lost jobs. 
The charts at the bottom showed that employment growth within AEP service area is holding steady, but still lags behind the U.S. by 0.6%. It is no surprise that job growth in AEP's Eastern territory exceeds the Western service area by 0.5% given what we've just discussed. The sector showing the strongest job growth for the quarter include construction, leisure and hospitality and education and health services. These gains were somewhat offset by the decline in natural resources and mining jobs. Today, there are 16,000 fewer natural resources and mining employees working in our service territory than last year. Approximately 12,000 of those jobs were located in our Western footprint. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review our industrial sales trends by region. As we briefly mentioned earlier, we continue to see the strongest growth in our industrial sales to the oil and gas sectors. The chart in the upper left shows our industrial sales in shale counties were up over 9% versus last year. This is in spite of the fact that oil prices, rig counts and employment in the oil and gas extraction segment were down significantly from last year. 
The bottom left chart shows that growth in oil and gas sectors was spread across all major shale plays within AEP service territory with the strongest growth coming from the Eagle Ford, Permian and Marcellus regions. 
The map on the right now includes our coal counties shown in blue. I want to highlight these counties since we are seeing some significant erosion in our industrial sales as well as customer accounts in this area. In the upper left chart, our industrial sales in the coal counties were down over 17% this quarter. Low natural gas prices and environmental regulations, combined with the drop in metals production and corresponding demand for metallurgical coal have created a perfect storm for Appalachian coal producers. You are likely familiar with the number of bankruptcies and mine closures that have been announced over the past year, citing these exact reasons. 
Outside of our shale and coal counties, the rest of AEP's industrials were up nearly 1% for the quarter. Some examples of industries that are still seeing modest growth this year include transportation manufacturing and plastics and rubber manufacturing, both of which are tied to auto sales where production benefited from lower fuel prices. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital rose by 0.5% this quarter and remained healthy at 53.7%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 5.45x and 20%, respectively. 
Our qualified pension funding decreased 3% this quarter to 94%. Although planned assets increased by 1.2%, planned liabilities increased by 4.5% due to the discount rate coming in lower than the assumed rate of 4.3%. We plan on funding our pension with about $93 million in the second quarter, equal to the estimated service cost for the year. 
Our OPEB funding now stands at 104%, planned assets decreased by 1% and planned liabilities increased 4% for the same reasons as the pension plan. The estimated O&M to service both plants this year is expected to be about $20 million. 
Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $3.2 billion and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018. During the second quarter of this year, we plan to refinance these facilities with an anticipated tenur expected to extend in the June of 2021. Altogether, AEP's balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics are strong and will allow us to fund our Utility Operations, growth and dividends under all reasonably foreseeable conditions. 
And finally, so we can quickly get your questions, let's turn to Slide 10. I want to reiterate that the first quarter's results were in line with our expectations. In spite of last night's late breaking news, we remain on track to earn within our previously announced operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share for 2016. As Nick said earlier, our previously announced strategic review of our competitive generation business will continue according to schedule and we will share the results of that process as soon as we can. We expect that to be in the third quarter. 
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

In this case, we're not talking about the commission. Now obviously, we would love for the commission to be part of that process. They need to be part of that process. But this is a legislative issue. And our concern is I think there has to be a broader concern by the state of Ohio. And that's represented by the legislature. What do we do to enable Ohio to take a firm hold of the capacity and energy situation within the state, the development of new resources, the jobs, taxes, and all those things that we talked about earlier. And I don't -- it's not like you're starting at Ground Zero to do this. I think the issues in Ohio are well-known from an energy policy perspective. As a matter fact, we just got through with a review to the Ohio Business Roundtable. The [indiscernible] partnership has been involved. There is definitely already steps being taken. It's a question of okay, what steps? And then, you're talking about okay, is there a stopgap measure to basically allow the transfer of certain assets within the state of Ohio to AEP Ohio directly? And avoid a -- any kind of affiliate transaction, which probably is, I would say, is probably a better chance of accomplishing something like that then full reregulation. But I wouldn't take that off the table either. I mean, I don't think there's broader issues that are involved here. Like for instance, if Ohio wants to move forward with renewables and renewable implementation and balance out the portfolio and focus on natural gas, those are clearly areas that can fall within some form of reregulation."

In addition, we've had a SWEPCO distribution cost recovery factor where we've requested about another $9.2 million. So very much trying to take advantage of the relatively quick recovery mechanisms that they have with the cost recovery filings that are short of a full rate case in Texas and trying to get those increases reflected as quickly as possible to help get some of those Texas and SWEPCO ROEs moving in the right direction. In PSO, we've implemented a rate increase, effective January 1 of this year subject to refund and are expecting an order out of the Oklahoma commission sometime this quarter. And again, that should have that PSO ROE moving in the right direction. up closer to the upper nines, closer to 10% range."

But we are still chasing the recovery mechanism because we're investing so much. And the other jurisdictions, we are filing rate cases to catch up in certain areas. But all in all, I mean we look at it like we're managing these across the board. So some maybe seeing, you're seeing drop a little bit. But there may be specific reasons for that that we're investing or that we expect ratemaking aspects to come around at some point. But we are making very deliberate choices. And even during the first quarter, I mean, we didn't cut back on our planned O&M or any of those activities because it's the first quarter. Generally, I have to say that GAAP, you probably looked at it 2 years ago, we're probably a 10.3% that we estimated for the year and -- but you're still in that 10% area. So -- and that's where we tried to manage this thing to ensure that we're leaving that threshold all across the board. So saying I wouldn't be looking at SWEPCO for example and say, well, that's the general trend for everyone. We've talked about the specific issue at SWEPCO and it's that [indiscernible] piece, the 8 [ph] megawatts of Arkansas that we really need to resolve but timing is going to be an issue there."

So all is in good shape there. It was not with",1616,"Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining AEP's First Quarter Earnings Call. Financially, 2016 is off to a steady start that delivered earnings consistent with our plan for the year. So all is in good shape there. It was not without challenges, though. We overcame the winter that never happened. And of course, the anticipated changes from 2015 such as loss of capacity revenues related to the Ohio transition order that ended in May 2015 and the loss of AEP River Operations revenue due to the sale that occurred late last year, positive rate changes, continued benefits of managing expenses and disciplined market hedging activities enabled GAAP and operating earnings to come in at $1.02 per share. This compares with $1.29 and $1.28 per share GAAP and operating earnings, respectively, for 2015. 
The impact of weather was significant for the quarter. Brian will cover this in detail a bit later, but we had the sixth warmest winter in the last 30 years in 2016. And remember, we're comparing against the second coldest winter in 2015. So considering this difference, I would say we had a great quarter from an earnings perspective, but it showed the resiliency of our plan for the year and the strength of our foundation for continued growth.
We are reaffirming our guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share and our 4% to 6% growth rate to further signal our confidence in how the year is likely to shape up for AEP.
I'm sure many of you have questions concerning last night's FERC order, so let me put some perspective on that. Obviously, we were disappointed with the FERC decision to review our PPA arrangement under the EDGAR rules based upon the presence of non-bypassable charges. But that being said, we embarked on the best mechanism within the existing Ohio legislation that we felt could withstand legal scrutiny that would allow the Ohio Commission to have a say regarding the long-term viability of resources and the development of new resources within the state. 
And the positive note regarding Ohio activities during the first quarter is that the PUCO did the right thing. They approved the PPA, and not only sent a message regarding investment and resources located within the state, but also focused on moving toward a balanced set of resources that included renewable development that would have advanced any potential Clean Power Plan objectives. But FERC has spoken and unless we have the patience for what could be a lengthy review process by FERC, this option could be off the table. 
So here is what I want to be absolutely clear about. AEP is moving toward being a premium regulated utility, one that is advancing toward being the next-generation energy provider that has a vibrant energy grid, with not only a balanced set of generation resources but the technology deployment of tomorrow to enable a clean, reliable and affordable energy product to our customers. We have no interest in getting involved in a protracted FERC state jurisdictional dispute so we will move as expeditiously on Plan B as possible to resolve any uncertainty regarding our being the next premium regulated utility. 
So this is a two-pronged approach that will be pursued in parallel. So we can still meet our objectives as quickly as possible. Number one, we already have a strategic review that I will update you later regarding the non-PPA assets. We will begin a strategy -- a strategic process for the PPA assets as well. Number two, we'll push for reregulation in the Ohio legislature to repeal and replace SB 221 or enable the transfer of and cost recovery for certain resources in AEP Ohio, thereby eliminating the need for a PPA. This will ensure -- this will secure Ohio's role in determining its own resource mix with a structure that enables long- and short-term deployment of generation-related resources in the state. These 2 prongs will progress in parallel, and whichever results in AEP becoming fully regulated earliest, will be completed. 
All of these state-related issues are occurring out of frustration with organized markets such as PJM that have an inherent inability to allow states to make decisions regarding their own resources. Ohio needs to decide expeditiously, does it want to control its own development of resources within the state or leave it to PJM and the federal government who have conflicting multistate interests?
Regarding the Ohio Supreme Court decisions, we believe that these two remanded cases should be taken up together at the PUCO because they clearly are interrelated. The first order concerning the capacity charge and the energy credit set by the PUCO, the court said clearly that the AEP should recover our generation capacity cost and that the PUCO erred in its use of the energy credit and should have listened to AEP's concerns. The second order concerning the rate stabilization recovery mechanism said that it was permissible to have deferred capacity costs recovered in the RSR, but not the component of the RSR that reflect the transition or financial integrity revenue. All of these together say that the remand to the PUCO requires the recovery of all of AEP's capacity costs. Therefore, once the dust settles on which buckets costs are attributed to, AEP expects the results to be neutral or positive to earnings. 
The last topic to review is an update of our strategic process. So that you will know where we are at, we have opened a confidential data room. There is considerable interest by several parties and the process is moving according to schedule with final bids in the third quarter and aggressively completing the transaction by the end of the year.
Now at this point, I'll move to the equalizer chart on the next page to talk about some of the state regulatory activities.
So overall, we're seeing a 9.4% return. As you recall from the last quarter, it was 9.6%. But we expected it to come down during the first half of the year and then move back up toward that approximately 10% that we had discussed earlier. So everything is still on plan for that.
Looking at the Ohio Power. The ROE for AEP Ohio is in line with our expectations and we expect to finish this year in line with the 11.9% ROE forecasted. 
For APCo, the decrease in ROE from December to March is primarily due to unfavorable weather this winter, the 2015 reversal of previous regulatory provisions as well as the performance of the merchant portion of the Mitchell plant. The 2015 West Virginia base rate case included a delayed billing of $25 million of the annual base rate increase to residential customers until July 2016, so we'll see that start to kick in. And as these -- as they phase in, the company's ROE is expected to trend at or near the 2016 forecasted ROE.
For Kentucky Power, we're seeing the expected continual improvement at quarter end. The commission authorized the $45 million rate increase that was effective in July 2015, and this rate case will continue to improve the ROE during 2016 as the year goes on. 
For I&M, it achieved an ROE of 10.2%. I&M continues to benefit from good regulatory frameworks in place for the major capital investment programs that it has going on: Rockport, SCR, solar, the nuclear life cycle management at Cook and transmission PJM-related projects. So I&M is well positioned for another positive year in 2016.
PSO's ROE is generally in line with expectations. In December, as you will recall, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented an interim base rate increase of $75 million that's subject to refine on January 15. So that's kicked in and we should expect that ROE to continue to improve. 
SWEPCO, we expect to see some improvement in ROEs from some recent filings, but they continue to be challenged by some of the wholesale revenue that's rolling off there. But also, the positive indications are that they're filing an application in Arkansas that went into effect March 24 to recover retrofit investments in Welsh and Flint Creek power plants. And then in Texas, we filed transmission distributional riders there as well. 
In AEP Texas, the ongoing distribution capital investment in TCC to serve higher levels of electric loads and to maintain the reliability of the grid has gradually lowered the regulated ROE over time. So on April 6, TCC and TNC filed a distribution cost recovery factor filings, seeking recovery of distribution investment from July '06 through December 2015, with rates expected to go into effect September 1. 
AEP Transmission Holdco, the transmission side of things, its return is 10.9%, which is in line with the expectation. 2016 forecast is 10.2% because of the heavy investments being made there as well. 
So all in all, it's been a great quarter, I think. The fundamentals are showing through the company. And certainly, it's -- we have several opportunities and we'll continue to work on those. But it has been eventful, but our employees' discipline and execution toward a common strategic objective is becoming more evident every day. No doubt, our progress will continue toward being that next premium regulated utility and I can't help but say, because I just got back from the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, I'll end with a quote from a famous Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame inductee, and it was -- it says, ""You will always tell when the groove is working or not."" That was from 2004 inductee, Prince. At American Electric Power, I can tell you the groove is working. So Brian, pick it up."

I will take us through the financial results for the first quarter, provide our latest insight on load and the economy and finish with a review of our balance sheet strength and liquidity position.

I will take us through the financial results for the first quarter, provide our latest insight on load and the economy and finish with a review of our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. 
Turning to Slide 5. Operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.02 per share or $501 million compared to $625 million or $1.28 per share in 2015. At the highest level, the decline in earnings this year was driven by unfavorable weather conditions and the expected decline in earnings in the Generation & Marketing segment due to the reduction in Ohio capacity revenues. These unfavorable drivers were partially offset by rate changes, growth in normalized margins in our regulated businesses and higher earnings in our AEP Transmission Holdco segment. 
With that as an overview, let's look at the drivers by segment. 
Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.57 per share, down $0.04 with the single largest driver being winter weather, which negatively impacted earnings for this segment by $0.11 per share. As Nick said earlier, 2016 was the sixth warmest winter and 2015 was the second coldest winter for AEP in the last 30 years. Other major drivers for this segment include the reversal of a 2015 regulatory provision in APCo produced a drag on earnings of $0.03 per share. Off-system sales declined by $0.02 per share due to substantially lower power prices. Higher O&M expense unfavorably affected this segment by $0.04 per share, primarily driven by higher employee-related cost. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were rate changes, which were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.06 per share to the quarter and higher margins on retail sales, mostly related to the timing and mix of sales which added $0.04 per share. We will look in detail at load and the economy in the next 3 slides. 
Finally, this quarter was bolstered by $0.04 per share from the lower effective income tax rate due to prior year tax adjustments and tax versus booked timing differences accounted for on a flow-through basis. 
The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.22 per share for the quarter, up $0.02 from last year. This major -- this segment's major drivers include rate changes, higher transmission revenues in the Texas companies and lower O&M expense, each of which added $0.01 per share for this segment. The O&M reduction was due in large part to a contribution to the Ohio growth fund made in 2015 that was not repeated this year. 
Partially offsetting these favorable items is a decline of $0.01 per share related to milder weather in Texas compared to last year. 
Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.09 per share for the quarter, an improvement of $0.02. Net plant less deferred taxes grew by approximately $910 million, an increase of 39% since last March. 
The Generation & Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.14 per share, down $0.24 from last year. Capacity revenues were lower by $0.12 per share due to plant retirements and the transition of Ohio standard service offer to full market pricing. Energy margins were lower by $0.07 per share due to power prices liquidating 32% lower than last year. While the trading and marketing organization performed well, it was not able to replicate last year's exceptional results and was off $0.03 per share. 
Corporate & Other was down $0.02 per share from last year, primarily the result of having no earnings from AEP River Operations due to its sale in late 2015. Despite mild weather, softness in residential sales and power prices, our performance for the quarter was solid. We have been planning for a couple of years to be ready for the capacity revenue challenges in 2016 and our actions and planning leave us well positioned to achieve our earnings targets for the year.
Now let's take a look at Slide 6 to review normalized load performance. Starting in the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales were essentially flat for the quarter. However, the other charts on this slide show that the growth in commercial and industrial sales is being offset by the decline in residential sales.
Normalized residential sales were down 1.6% for the quarter. Although we experienced modest growth in our residential customer accounts compared to last year, most of the customer account growth was concentrated in Texas where favorable demographic support new household formation. This was partially offset by fewer customers in our Eastern territory, specifically around the Appalachian coal basin. 
On the positive side, commercial sales grew by 0.7%. This growth was spread across most of our operating companies, which is consistent with the growth in the service sector employment that we experienced across AEP service territory. 
Finally, industrial sales grew by 0.9% this quarter. The majority of this growth came from the oil and gas sectors, which I will discuss in more detail later. The growth in these sectors helped offset the drag from the primary metals and mining sectors. The weak global demand, oversupply of Asian steel and strong dollar combined to create challenging markets for export manufacturers within our footprint. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to look at the most recent economic data for AEP service territory. Starting at the top with GDP, you see that the estimated 1.8% growth for AEP service area is now only 0.3% behind the U.S. For the first time since 2014, our Eastern territory is now growing faster than the U.S. This was not the case for our Western territory, where there's greater exposure to lower oil and gas prices. While the nation benefited from lower fuel prices, AEP's regional economy supporting these shale plays are experiencing the negative impact of lost jobs. 
The charts at the bottom showed that employment growth within AEP service area is holding steady but still lags behind the U.S. by 0.6%. It is no surprise that job growth in AEP's Eastern territory exceeds the Western service area by 0.5% given what we've just discussed. The sector showing the strongest job growth for the quarter include construction, leisure and hospitality and education and health services. These gains were somewhat offset by the decline in natural resources and mining jobs. Today, there are 16,000 fewer natural resources and mining employees working in our service territory than last year. Approximately 12,000 of those jobs were located in our Western footprint. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review our industrial sales trends by region. As we briefly mentioned earlier, we continue to see the strongest growth in our industrial sales to the oil and gas sectors. The chart in the upper left shows our industrial sales in shale counties were up over 9% versus last year. This is in spite of the fact that oil prices, rig counts and employment in the oil and gas extraction segment were down significantly from last year. 
The bottom left chart shows that growth in oil and gas sectors was spread across all major shale plays within AEP service territory, with the strongest growth coming from the Eagle Ford, Permian and Marcellus regions. 
The map on the right now includes our coal counties shown in blue. I want to highlight these counties since we are seeing some significant erosion in our industrial sales as well as customer counts in this area. In the upper left chart, our industrial sales in the coal counties were down over 17% this quarter. Low natural gas prices and environmental regulations, combined with the drop in metals production and corresponding demand for metallurgical coal have created a perfect storm for Appalachian coal producers. You are likely familiar with the number of bankruptcies and mine closures that have been announced over the past year, citing these exact reasons. 
Outside of our shale and coal counties, the rest of AEP's industrials were up nearly 1% for the quarter. Some examples of industries that are still seeing modest growth this year include transportation manufacturing and plastics and rubber manufacturing, both of which are tied to auto sales where production benefited from lower fuel prices. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital rose by 0.5% this quarter and remained healthy at 53.7%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 5.45x and 20%, respectively. 
Our qualified pension funding decreased 3% this quarter to 94%. Although planned assets increased by 1.2%, planned liabilities increased by 4.5% due to the discount rate coming in lower than the assumed rate of 4.3%. We plan on funding our pension with about $93 million in the second quarter, equal to the estimated service cost for the year. 
Our OPEB funding now stands at 104%, planned assets decreased by 1% and planned liabilities increased 4% for the same reasons as the pension plan. The estimated O&M to service both plants this year is expected to be about $20 million. 
Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $3.2 billion and is supported by our 2 revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018. During the second quarter of this year, we plan to refinance these facilities with an anticipated tenor expected to extend in the June of 2021. Altogether, AEP's balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics are strong and will allow us to fund our Utility Operations, growth and dividends under all reasonably foreseeable conditions. 
And finally, so we can quickly get to your questions, let's turn to Slide 10. I want to reiterate that the first quarter's results were in line with our expectations. In spite of last night's late breaking news, we remain on track to earn within our previously announced operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share for 2016. As Nick said earlier, our previously announced strategic review of our competitive generation business will continue according to schedule and we will share the results of that process as soon as we can. We expect that to be in the third quarter. 
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

I'll just probably make a distinction because even before we started the PPA, I said the State of Ohio needed to decide. But I also said that the commission needs to decide. And because we were trying to do something within the purview of the existing legislation, and it had been left up to the deference of the commission to decide. In this case, we're not talking about the commission. Now obviously, we'd love for the commission to be part of that process. They need to be part of the process. But this is a legislative issue. And our concern is, and I think there has to be a broader concern by the State of Ohio, and that's represented by the legislature. What do we do to enable Ohio to take a firm hold of the capacity and energy situation within the state, the development of new resources, the jobs, taxes, and all those things that we talked about earlier. And I don't -- it's not like you're starting at ground zero to do this. I think the issues in Ohio are well-known from an energy policy perspective. Matter fact, we just got through with a review through the Ohio Business Roundtable. The Columbus Partnership has been involved. There is definitely already steps being taken. It's a question of okay, what steps? And there, you're talking about okay, is there a stopgap measure to basically allow the transfer of certain assets within the State of Ohio to AEP Ohio directly and avoid a -- any kind of affiliate transaction? Which probably is, I would say, is probably a better chance of accomplishing something like that than a full reregulation. But I wouldn't take that off the table either. I mean, because I think there's broader issues that are involved here. Like for instance, if Ohio wants to move forward with renewables and renewable implementation and balance out the portfolio and focus on natural gas, those are clearly areas that can fall within some form of reregulation."

But a more fulsome discussion on what we would do with use of proceeds would likely be at an Analyst Day following the announcement of the resolution of that strategic review."

So all is in good shape there. It was not with",1615,"Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining AEP's First Quarter Earnings Call. Financially, 2016 is off to a steady start that delivered earnings consistent with our plan for the year. So all is in good shape there. It was not without challenges, though. We overcame the winter that never happened. And of course, the anticipated changes from 2015 such as loss of capacity revenues related to the Ohio transition order that ended in May 2015 and the loss of AEP River Operations revenue due to the sale that occurred late last year, positive rate changes, continued benefits of managing expenses and disciplined market hedging activities enabled GAAP and operating earnings to come in at $1.02 per share. This compares with $1.29 and $1.28 per share GAAP and operating earnings, respectively, for 2015. 
The impact of weather was significant for the quarter. Brian will cover this in detail a bit later, but we had the sixth warmest winter in the last 30 years in 2016. And remember, we're comparing against the second coldest winter in 2015. So considering this difference, I would say we had a great quarter from an earnings perspective, but it showed the resiliency of our plan for the year and the strength of our foundation for continued growth.
We are reaffirming our guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share and our 4% to 6% growth rate to further signal our confidence in how the year is likely to shape up for AEP.
I'm sure many of you have questions concerning last night's FERC order, so let me put some perspective on that. Obviously, we were disappointed with the FERC decision to review our PPA arrangement under the EDGAR rules based upon the presence of non-bypassable charges. But that being said, we embarked on the best mechanism within the existing Ohio legislation that we felt could withstand legal scrutiny that would allow the Ohio Commission to have a say regarding the long-term viability of resources and the development of new resources within the state. 
And the positive note regarding Ohio activities during the first quarter is that the PUCO did the right thing. They approved the PPA, and not only sent a message regarding investment and resources located within the state, but also focused on moving toward a balanced set of resources that included renewable development that would have advanced any potential Clean Power Plan objectives. But FERC has spoken and unless we have the patience for what could be a lengthy review process by FERC, this option could be off the table. 
So here is what I want to be absolutely clear about. AEP is moving toward being a premium regulated utility, one that is advancing toward being the next-generation energy provider that has a vibrant energy grid, with not only a balanced set of generation resources but the technology deployment of tomorrow to enable a clean, reliable and affordable energy product to our customers. We have no interest in getting involved in a protracted FERC state jurisdictional dispute so we will move as expeditiously on Plan B as possible to resolve any uncertainty regarding our being the next premium regulated utility. 
So this is a two-pronged approach that will be pursued in parallel. So we can still meet our objectives as quickly as possible. Number one, we already have a strategic review that I will update you later regarding the non-PPA assets. We will begin a strategy -- a strategic process for the PPA assets as well. Number two, we'll push for reregulation in the Ohio legislature to repeal and replace SB 221 or enable the transfer of and cost recovery for certain resources in AEP Ohio, thereby eliminating the need for a PPA. This will ensure -- this will secure Ohio's role in determining its own resource mix with a structure that enables long- and short-term deployment of generation-related resources in the state. These 2 prongs will progress in parallel, and whichever results in AEP becoming fully regulated earliest, will be completed. 
All of these state-related issues are occurring out of frustration with organized markets such as PJM that have an inherent inability to allow states to make decisions regarding their own resources. Ohio needs to decide expeditiously, does it want to control its own development of resources within the state or leave it to PJM and the federal government who have conflicting multistate interests?
Regarding the Ohio Supreme Court decisions, we believe that these two remanded cases should be taken up together at the PUCO because they clearly are interrelated. The first order concerning the capacity charge and the energy credit set by the PUCO, the court said clearly that the AEP should recover our generation capacity cost and that the PUCO erred in its use of the energy credit and should have listened to AEP's concerns. The second order concerning the rate stabilization recovery mechanism said that it was permissible to have deferred capacity costs recovered in the RSR, but not the component of the RSR that reflect the transition or financial integrity revenue. All of these together say that the remand to the PUCO requires the recovery of all of AEP's capacity costs. Therefore, once the dust settles on which buckets costs are attributed to, AEP expects the results to be neutral or positive to earnings. 
The last topic to review is an update of our strategic process. So that you will know where we are at, we have opened a confidential data room. There is considerable interest by several parties and the process is moving according to schedule with final bids in the third quarter and aggressively completing the transaction by the end of the year.
Now at this point, I'll move to the equalizer chart on the next page to talk about some of the state regulatory activities.
So overall, we're seeing a 9.4% return. As you recall from the last quarter, it was 9.6%. But we expected it to come down during the first half of the year and then move back up toward that approximately 10% that we had discussed earlier. So everything is still on plan for that.
Looking at the Ohio Power. The ROE for AEP Ohio is in line with our expectations and we expect to finish this year in line with the 11.9% ROE forecasted. 
For APCo, the decrease in ROE from December to March is primarily due to unfavorable weather this winter, the 2015 reversal of previous regulatory provisions as well as the performance of the merchant portion of the Mitchell plant. The 2015 West Virginia base rate case included a delayed billing of $25 million of the annual base rate increase to residential customers until July 2016, so we'll see that start to kick in. And as these -- as they phase in, the company's ROE is expected to trend at or near the 2016 forecasted ROE.
For Kentucky Power, we're seeing the expected continual improvement at quarter end. The commission authorized the $45 million rate increase that was effective in July 2015, and this rate case will continue to improve the ROE during 2016 as the year goes on. 
For I&M, it achieved an ROE of 10.2%. I&M continues to benefit from good regulatory frameworks in place for the major capital investment programs that it has going on: Rockport, SCR, solar, the nuclear life cycle management at Cook and transmission PJM-related projects. So I&M is well positioned for another positive year in 2016.
PSO's ROE is generally in line with expectations. In December, as you will recall, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented an interim base rate increase of $75 million that's subject to refine on January 15. So that's kicked in and we should expect that ROE to continue to improve. 
SWEPCO, we expect to see some improvement in ROEs from some recent filings, but they continue to be challenged by some of the wholesale revenue that's rolling off there. But also, the positive indications are that they're filing an application in Arkansas that went into effect March 24 to recover retrofit investments in Welsh and Flint Creek power plants. And then in Texas, we filed transmission distributional riders there as well. 
In AEP Texas, the ongoing distribution capital investment in TCC to serve higher levels of electric loads and to maintain the reliability of the grid has gradually lowered the regulated ROE over time. So on April 6, TCC and TNC filed a distribution cost recovery factor filings, seeking recovery of distribution investments from July '06 through December 2015, with rates expected to go into effect September 1. 
AEP Transmission Holdco, the transmission side of things, its return is 10.9%, which is in line with expectations. 2016 forecast is 10.2% because of the heavy investments being made there as well. 
So all in all, it's been a great quarter, I think. The fundamentals are showing through the company. And certainly, it's -- we have several opportunities and we'll continue to work on those. But it has been eventful, but our employees' discipline and execution toward a common strategic objective is becoming more evident every day. No doubt, our progress will continue toward being that next premium regulated utility and I can't help but say, because I just got back from the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, I'll end with a quote from a famous Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame inductee, and it was -- it says, ""You will always tell when the groove is working or not."" That was from 2004 inductee, Prince. At American Electric Power, I can tell you the groove is working. So Brian, pick it up."

I will take us through the financial results for the first quarter, provide our latest insight on load and the economy and finish with a review of our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. Turning to",1692,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning everyone. I will take us through the financial results for the first quarter, provide our latest insight on load and the economy and finish with a review of our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. 
Turning to Slide 5. Operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.02 per share or $501 million compared to $625 million or $1.28 per share in 2015. At the highest level, the decline in earnings this year was driven by unfavorable weather conditions and the expected decline in earnings in the Generation & Marketing segment due to the reduction in Ohio capacity revenues. These unfavorable drivers were partially offset by rate changes, growth in normalized margins in our regulated businesses and higher earnings in our AEP Transmission Holdco segment. 
With that as an overview, let's look at the drivers by segment. 
Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.57 per share, down $0.04 with the single largest driver being winter weather, which negatively impacted earnings for this segment by $0.11 per share. As Nick said earlier, 2016 was the sixth warmest winter and 2015 was the second coldest winter for AEP in the last 30 years. Other major drivers for this segment include the reversal of a 2015 regulatory provision in APCo produced a drag on earnings of $0.03 per share. Off-system sales declined by $0.02 per share due to substantially lower power prices. Higher O&M expense unfavorably affected this segment by $0.04 per share, primarily driven by higher employee-related cost. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were rate changes, which were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.06 per share to the quarter and higher margins on retail sales, mostly related to the timing and mix of sales which added $0.04 per share. We will look in detail at load and the economy in the next 3 slides. 
Finally, this quarter was bolstered by $0.04 per share from the lower effective income tax rate due to prior year tax adjustments and tax versus booked timing differences accounted for on a flow-through basis. 
The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.22 per share for the quarter, up $0.02 from last year. This major -- this segment's major drivers include rate changes, higher transmission revenues in the Texas companies and lower O&M expense, each of which added $0.01 per share for this segment. The O&M reduction was due in large part to a contribution to the Ohio growth fund made in 2015 that was not repeated this year. 
Partially offsetting these favorable items is a decline of $0.01 per share related to milder weather in Texas compared to last year. 
Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.09 per share for the quarter, an improvement of $0.02. Net plant less deferred taxes grew by approximately $910 million, an increase of 39% since last March. 
The Generation & Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.14 per share, down $0.24 from last year. Capacity revenues were lower by $0.12 per share due to plant retirements and the transition of Ohio standard service offer to full market pricing. Energy margins were lower by $0.07 per share due to power prices liquidating 32% lower than last year. While the trading and marketing organization performed well, it was not able to replicate last year's exceptional results and was off $0.03 per share. 
Corporate & Other was down $0.02 per share from last year, primarily the result of having no earnings from AEP River Operations due to its sale in late 2015. Despite mild weather, softness in residential sales and power prices, our performance for the quarter was solid. We have been planning for a couple of years to be ready for the capacity revenue challenges in 2016 and our actions and planning leave us well positioned to achieve our earnings targets for the year.
Now let's take a look at Slide 6 to review normalized load performance. Starting in the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales were essentially flat for the quarter. However, the other charts on this slide show that the growth in commercial and industrial sales is being offset by the decline in residential sales.
Normalized residential sales were down 1.6% for the quarter. Although we experienced modest growth in our residential customer accounts compared to last year, most of the customer account growth was concentrated in Texas where favorable demographic support new household formation. This was partially offset by fewer customers in our Eastern territory, specifically around the Appalachian coal basin. 
On the positive side, commercial sales grew by 0.7%. This growth was spread across most of our operating companies, which is consistent with the growth in the service sector employment that we experienced across AEP service territory. 
Finally, industrial sales grew by 0.9% this quarter. The majority of this growth came from the oil and gas sectors, which I will discuss in more detail later. The growth in these sectors helped offset the drag from the primary metals and mining sectors. The weak global demand, oversupply of Asian steel and strong dollar combined to create challenging markets for export manufacturers within our footprint. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to look at the most recent economic data for AEP service territory. Starting at the top with GDP, you see that the estimated 1.8% growth for AEP service area is now only 0.3% behind the U.S. For the first time since 2014, our Eastern territory is now growing faster than the U.S. This was not the case for our Western territory, where there's greater exposure to lower oil and gas prices. While the nation benefited from lower fuel prices, AEP's regional economy supporting these shale plays are experiencing the negative impact of lost jobs. 
The charts at the bottom showed that employment growth within AEP service area is holding steady but still lags behind the U.S. by 0.6%. It is no surprise that job growth in AEP's Eastern territory exceeds the Western service area by 0.5% given what we've just discussed. The sector showing the strongest job growth for the quarter include construction, leisure and hospitality and education and health services. These gains were somewhat offset by the decline in natural resources and mining jobs. Today, there are 16,000 fewer natural resources and mining employees working in our service territory than last year. Approximately 12,000 of those jobs were located in our Western footprint. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review our industrial sales trends by region. As we briefly mentioned earlier, we continue to see the strongest growth in our industrial sales to the oil and gas sectors. The chart in the upper left shows our industrial sales in shale counties were up over 9% versus last year. This is in spite of the fact that oil prices, rig counts and employment in the oil and gas extraction segment were down significantly from last year. 
The bottom left chart shows that growth in oil and gas sectors was spread across all major shale plays within AEP service territory, with the strongest growth coming from the Eagle Ford, Permian and Marcellus regions. 
The map on the right now includes our coal counties shown in blue. I want to highlight these counties since we are seeing some significant erosion in our industrial sales as well as customer counts in this area. In the upper left chart, our industrial sales in the coal counties were down over 17% this quarter. Low natural gas prices and environmental regulations, combined with the drop in metals production and corresponding demand for metallurgical coal have created a perfect storm for Appalachian coal producers. You are likely familiar with the number of bankruptcies and mine closures that have been announced over the past year, citing these exact reasons. 
Outside of our shale and coal counties, the rest of AEP's industrials were up nearly 1% for the quarter. Some examples of industries that are still seeing modest growth this year include transportation manufacturing and plastics and rubber manufacturing, both of which are tied to auto sales where production benefited from lower fuel prices. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital rose by 0.5% this quarter and remained healthy at 53.7%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 5.45x and 20%, respectively. 
Our qualified pension funding decreased 3% this quarter to 94%. Although plan assets increased by 1.2%, plan liabilities increased by 4.5% due to the discount rate coming in lower than the assumed rate of 4.3%. We plan on funding our pension with about $93 million in the second quarter, equal to the estimated service cost for the year. 
Our OPEB funding now stands at 104%. Plan assets decreased by 1% and plan liabilities increased 4% for the same reasons as the pension plan. The estimated O&M to service both plans this year is expected to be about $20 million. 
Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $3.2 billion and is supported by our 2 revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018. During the second quarter of this year, we plan to refinance these facilities with an anticipated tenor expected to extend in the June of 2021. Altogether, AEP's balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics are strong and will allow us to fund our Utility Operations, growth and dividends under all reasonably foreseeable conditions. 
And finally, so we can quickly get to your questions, let's turn to Slide 10. I want to reiterate that the first quarter's results were in line with our expectations. In spite of last night's late breaking news, we remain on track to earn within our previously announced operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share for 2016. As Nick said earlier, our previously announced strategic review of our competitive generation business will continue according to schedule and we will share the results of that process as soon as we can. We expect that to be in the third quarter. 
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

And because we were trying to do something within the purview of the existing legislation, and it had been left up to the deference of the commission to decide. In this case, we're not talking about the commission. Now obviously, we'd love for the commission to be part of that process. They need to be part of the process. But this is a legislative issue. And our concern is, and I think there has to be a broader concern by the State of Ohio, and that's represented by the legislature. What do we do to enable Ohio to take a firm hold of the capacity and energy situation within the state, the development of new resources, the jobs, taxes, and all those things that we talked about earlier. And I don't -- it's not like you're starting at ground zero to do this. I think the issues in Ohio are well-known from an energy policy perspective. Matter fact, we just got through with a review through the Ohio Business Roundtable. The Columbus Partnership has been involved. There is definitely already steps being taken. It's a question of okay, what steps? And there, you're talking about okay, is there a stopgap measure to basically allow the transfer of certain assets within the State of Ohio to AEP Ohio directly and avoid a -- any kind of affiliate transaction? Which probably is, I would say, is probably a better chance of accomplishing something like that than full reregulation. But I wouldn't take that off the table either. I mean, because I think there's broader issues that are involved here. Like for instance, if Ohio wants to move forward with renewables and renewable implementation and balance out the portfolio and focus on natural gas, those are clearly areas that can fall within some form of reregulation."

So some may be see -- you're seeing drop a little bit but there may be specific reasons for that, that we -- that we're investing or that we expect rate-making aspects to come around at some point. But we're making very deliberate choices. And even during the first quarter, I mean, we didn't cut back on our planned O&M or any of those activities because it's the first quarter. Generally, you'd have to say that, yes, probably if you looked at it 2 years ago, we were probably at 10.3% that we estimated for the year and -- but you're still in that 10% area. So -- and that's where we try to manage this thing to ensure that we're meeting that threshold across-the-board. So I wouldn't be looking at SWEPCO, for example, and saying, ""Well, that's the general trend for everyone."" We've talked about the specific issue at SWEPCO and it's that Turk piece, the 88 megawatts of Arkansas that we really need to resolve. But timing is going to be an issue there."

So the capacity is probably available so -- but because we transferred out-capacity as well, we'll need to -- and retired capacity, we'll need to make sure we have a plan to recover from that. I think from the customer standpoint, to put new capacity in place or buy existing capacity that's out on the market would be a positive thing to provide certainty in terms of their bills in the future. And I just see a very volatile future for Ohio customers and usually, that volatility happens at bad times where customers can ill afford to be able to pay a bill.

And when you open it up to the market forces, the budget biller is not in the game anymore. So I think there's value in that."

Financially, 2016 is off to a steady start that delivered earnings consistent with our plan for the year. So all is in good shape there. It was not without challenges, though. We overcame the winter that never happened. And of course, the anticipated changes from 2015 such as loss of capacity revenues related to the Ohio transition order that ended in May 2015 and the loss of AEP River Operations revenue due to the sale that occurred late last year, positive rate changes, continued benefits of managing expenses and disciplined market hedging activities enabled GAAP and operating earnings to come in at $1.02 per share. This compares with $1.29 and $1.28 per share GAAP and operating earnings, respectively, for 2015. 
The impact of weather was significant for the quarter. Brian will cover this in detail a bit later, but we had the sixth warmest winter in the last 30 years in 2016. And remember, we're comparing against the second coldest winter in 2015. So considering this difference, I would say we had a great quarter from an earnings perspective, but it showed the resiliency of our plan for the year and the strength of our foundation for continued growth.
We are reaffirming our guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share and our 4% to 6% growth rate to further signal our confidence in how the year is likely to shape up for AEP.
I'm sure many of you have questions concerning last night's FERC order, so let me put some perspective on that. Obviously, we were disappointed with the FERC decision to review our PPA arrangement under the EDGAR rules based upon the presence of non-bypassable charges. But that being said, we embarked on the best mechanism within the existing Ohio legislation that we felt could withstand legal scrutiny that would allow the Ohio Commission to have a say regarding the long-term viability of resources and the development of new resources within the state. 
And the positive note regarding Ohio activities during the first quarter is that the PUCO did the right thing. They approved the PPA, and not only sent a message regarding investment and resources located within the state, but also focused on moving toward a balanced set of resources that included renewable development that would have advanced any potential Clean Power Plan objectives. But FERC has spoken and unless we have the patience for what could be a lengthy review process by FERC, this option could be off the table. 
So here is what I want to be absolutely clear about. AEP is moving toward being a premium regulated utility, one that is advancing toward being the next-generation energy provider that has a vibrant energy grid, with not only a balanced set of generation resources but the technology deployment of tomorrow to enable a clean, reliable and affordable energy product to our customers. We have no interest in getting involved in a protracted FERC state jurisdictional dispute so we will move as expeditiously on Plan B as possible to resolve any uncertainty regarding our being the next premium regulated utility. 
So this is a two-pronged approach that will be pursued in parallel. So we can still meet our objectives as quickly as possible. Number one, we already have a strategic review that I will update you later regarding the non-PPA assets. We will begin a strategy -- a strategic process for the PPA assets as well. Number two, we'll push for reregulation in the Ohio legislature to repeal and replace SB 221 or enable the transfer of and cost recovery for certain resources in AEP Ohio, thereby eliminating the need for a PPA. This will ensure -- this will secure Ohio's role in determining its own resource mix with a structure that enables long- and short-term deployment of generation-related resources in the state. These 2 prongs will progress in parallel, and whichever results in AEP becoming fully regulated earliest, will be completed. 
All of these state-related issues are occurring out of frustration with organized markets such as PJM that have an inherent inability to allow states to make decisions regarding their own resources. Ohio needs to decide expeditiously, does it want to control its own development of resources within the state or leave it to PJM and the federal government who have conflicting multistate interests?
Regarding the Ohio Supreme Court decisions, we believe that these two remanded cases should be taken up together at the PUCO because they clearly are interrelated. The first order concerning the capacity charge and the energy credit set by the PUCO, the court said clearly that the AEP should recover our generation capacity cost and that the PUCO erred in its use of the energy credit and should have listened to AEP's concerns. The second order concerning the rate stabilization recovery mechanism said that it was permissible to have deferred capacity costs recovered in the RSR, but not the component of the RSR that reflect the transition or financial integrity revenue. All of these together say that the remand to the PUCO requires the recovery of all of AEP's capacity costs. Therefore, once the dust settles on which buckets costs are attributed to, AEP expects the results to be neutral or positive to earnings. 
The last topic to review is an update of our strategic process. So that you will know where we are at, we have opened a confidential data room. There is considerable interest by several parties and the process is moving according to schedule with final bids in the third quarter and aggressively completing the transaction by the end of the year.
Now at this point, I'll move to the equalizer chart on the next page to talk about some of the state regulatory activities.
So overall, we're seeing a 9.4% return. As you recall from the last quarter, it was 9.6%. But we expected it to come down during the first half of the year and then move back up toward that approximately 10% that we had discussed earlier. So everything is still on plan for that.
Looking at the Ohio Power. The ROE for AEP Ohio is in line with our expectations and we expect to finish this year in line with the 11.9% ROE forecasted. 
For APCo, the decrease in ROE from December to March is primarily due to unfavorable weather this winter, the 2015 reversal of previous regulatory provisions as well as the performance of the merchant portion of the Mitchell plant. The 2015 West Virginia base rate case included a delayed billing of $25 million of the annual base rate increase to residential customers until July 2016, so we'll see that start to kick in. And as these -- as they phase in, the company's ROE is expected to trend at or near the 2016 forecasted ROE.
For Kentucky Power, we're seeing the expected continual improvement at quarter end. The commission authorized the $45 million rate increase that was effective in July 2015, and this rate case will continue to improve the ROE during 2016 as the year goes on. 
For I&M, it achieved an ROE of 10.2%. I&M continues to benefit from good regulatory frameworks in place for the major capital investment programs that it has going on: Rockport, SCR, solar, the nuclear life cycle management at Cook and transmission PJM-related projects. So I&M is well positioned for another positive year in 2016.
PSO's ROE is generally in line with expectations. In December, as you will recall, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented an interim base rate increase of $75 million that's subject to refine on January 15. So that's kicked in and we should expect that ROE to continue to improve. 
SWEPCO, we expect to see some improvement in ROEs from some recent filings, but they continue to be challenged by some of the wholesale revenue that's rolling off there. But also, the positive indications are that they're filing an application in Arkansas that went into effect March 24 to recover retrofit investments in Welsh and Flint Creek power plants. And then in Texas, we filed transmission distributional riders there as well. 
In AEP Texas, the ongoing distribution capital investment in TCC to serve higher levels of electric loads and to maintain the reliability of the grid has gradually lowered the regulated ROE over time. So on April 6, TCC and TNC filed a distribution cost recovery factor filings, seeking recovery of distribution investments from July '06 through December 2015, with rates expected to go into effect September 1. 
AEP Transmission Holdco, the transmission side of things, its return is 10.9%, which is in line with expectations. 2016 forecast is 10.2% because of the heavy investments being made there as well. 
So all in all, it's been a great quarter, I think. The fundamentals are showing through the company. And certainly, it's -- we have several opportunities and we'll continue to work on those. But it has been eventful, but our employees' discipline and execution toward a common strategic objective is becoming more evident every day. No doubt, our progress will continue toward being that next premium regulated utility and I can't help but say, because I just got back from the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, I'll end with a quote from a famous Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame inductee, and it was -- it says, ""You will always tell when the groove is working or not."" That was from 2004 inductee, Prince. At American Electric Power, I can tell you the groove is working. So Brian, pick it up."

Turning to Slide 5. Operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.02 per share or $501 million compared to $625 million or $1.28 per share in 2015. At the highest level, the decline in earnings this year was driven by unfavorable weather conditions and the expected decline in earnings in the Generation & Marketing segment due to the reduction in Ohio capacity revenues. These unfavorable drivers were partially offset by rate changes, growth in normalized margins in our regulated businesses and higher earnings in our AEP Transmission Holdco segment. 
With that as an overview, let's look at the drivers by segment. 
Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.57 per share, down $0.04 with the single largest driver being winter weather, which negatively impacted earnings for this segment by $0.11 per share. As Nick said earlier, 2016 was the sixth warmest winter and 2015 was the second coldest winter for AEP in the last 30 years. Other major drivers for this segment include the reversal of a 2015 regulatory provision in APCo produced a drag on earnings of $0.03 per share. Off-system sales declined by $0.02 per share due to substantially lower power prices. Higher O&M expense unfavorably affected this segment by $0.04 per share, primarily driven by higher employee-related cost. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were rate changes, which were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.06 per share to the quarter and higher margins on retail sales, mostly related to the timing and mix of sales which added $0.04 per share. We will look in detail at load and the economy in the next 3 slides. 
Finally, this quarter was bolstered by $0.04 per share from the lower effective income tax rate due to prior year tax adjustments and tax versus booked timing differences accounted for on a flow-through basis. 
The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.22 per share for the quarter, up $0.02 from last year. This major -- this segment's major drivers include rate changes, higher transmission revenues in the Texas companies and lower O&M expense, each of which added $0.01 per share for this segment. The O&M reduction was due in large part to a contribution to the Ohio growth fund made in 2015 that was not repeated this year. 
Partially offsetting these favorable items is a decline of $0.01 per share related to milder weather in Texas compared to last year. 
Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.09 per share for the quarter, an improvement of $0.02. Net plant less deferred taxes grew by approximately $910 million, an increase of 39% since last March. 
The Generation & Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.14 per share, down $0.24 from last year. Capacity revenues were lower by $0.12 per share due to plant retirements and the transition of Ohio standard service offer to full market pricing. Energy margins were lower by $0.07 per share due to power prices liquidating 32% lower than last year. While the trading and marketing organization performed well, it was not able to replicate last year's exceptional results and was off $0.03 per share. 
Corporate & Other was down $0.02 per share from last year, primarily the result of having no earnings from AEP River Operations due to its sale in late 2015. Despite mild weather, softness in residential sales and power prices, our performance for the quarter was solid. We have been planning for a couple of years to be ready for the capacity revenue challenges in 2016 and our actions and planning leave us well positioned to achieve our earnings targets for the year.
Now let's take a look at Slide 6 to review normalized load performance. Starting in the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales were essentially flat for the quarter. However, the other charts on this slide show that the growth in commercial and industrial sales is being offset by the decline in residential sales.
Normalized residential sales were down 1.6% for the quarter. Although we experienced modest growth in our residential customer accounts compared to last year, most of the customer account growth was concentrated in Texas where favorable demographic support new household formation. This was partially offset by fewer customers in our Eastern territory, specifically around the Appalachian coal basin. 
On the positive side, commercial sales grew by 0.7%. This growth was spread across most of our operating companies, which is consistent with the growth in the service sector employment that we experienced across AEP service territory. 
Finally, industrial sales grew by 0.9% this quarter. The majority of this growth came from the oil and gas sectors, which I will discuss in more detail later. The growth in these sectors helped offset the drag from the primary metals and mining sectors. The weak global demand, oversupply of Asian steel and strong dollar combined to create challenging markets for export manufacturers within our footprint. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to look at the most recent economic data for AEP service territory. Starting at the top with GDP, you see that the estimated 1.8% growth for AEP service area is now only 0.3% behind the U.S. For the first time since 2014, our Eastern territory is now growing faster than the U.S. This was not the case for our Western territory, where there's greater exposure to lower oil and gas prices. While the nation benefited from lower fuel prices, AEP's regional economy supporting these shale plays are experiencing the negative impact of lost jobs. 
The charts at the bottom showed that employment growth within AEP service area is holding steady but still lags behind the U.S. by 0.6%. It is no surprise that job growth in AEP's Eastern territory exceeds the Western service area by 0.5% given what we've just discussed. The sector showing the strongest job growth for the quarter include construction, leisure and hospitality and education and health services. These gains were somewhat offset by the decline in natural resources and mining jobs. Today, there are 16,000 fewer natural resources and mining employees working in our service territory than last year. Approximately 12,000 of those jobs were located in our Western footprint. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review our industrial sales trends by region. As we briefly mentioned earlier, we continue to see the strongest growth in our industrial sales to the oil and gas sectors. The chart in the upper left shows our industrial sales in shale counties were up over 9% versus last year. This is in spite of the fact that oil prices, rig counts and employment in the oil and gas extraction segment were down significantly from last year. 
The bottom left chart shows that growth in oil and gas sectors was spread across all major shale plays within AEP service territory, with the strongest growth coming from the Eagle Ford, Permian and Marcellus regions. 
The map on the right now includes our coal counties shown in blue. I want to highlight these counties since we are seeing some significant erosion in our industrial sales as well as customer counts in this area. In the upper left chart, our industrial sales in the coal counties were down over 17% this quarter. Low natural gas prices and environmental regulations, combined with the drop in metals production and corresponding demand for metallurgical coal have created a perfect storm for Appalachian coal producers. You are likely familiar with the number of bankruptcies and mine closures that have been announced over the past year, citing these exact reasons. 
Outside of our shale and coal counties, the rest of AEP's industrials were up nearly 1% for the quarter. Some examples of industries that are still seeing modest growth this year include transportation manufacturing and plastics and rubber manufacturing, both of which are tied to auto sales where production benefited from lower fuel prices. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital rose by 0.5% this quarter and remained healthy at 53.7%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 5.45x and 20%, respectively. 
Our qualified pension funding decreased 3% this quarter to 94%. Although plan assets increased by 1.2%, plan liabilities increased by 4.5% due to the discount rate coming in lower than the assumed rate of 4.3%. We plan on funding our pension with about $93 million in the second quarter, equal to the estimated service cost for the year. 
Our OPEB funding now stands at 104%. Plan assets decreased by 1% and plan liabilities increased 4% for the same reasons as the pension plan. The estimated O&M to service both plans this year is expected to be about $20 million. 
Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $3.2 billion and is supported by our 2 revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018. During the second quarter of this year, we plan to refinance these facilities with an anticipated tenor expected to extend in the June of 2021. Altogether, AEP's balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics are strong and will allow us to fund our Utility Operations, growth and dividends under all reasonably foreseeable conditions. 
And finally, so we can quickly get to your questions, let's turn to Slide 10. I want to reiterate that the first quarter's results were in line with our expectations. In spite of last night's late breaking news, we remain on track to earn within our previously announced operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share for 2016. As Nick said earlier, our previously announced strategic review of our competitive generation business will continue according to schedule and we will share the results of that process as soon as we can. We expect that to be in the third quarter. 
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

I'll just probably make a distinction because even before we started the PPA, I said the State of Ohio needed to decide. But I also said that the commission needs to decide. And because we were trying to do something within the purview of the existing legislation, and it had been left up to the deference of the commission to decide. In this case, we're not talking about the commission. Now obviously, we'd love for the commission to be part of that process. They need to be part of the process. But this is a legislative issue. And our concern is, and I think there has to be a broader concern by the State of Ohio, and that's represented by the legislature. What do we do to enable Ohio to take a firm hold of the capacity and energy situation within the state, the development of new resources, the jobs, taxes, and all those things that we talked about earlier. And I don't -- it's not like you're starting at ground zero to do this. I think the issues in Ohio are well-known from an energy policy perspective. Matter fact, we just got through with a review through the Ohio Business Roundtable. The Columbus Partnership has been involved. There is definitely already steps being taken. It's a question of okay, what steps? And there, you're talking about okay, is there a stopgap measure to basically allow the transfer of certain assets within the State of Ohio to AEP Ohio directly and avoid a -- any kind of affiliate transaction? Which probably is, I would say, is probably a better chance of accomplishing something like that than full reregulation. But I wouldn't take that off the table either. I mean, because I think there's broader issues that are involved here. Like for instance, if Ohio wants to move forward with renewables and renewable implementation and balance out the portfolio and focus on natural gas, those are clearly areas that can fall within some form of reregulation."

Not only operating companies but also on the competitor side with Purchase Power Arrangement. So those are opportunities that we can continue to develop in anticipation of cash proceeds coming in. But what I want to make sure of is that we're not going to just get a pile of cash and have it burn a hole in our pocket  and we wind up doing something stupid."

AEP had a strong second quarter with GAAP in operating earnings coming in at $1.2 per share  and $095 per share respectively. Bringing the year-to-date earnings to $2 04 per share on a GAAP basis and a $1.97 per share on an operating basis. This compares favorably to the second quarter 2015 GAAP in operating earnings of $0.88 per share. The 2016 year-to-date earnings compared unfavorably to 2015 primarily June by the significant energy and different experienced in the first quarter of 2015 versus first quarter 2016 as we reported last quarter. These results clearly, keep some pace to meet our operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share, which we are reaffirming. We are also reaffirming our 4% to 6% growth rate. So overall goes quarter for the disciplined and consistency there are investors can be expect from AEP. 
Our focus on the Utility Operations, transmission growth, expansion of our customer sales channels, process optimization and the disciplined deployment of capital and O&M expenses continues to drive positive results for our shareholders and the customers. While externally it may appear to be relatively calm quarter there has been substantial activity internally therefore the demonstrates the direction of AEP and strategy to the next premium regulated utility. 
We recently established a chief customer officer assumed by, our former AEP Texas President that provides focus on improving our customer experience. This organization redesign will focus on addressing the evolving between regulatory framework, emerging technologies that enhance the customer experience and deploying the analytics and technology into the future to address resource needs and to optimize smart grid applications. As we progress with the substantial build-out of transmission and distribution to accommodate large-scale optimization and renewal of the grid along with the development of additional sales channels that provide a growth, we are emerging as an energy company that provides solutions for our customers to both the classical regular did annual up to provides universal access and tailored solutions for customers.
AEP's culture is one-off collaboration and innovation and I have no doubt AEP when focused on investments in the largest transmission system in the U.S. and energy grid of tomorrow will continue to be want to be the next premium regulatory energy company. Also during the second quarter we continued our strategic review with the competitive generation. Keep in mind, we now have 2 branches of generation. The first of which we've called the non-PPA assets for better term, which essentially is the natural gas units and the coal station. The process for this tranche is going according to plan and continues beyond initial bids that we received in the second quarter with final bids due in August. I can say that the response has been robust and we are confident that the process will move toward the conclusion of the strategic review in the coming months.
We've also begun the planning for the disposition of any cash proceeds to ensure an earnings trajectory that replaces whilst earnings as quickly as possible. This could include some ramp-up capital spending in transmission and other actions that we've done previously and, because of immediate recognition off PTC benefits, one business we are currently wrapping up is our investment in long-term solar arrangements as well. 
The second tranche, the previously referred to PPA assets are in the initial phase are preparing the assets for process much like the non-PPA assets.
This process will occur in parallel with our focused efforts toward restructuring in Ohio. We will be discussing these issues and implications in more detail during the coming months, leading up to November EER. 
To follow-up on the Ohio restructuring discussion for those of you who don't know, several of our company sites have shown up in the latest One of those sites was our sitting in front of one Riverside corporate headquarters, the virtual reality of Pokémon next to our generator turbine in Ohio may be think that it may be good for a game, but if the generator was virtual, we might have a real problem on our hands and that is where Ohio is heading if it depends too much on federal markets that do not value long-term baseload generation.

same generation in the state and the customer's ability to choose generation suppliers. This overall process would allow AEP Ohio to move forward with the transition of generation resources and responsible way that would benefit the state of Ohio and AEP in its customers. The legislation would address any potential jurisdictional matters, while allowing the state to take control of itt's own resources as well as any transition envision another initiatives such as Clean Power Plan. 
In the absence of restructuring legislation, AEP will continue with the strategic process with the second tranche of generation. We continue to analyze the situation our service territory. Shell gas load is in recent month long mining while industrial load is dropped commercial and residential load increased from quarter-to-quarter but last several years have overall been mix bag in hard to read, much like the economy in general.  Brian, will address the root load related issues in more detail in a few minutes. 
Moving to the equalizer chart on Page 4 that shows our various operating areas. Our overall ROE continues to improve, as we mentioned last quarter, it's now at 9.8% versus 9.4% that we reported last quarter and still expected move towards our forecasted 10.1% overall ROE for 2016.  So all according to plan. So here is the story for each of the regulated business units. For Ohio Power, the ROE for AEP Ohio is at the end of the second quarter was 13.3%. We expect to be more favorable than the forecast of 11.9% at the end of the year. The improved ROE forecast is primarily due to AEP Ohio receiving regulatory order related to the recovery that allows us to recover deferred fuel costs with caring charges as approved by the commission ESP 1 case. 
And also $21 million increase in retail margin due to a regulatory reversal provision that occurred. And then favorable annual PJM transmission formula rate through So all of Ohio Power is doing very well at this point and then we continue to expect that. 
APCo, the increase in ROE primarily due to onetime recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia approved by Public Service Commission of West Virginia in June of 2016. The 2015 West Virginia base rate case included the way of billing of $25 million annual base rate increase to residential customers until July 2016.
As these revenues in the company's ROE is expected to trend nearly 2016 forecasted ROE. APCo does continue to monitor reductions in industrial and residential load, particular in the coal depressed areas of the state. We're watching that very closely. 
Kentucky Power, we are seeing the expected continue improvement at quarter-end, the commission authorized the $45 million rate increase effective July 2015, and this rate case will continue to improve the ROE in 2016. And also they are continuing to watch their economy as well. 
I&M achieved an ROE of 10.1%, I&M continues to benefit from reasonable regulatory frameworks in place for those major capital investments programs that we've had in the state generation such as Rockport, the solar projects, nuclear with the lifecycle management and transmission projects as well. So I&M is well-positioned for another positive year in 2016. PSO, it's ROE is generally aligned with expectations, Oklahoma's economy continues to experience a slowdown due in large part low oil process and reduced oil and gas activity in the state. In December 2015, the Oklahoma Corporation and Commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented an interim base rate increase of $75 million subject to refund in January of 2016. 
So a final commission order is expected on that in the fourth quarter. SWEPCO, 2016 revenues were challenged by the weakness in oil and natural gas process, some wholesale revenues rolling off for sale customers exercise options for cell generation market participation, but we filed an application that went into effect March 24, to recover our retrofit investments at Welsh and Flint Creek. And then in taxes, we filed transmission distribution writers as well in that state. 
So we continue to make a various filings in those states to improve the ROE. AEP Texas, the ongoing distribution capital investment, AEP Texas to serve higher levels of electric load and maintain the reliability of the grid had gradually lower the regulated ROE over time. 
The ROE should continued to improve and however, due to recently approved $36 million settlement that will go into effect September 1, 2016. And that's distribution cost recovery factor, for those of you don't know what is AEP Transmission Holdco the Transmission Holdco's return of 11.7% is outperforming the 2016 forecast of 10.2%. The increase in ROE is really focused on true up an annual true up that occurs in the transmission formula. So we expect that ROE to come down during the year, but still expect to be around 10.7% by year-end. 
So that non-measurable process that we are going to through there. So overall, 9.8% continues to track up upward and we are pleased with the progress that Abu operating companies have made. So overall, another great quarter for AEP. This quarter has been a continued approach by AEP and showed consistency discipline and institution to provide quality shareholder value. It's hard for anyone from outside AEP to see company see from inside, dedication, innovation of approximately 18,000 employees. So I'll just put it this way. I happen to play drums in a band in an event on last week where we backed up Marshall Tucker band, we played some blue some still in my mind so I'll stand up by just saying baby we were born to run.

Operating earnings for th",1657,"Thank you, and good money everyone. I'll take us through second quarter year-to-date financial results, provide our latest insight an economy and finish with a review of our assistant and liquidity position. 
Turning to Slide 5. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.95 per share or $466 million compared to $0.88 per share, $429 million in 2015. Overall the increase in earnings was driven by a rate changes, including the reversal regulatory provision and lower O&M in our regulated utilities and higher earnings in our AEP Transmission Holdco segment. Both of which were partially offset by the expected decline in the Generation & Marketing segment. 
Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.43 in the share our second quarter both 2016 and 2015. Lower O&M due to decreased playing outage expenses and recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers were offset by lower margins on retail sales and decreased off-system sales margin due to lower energy prices. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment are in $0.25 per share for the quarter up $0.09 from last year. This segments major variances included the reversal of the previous regulatory provision in Ohio adding $0.03 per share and higher margins on retail sales, which added $0.02 per share.
Other favorable drivers each adding a penny per share or rate changes, higher archive transmission revenue and lower O&M expense. Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.19 per share for the quarter and improvement of $0.06. The growth in earnings reflects our return on incremental investment and includes the impact of the annual true up the formula mechanism. That plan investment deferred taxes grew by approximately $840 million an increase of 32% since last June.
The generation in marketing segment produced our earnings of $0.09 per share down $0.07 last year. Capacity revenues were lower by $0.07 due to retirements and the transition of Ohio to full market pricing. Energy margins were lower by $0.03 per share due to power prices liquidating 18% lower than last year. 
On the positive side, the commercial organization in our competitive business performed well and wholesale trading and marketing was favorable by penny this quarter. Corporate & Other down opinion from last year due to higher O&M expense.
Let's turn to Slide 6, and I'll briefly highlight our year-to-date results. Operating results through June, operating earnings through June were $1.97 per share or $967 million compared to $2.15 per share or $1.1 billion in 2015. The details on the slide for those of you would like to, but overall the decrease in earning was driven by the expected decline in earnings Generation & Marketing segment, less favorable weather conditions in the first quarter, depressed power prices and disposition of our business last year.
These unfavorable drivers will partially offset by rate changes, the change in the effective tax rate, growth in normalize margin and increased earnings in our transmission businesses. 
Now let's take a look at Slide 7 to review normalized load performance. For both the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, the message is the same. Our normalized retail sales were down compared to last year, because the increase in residential and commercial sales was more than offset by the drop in industrial load. And the lower rate chart normalize retail sales were down 0.04% for the quarter and 0.03% year-to-date. For both periods, the strong sales performance in our Texas territory is being offset by weakness in the Appalachian and Kentucky regions, this illustrates the benefit of geography diversity. 
Normalized residential sales in the upper left, rebounded in the second quarter and are now essentially flat compared to last year. Through the first half of 2016, our residential sales customer counts and normalized usage were all essentially flat. In the upper right, commercial sales grew by 1% for the quarter and are up 0.08% year-to-date. This growth was spread across several of our operating companies. Although, the strongest growth occurred with the utility segment. This is consistent with some of the economic data I'll share with you on the next slide.
Finally, industrial sales drop by 4% this quarter and are down 1.6% through June. The sustained drop in energy prices, weak global demand and strong dollar have combined to form a challenging environment for manufacturers. 
For the quarter, industrial sales declined in 7 of our top 10 industry sectors. The 2 sector that grew in the second quarter were Pipeline Transportation and transportation equipment manufacturing. The Petroleum & Coal Products sector was flat for the quarter.  I'll provide additional color on our industrial sales later. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8, to look at the most recent economic data for AEP service territory. Starting at the top with GDP, the estimated 1.3% growth for AEP is only 0.03% behind the U.S. The upper right chart shows that our Eastern territory is not only growing faster than our Western territory, but is now exceeding the U.S. This is not the case for our Western territory, where there is greater exposure to lower oil and gas prices. Depressed energy prices have created a noticeable in our Western footprint, while the nation benefits from lower fuel prices, AEP's regional economy supporting these shale plays on experiencing the impact of jobs. 
The chart at the bottom -- the charts at the bottom showed that employment growth for AEP it's holding steady at 1.1% but still lags the U.S. by 0.06%. It is not surprising to see job growth in AEP's Eastern territory exceeding the West given what we just discussed. 
Earlier in the presentation, I mention that our commercial sales were the strongest in our utility segment, that matches they employment data for our service territory as well. Over two thirds of all jobs added in 2016, have been in Ohio and Texas. The sector showing the strongest job growth for the quarter include construction, leisure and hospitality and education and health services. These gains were somewhat offset by the decline in natural resources and mining jobs. Today, there are over 22,000 fewer employees in that sector than last year, and approximately 15,000 of those jobs were located in our Western footprint. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to review our industrial sales by trend, trends by region -- I'm sorry. Over the last several years, our industrial sales growth has largely been tight to the oil and gas activity around the major cell plays. Up until this quarter, sales to the oil and gas sectors have been fairly resilient despite low energy prices. The chart in the upper left shows that the is started to turn. AEP's the industrial sales initial County this quarter actually declined by, specifically the decline is largely coming from our upstream oil and gas extraction sector, which experienced a 6% decline for the quarter. 
The map on the right identifies our coal counties shown in blue. I want to highlight these counties since we continue to see significant erosion in our industrial sales as well as customer counts in this area. In the upper left charge, our industrial sales in the coal counties were down 14% for this quarter a mobile sales to the mining sector alone were down nearly 18%. 
Lower natural gas prices, environmental the regulations, lower demand from the utility sector and as demand globally for metallurgical coal has created bad situation for Appalachian coal producers. Outside of our shale and coal counties, the rest of AEP's industrial sales were down 3.3% for the quarter. 
Now let's move on to Slide 10 to review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our total debt to capital ratio up by during the quarter and remained healthy of 54%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and BAA one range at 5.6x and 20.2%, respectively. 
Our qualified pension funding remained unchanged for the quarter at 94%. Although plan assets increased during the quarter, so to plan liabilities due to discount rate coming in lower than assumed. During the month of June, we funded about $86 million to plan assets and amount equal to the estimated service cost for the year. 
Our funding now stands at 101%. Plan assets increased by but plan liabilities increased 3.1% due to drop in discount rates. The overall impact dropped our OPEB funding ratio by 2.9%. The estimated after-tax O&M expense for both plans this year is expected to be about $13 million.
Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $2.3 billion and is supported by our revolving credit facilities. During the second quarter, our treasury team worked with our banking partners to amend and extend our key credit facilities. We now have $3 billion facility that extends in the June of 2021, and the second $500 million facility that expires in June of 2018. This tiered structure allows maximum flexibility as we continue our strategic review of our competitive generation assets. 
Altogether, AEP's balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics are strong and will allow us to fund our utility Operations, growth and dividends under all reasonably foreseeable conditions.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 and ramp this up so we can get to your questions. We are pleased with our earnings results for the second quarter of this year. Gains, in our wires businesses, more than offset expected decreases in our competitive businesses due to lower energy prices and deregulation in Ohio. 
As we look towards the second half of 2016, we believe that our regulatory businesses will more than offset any challenges presented by our Generation & Marketing segment giving us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share.
Finally, as Nick mentioned earlier, the strategic review of our competitive generation remains on track and we hope to have news for you in that regard either later this quarter or early next quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

And when you think about the levels that we have around O&M, but also we have emerging -- emerging revenue size as well. I mean the transmission continues to pick up, there is no question we will have to continue to invest in the grid and in particular transmission as well. And then we also have other investments like solar and those kinds of relationships with customers that are improving earnings as well. So I think, when you look the 4% to 6%, we're still confident the 4% to 6%. And as we go through the year, we will certainly be able to fine tune that in more detail. But I guess, the overall message is we feel like we have the ability as we've done in the last 4 years to be able to compensate for any of these issues that occur in. And there is no question, I mean, any business, any business has to adjust based upon what the sales forecast looks like, but also look at the revenue side as well and ensure they were doing everything we can do there to do its work as well. So Greg, I know, there is a lot of concern out there about a load forecast going forward, if you trended out and of course, what we do generation. But at the end of the day, we are going to adjust to it. And I think we take very seriously the consistency that we've built and maintained over the last 4 years and we don't intend on giving that up."

And we are after doing that. We have, we just did a universal scale our utility scale project in Utah that hasn't been announced yet, we can't say who, but it's 20 megawatt project and then we also have several other small projects with municipalities and so forth in New York and other locations around the country and we've been doing that, and we know how to do that. What we -- what we really are focused on those, is ensuring that we do have a place to deploy our capital in the fashion and that cans certainly augment our business, but our main focus is to be focused on infrastructure what it means. And it goes beyond, it goes to relationships with customers not sort of alluded to that in my opening discussion. You have much broader relationships with some of these customers that goes beyond solar, it goes to obviously renewables but storage. We are very focused on storage aspects. We are an investor in green speed for example, integration of solar and wind but also energy storage. And you see those applications coming together from a distribution standpoint and that's going to be a huge benefit to us. So obviously, we want to be in solar business but we also want to be in the wind power, but it's really addressing tailored needs of customers focused around that customer experience.

We are going to focus on that between now and November. And in November, is when the Ohio legislation comes back into place, and keep in mind I'm talking about first, the first tranche of assets, this is really regarding the second tranche, which is what formerly was the PPA asset. So the first tranche moving along. It's already the trains left the station and its moving forward. The second tranche, I'm saying from restructuring standpoint we are going to go through and how the legislation, have discussions with stakeholders, get the process implies in November when Ohio the legislator comes back into session, it will be a session. So we will have to make sure that we are focused on those legislators that are still be around in the future leaders of that organization. And then that way, we can hit the ground running with legislation that's already been large and discussed in the first quarter by the first of the year. So in the first quarter you're starter starting with new legislature. I think, we're going to know quickly people open to the possibility happening or not. And at that point in time, we've already started our secondary process that I talked about are on the PPA assets getting data room ready, all that kind of stuff. And we will make a determination where we think Ohio is going to go. Ohio many people didn't make the PPA would happen in Ohio, and it did happen. And I still think there is going to be some formal restructuring in Ohio, because there has to be. But the question becomes number one, our people receptive to number 2, is the timeframe appropriate for what we are trying to achieve, the driver here will be that secondary process and we will have to get some determination as to whether the open us and the collaboration the state of Ohio would work to get something done during the of fall that. So that's where we are at. When we think about that probably is seasonal process in the first quarter of next year that we will know whether Ohio is chance moving forward with that thing or not? So that will tell us what we need to know."

There's a lot of discussion about there's 3 or 4 natural gas units getting inadequate of what what the Ohio load actually is.

Thank you once again joining AEP's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. AEP had a strong second quarter with GAAP and operating earnings coming in at $1.02 per share and $0.95 per share, respectively, bringing the year-to-date earnings to $2.04 per share on a GAAP basis and a $1.97 per share on an operating basis. This compares favorably to the second quarter 2015 GAAP and operating earnings of $0.88 per share. The 2016 year-to-date earnings compare unfavorably to 2015, primarily driven by the significant weather and energy market differences experienced in the first quarter of 2015 versus first quarter 2016, as we reported last quarter. These results clearly keep us on pace to meet our operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share, which we are reaffirming. We're also reaffirming our 4% to 6% growth rate. So overall, a steady-as-she-goes quarter with the discipline and consistency that our investors have come to expect from AEP. 
Our focus on the Utility Operations, transmission growth, expansion of our customer sales channels, process optimization and the disciplined deployment of capital and O&M expenses continues to drive positive results for our shareholders and customers. While externally it may appear to be a relatively calm quarter, there has been substantial activity internally that further demonstrates the direction of AEP and its strategy to be the next premium regulated utility. 
We recently established a Chief Customer Officer role assumed by Bruce Evans, our former AEP Texas President, that provides a focus on improving our customer experience. This organizational redesign will focus on addressing the evolving nexus that exists between the regulatory framework, emerging technologies that enhance the customer experience and deploying the analytics and technologies of the future to address resource needs and to optimize smart grid applications. As we progress with the substantial build-out of transmission and distribution to accommodate large-scale optimization and renewal of the grid, along with the development of additional sales channels that provide growth, we are emerging as an energy company that provides solutions for our customers through both the classical regulated envelope that provides universal access and tailored solutions for customers.
AEP's culture is one of openness, collaboration and innovation and I have no doubt AEP, when focused on investments in the largest transmission system in the U.S. and the energy grid of tomorrow, will continue to evolve to be the next premium regulated energy company. Also, during the second quarter, we continued our strategic review of competitive generation. Keep in mind, we now have 2 tranches of generation, the first of which we've called the non-PPA assets, for lack of a better term, which essentially is the natural gas units and the Gavin coal station. The process for this tranche is going according to plan and continues beyond initial bids that we received in the second quarter, with final bids due in August. I can say that the response has been robust, and we are confident that the process will move toward the conclusion of the strategic review in the coming months.
We have also begun the planning for the disposition of any cash proceeds to ensure an earnings trajectory that replaces lost earnings as quickly as possible. This could include some ramp-up capital spending in transmission and other actions that we've done previously. And because of immediate recognition of PTC benefits, one business we are currently wrapping up, is our investment in long-term solar arrangements as well. 
The second tranche, the previously referred to PPA assets, are in the initial phase of preparing the assets for a process much like the non-PPA assets. This process will occur in parallel with our focused efforts toward restructuring in Ohio. We will be discussing these issues and implications in more detail during the coming months, leading up to November EEI. 
To follow up on the Ohio restructuring discussion, for those of you who don't know, several of our company sites have shown up in the latest craze of Pokémon GO. One of those sites was our turbine sitting in front of our 1 Riverside Plaza corporate headquarters. The virtual reality of a Pokémon next to our generator turbine in Ohio made me think that it may be good for a game, but if the generator was virtual, we might have a real problem on our hands, and that is where Ohio is heading if it depends too much on federal markets that do not value long-term baseload generation. 
I advice you to look at PJM website, pjm.com, to review the generation mix at the peak the warm days we have been experiencing lately. The vast majority of capacity at the time of the peak is delivered by coal and nuclear resources that are not valued properly in the market construct.
Moreover, these markets do not take into account other issues that are of state concern such as placement of generation, valves portfolios, jobs, taxes and other state issues. These markets, including PJM, need to be improved to adjust to these realities. With FERC's order essentially taking the Ohio PPA proposal approved by the Ohio Commission off the table, which are discussed last quarter, AEP is addressing the situation by pursuing restructuring in Ohio. Note this is restructuring, not reregulation. Our proposal for legislation is now being discussed with various stakeholders and involves the ability to transfer existing generation and invest in new generation such as natural gas and renewables by AEP Ohio. The proposed legislation strikes a balance between our ability to invest and maintain generation in the state and the customer's ability to choose generation suppliers. This overall process would allow AEP Ohio to move forward with the transition of generation resources in a responsible way that would benefit the state of Ohio and AEP and its customers. The legislation would address any potential FERC jurisdictional matters, while allowing the state to take control of its own resources as well as any transition-envisioned other initiatives such as the Clean Power Plan. 
In the absence of restructuring legislation, AEP will continue with the strategic process with the second tranche of generation. We continue to analyze the load situation of our service territory. Shale gas load is tailed off in recent months along, of course, with mining. While industrial load is dropped, commercial and residential load increased so from quarter-to-quarter. The last several years have overall been a mixed bag and hard to read, much like the economy in general. Brian will address the load-related issues in more detail in a few minutes. 
Moving to the equalizer chart on Page 4 that shows our various operating areas. Our overall ROE continues to improve. As we mentioned last quarter, it's now at 9.8% versus 9.4% that we recorded last quarter and is still expected move toward our forecasted 10.1% overall ROE for 2016, so all is moving according to plan.
So here's the story for each of the regulated business units. For Ohio Power, the ROE for AEP Ohio is -- at the end of the second quarter was 13.3%. We expect it to be more favorable than the forecast of 11.9% at the end of the year. The improved ROE forecast is primarily due to AEP Ohio receiving regulatory order related to the PIRR, the phase-in recovery rider, that allows us to recover accumulated deferred fuel costs with curing charges, as approved by the commission in the ESP 1 case and also a $21 million increase in retail margin due to a regulatory reversal provision that occurred. And then a favorable annual PJM transmission formula rate true-up. So Ohio Power is doing very well at this point and we continue to expect that. 
APCo, the increase in ROE is primarily due to a onetime recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia as approved by the Public Service Commission of West Virginia in June of 2016. The 2015 West Virginia base rate case included a delayed billing of $25 million of the annual base rate increase to residential customers until July 2016. As these revenues phase in, the company's ROE is expected to trend near the 2016 forecasted ROE. APCo does continue to monitor reductions in industrial and residential load, particularly in the coal-depressed areas of the state. We're watching that very closely. 
Kentucky Power, we're seeing the expected continual improvement. At quarter-end, the commission authorized the $45 million rate increase effective July 2015, and this rate case will continue to improve the ROE in 2016. And also, they are continuing to watch their economy as well. 
I&M achieved an ROE of 10.1%. I&M continues to benefit from reasonable regulatory frameworks in place for those major capital investment programs that we've had in the state generation such as Rockport, the solar projects, nuclear with the life cycle management at Cook and transmission projects as well. So I&M is well positioned for another positive year in 2016.
PSO, its ROE is generally aligned with expectations. Oklahoma's economy continues to experience a slowdown, due in large part to low oil prices and reduced oil and gas activity in the state. In December 2015, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented an interim base rate increase of $75 million, subject to refund in January of 2016. So a final commission order is expected on that in the fourth quarter.
SWEPCO, 2016 revenues are challenged by the weakness in oil and natural gas process. Some wholesale revenue is rolling off as wholesale customers exercise options for self-generation or market participation, but we filed an application in Arkansas that went into effect March 24 to recover our retrofit investments at Welsh and Flint Creek. And then, in Texas, we filed transmission-distribution riders as well in that state. So we continue to make various filings in those states to improve the ROE.
AEP Texas, the ongoing distribution capital investment in AEP Texas to serve higher levels of electric load and maintain the reliability of the grid had gradually lowered the regulated ROE over time. The ROE should continue to improve, however, due to the recently approved $56 million DCRF settlement that will go into effect September 1, 2016. And that's that distribution cost recovery factor, for those of you that don't know what DCRF is.
AEP Transmission Holdco, the Transmission Holdco's return of 11.7% is outperforming the 2016 forecast of 10.2%. The increase in ROE is really focused on a true-up, an annual true-up, that occurs in the transmission formula. So we expect that ROE to come down during the year but still expect it to be around 10.7% by year-end. So that's a known and measurable process that we're going to through there.
So overall, 9.8% continues to track upward and we're pleased with the progress that the operating companies have made. So overall, another great quarter for AEP. This quarter has been a continued approach by AEP to ensure consistency, discipline and execution to provide quality shareholder value. It's hard for anyone from outside of AEP to see the company I see from inside with the dedication and innovation of our approximately 18,000 employees, so I'll just put it this way. I happen to play drums in a band at an event in Cleveland last week, where we backed up the Marshall Tucker Band. We played some Bruce Springsteen and it's still on my mind, so I'll just end up by just saying, baby, we were born to run. Brian?"

Turning to Slide 5. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.95 per share or $466 million compared to $0.88 per share or $429 million in 2015. Overall, the increase in earnings was driven by rate changes, including the reversal of the regulatory provision and lower O&M in our regulated utilities and higher earnings in our AEP Transmission Holdco segment, both of which were partially offset by the expected decline in the Generation & Marketing segment. 
Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.43 per share in the second quarter for both 2016 and 2015. Lower O&M due to decreased planned outage expenses and recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers were offset by lower margins on retail sales and decreased off-system sales margins due to lower energy prices. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.25 per share for the quarter, up $0.09 from last year. This segment's major variances included the reversal of the previous regulatory provision in Ohio, adding $0.03 per share, and higher margins on retail sales, which added $0.02 per share.
Other favorable drivers, each adding $0.01 per share, were rate changes, higher ERCOT transmission revenue and lower O&M expense. Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.19 per share for the quarter, an improvement of $0.06. The growth in earnings reflects our return on incremental investment and includes the impact of the annual true-up for the formula rate mechanism. Net plant investment, less deferred taxes, grew by approximately $840 million, an increase of 32% since last June.
The Generation & Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.09 per share, down $0.07 from last year. Capacity revenues were lower by $0.07 due to plant retirements and the transition of Ohio to full market pricing. Energy margins were lower by $0.03 per share due to power prices liquidating 18% lower than last year. On the positive side, the commercial organization in our competitive business performed well, and wholesale trading and marketing was favorable by $0.01 this quarter. Corporate and other was down $0.01 from last year due to higher O&M expense.
Let's turn to Slide 6, and I'll briefly highlight our year-to-date results. Operating results through June -- operating earnings through June were $1.97 per share or $967 million compared to $2.15 per share or $1.1 billion in 2015. The detail is on the slide for those of you who would like it, but overall, the decrease in earnings was driven by the expected decline in earnings in the Generation & Marketing segment, less favorable weather conditions in the first quarter, depressed power prices and the disposition of our River business last year. These unfavorable drivers were partially offset by rate changes, the change in the effective tax rate, growth in normalized margin and increased earnings in our transmission businesses. 
Now let's take a look at Slide 7 to review normalized load performance. For both the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, the message is the same. Our normalized retail sales were down compared to last year because the increase in residential and commercial sales was more than offset by the drop in industrial load. In the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales were down 0.4% for the quarter and 0.3% year-to-date. For both periods, the strong sales performance in our Texas territory is being offset by weakness in the Appalachian and Kentucky regions. This illustrates the benefit of geographic diversity. 
Normalized residential sales in the upper left rebounded in the second quarter and are now essentially flat compared to last year. Through the first half of 2016, our residential sales, customer counts and normalized usage were all essentially flat. In the upper right, commercial sales grew by 1% for the quarter and are up 0.8% year-to-date. This growth was spread across several of our operating companies, although the strongest growth occurred with the T&D utility segment. This is consistent with some of the economic data I will share with you on the next slide.
Finally, industrial sales dropped by 4% this quarter and are down 1.6% through June. The sustained drop in energy prices, weak global demand and strong dollar have combined to form a challenging environment for manufacturers. For the quarter, industrial sales declined in 7 of our top 10 industrial sectors. The 2 sectors that grew in the second quarter were Pipeline Transportation and Transportation Equipment Manufacturing. The Petroleum & Coal Products sector was flat for the quarter. I'll provide additional color on our industrial sales later. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to look at the most recent economic data for AEP service territory. Starting at the top with GDP, the estimated 1.3% growth for AEP is only 0.3% behind U.S. The upper right chart shows that our Eastern territory is not only growing faster than our Western territory but is now exceeding the U.S. This is not the case for our Western territory, where there's greater exposure to lower oil and gas prices. Depressed energy prices have created a noticeable slowing in our Western footprint. While the nation benefits from lower fuel prices, AEP's regional economies supporting these shale plays are experiencing the impact of lost jobs. The chart at the bottom -- the charts at the bottom showed that employment growth for AEP is holding steady at 1.1% but still lags the U.S. by 0.6%. It is not surprising to see job growth in AEP's Eastern territory exceeding the West, given what we just discussed. 
Earlier in the presentation, I mentioned that our commercial sales were the strongest in our T&D utility segment. That matches the employment data for our service territory as well. Over 2/3 of all jobs added in 2016 have been in Ohio and Texas. The sector showing the strongest job growth for the quarter include construction, leisure and hospitality and education and health services. These gains were somewhat offset by the decline in natural resources and mining jobs. Today, there are over 22,000 fewer employees in that sector than last year and approximately 15,000 of those jobs were located in our Western footprint. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to review our industrial sales by trend -- trends by region, I'm sorry. Over the last several years, our industrial sales growth has largely been tied to the oil and gas activity around the major shale plays. Up until this quarter, sales to the oil and gas sectors have been fairly resilient despite low energy prices. The chart in the upper left shows that the tide has started to turn. AEP's industrial sales in shale counties this quarter actually declined by 0.3%. Specifically, the decline is largely coming from our upstream oil and gas extraction sector, which experienced a 6% decline for the quarter. 
The map on the right identifies our coal counties shown in blue. I want to highlight these counties since we continue to see significant erosion in our industrial sales as well as customer counts in this area. In the upper left chart, our industrial sales in the coal counties were down 14% for this quarter, while sales to the mining sector alone were down nearly 18%. Low natural gas prices, environmental regulations, lower demand from the utility sector and less demand globally for metallurgical coal have created a bad situation for Appalachian coal producers. Outside of our shale and coal counties, the rest of AEP's industrial sales were down 3.3% for the quarter. 
Now let's move on to Slide 10 to review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our total debt-to-capital ratio crept up by 0.3% during the quarter and remained healthy at 54%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 5.6x and 20.2%, respectively. 
Our qualified pension funding remained unchanged for the quarter at 94%. Although plan assets increased during the quarter, so did plan liabilities due to the discount rate coming in lower than assumed. During the month of June, we funded about $86 million to plan assets, an amount equal to the estimated service cost for the year. Our OPEB funding now stands at 101%. Plan assets increased by 0.2% but plan liabilities increased 3.1% due to dropping discount rates. The overall impact dropped our OPEB funding ratio by 2.9%. The estimated after-tax O&M expense for both plans this year is expected to be about $13 million.
Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $2.3 billion and is supported by our 2 revolving credit facilities. During the second quarter, our treasury team worked with our banking partners to amend and extend our key credit facilities. We now have a $3 billion facility that extends into June of 2021 and a second $500 million facility that expires in June of 2018. This tiered structure allows for maximum flexibility as we continue our strategic review of our competitive generation assets. Altogether, AEP's balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics are strong and will allow us to fund our utility operations, growth and dividends under all reasonably foreseeable conditions.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 and wrap this up so we can get to your questions. We are pleased with our earnings results for the second quarter of this year. Gains in our wires businesses more than offset expected decreases in our competitive businesses due to lower energy prices and deregulation in Ohio. As we look towards the second half of 2016, we believe that our regulated businesses will more than offset any challenges presented by our Generation & Marketing segment, giving us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share. Finally, as Nick mentioned earlier, the strategic review of our competitive generation remains on track, and we hope to have news for you in that regard either later this quarter or early next quarter. 
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

I think the other thing the last 4 years has shown us, we have to adjust to it. And when you think about the levers that we have around O&M, but also we have emerging revenue size as well. I mean, the transmission continues to pick up. There's no question we'll have to continue to invest in the grid and a particular transmission as well. And then we also have other investments like solar and those kinds of relationships with customers that are improving earnings as well. So I think when you look the 4% to 6%, we're still confident in the 4% to 6%. And as we go through the year, we'll certainly be able to fine-tune that in more detail. But I guess, the overall message is we feel like we have the ability, as we've done in the last 4 years, to be able to compensate for any of these issues that occur. And there's no question, I mean, any business has to adjust based upon what the sales forecast looks like, but also they got to look at the revenue side as well to ensure that we're doing everything we can do there to do its work as well. So Greg, I know there's a lot of concern out there about load forecast going forward, if you trend it out and, of course, what we do with the unregulated generation. But at the end of the day, we're going to adjust to it.

We have a huge transmission system so we have a lot of ability to invest. But you're always looking for sources of new revenue and we see it as another tool in the toolbox to be able to focus on enhancements of earnings because, obviously, there's near-term benefits of protection tax credits, and we're out there doing that. We have -- we just did a universal scale or utility scale project in Utah that hasn't been announced yet. We can't say who, but it's 20 megawatt project. And then we also have several other small projects with municipalities and so forth in New York and other locations around the country. I mean, we've been doing that and we know how to do that. What we really are focused on though is ensuring that we do have a place to deploy our capital in the widest fashion and that can certainly augment our business, but our main focus is to focus on the infrastructure and what it means. And it goes beyond solar. It goes to relationships with customers and I sort of alluded to that in my opening discussion. You have much broader relationships with some of these customers that goes beyond solar. It goes to, obviously, renewables with storage. We're very focused on storage aspects. We are an investor in Greensmith, for example, an integration of solar and wind but also an energy storage. And you see those applications coming together from a distribution standpoint and that's going to be a huge benefit to us. So obviously, we want to be in a solar business but we also want to be in the wind power, but it's really addressing tailored needs of customers, focused around that customer experience. And so -- and actually, fashion is coming to past but we'll probably be getting larger at it but we'll be good at it. We'll be focused on, ultimately, those customer experience side of things."

solar projects and what count as regulated generation. We performed extremely well in doing that business. Regardless of whether we should be in it or not, that's another question. But when we do it, it's very disciplined, it's very structured and it's very focused on what we're trying to achieve. So you're exactly right. I mean, for us, I mean, if you look at the use of proceeds, if we have cash proceeds coming in from a transaction, then obviously one of the issues that talked about earlier was purchase -- repurchase of stock. But obviously, if you can invest in a long-term solar project and take the PTCs upfront, that's also a great measure for investment as opposed to buying back stock. So there's a lot of things that are on the table that we're preparing as we work through the process of that disposition of cash, for example. So I think to be the energy company of the future, you've got to be involved with all these facets of the business and understand the facets of the business, but you got to be very disciplined in your approach. And we just have a, I would say -- I wouldn't say a different view in terms of whether all these resources, there should be balance that our resources will agree on that, I think the issue is we're very focused on the wires piece of it and how it interacts with the customer. And in the future, you're going to see a lot of these distributed solutions that are driven by the customer interaction at the distribution level, and we're going to be there to do it."

We have the framework of legislation that we're addressing with stakeholders now. And that's whether it's legislators, whether it's others that are important to the discussion process, other participants in the markets, those kinds of things, we're going to focus on that between now and November. And then November is when the Ohio legislation comes back into place. And keep in mind, I'm talking about the first tranche of assets. This is really regarding the second tranche, which is what formerly was the PPA asset. So the first tranche, that's moving along. It's already the trains left the station and it's moving forward. The second tranche, I'm saying from the restructuring standpoint, we're going to go through and have the legislation, have discussions with stakeholders, get that process in place in November when Ohio -- the legislature comes back into session. It will be a lame-duck session. So we'll to make sure that we are focused on those legislators that will still be around and the future leaders of that organization. And then, that way, we can hit the ground running with legislation that's already been, by and large, embedded and discussed in the first quarter by the first of the year. So in the first quarter, you're starting with the new legislature. I think we're going to know pretty quickly whether people are open to the possibility of this kind of thing happening or not. And at that point in time, we've already started our secondary process that I talked about around the PPA assets, getting the data room ready, all that kind of stuff. And we'll make a determination of where we think Ohio is going to go. Ohio, many people didn't think the PPA would happen in Ohio and it did happen. And I still think there's going to be some form of restructuring in Ohio because there has to be. And -- but the question becomes, number one, are people receptive to it? Number 2, is the time frame appropriate for what we're trying to achieve? Because the driver here will be that secondary process and we'll have to get some determination as to whether the openness and the collaboration of the state of Ohio would work to get something done during the pendency of all that. So that's where we are at. So when we think about that, you're probably thinking the decisional process in the first quarter of next year, that we'll know whether Ohio, if there's a chance of moving forward with that thing or not. And so that will tell us what we need to know."

There's a lot of discussion about there's 3 or 4 natural gas units getting built. Well, that's woefully inadequate of what the Ohio load actually is. And so there is a capacity deficiency in Ohio. And if Ohio wants to take advantage of additional natural gas build-out, the additional structural -- additions such as pipeline infrastructure, electric transmission infrastructure, the economic development follow-on to all of that, there's no reason for Ohio to give that up.

AEP had a strong second quarter with GAAP and operating earnings coming in at $1.02 per share and $0.95 per share, respectively, bringing",1908,"Okay. Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone. Thank you once again joining AEP's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. AEP had a strong second quarter with GAAP and operating earnings coming in at $1.02 per share and $0.95 per share, respectively, bringing the year-to-date earnings to $2.04 per share on a GAAP basis and a $1.97 per share on an operating basis. This compares favorably to the second quarter 2015 GAAP and operating earnings of $0.88 per share. The 2016 year-to-date earnings compare unfavorably to 2015, primarily driven by the significant weather and energy market differences experienced in the first quarter of 2015 versus first quarter 2016, as we reported last quarter. These results clearly keep us on pace to meet our operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share, which we are reaffirming. We're also reaffirming our 4% to 6% growth rate. So overall, a steady-as-she-goes quarter with the discipline and consistency that our investors have come to expect from AEP. 
Our focus on the Utility Operations, transmission growth, expansion of our customer sales channels, process optimization and the disciplined deployment of capital and O&M expenses continues to drive positive results for our shareholders and customers. While externally it may appear to be a relatively calm quarter, there has been substantial activity internally that further demonstrates the direction of AEP and its strategy to be the next premium regulated utility. 
We recently established a Chief Customer Officer role assumed by Bruce Evans, our former AEP Texas President, that provides a focus on improving our customer experience. This organizational redesign will focus on addressing the evolving nexus that exists between the regulatory framework, emerging technologies that enhance the customer experience and deploying the analytics and technologies of the future to address resource needs and to optimize smart grid applications. As we progress with the substantial build-out of transmission and distribution to accommodate large-scale optimization and renewal of the grid, along with the development of additional sales channels that provide growth, we are emerging as an energy company that provides solutions for our customers through both the classical regulated envelope that provides universal access and tailored solutions for customers.
AEP's culture is one of openness, collaboration and innovation and I have no doubt AEP, when focused on investments in the largest transmission system in the U.S. and the energy grid of tomorrow, will continue to evolve to be the next premium regulated energy company. Also, during the second quarter, we continued our strategic review of the competitive generation. Keep in mind, we now have 2 tranches of generation, the first of which we've called the non-PPA assets, for lack of a better term, which essentially is the natural gas units and the Gavin coal station. The process for this tranche is going according to plan and continues beyond initial bids that were received in the second quarter, with final bids due in August. I can say that the response has been robust, and we are confident that the process will move toward the conclusion of the strategic review in the coming months.
We have also begun the planning for the disposition of any cash proceeds to ensure an earnings trajectory that replaces lost earnings as quickly as possible. This could include some ramp-up capital spending in transmission and other actions that we've done previously. And because of immediate recognition of PTC benefits, one business we are currently wrapping up, is our investment in long-term solar arrangements as well. 
The second tranche, the previously referred to PPA assets, are in the initial phase of preparing the assets for a process much like the non-PPA assets. This process will occur in parallel with our focused efforts toward restructuring in Ohio. We will be discussing these issues and implications in more detail during the coming months, leading up to November EEI. 
To follow up on the Ohio restructuring discussion, for those of you who don't know, several of our company sites have shown up in the latest craze of Pokémon GO. One of those sites was our turbine sitting in front of our 1 Riverside Plaza corporate headquarters. The virtual reality of a Pokémon next to our generator turbine in Ohio made me think that it may be good for a game, but if the generator was virtual, we might have a real problem on our hands, and that is where Ohio is heading if it depends too much on federal markets that do not value long-term baseload generation. 
I advice you to look at the PJM website, pjm.com, to review the generation mix at the peak during the warm days we have been experiencing lately. The vast majority of capacity at the time of the peak is delivered by coal and nuclear resources that are not valued properly in the market construct.
Moreover, these markets do not take into account other issues that are of state concern such as placement of generation, valves portfolios, jobs, taxes and other state issues. These markets, including PJM, need to be improved to adjust to these realities. With FERC's order essentially taking the Ohio PPA proposal approved by the Ohio Commission off the table, which are discussed last quarter, AEP is addressing the situation by pursuing restructuring in Ohio. Note this is restructuring, not reregulation. Our proposal for legislation is now being discussed with various stakeholders and involves the ability to transfer existing generation and invest in new generation such as natural gas and renewables by AEP Ohio. The proposed legislation strikes a balance between our ability to invest and maintain generation in the state and the customer's ability to choose generation suppliers. This overall process would allow AEP Ohio to move forward with the transition of generation resources in a responsible way that would benefit the state of Ohio and AEP and its customers. The legislation would address any potential FERC jurisdictional matters, while allowing the state to take control of its own resources as well as any transition-envisioned other initiatives such as the Clean Power Plan. 
In the absence of restructuring legislation, AEP will continue with the strategic process with the second tranche of generation. We continue to analyze the load situation of our service territory. Shale gas load has tailed off in recent months along, of course, with mining. While industrial load is dropped, commercial and residential load increased so from quarter-to-quarter, the last several years have overall been a mixed bag and hard to read, much like the economy in general. Brian will address the load-related issues in more detail in a few minutes. 
Moving to the equalizer chart on Page 4 that shows our various operating areas. Our overall ROE continues to improve. As we mentioned last quarter, it's now at 9.8% versus 9.4% that we recorded last quarter and is still expected move toward our forecasted 10.1% overall ROE for 2016, so all is moving according to plan.
So here's the story for each of the regulated business units. For Ohio Power, the ROE for AEP Ohio is -- at the end of the second quarter was 13.3%. We expect it to be more favorable than the forecast of 11.9% at the end of the year. The improved ROE forecast is primarily due to AEP Ohio receiving regulatory order related to the PIRR, the phase-in recovery rider, that allows us to recover accumulated deferred fuel costs with curing charges, as approved by the commission in the ESP 1 case and also a $21 million increase in retail margin due to a regulatory reversal provision that occurred. And then a favorable annual PJM transmission formula rate true-up. So Ohio Power is doing very well at this point and we continue to expect that. 
APCo, the increase in ROE is primarily due to a onetime recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia as approved by the Public Service Commission of West Virginia in June of 2016. The 2015 West Virginia base rate case included delayed billing of $25 million of the annual base rate increase to residential customers until July 2016. As these revenues phase in, the company's ROE is expected to trend near the 2016 forecasted ROE. APCo does continue to monitor reductions in industrial and residential load, particularly in the coal-depressed areas of the state. We're watching that very closely. 
Kentucky Power, we're seeing the expected continual improvement. At quarter-end, the commission authorized the $45 million rate increase effective July 2015, and this rate case will continue to improve the ROE in 2016. And also, they are continuing to watch their economy as well. 
I&M achieved an ROE of 10.1%. I&M continues to benefit from reasonable regulatory frameworks in place for those major capital investment programs that we've had in the state generation such as Rockport, the solar projects, nuclear with the life cycle management at Cook and transmission projects as well. So I&M is well positioned for another positive year in 2016.
PSO, its ROE is generally aligned with expectations. Oklahoma's economy continues to experience a slowdown, due in large part to low oil prices and reduced oil and gas activity in the state. In December 2015, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented an interim base rate increase of $75 million, subject to refund in January of 2016. So a final commission order is expected on that in the fourth quarter.
SWEPCO, 2016 revenues are challenged by the weakness in oil and natural gas process. Some wholesale revenue is rolling off as wholesale customers exercise options for self-generation or market participation, but we filed an application in Arkansas that went into effect March 24 to recover our retrofit investments at Welsh and Flint Creek. And then, in Texas, we filed transmission-distribution riders as well in that state. So we continue to make various filings in those states to improve the ROE.
AEP Texas, the ongoing distribution capital investment at AEP Texas to serve higher levels of electric load and maintain the reliability of the grid had gradually lowered the regulated ROE over time. The ROE should continue to improve, however, due to the recently approved $56 million DCRF settlement that will go into effect September 1, 2016. And that's that distribution cost recovery factor, for those of you that don't know what DCRF is.
AEP Transmission Holdco, the Transmission Holdco's return of 11.7% is outperforming the 2016 forecast of 10.2%. The increase in ROE is really focused on a true-up, an annual true-up, that occurs in the transmission formula. So we expect that ROE to come down during the year but still expect it to be around 10.7% by year-end. So that's a known and measurable process that we're going to through there.
So overall, 9.8% continues to track upward and we're pleased with the progress that the operating companies have made. So overall, another great quarter for AEP. This quarter has been a continued approach by AEP to ensure consistency, discipline and execution to provide quality shareholder value. It's hard for anyone from outside of AEP to see the company I see from inside with the dedication and innovation of our approximately 18,000 employees, so I'll just put it this way. I happen ed to play drums in a band at an event in Cleveland last week, where we backed up the Marshall Tucker Band. We played some Bruce Springsteen and it's still on my mind, so I'll just end up by just saying, baby, we were born to run. Brian?"

Turning to Slide 5. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.95 per share or $466 million compared to $0.88 per share or $429 million in 2015. Overall, the increase in earnings was driven by rate changes, including the reversal of the regulatory provision and lower O&M in our regulated utilities and higher earnings in our AEP Transmission Holdco segment, both of which were partially offset by the expected decline in the Generation & Marketing segment. 
Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.43 per share in the second quarter for both 2016 and 2015. Lower O&M due to decreased planned outage expenses and recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers were offset by lower margins on retail sales and decreased off-system sales margins due to lower energy prices. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.25 per share for the quarter, up $0.09 from last year. This segment's major variances included the reversal of the previous regulatory provision in Ohio, adding $0.03 per share, and higher margins on retail sales, which added $0.02 per share.
Other favorable drivers, each adding $0.01 per share, were rate changes, higher ERCOT transmission revenue and lower O&M expense. Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.19 per share for the quarter, an improvement of $0.06. The growth in earnings reflects our return on incremental investment and includes the impact of the annual true-up for the formula rate mechanism. Net plant investment, less deferred taxes, grew by approximately $840 million, an increase of 32% since last June.
The Generation & Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.09 per share, down $0.07 from last year. Capacity revenues were lower by $0.07 due to plant retirements and the transition of Ohio to full market pricing. Energy margins were lower by $0.03 per share due to power prices liquidating 18% lower than last year. On the positive side, the commercial organization in our competitive business performed well, and wholesale trading and marketing was favorable by $0.01 this quarter. Corporate and other was down $0.01 from last year due to higher O&M expense.
Let's turn to Slide 6, and I'll briefly highlight our year-to-date results. Operating results through June -- operating earnings through June were $1.97 per share or $967 million compared to $2.15 per share or $1.1 billion in 2015. The detail is on the slide for those of you who would like it, but overall, the decrease in earnings was driven by the expected decline in earnings in the Generation & Marketing segment, less favorable weather conditions in the first quarter, depressed power prices and the disposition of our River business last year. These unfavorable drivers were partially offset by rate changes, the change in the effective tax rate, growth in normalized margin and increased earnings in our transmission businesses. 
Now let's take a look at Slide 7 to review normalized load performance. For both the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, the message is the same. Our normalized retail sales were down compared to last year because the increase in residential and commercial sales was more than offset by the drop in industrial load. In the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales were down 0.4% for the quarter and 0.3% year-to-date. For both periods, the strong sales performance in our Texas territory is being offset by weakness in the Appalachian and Kentucky regions. This illustrates the benefit of geographic diversity. 
Normalized residential sales in the upper left rebounded in the second quarter and are now essentially flat compared to last year. Through the first half of 2016, our residential sales, customer counts and normalized usage were all essentially flat. In the upper right, commercial sales grew by 1% for the quarter and are up 0.8% year-to-date. This growth was spread across several of our operating companies, although the strongest growth occurred with the T&D utility segment. This is consistent with some of the economic data I will share with you on the next slide.
Finally, industrial sales dropped by 4% this quarter and are down 1.6% through June. The sustained drop in energy prices, weak global demand and strong dollar have combined to form a challenging environment for manufacturers. For the quarter, industrial sales declined in 7 of our top 10 industrial sectors. The 2 sectors that grew in the second quarter were Pipeline Transportation and Transportation Equipment Manufacturing. The Petroleum & Coal Products sector was flat for the quarter. I'll provide additional color on our industrial sales later. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to look at the most recent economic data for AEP service territory. Starting at the top with GDP, the estimated 1.3% growth for AEP is only 0.3% behind U.S. The upper right chart shows that our Eastern territory is not only growing faster than our Western territory but is now exceeding the U.S. This is not the case for our Western territory, where there's greater exposure to lower oil and gas prices. Depressed energy prices have created a noticeable slowing in our Western footprint. While the nation benefits from lower fuel prices, AEP's regional economies supporting these shale plays are experiencing the impact of lost jobs. The chart at the bottom -- the charts at the bottom showed that employment growth for AEP is holding steady at 1.1% but still lags the U.S. by 0.6%. It is not surprising to see job growth in AEP's Eastern territory exceeding the West, given what we just discussed. 
Earlier in the presentation, I mentioned that our commercial sales were the strongest in our T&D utility segment. That matches the employment data for our service territory as well. Over 2/3 of all jobs added in 2016 have been in Ohio and Texas. The sector showing the strongest job growth for the quarter include construction, leisure and hospitality and education and health services. These gains were somewhat offset by the decline in natural resources and mining jobs. Today, there are over 22,000 fewer employees in that sector than last year and approximately 15,000 of those jobs were located in our Western footprint. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to review our industrial sales by trend -- trends by region, I'm sorry. Over the last several years, our industrial sales growth has largely been tied to the oil and gas activity around the major shale plays. Up until this quarter, sales to the oil and gas sectors have been fairly resilient despite low energy prices. The chart in the upper left shows that the tide has started to turn. AEP's industrial sales in shale counties this quarter actually declined by 0.3%. Specifically, the decline is largely coming from our upstream oil and gas extraction sector, which experienced a 6% decline for the quarter. 
The map on the right identifies our coal counties shown in blue. I want to highlight these counties since we continue to see significant erosion in our industrial sales as well as customer counts in this area. In the upper left chart, our industrial sales in the coal counties were down 14% for this quarter, while sales to the mining sector alone were down nearly 18%. Low natural gas prices, environmental regulations, lower demand from the utility sector and less demand globally for metallurgical coal have created a bad situation for Appalachian coal producers. Outside of our shale and coal counties, the rest of AEP's industrial sales were down 3.3% for the quarter. 
Now let's move on to Slide 10 to review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our total debt-to-capital ratio crept up by 0.3% during the quarter and remains healthy at 54%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 5.6x and 20.2%, respectively. 
Our qualified pension funding remained unchanged for the quarter at 94%. Although plan assets increased during the quarter, so did plan liabilities due to the discount rate coming in lower than assumed. During the month of June, we funded about $86 million to plan assets, an amount equal to the estimated service cost for the year. Our OPEB funding now stands at 101%. Plan assets increased by 0.2% but plan liabilities increased 3.1% due to dropping discount rates. The overall impact dropped our OPEB funding ratio by 2.9%. The estimated after-tax O&M expense for both plans this year is expected to be about $13 million.
Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $2.3 billion and is supported by our 2 revolving credit facilities. During the second quarter, our treasury team worked with our banking partners to amend and extend our key credit facilities. We now have a $3 billion facility that extends into June of 2021 and a second $500 million facility that expires in June of 2018. This tiered structure allows for maximum flexibility as we continue our strategic review of our competitive generation assets. Altogether, AEP's balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics are strong and will allow us to fund our utility operations, growth and dividends under all reasonably foreseeable conditions.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 and wrap this up so we can get to your questions. We are pleased with our earnings results for the second quarter of this year. Gains in our wires businesses more than offset expected decreases in our competitive businesses due to lower energy prices and deregulation in Ohio. As we look towards the second half of 2016, we believe that our regulated businesses will more than offset any challenges presented by our Generation & Marketing segment, giving us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share. Finally, as Nick mentioned earlier, the strategic review of our competitive generation remains on track, and we hope to have news for you in that regard either later this quarter or early next quarter. 
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

I think the other thing the last 4 years has shown us, we have to adjust to it. And when you think about the levers that we have around O&M, but also we have emerging revenue size as well. I mean, the transmission continues to pick up. There's no question we'll have to continue to invest in the grid and a particular transmission as well. And then we also have other investments like solar and those kinds of relationships with customers that are improving earnings as well. So I think when you look the 4% to 6%, we're still confident in the 4% to 6%. And as we go through the year, we'll certainly be able to fine-tune that in more detail. But I guess, the overall message is we feel like we have the ability, as we've done in the last 4 years, to be able to compensate for any of these issues that occur. And there's no question, I mean, any business has to adjust based upon what the sales forecast looks like, but also they got to look at the revenue side as well to ensure that we're doing everything we can do there to do its work as well. So Greg, I know there's a lot of concern out there about load forecast going forward, if you trend it out and, of course, what we do with the unregulated generation. But at the end of the day, we're going to adjust to it.

We have a huge transmission system so we have a lot of ability to invest. But you're always looking for sources of new revenue and we see it as another tool in the toolbox to be able to focus on enhancements of earnings because, obviously, there's near-term benefits of protection tax credits, and we're out there doing that. We have -- we just did a universal scale or utility scale project in Utah that hasn't been announced yet. We can't say who, but it's 20 megawatt project. And then we also have several other small projects with municipalities and so forth in New York and other locations around the country. I mean, we've been doing that and we know how to do that. What we really are focused on though is ensuring that we do have a place to deploy our capital in the widest fashion and that can certainly augment our business, but our main focus is to focus on the infrastructure and what it means. And it goes beyond solar. It goes to relationships with customers and I sort of alluded to that in my opening discussion. You have much broader relationships with some of these customers that goes beyond solar. It goes to, obviously, renewables with storage. We're very focused on storage aspects. We are an investor in Greensmith, for example, an integration of solar and wind but also in energy storage. And you see those applications coming together from a distribution standpoint and that's going to be a huge benefit to us. So obviously, we want to be in a solar business but we also want to be in the wind power, but it's really addressing tailored needs of customers, focused around that customer experience.

But when we do it, it's very disciplined, it's very structured and it's very focused on what we're trying to achieve. So you're exactly right. I mean, for us, I mean, if you look at the use of proceeds, if we have cash proceeds coming in from a transaction, then obviously one of the issues that talked about earlier was purchase -- repurchase of stock. But obviously, if you can invest in a long-term solar project and take the PTCs upfront, that's also a great measure for investment as opposed to buying back stock. So there's a lot of things that are on the table that we're preparing as we work through the process of that disposition of cash, for example. So I think to be the energy company of the future, you've got to be involved with all these facets of the business and understand the facets of the business, but you got to be very disciplined in your approach. And we just have a, I would say -- I wouldn't say a different view in terms of whether all these resources, there should be balance that our resources will agree on that, I think the issue is we're very focused on the wires piece of it and how it interacts with the customer.

We have the framework of legislation that we're addressing with stakeholders now. And that's whether it's legislators, whether it's others that are important to the discussion process, other participants in the markets, those kinds of things, we're going to focus on that between now and November. And then November is when the Ohio legislation comes back into place. And keep in mind, I'm talking about the first tranche of assets. This is really regarding the second tranche, which is what formerly was the PPA asset. So the first tranche, that's moving along. It's already -- the trains left the station and it's moving forward. The second tranche, I'm saying from the restructuring standpoint, we're going to go through and have the legislation, have discussions with stakeholders, get that process in place in November when Ohio -- the legislature comes back into session. It will be a lame-duck session. So we'll to make sure that we are focused on those legislators that will still be around and the future leaders of that organization. And then, that way, we can hit the ground running with legislation that's already been, by and large, vetted and discussed in the first quarter by the first of the year. So in the first quarter, you're starting with the new legislature. I think we're going to know pretty quickly whether people are open to the possibility of this kind of thing happening or not. And at that point in time, we've already started our secondary process that I talked about around the PPA assets, getting the data room ready, all that kind of stuff. And we'll make a determination of where we think Ohio is going to go. Ohio, many people didn't think the PPA would happen in Ohio and it did happen. And I still think there's going to be some form of restructuring in Ohio because there has to be. And -- but the question becomes, number one, are people receptive to it? Number 2, is the time frame appropriate for what we're trying to achieve? Because the driver here will be that secondary process and we'll have to get some determination as to whether the openness and the collaboration of the state of Ohio would work to get something done during the pendency of all that. So that's where we are at. So when we think about that, you're probably thinking the decisional process in the first quarter of next year, that we'll know whether Ohio, if there's a chance of moving forward with that thing or not. And so that will tell us what we need to know."

So -- and the legislation includes the ability for AEP Ohio to not only transfer those assets that were under the PPA to AEP Ohio, but also to be able to have a mechanism for investment in future generation, and obviously, the state of Ohio is very interested in getting natural gas going. There's a lot of discussion about there's 3 or 4 natural gas units getting built. Well, that's woefully inadequate of what the Ohio load actually is. And so there is a capacity deficiency in Ohio. And if Ohio wants to take advantage of additional natural gas build-out, the additional structural -- additions such as pipeline infrastructure, electric transmission infrastructure, the economic development follow-on to all of that, there's no reason for Ohio to give that up. And so there has to be a mechanism to do that and that's what we're after."

I mean, Hillary Clinton wants to just, I guess, do several billion focused on rehabilitating from a jobs perspective and that kind of thing. That seems like a longer-term issue. And of course, Donald Trump is on the other side, saying he's put the miners back to work. And I don't know exactly how that works, but will -- but either way, I think both of them, they really ought to be focused on reinvigorating that part of the country since it's been so devastated by what's happened recently."

Thank you once again joining AEP's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. AEP had a strong second quarter with GAAP and operating earnings coming in at $1.02 per share and $0.95 per share, respectively, bringing the year-to-date earnings to $2.04 per share on a GAAP basis and a $1.97 per share on an operating basis. This compares favorably to the second quarter 2015 GAAP and operating earnings of $0.88 per share. The 2016 year-to-date earnings compare unfavorably to 2015, primarily driven by the significant weather and energy market differences experienced in the first quarter of 2015 versus first quarter 2016, as we reported last quarter. These results clearly keep us on pace to meet our operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share, which we are reaffirming. We're also reaffirming our 4% to 6% growth rate. So overall, a steady-as-she-goes quarter with the discipline and consistency that our investors have come to expect from AEP. 
Our focus on the Utility Operations, transmission growth, expansion of our customer sales channels, process optimization and the disciplined deployment of capital and O&M expenses continues to drive positive results for our shareholders and customers. While externally it may appear to be a relatively calm quarter, there has been substantial activity internally that further demonstrates the direction of AEP and its strategy to be the next premium regulated utility. 
We recently established a Chief Customer Officer role assumed by Bruce Evans, our former AEP Texas President, that provides a focus on improving our customer experience. This organizational redesign will focus on addressing the evolving nexus that exists between the regulatory framework, emerging technologies that enhance the customer experience and deploying the analytics and technologies of the future to address resource needs and to optimize smart grid applications. As we progress with the substantial build-out of transmission and distribution to accommodate large-scale optimization and renewal of the grid, along with the development of additional sales channels that provide growth, we are emerging as an energy company that provides solutions for our customers through both the classical regulated envelope that provides universal access and tailored solutions for customers.
AEP's culture is one of openness, collaboration and innovation and I have no doubt AEP, when focused on investments in the largest transmission system in the U.S. and the energy grid of tomorrow, will continue to evolve to be the next premium regulated energy company. Also, during the second quarter, we continued our strategic review of the competitive generation. Keep in mind, we now have 2 tranches of generation, the first of which we've called the non-PPA assets, for lack of a better term, which essentially is the natural gas units and the Gavin coal station. The process for this tranche is going according to plan and continues beyond initial bids that were received in the second quarter, with final bids due in August. I can say that the response has been robust, and we are confident that the process will move toward the conclusion of the strategic review in the coming months.
We have also begun the planning for the disposition of any cash proceeds to ensure an earnings trajectory that replaces lost earnings as quickly as possible. This could include some ramp-up capital spending in transmission and other actions that we've done previously. And because of immediate recognition of PTC benefits, one business we are currently wrapping up, is our investment in long-term solar arrangements as well. 
The second tranche, the previously referred to PPA assets, are in the initial phase of preparing the assets for a process much like the non-PPA assets. This process will occur in parallel with our focused efforts toward restructuring in Ohio. We will be discussing these issues and implications in more detail during the coming months, leading up to November EEI. 
To follow up on the Ohio restructuring discussion, for those of you who don't know, several of our company sites have shown up in the latest craze of Pokémon GO. One of those sites was our turbine sitting in front of our 1 Riverside Plaza corporate headquarters. The virtual reality of a Pokémon next to our generator turbine in Ohio made me think that it may be good for a game, but if the generator was virtual, we might have a real problem on our hands, and that is where Ohio is heading if it depends too much on federal markets that do not value long-term baseload generation. 
I advice you to look at the PJM website, pjm.com, to review the generation mix at the peak during the warm days we have been experiencing lately. The vast majority of capacity at the time of the peak is delivered by coal and nuclear resources that are not valued properly in the market construct.
Moreover, these markets do not take into account other issues that are of state concern such as placement of generation, valves portfolios, jobs, taxes and other state issues. These markets, including PJM, need to be improved to adjust to these realities. With FERC's order essentially taking the Ohio PPA proposal approved by the Ohio Commission off the table, which are discussed last quarter, AEP is addressing the situation by pursuing restructuring in Ohio. Note this is restructuring, not reregulation. Our proposal for legislation is now being discussed with various stakeholders and involves the ability to transfer existing generation and invest in new generation such as natural gas and renewables by AEP Ohio. The proposed legislation strikes a balance between our ability to invest and maintain generation in the state and the customer's ability to choose generation suppliers. This overall process would allow AEP Ohio to move forward with the transition of generation resources in a responsible way that would benefit the state of Ohio and AEP and its customers. The legislation would address any potential FERC jurisdictional matters, while allowing the state to take control of its own resources as well as any transition-envisioned other initiatives such as the Clean Power Plan. 
In the absence of restructuring legislation, AEP will continue with the strategic process with the second tranche of generation. We continue to analyze the load situation of our service territory. Shale gas load has tailed off in recent months along, of course, with mining. While industrial load is dropped, commercial and residential load increased so from quarter-to-quarter, the last several years have overall been a mixed bag and hard to read, much like the economy in general. Brian will address the load-related issues in more detail in a few minutes. 
Moving to the equalizer chart on Page 4 that shows our various operating areas. Our overall ROE continues to improve. As we mentioned last quarter, it's now at 9.8% versus 9.4% that we recorded last quarter and is still expected move toward our forecasted 10.1% overall ROE for 2016, so all is moving according to plan.
So here's the story for each of the regulated business units. For Ohio Power, the ROE for AEP Ohio is -- at the end of the second quarter was 13.3%. We expect it to be more favorable than the forecast of 11.9% at the end of the year. The improved ROE forecast is primarily due to AEP Ohio receiving regulatory order related to the PIRR, the phase-in recovery rider, that allows us to recover accumulated deferred fuel costs with curing charges, as approved by the commission in the ESP 1 case and also a $21 million increase in retail margin due to a regulatory reversal provision that occurred. And then a favorable annual PJM transmission formula rate true-up. So Ohio Power is doing very well at this point and we continue to expect that. 
APCo, the increase in ROE is primarily due to a onetime recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia as approved by the Public Service Commission of West Virginia in June of 2016. The 2015 West Virginia base rate case included delayed billing of $25 million of the annual base rate increase to residential customers until July 2016. As these revenues phase in, the company's ROE is expected to trend near the 2016 forecasted ROE. APCo does continue to monitor reductions in industrial and residential load, particularly in the coal-depressed areas of the state. We're watching that very closely. 
Kentucky Power, we're seeing the expected continual improvement. At quarter-end, the commission authorized the $45 million rate increase effective July 2015, and this rate case will continue to improve the ROE in 2016. And also, they are continuing to watch their economy as well. 
I&M achieved an ROE of 10.1%. I&M continues to benefit from reasonable regulatory frameworks in place for those major capital investment programs that we've had in the state generation such as Rockport, the solar projects, nuclear with the life cycle management at Cook and transmission projects as well. So I&M is well positioned for another positive year in 2016.
PSO, its ROE is generally aligned with expectations. Oklahoma's economy continues to experience a slowdown, due in large part to low oil prices and reduced oil and gas activity in the state. In December 2015, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented an interim base rate increase of $75 million, subject to refund in January of 2016. So a final commission order is expected on that in the fourth quarter.
SWEPCO, 2016 revenues are challenged by the weakness in oil and natural gas process. Some wholesale revenue is rolling off as wholesale customers exercise options for self-generation or market participation, but we filed an application in Arkansas that went into effect March 24 to recover our retrofit investments at Welsh and Flint Creek. And then, in Texas, we filed transmission-distribution riders as well in that state. So we continue to make various filings in those states to improve the ROE.
AEP Texas, the ongoing distribution capital investment at AEP Texas to serve higher levels of electric load and maintain the reliability of the grid had gradually lowered the regulated ROE over time. The ROE should continue to improve, however, due to the recently approved $56 million DCRF settlement that will go into effect September 1, 2016. And that's that distribution cost recovery factor, for those of you that don't know what DCRF is.
AEP Transmission Holdco, the Transmission Holdco's return of 11.7% is outperforming the 2016 forecast of 10.2%. The increase in ROE is really focused on a true-up, an annual true-up, that occurs in the transmission formula. So we expect that ROE to come down during the year but still expect it to be around 10.7% by year-end. So that's a known and measurable process that we're going to through there.
So overall, 9.8% continues to track upward and we're pleased with the progress that the operating companies have made. So overall, another great quarter for AEP. This quarter has been a continued approach by AEP to ensure consistency, discipline and execution to provide quality shareholder value. It's hard for anyone from outside of AEP to see the company I see from inside with the dedication and innovation of our approximately 18,000 employees, so I'll just put it this way. I happen ed to play drums in a band at an event in Cleveland last week, where we backed up the Marshall Tucker Band. We played some Bruce Springsteen and it's still on my mind, so I'll just end up by just saying, baby, we were born to run. Brian?"

Turning to Slide 5. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.95 per share or $466 million compared to $0.88 per share or $429 million in 2015. Overall, the increase in earnings was driven by rate changes, including the reversal of the regulatory provision and lower O&M in our regulated utilities and higher earnings in our AEP Transmission Holdco segment, both of which were partially offset by the expected decline in the Generation & Marketing segment. 
Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.43 per share in the second quarter for both 2016 and 2015. Lower O&M due to decreased planned outage expenses and recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers were offset by lower margins on retail sales and decreased off-system sales margins due to lower energy prices. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.25 per share for the quarter, up $0.09 from last year. This segment's major variances included the reversal of the previous regulatory provision in Ohio, adding $0.03 per share, and higher margins on retail sales, which added $0.02 per share.
Other favorable drivers, each adding $0.01 per share, were rate changes, higher ERCOT transmission revenue and lower O&M expense. Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.19 per share for the quarter, an improvement of $0.06. The growth in earnings reflects our return on incremental investment and includes the impact of the annual true-up for the formula rate mechanism. Net plant investment, less deferred taxes, grew by approximately $840 million, an increase of 32% since last June.
The Generation & Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.09 per share, down $0.07 from last year. Capacity revenues were lower by $0.07 due to plant retirements and the transition of Ohio to full market pricing. Energy margins were lower by $0.03 per share due to power prices liquidating 18% lower than last year. On the positive side, the commercial organization in our competitive business performed well, and wholesale trading and marketing was favorable by $0.01 this quarter. Corporate and other was down $0.01 from last year due to higher O&M expense.
Let's turn to Slide 6, and I'll briefly highlight our year-to-date results. Operating results through June -- operating earnings through June were $1.97 per share or $967 million compared to $2.15 per share or $1.1 billion in 2015. The detail is on the slide for those of you who would like it, but overall, the decrease in earnings was driven by the expected decline in earnings in the Generation & Marketing segment, less favorable weather conditions in the first quarter, depressed power prices and the disposition of our River business last year. These unfavorable drivers were partially offset by rate changes, the change in the effective tax rate, growth in normalized margin and increased earnings in our transmission businesses. 
Now let's take a look at Slide 7 to review normalized load performance. For both the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, the message is the same. Our normalized retail sales were down compared to last year because the increase in residential and commercial sales was more than offset by the drop in industrial load. In the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales were down 0.4% for the quarter and 0.3% year-to-date. For both periods, the strong sales performance in our Texas territory is being offset by weakness in the Appalachian and Kentucky regions. This illustrates the benefit of geographic diversity. 
Normalized residential sales in the upper left rebounded in the second quarter and are now essentially flat compared to last year. Through the first half of 2016, our residential sales, customer counts and normalized usage were all essentially flat. In the upper right, commercial sales grew by 1% for the quarter and are up 0.8% year-to-date. This growth was spread across several of our operating companies, although the strongest growth occurred with the T&D utility segment. This is consistent with some of the economic data I will share with you on the next slide.
Finally, industrial sales dropped by 4% this quarter and are down 1.6% through June. The sustained drop in energy prices, weak global demand and strong dollar have combined to form a challenging environment for manufacturers. For the quarter, industrial sales declined in 7 of our top 10 industrial sectors. The 2 sectors that grew in the second quarter were Pipeline Transportation and Transportation Equipment Manufacturing. The Petroleum & Coal Products sector was flat for the quarter. I'll provide additional color on our industrial sales later. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to look at the most recent economic data for AEP service territory. Starting at the top with GDP, the estimated 1.3% growth for AEP is only 0.3% behind U.S. The upper right chart shows that our Eastern territory is not only growing faster than our Western territory but is now exceeding the U.S. This is not the case for our Western territory, where there's greater exposure to lower oil and gas prices. Depressed energy prices have created a noticeable slowing in our Western footprint. While the nation benefits from lower fuel prices, AEP's regional economies supporting these shale plays are experiencing the impact of lost jobs. The chart at the bottom -- the charts at the bottom showed that employment growth for AEP is holding steady at 1.1% but still lags the U.S. by 0.6%. It is not surprising to see job growth in AEP's Eastern territory exceeding the West, given what we just discussed. 
Earlier in the presentation, I mentioned that our commercial sales were the strongest in our T&D utility segment. That matches the employment data for our service territory as well. Over 2/3 of all jobs added in 2016 have been in Ohio and Texas. The sector showing the strongest job growth for the quarter include construction, leisure and hospitality and education and health services. These gains were somewhat offset by the decline in natural resources and mining jobs. Today, there are over 22,000 fewer employees in that sector than last year and approximately 15,000 of those jobs were located in our Western footprint. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to review our industrial sales by trend -- trends by region, I'm sorry. Over the last several years, our industrial sales growth has largely been tied to the oil and gas activity around the major shale plays. Up until this quarter, sales to the oil and gas sectors have been fairly resilient despite low energy prices. The chart in the upper left shows that the tide has started to turn. AEP's industrial sales in shale counties this quarter actually declined by 0.3%. Specifically, the decline is largely coming from our upstream oil and gas extraction sector, which experienced a 6% decline for the quarter. 
The map on the right identifies our coal counties shown in blue. I want to highlight these counties since we continue to see significant erosion in our industrial sales as well as customer counts in this area. In the upper left chart, our industrial sales in the coal counties were down 14% for this quarter, while sales to the mining sector alone were down nearly 18%. Low natural gas prices, environmental regulations, lower demand from the utility sector and less demand globally for metallurgical coal have created a bad situation for Appalachian coal producers. Outside of our shale and coal counties, the rest of AEP's industrial sales were down 3.3% for the quarter. 
Now let's move on to Slide 10 to review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our total debt-to-capital ratio crept up by 0.3% during the quarter and remains healthy at 54%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 5.6x and 20.2%, respectively. 
Our qualified pension funding remained unchanged for the quarter at 94%. Although plan assets increased during the quarter, so did plan liabilities due to the discount rate coming in lower than assumed. During the month of June, we funded about $86 million to plan assets, an amount equal to the estimated service cost for the year. Our OPEB funding now stands at 101%. Plan assets increased by 0.2% but plan liabilities increased 3.1% due to dropping discount rates. The overall impact dropped our OPEB funding ratio by 2.9%. The estimated after-tax O&M expense for both plans this year is expected to be about $13 million.
Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $2.3 billion and is supported by our 2 revolving credit facilities. During the second quarter, our treasury team worked with our banking partners to amend and extend our key credit facilities. We now have a $3 billion facility that extends into June of 2021 and a second $500 million facility that expires in June of 2018. This tiered structure allows for maximum flexibility as we continue our strategic review of our competitive generation assets. Altogether, AEP's balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics are strong and will allow us to fund our utility operations, growth and dividends under all reasonably foreseeable conditions.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 and wrap this up so we can get to your questions. We are pleased with our earnings results for the second quarter of this year. Gains in our wires businesses more than offset expected decreases in our competitive businesses due to lower energy prices and deregulation in Ohio. As we look towards the second half of 2016, we believe that our regulated businesses will more than offset any challenges presented by our Generation & Marketing segment, giving us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share. Finally, as Nick mentioned earlier, the strategic review of our competitive generation remains on track, and we hope to have news for you in that regard either later this quarter or early next quarter. 
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

And I've heard some concern from investors just around the ability to meet the 4% to 6% earnings growth aspiration, if in fact the sales growth targets that you laid out when you laid that target out a year or so ago fail to materialize. Sort of you aspire to be a premium utility. The premium utilities don't blame changes in the outlook for not meeting their growth rates. So how do you aspire to sort of optimize your plan through time if industrial sales continue to be a drag on the plan?"

I think the other thing the last 4 years has shown us, we have to adjust to it. And when you think about the levers that we have around O&M, but also we have emerging revenue size as well. I mean, the transmission continues to pick up. There's no question we'll have to continue to invest in the grid and a particular transmission as well. And then we also have other investments like solar and those kinds of relationships with customers that are improving earnings as well. So I think when you look the 4% to 6%, we're still confident in the 4% to 6%. And as we go through the year, we'll certainly be able to fine-tune that in more detail. But I guess, the overall message is we feel like we have the ability, as we've done in the last 4 years, to be able to compensate for any of these issues that occur. And there's no question, I mean, any business has to adjust based upon what the sales forecast looks like, but also they got to look at the revenue side as well to ensure that we're doing everything we can do there to do its work as well. So Greg, I know there's a lot of concern out there about load forecast going forward, if you trend it out and, of course, what we do with the unregulated generation. But at the end of the day, we're going to adjust to it. And I think we take very seriously the consistency that we've built and maintained over the last 4 years and we don't intend on giving that up."

We have a huge transmission system so we have a lot of ability to invest. But you're always looking for sources of new revenue and we see it as another tool in the toolbox to be able to focus on enhancements of earnings because, obviously, there's near-term benefits of protection tax credits, and we're out there doing that. We have -- we just did a universal scale or utility scale project in Utah that hasn't been announced yet. We can't say who, but it's 20 megawatt project. And then we also have several other small projects with municipalities and so forth in New York and other locations around the country. I mean, we've been doing that and we know how to do that. What we really are focused on though is ensuring that we do have a place to deploy our capital in the widest fashion and that can certainly augment our business, but our main focus is to focus on the infrastructure and what it means. And it goes beyond solar. It goes to relationships with customers and I sort of alluded to that in my opening discussion. You have much broader relationships with some of these customers that goes beyond solar. It goes to, obviously, renewables with storage. We're very focused on storage aspects. We are an investor in Greensmith, for example, an integration of solar and wind but also in energy storage. And you see those applications coming together from a distribution standpoint and that's going to be a huge benefit to us. So obviously, we want to be in a solar business but we also want to be in the wind power, but it's really addressing tailored needs of customers, focused around that customer experience. And so -- and actually [ph], fashion [ph] is coming to pass but we'll probably be getting larger at it but we'll be good at it.

solar projects and what count as regulated generation. We performed extremely well in doing that business. Regardless of whether we should be in it or not, that's another question. But when we do it, it's very disciplined, it's very structured and it's very focused on what we're trying to achieve. So you're exactly right. I mean, for us, I mean, if you look at the use of proceeds, if we have cash proceeds coming in from a transaction, then obviously one of the issues that talked about earlier was purchase -- repurchase of stock. But obviously, if you can invest in a long-term solar project and take the PTCs upfront, that's also a great measure for investment as opposed to buying back stock. So there's a lot of things that are on the table that we're preparing as we work through the process of that disposition of cash, for example. So I think to be the energy company of the future, you've got to be involved with all these facets of the business and understand the facets of the business, but you got to be very disciplined in your approach. And we just have a, I would say -- I wouldn't say a different view in terms of whether all these resources, there should be balance that our resources will agree on that, I think the issue is we're very focused on the wires piece of it and how it interacts with the customer. And in the future, you're going to see a lot of these distributed solutions that are driven by the customer interaction at the distribution level, and we're going to be there to do it."

We have the framework of legislation that we're addressing with stakeholders now. And that's whether it's legislators, whether it's others that are important to the discussion process, other participants in the markets, those kinds of things, we're going to focus on that between now and November. And then November is when the Ohio legislation comes back into place. And keep in mind, I'm talking about the first tranche of assets. This is really regarding the second tranche, which is what formerly was the PPA asset. So the first tranche, that's moving along. It's already -- the trains left the station and it's moving forward. The second tranche, I'm saying from the restructuring standpoint, we're going to go through and have the legislation, have discussions with stakeholders, get that process in place in November when Ohio -- the legislature comes back into session. It will be a lame-duck session. So we'll to make sure that we are focused on those legislators that will still be around and the future leaders of that organization. And then, that way, we can hit the ground running with legislation that's already been, by and large, vetted and discussed in the first quarter by the first of the year. So in the first quarter, you're starting with the new legislature. I think we're going to know pretty quickly whether people are open to the possibility of this kind of thing happening or not. And at that point in time, we've already started our secondary process that I talked about around the PPA assets, getting the data room ready, all that kind of stuff. And we'll make a determination of where we think Ohio is going to go. Ohio, many people didn't think the PPA would happen in Ohio and it did happen. And I still think there's going to be some form of restructuring in Ohio because there has to be. And -- but the question becomes, number one, are people receptive to it? Number 2, is the time frame appropriate for what we're trying to achieve? Because the driver here will be that secondary process and we'll have to get some determination as to whether the openness and the collaboration of the state of Ohio would work to get something done during the pendency of all that. So that's where we are at. So when we think about that, you're probably thinking the decisional process in the first quarter of next year, that we'll know whether Ohio, if there's a chance of moving forward with that thing or not. And so that will tell us what we need to know."

There's a lot of discussion about there's 3 or 4 natural gas units getting built. Well, that's woefully inadequate of what the Ohio load actually is. And so there is a capacity deficiency in Ohio. And if Ohio wants to take advantage of additional natural gas build-out, the additional structural -- additions such as pipeline infrastructure, electric transmission infrastructure, the economic development follow-on to all of that, there's no reason for Ohio to give that up.

But we're going to be very disciplined in our approach. So we'll have more on that at EEI in November. And in addition to that, it's what we're doing with wind power or with energy storage as well. So -- and it could be even more defined energy service relationships as well."
