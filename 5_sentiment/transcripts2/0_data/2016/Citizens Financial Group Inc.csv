We completed our separation from RBS, becoming fully independent in late October. Our financial progress was in line with our expectations and guidance, in spite of a lower rate environment than anticipated. We achieved good loan deposit growth. We delivered positive operating leverage as savings from our efficiency initiatives kept expenses flat, notwithstanding significant investments in growth areas and in technology. We made strides in improving our product offerings and service quality and customer satisfactions trending upwards. 
We hired some great talent, including Eric and Don, right here with me, and we had some great new initiatives on the colleague fund like leadership development and career mapping.
Our risk management the properties continue to strengthen. We had a good result on CCAR and we're working hard to achieve the regulators tighten standards. And we continue to deliver enhanced technology capabilities, including a new backup data center, a new mortgage platform and expanded online and mobile capabilities. 
So all in all, solid performance on all dimensions, tracking well against our turnaround plan. We ended the year with a good fourth quarter and we feel good about our trajectory as we head into 2016. 
In Q4, we achieved good loan growth, as well as good NII and fee growth. We had expected to do even better, but the leverage credit markets became challenged during Q4, disrupting some of our capital markets pipeline. Hopefully that market will come back later in Q1. 
Expenses increased modestly, given technology-related spend and $6 million of cost largely associated with our growth and efficiency initiatives. Additionally, our credit provision grew by $15 million versus Q3 due to a Earlier, this year, we had seen back book improvements offset our reserve bill types of loan growth, but the back book is now so clean that we don't expect to see much of that continue. 
The balance sheet remains robust with excellent capital, liquidity and funding position, and strong ratios and metrics. 
For the full year, highlights include 13% adjusted EPS growth, positive operating leverage of 3%, 8% average loan growth and tangible book value per share growth of 5%. All of which I might add compared very favorably with peers. So now, I'd like to turn it over to Eric to give a little more color on the financials. Eric?"

Since Bruce said some of the highlights, let me direct you to a few pages in our slide deck for some color on Q4. 
On Slide 6, on an adjusted basis, we grew EPS by 5% in the quarter and 8% from the fourth quarter 2014. This included good operating leverage with revenues up 4% and expenses up at 2%. We improved the efficiency ratio, a 135 basis points year-over-year. 
On Slide 9, you could see our NIM with up 1 basis point in the quarter. We've done good job on growing our loan yields by adjusting our mix and being disciplined on pricing. We were also want to bring interest during deposit cost down by a 1 basis point this quarter. This is a real progress that we sharpen our offerings and pricing strategies. We did move the basis point given higher cash balances, tied to some of the long-term funding we raised in the quarter and the effects of those borrowing costs. 
Now on Slide 10. Noninterest income was up $9 million in the quarter with momentum in both consumer and commercial service charges and fees, driven by progress in our treasury solutions initiatives and some seasonality. Capital markets fees were lower-than-expected given the fixed income market disruption during the quarter. Securities gains picked up a bit to offset this, along with lower other income.  Recall that the third quarter included an $8 million brand sale gain. 
Now on Slide 11. As expected, our adjusted expenses were uplink in the quarter given an increase in technology expense. This was driven by the impact of our new backup data center coming on line along with the implementation of various technology and operation initiatives to improve offerings and drive future revenue growth. Outside of this growth, we held salaries and benefits cost flat. 
We achieved good loan growth in both consumer and commercial during the fourth quarter, which you can see on Pages 13 and 14. In consumer, growth was paid by continued expansion in mortgage and we also grew other retail categories, which includes our unsecured iPhone finance products, which generated $220 million in balances by year end. We continued to do a nice job of repointing our growth to higher return categories and the yield in consumer expanded accordingly 4 basis points in the quarter. 
We also saw nice growth in commercial while we grew commercial real estate loan as client dealership added earlier in the year after line. We also continued to execute well to corporate, franchise finance and corporate finance, which helped to mitigate some of the reductions in middle markets as borrowers continued to reduce line utilization. 
And in our balance sheet measures for the next couple of pages, we had a stronger-than-projected results, which you can see. 
Next, I'd like to take you to Slide 18. Here we show how Citizens' performed against guidance we gave back in January of 2015. Overall, the results were largely in line. Balance sheet growth targets were achieved. And while revenue growth was a bit lower-than-expected, largely due to tax income compression, we were able to offset that with additional efforts on expenses and favorable credits. 
On Slide 19, we show our progress against our strategic initiatives. Most of this is tracking well. But let me call out few other challenges and tell you where we're doing about them. In mortgage, our new head, Chris has a clear plan focus on regaining operational excellence following our introduction of a new origination platforms in Q4 last year. This further slowdown in our throughput and impacted net recruiting. We believe execution of this plan will position us for a stronger 2016 in hiring, retention and productivity. 
In Wealth, under the new leadership of John, we had a strong rebound in recruiting this quarter higher momentum as we enter 2016. We will continue to migrate for some more fee-based model. And in Asset Finance, we are positioned -- we are repositioning with the cross-sell product to our corporate customers in the wake of the loss of the RBS customer referrals. We saw some good progress in Q4. 
So all in all, we posted solid results again this quarter and for the year and continue to make good progress against our strategic initiatives, efficiency efforts and balance sheet repositioning. We are positioned well 2016. Back to you Bruce."

I'd like to elevate a little starting up Slide 20 to focus on our goals in turning around Citizens. We aspired to be a top-performing bank that delivers well to it's our stakeholders with serving customers well at the heart of our culture. 
On Slide 21, we showed some of the objectives we have within our plan. We made good progress in 2015, pretty much across the board, but there is still more to do. work in-progress. 
On Slide 22, you can see the financial targets that we laid out and the steady progress we are making in improving our results. So with that, as a backdrop, let's shift to our outlook on 2016, Slide 23. The markets are off to a rough start so far, but our planning assumption is still for steady U.S. GDP growth, solid loan demands and say, 1 to 2 more rate hikes coming in July and possibly December. 
To deliver strong performance, we have a few key objectives. We need to sustain robust loan growth and we need to keep NIM stable to trending up on an underlying basis. Rate hikes if they come will deliver additional benefit. We need to drive our fee initiatives and we need to deliver better fee growth. And we will need to keep finding ways to constrain expense growth given our plans and necessary investments in growth initiatives. If we do that well, we will again deliver meaningful positive operating leverage that will cover a normalization of provision and it will drive good growth in earnings. And of course, we want to continue to work down our capital surplus through loan growth, a higher dividend and share repurchases. So let's move on now to Slide 25 and our guidance. Eric, back to you."

Loan growth up 6% to 8%. NII growth up 7% to 10% with NIM improvement of 6 to 12 bps. The forward curve assumes rate hikes in July and December, which would help us get to the higher end of this range if they occur. 
Fee growth of 5% to 7%. Expense growth of 2.5% to 3.5% as our efficiency initiatives provided a greater investment spending in 2015 and they will in 2016. Provision normalization $375 million to $425 million range and CET1 ratio of 11.2% to 11.5%. 
As an overall comment, we expect that we could achieve a better level of revenue growth in 2016 than 2015 due to better performance on NIM and on fees. This will cover slightly higher expense growth and a modest bump from 4Q provisioning levels. We've laid out some useful details behind this growth rates on Slides 38 to 40 in the appendix 2. Please take a look at your leisure. 
On Slide 39, for example, we detailed the impact to NII of the December 2015 rate hike, which is worth $40 million to $50 million and the potential impact of 2 more in 2016 per the forward curve that we use at the time when we concluded our plan, which would be worth $30 million to $40 million. The bulk of its additional benefit is from the July 2016 hike as there is minimal impact from the December '16 hike in the forthcoming year. If we don't get in hike, we'll have pull harder on another NII levers and review expenses to find offsets. 
Also note that the current dividends on the stock decreases NII by $70 million and cost us $0.02 a share. We should also highlight that on Slide 41, there is an accounting change for reward that we make prospectively in 2016, which you will need to factor into your model. 
Our outlook for Q1 is shown on Slide 26, fairly straightforward overall becomes typical seasonal impact to consider. So let me turn it back to Bruce to wrap up."

So if the 1 in July happens, it's good for us. If it doesn't happen, we have a range there that we were counting on $30 million to $40 million benefit and it's -- that's a manageable number. I mean, that's -- we'll have to pull the leverage harder on either earning asset growth or you can see right there, our loan mix and yields or go back and look at expenses.

We continue to grow average assets -- earning assets and we hold NIM flattish up a bit as we like into some of that mixed shift as you see us doing in particular on consumer. And then what I'd say is, this past December hike, right? The 1 that was a short while ago, literally a months ago, actually gets us to boost of 3 to 5 basis points, why? Because LIBOR up, commercial loans has started to replace already and that gives us a little bit of tailwind. So we have confidence that while there is a good work to do, real work to do to continue on the kind of the pricing efforts, the mix and management efforts and the discipline, that the loan growth coupled with the NIM kind of we're on plus a little bit of tailwind from December hike, we should be able to continue to deliver good progress on NII growth in the coming year."

And what happens in Q4 is that we continue with a steady level of NPOs around 31 bps and then we started to build the provisions type of loan growth. And earlier in the year, we had back book cleanup, so we were effectively having credits come through to the offset that need to build the reserve and So it was less pronounced earlier in the year. We think that's pretty much run it's course. So now what you would expect to see very, very modest migration on the NCOs, but they need to keep building the reserve because we're going to have decent level of loan growth that we're calling out here. So that's really what's driving that overall range. We don't see anything dramatic shifting in the consumer portfolios, maybe a little higher because of our risk appetite is shifted in commercial, we're keeping on a eye as we said on energy, nothing is rattling up at this point and nothing really broadly across the portfolio is migrating. So again, we feel quite good about this range that we're offering. Don, don't talk about it?"

We are continuing to invest in a disciplined way on expenses on the headcount at the front end kind of front-end sales. And we continue to need to spend some on technology and you see that coming through. But at this past year, we had that real effect of top 1 program and part of that top 2 program coming through and I'd showed you on Page 40, a real sizable efficiency. I think as you look through next year, right, where we're starting to see that continuation of a top 2 savings, I think we map that out in quite a bit of detail this past summer and there is at least a percentage point of savings that will come from that incremental to 2015, and so we have high confidence there. I think beyond that, we are obviously disciplined as we go. So besides transforming operations and working on procurement, right, there is always the long list of opportunity that we focus on in the past, but that doesn't mean that, we don't go back and make sure that our headcount expansion is very disciplined on the front-end sales and continue to look at some of the middle office and back-office personnel. So we don't have to do that. And I think the easy part of that downdraft over and about top 2 is the revenues don't coming in certain areas mortgages for example, and then you're not paying out commission, so that naturally falls to the bottom line. Beyond that, we're not going to work hard and find areas to address and you can imagine, we don't put the budget this together without having a lift of 3, 4, 5, 6 items that we're ready to working on in and contingencies that we can call it we don't seek the economic activity that we would have anticipated."

So you're going to see that and that's a little bit of the difference. We do have a commitment to continue improvement. And so if there was a topline and there was a top 2, you can speculate that there might be a top 3 coming down the road, but that's the way we want to operate this place is to constantly look to make sure we're running the bank better and would maximizing the utility of every expense and investment dollar that we have. And the last thing I would say is that, if the rate hikes don't happen, it's not just an expense levers that we would look to, as I said, in answer to, there is also the other things back on Page 39 in terms of, can we drive a little more asset growth? Can we focus a little more on the mix to try to get the yield up? So I think there is some embedded offset potentially right in NII to compensate for that, but yes, you're right. Expenses would clearly if the stock market saying what they saying? We don't know it's not always a great leading indicator, but if revenue growth was little hard to come by, you certainly have to go back and look at your expenses again."

We will -- we expect to see some continued growth in mortgage. We have actually been in a position where our home equity portfolio has been going down a little bit in 2015, but we're reaching that point of that starting to moving back into the growth notes with a very, very strong application and closing quarter in the fourth quarter in the home equity.

In '16, we expect to see some of growth in the middle market. We did quite a lot of hiring across our Middle Market key last year and take a little, while for those new bankers to begin to ramp up, to begin to get attraction, so we expect to continue to see good growth where we saw in '15 and get a little bit of incremental growth at of our midmarket channels. So overall, we expect growth slightly lower than 10% in terms of loan and interest growth.

And we've only just started to fund a lot of that. So there is some embedded growth in the book that we expect to see just as project material and we begin to fund up commitments that we made already. We think we can grow the construction business at between a little over 10% as we move into 2016. We're seeing good flows.

They moved around quite a bit by quarter, but you can get good benefit there that actually average up you are yields. And that's actually been part of the reason why we've been able to held yields steady in commercial. You also get a bit of an uptick in Asset Finance, that's worth kind of 10 basis points over the average portfolio. And then the areas where you get a little less commercial real estate, you'll get a less 10 basis points, but I think we -- for the right risk return, we feel like there is good economics there and something like in the Corporate, which we did not emphasize as much because it tends to be higher-grade clients 30 to 40 basis points in loan origination, but more cropped up.

The first hike is not result in a lot of movement in range, right? That was the speculation everyone had, which is Fed moves and there is all sorts of shift, right, but let me kind of decompose on the retail side, there is literally been no movements. It's actually been a few down in a few geographies and obviously, we look at everything. We look at every geography, every city. We're looking at the online players and we're looking at the community banks and it's actually been very, very quite there. And so that gives us some confidence that the we've been talking about our sound. And as you recall, the betas are kind of of over the cycle betas, right. So the beta on retail is going to be quite low for the first rate hike for the first couple of quarters. So I think both bode well for us. On the commercial side, there's always the job owning because commercial clients have their loans repricing on LIBOR and some of them come back on deposits and obviously, that's a business we're in. I think -- there is -- there wasn't much change in December with what you saw, a little bit in January. And I think as you see the month through February and March, we'll have -- we had some amount of uptick and so it could be a little bit, but you're talking a handful basis points on that side.

So -- yes, so the noninterest guidance covers the whole categories. When we strip out some of the, like 1 timers, this impact of Chicago, we think we grew about 4% last year. And the 5% -- 7% growth guidance is really, when you get the uptick. I think if you look further uptake whether rebounding capital markets, hopefully that market stabilizes in the leverage credit markets and that won't be a drag was in Q4. And we're building at our product capabilities. So as we moved away from RBS, we've add to our own capabilities and we were sharing some of those dollars with RBS and now those dollars go 100% to us and we get our book of dealer set up and when we move off on to our own FX and derivatives platform, there is additional revenue opportunities that come from that. We've invested in the cash management business and are doing a better job of cross-selling. We're growing higher sales resources, but get better penetration of our whole product set, so we see some good upside on the commercial side. And similarly on consumer, if we can get the mortgage business going and I'd say we took a little pause here in the fourth quarter as we had to  move and focus on our system and the compliance, I think that bodes well and we'll provide some list then well. We're very under penetrated in wealth. And I think we had a great recruiting quarter in Q4. We got in 12 FCs, best quarter we've had in the long, long time. We had a new Head of Well,, we have high hopes for it, so in both mortgage and wealth, we had new leadership, and I think both have hit the ground running. So I think it's a bit across-the-board and yes, you're right. It would be great if we exceed 5% to 7%, but I think fees in general in the industry have been little sluggish in the environment. And so I think we're just being measured and hopefully that's a range that we can step up from 4 and getting into that 5% to 7%. Eric, do you want to add anything?"

So that's the kind of the anchor point that $5 million to $6 million off. Now that wasn't there in the first 3 quarters of this year, but should go through consistently for 4 quarters next year and that's the basis. If there are little more in that fee increase besides the $5 million to $6 million, we play a little more, but I think we've seen a bulk of it.

I think in retail -- let me actually do that on we've actually had a focus on increasing over last couple of months and quarters with nonprice-driven offer and really focusing on that core DDA and what we call check in with interest, right, which is really checking with a low amount of interest. And we've been doing that on the commercial side, on the consumer side, or that's the cash management side and that's actually been growing nicely. If you actually look at this for DDA and checking with interest on the balance sheet, those are up 2% quarter-on-quarter, 6% year-on-year. And you can actually go back and you can see DDA has been up and last in the 3 quarters in a row, with interest the last 4 quarters in a row. So we're seeing the kind of engagement with clients and that's nonprice-driven way that we've lied. Now we need to keep doing that and that needs to be an ongoing focus and part of very heard about the cash management investments, functionalities part of what we continue to do on consumers revise and improve value propositions to really draw clients. And that's what I would call the heart of what we do on deposits. I think the other, we always open it up price oriented and deposits voucher, like in a bank take those were because from our clients are funding with us. The issue is how do you do that in a disciplined way and so in commercial with lighting we have gone back to some of the large pools of deposits that we put on post Chicago divestiture a year ago, effectively promotional deposits and back in September, the Fed did in go, right, remember in September the did in go, there was a national contrast kind of days those off and promotional rates began then obviously, we matched little bit of attrition, but then we reset and can grow also in comfortable level. And that's where it really gone and commercial and then emphasize the work sales force needs to do on cross and basis from that segment prior to once a part of the year. On the retail side, coming similar we're quite disciplined region-by-region and with Brad stream, what Eric is venting about we're the continue on what you're doing on money market we can see much like the rest of the industry does and has been I think there's been fruitful.

But that's the thing that we really have to focus on. We can't have any leakage. So last year, if we grew loans at 7 and we grew NII at 4, we have to -- if we grow loans at 7, I want to grow NII at 7-plus. And if we can do that, I think that's really powerful in terms of the operating leverage that will deliver."

2015 was a year of significant progress for Citizens. We completed our separation from RBS, becoming fully independent in late October. Our financial progress was in line with expectations and guidance in spite of a lower rate environment than anticipated. We achieved good loan and deposit growth. We delivered positive operating leverage as savings from our efficiency initiatives kept expenses flat notwithstanding significant investments in growth areas and in technology. We made strides in improving our product offerings and service quality and customer satisfaction is trending upwards. We hired some great talent including Eric and Don right here with me, and we had some great new initiatives on the colleague front like leadership development and career mapping. Our risk management capabilities continue to strengthen. We had a good result on CCAR and we're working hard to achieve the regulators' tightened standards. And we continue to deliver enhanced technology capabilities including a new backup data center, a new mortgage platform and expanded online and mobile capabilities. 
So all in all, solid performance on all dimensions, tracking well against our turnaround plan. 
We ended the year with a good fourth quarter, and we feel good about our trajectory as we head into 2016. In Q4, we achieved good loan growth as well as good NII and fee growth. We had expected to do even better, but the leverage credit markets became challenged during Q4, disrupting some of our capital markets pipeline. Hopefully, that market will come back later in Q1. Expenses increased modestly given technology-related spend and $6 million of costs largely associated with our growth and efficiency initiatives. 
Additionally, our credit provision grew by $15 million versus Q3 due to a reserve build. Earlier this year, we had seen back book improvements offset our reserve build tied to loan growth, but the back book is now so clean that we don't expect to see much of that continue. 
The balance sheet remains robust with excellent capital, liquidity and funding position and strong ratios and metrics. 
For the full year, highlights include 13% adjusted EPS growth, positive operating leverage of 3%, 8% average loan growth and tangible book value per share growth of 5%, all of which, I might add, compare very favorably with peers. 
So now, I'd like to turn it over to Eric to give a little more color on the financials. Eric?"

Since Bruce said some of the highlights, let me direct you to a few pages in our slide deck for some color on Q4. 
On Slide 6, on an adjusted basis, we grew EPS by 5% linked quarter and 8% from the fourth quarter of 2014. This included good operating leverage with revenues up 4% and expenses up just 2%. We improved the efficiency ratio 135 basis points year-over-year. 
On Slide 9, you could see our NIM was up 1 basis point in the quarter. We've done a good job on growing our loan yield by adjusting our mix and risk appetite and being disciplined on pricing. We were also able to bring interest-bearing deposit costs down by a basis point this quarter. This is a real progress as we sharpen our offerings and pricing strategies. We did lose a basis point given higher cash balances tied to some of the long-term funding we raised in the quarter and the effects of those borrowing costs. 
Now on Slide 10. Noninterest income was up $9 million in the quarter with momentum in both Consumer and Commercial service charges and fees, driven by progress in our Treasury Solutions initiatives and some seasonality. Capital markets fees were lower than expected given the fixed income market disruption during the quarter. Securities gains picked up a bit to offset this along with lower other income. Recall that the third quarter included an $8 million branch sale gain. 
Now on Slide 11. As expected, our adjusted expenses were up linked quarter given an increase in technology expense. This was driven by the impact of our new backup data center coming online, along with the implementation of various technology and operations initiatives, to improve offerings and drive future revenue growth. Outside of this growth, we held salaries and benefits costs flat. 
We achieved good loan growth in both Consumer and Commercial during the fourth quarter, which you can see on Pages 13 and 14. In Consumer, growth was paved by continued expansion in mortgage and student and we also grew the other retail category, which includes our unsecured iPhone finance product, which generated $220 million in balances by year-end. We continued to do a nice job of repointing our growth to higher-return categories and the yield in Consumer expanded accordingly 4 basis points in the quarter. 
We also saw nice growth in Commercial where we grew Commercial Real Estate loans as client relationships added earlier in the year have their line. We also continued to execute well in Mid-Corporate, Franchise Finance and Corporate finance, which helped to mitigate some of the reductions in middle market as borrowers there continued to reduce line utilization. 
And in all our balance sheet measures on the next couple of pages, we had stronger-than-projected results, which you can see. 
Next, I'd like to take you to Slide 18. Here we show how Citizens performed against guidance we gave back in January of 2015. Overall, the results were largely in line. Balance sheet growth targets were achieved, and while revenue growth was a bit lower than expected largely due to first half NIM compression, we were able to offset that with additional efforts on expenses and favorable credit. 
On Slide 19, we show our progress against our strategic initiatives, most of which is tracking well. But let me call out a few of the challenges and tell you what we are doing about them. In mortgage, our new Head, Chris Nard, has a clear plan focused on regaining operational excellence following our introduction of a new RESPA- and TILA-compliant origination platform in Q4 last year, which caused a slowdown in our throughput and impacted net recruiting. We believe execution of this plan will position us for a stronger 2016 in hiring, retention and productivity. 
In Wealth, under the new leadership of John Bahnken, we had a strong rebound in recruiting this quarter, only see good hiring momentum as we enter 2016. We will continue to migrate toward some more fee-based model. 
And in Asset Finance, we are positioned -- we are repositioning this as a cross-sell product to our corporate customers in the wake of the loss of the RBS customer referrals. We saw some good progress in Q4. 
So all in all, we posted solid results again this quarter and for the year and we continue to make good progress against our strategic initiatives, efficiency efforts and balance sheet repositioning. We are positioned well as we move into 2016. 
Back to you, Bruce."

I'd like to elevate a little starting up Slide 20 to focus on our goals in turning around Citizens. We aspired to be a top-performing bank that delivers well for its our stakeholders with serving customers well at the heart of our culture. 
On Slide 21, we show some of the objectives we have within our plan. We made good progress in 2015, pretty much across-the-board, though there's still more to do. We're a work in progress. 
On Slide 22, you can see the financial targets that we laid out and the steady progress we are making in improving our results. 
So with that, as a backdrop, let's shift to our outlook on 2016, Slide 23. The markets are off to a rough start so far, but our planning assumption is still for steady U.S. GDP growth, solid loan demand, and say, 1 to 2 more rate hikes coming in July and possibly December. 
To deliver strong performance, we have a few key objectives. We need to sustain robust loan growth and we need to keep NIM stable to trending up on an underlying basis. Rate hikes, if they come, will deliver additional benefit. We need to drive our fee initiatives and we need to deliver better fee growth. And we will need to keep finding ways to constrain expense growth given our plans and necessary investment in growth initiatives. If we do that well, we will again deliver meaningful positive operating leverage that will cover a normalization of provision and it'll drive good growth in earnings. And of course, we want to continue to work down our capital surplus through loan growth, a higher dividend and share repurchases. 
So let's move on now to Slide 25 and our guidance. Eric, back to you."

Expense growth of 2.5% to 3.5% as our efficiency initiatives provided a greater offset to investment spending in 2015 and they will in 2016. Provision normalization to a $375 million to $425 million range, and a CET1 ratio of 11.2% to 11.5%. 
As an overall comment, we expect that we could achieve a better level of revenue growth in 2016 than 2015 due to better performance on NIM and on fees. This will cover a slightly higher expense growth and a modest bump from 4Q provision levels. We've laid out some useful details behind these growth rates on Slides 38 to 40 in the Appendix 2. Please take a look at your leisure. 
On Slide 39, for example, we detailed the impact to NII of the December 2015 rate hike, which is worth $40 million to $50 million and the potential impact of 2 more in 2016 per the forward curve that we used at the time when we concluded our plan, which would be worth $30 million to $40 million. The bulk of this additional benefit is from the July 2016 hike as there is minimal impact from the December '16 hike in the forthcoming year. If we don't get any more hikes, we'll have pull harder on other NII levers and review expenses to find offsets. 
Also note that the cut on dividend on the Fed stock decreases NII by $17 million and cost us $0.02 a share. 
We should also highlight that, on Slide 41, there's an accounting change for cards reward that we make prospectively in 2016, which you will need to factor into your model. 
Our outlook for Q1 is shown on Slide 26, fairly straightforward overall with some typical seasonal impacts to consider. 
So let me turn it back to Bruce to wrap up."

So until that is fully migrated, which should be complete by the end of the first quarter, there'll be a little geography there. But in the long run, that's designed to save us money, that's part of our top initiative and I think the migration is going reasonably well. There's also a little bit of seasonality there in outside services to trying to get some projects across the line. We had a little bit of spike there. So I'd say that was really the driver, Ken.

So when we finish the plan, we had used the forward curve, which had one in July and one in December. The one in December doesn't really help '16, it's going to help '17. So if the one in July happens, it's good for us. If it doesn't happen, we have a range there that we were counting on, $30 million to $40 million of benefit, and it's -- that's a manageable number. I mean, that's -- we'll have to pull the levers harder on either earning asset growth, or you can see right there, our loan mix and yields or go back and look at expenses. And so -- anyway, it's -- it would be a tailwind if it happens. It puts us closer to the higher end of the range, makes it easier, maybe it gives us 1% if it happens.

You actually saw that tick up a couple basis points from 2Q to 3Q, another basis point from 3Q to 4Q. And so the plan is pretty straightforward. We continue to grow loans, we continue to grow average assets -- earning assets and we hold NIM flattish to up a bit as we leg [ph] into some of that mix shift that you see us doing, in particular, on Consumer. And then what I'd say is this past December hike, right, the one that was just a short while ago, literally a month ago, actually gives us a boost of 3 to 5 basis points. Why? Because LIBOR has floated up, commercial loans have started to reprice already and that gives us a little bit of a tailwind. So we have confidence that while there's good work to do, real work to do to continue on the kind of the pricing efforts, the mix and management efforts and the discipline, that the loan growth coupled with the NIM kind of guardrails that we're on plus a little bit of tailwind from that December hike, we should be able to continue to deliver good progress on NII growth in the coming year."

But our guidance range of $375 million to $425 million, if you consider that we were at $91 million in Q4, that would annualize to roughly $365 million. And what happens in Q4 is that we continue with a steady level of NCOs around 31 bps and then we started to build the provisions tied to loan growth. And earlier in the year, we had back book cleanup, so we were effectively having credits come through to offset that need to build the reserve and so it was less pronounced earlier in the year. We think that's pretty much run its course, so now what you would expect to see is very, very modest migration on the NCOs, but the need to keep building the reserve because we're going to have decent level of loan growth that we're calling out here. So that's really what's driving that overall range. We don't see anything dramatic shifting in the consumer portfolios, maybe a little higher, because our risk appetite has shifted in commercial.

I mean, just to share the big picture, right, we are continuing to invest in a disciplined way on expenses, on headcount at the front end -- kind of the front-end sales, and we continue to need to spend some on technology and you see that coming through. But at this past year, we had that real effect of the Top I program and then part of that Top II program coming through and that shows you, on Page 40, a real sizable efficiency save. I think as you look through next year, right, where we're starting to see the continuation of the Top II savings, I think we mapped that out in quite a bit of detail this past summer and there's at least a percentage point of savings that will come from that incremental to 2015 and so we have high confidence there. I think beyond that, we are obviously disciplined as we go. So besides transforming operations and working on procurement, right, there's always the long list of opportunity that we focus on. We've done delayering in the past, but that doesn't mean that we don't go back and make sure that our headcount expansion is very disciplined on the front-end sales and continue to look at some of the middle-office and back-office personnel. So we're going to have to do that. And I think the easy part of that downdraft over and about Top II is that if revenues don't come in certain areas, were it to be mortgages, for example, then you're not paying out commission, so that naturally falls to the bottom line. Beyond that, though, we're going to have to work hard and find areas to address and you can imagine we don't put a budget like this together without having a list of 3, 4, 5, 6 items that we're already to working on and contingencies that we can call if we don't see the economic activity that we would have anticipated."

And so one of the reasons that we feel confident in our higher revenue outlook is that things like our checkup program and pricing initiatives and the like are giving us some momentum on the revenue front. So you're going to see that and that's a little bit of the difference. We do have a commitment to continue its improvement. And so if there was a Top I and there was a Top II, you can speculate that there might be a top 3 coming down the road, but that's the way we want to operate this place, is to constantly look to make sure we're running the bank better and that we're maximizing the utility of every expense and investment dollar that we have. And the last thing I would say is that if the rate hikes don't happen, it's not just an expense lever that we would look to, as I said, in the answer to Jill, there's also the other things back on Page 39 in terms of can we drive a little more asset growth, can we focus a little more on the mix to try to get the yield up. So I think there's some embedded offsets potentially right in NII to compensate for that. But yes, you're right. Expenses would clearly, if the stock market's saying -- what are they saying? We don't know. It's not always a great leading indicator, but if revenue growth was little hard to come by, you'd certainly have to go back and look at your expenses again."

And it started out being more purchase of auto, and as we ramped up our own capabilities in prime auto origination, we'd scale back the auto purchases. We'd still like the student space and we struck a relationship with SoFi and -- so we now are purchasing some student loans and fewer auto loans. So I would expect to broadly see that. And over time, we will just be opportunistic on purchases. And as we keep playing offense and putting more originators out there, we'll be able to fully whet our appetite on own originations. But for now, we think we're getting some very high-quality assets that really fit the profile of what we can do on our own and augments the growth rate at a little bit. So that maybe I could -- and I'd say the other thing is that we're pretty balanced in terms of the growth coming between Consumer and Commercial, you can see that in Q4. There's good balance between the opportunities in Commercial and Consumer, so we're going on both sides. But maybe I'll flip it to Brad and then Don to quickly offer where they see the opportunities and expect the books."

You talked about it, we have slowed down the purchase of those SCUSA assets, so that's really more of a maintenance mode as opposed to growing, but we like the relationship with SoFi, which will supplement the loan growth in student. We will -- we expect to see some continued growth in mortgage. We have actually been in a position where our home equity portfolio has been going down a little bit in 2015, but we're reaching that point of that starting to moving back into the growth mode with a very, very strong application and closing quarter in the fourth quarter in home equity. And we'll probably see -- it'll be modest, I think. We will probably see some growth in home equity.

So we saw solid double-digit growth in all of those verticals while also keeping a good pricing discipline and a good credit discipline, which I think is the balancing act that we will continue to focus on in 2016. In '16, we expect to see some more growth in the Middle Market. We did quite a lot of hiring across our Middle Market teams last year and it's taken a little while for those new bankers to begin to ramp and to begin to get traction, so we expect to continue to see good growth where we saw it in '15 and get a little bit of incremental growth out of our Mid Market channels. So overall, we're expecting to grow slightly lower than 10% in terms of loan and interest growth. And the other thing, we think we will see in '16 is even more acceleration in the fee lines as we begin to take advantage of some of these investments that we've made around capital markets and treasury services in particular."

I think Eric had mentioned in his comments we ended the year at $220 million in balances and you would expect to continue to see that to grow. I would tell you it's a little hard to pin down exactly where we see it going for a couple of reasons: we're actually somewhat limited in the scope of that initiative today in that it's available only in the Apple Store and it's only available for the current model. So there will be a few drivers that dictate where that program goes: do you expand that beyond just the Apple Stores, do they launch new products, do you extend the program beyond just the current model following, so forth. So I guess, the way I would sum that up is we would certainly expect to see volume. We're 1 quarter of growth. We're 1 quarter in and we generated $220 million. So you're certainly going to see growth. There is some question is to how fast that growth will be given some of those parameters. We're very pleased with the program. We think we've provided a very good customer experience. Can't speak for Apple, but I think they would say the same. They're very pleased with how the program is going so far. So we're opportunistic. It is a nice program and they're a nice asset for us in terms of yield margins. So very attractive return for us."

A couple of years ago, we began to move into the construction lending business, which is higher margin. So we have seen our margins in real estate on a blended basis go up and we expect to continue to see that. As I think, Eric mentioned, we have done a lot of business over the last 2 or 3 years with very targeted sponsors and very targeted NSAs on the construction side. And we've only just started to fund a lot of that. So there is some embedded growth in the book that we expect to see just as project material and we begin to fund up commitments that we've made already. We think we can grow the construction business between a little over 10% as we move into 2016. We're seeing good flows. I expect the REIT business to stay roughly flattish and that's below our lower margin business. So I think you'll see blended growth of slightly under 10% and margin uptick as we roll through '16. And I think, as you mentioned, margin, we are cognizant of where we might be in the real estate cycle. It's been a very, very strong market for the last several years.

So I mean, let me just kind of give you some directional information. If you think about some of the core portfolios that we have, I think, we said previously and I'll reemphasize that as we have grown in Industry Verticals, Middle Market and Franchise Finance, we tend to put yields on that are higher than the portfolio to the tune of 30 to 40 basis points. They moved around quite a bit by quarter, but you get good benefit there that actually average up your yields. And that's actually been part of the reason why we've been able to held yield steady in commercial. You also get a bit of an uptick in Asset Finance, that's worth kind of 10 basis points over the average portfolio. And then the areas where you get a little less, commercial real estate, you'll get a less, 10 basis points, but I think we -- for the right risk return, we feel like there is good economics there and something like Mid-Corporate, which we did not emphasize as much because it tends to be higher-grade clients, probably you'll get a merit of 30 to 40 basis points in your [indiscernible] origination, but more cropped up, right, and bigger wallet into it to cross-sell. So there's kind of a mix of facts and that's in a way the texture that we use as the management team we guide where do we want to emphasize, how much do we want to invest in these different areas. Don mentioned from the hiring in Middle Market quite obviously for us to hire and to continue to strengthen because of that 30 to 40 basis point lift that we get and the cross-sell that comes with that whether it's deposits our cash management and that's kind of part of the, I guess, the tool set and the special custody [ph] of which we are -- we're carefully driving growth margin and getting the NIMs of where we like it to be."

So -- yes, so the noninterest guidance covers the whole categories. When we strip out some of the, like onetimers, like the impact of Chicago, we think we grew about 4% last year. And the 5% -- 7% growth guidance is really where you get the uptick. I think if you look for the uptick where the rebound in capital markets, hopefully, that market stabilizes in the leverage credit markets and that won't be a drag like it was in Q4. And we're building at our product capabilities. So as we moved away from RBS, we've had to add our own capabilities and we were sharing some of those dollars with RBS and now those dollars go 100% to us and we get our book of dealer set up and then we move off on to our own FX and derivatives platform. There is additional revenue opportunities that come from that. We've invested in the cash management business and are doing a better job of cross-selling. We have grown out and hired more sales resources, that get better penetration of our whole product set, so we see some good upside on the commercial side. And similarly on consumer, if we can get the mortgage business going and I'd say we took a little pause here in the fourth quarter as we had to move and focus on our system and the RESPA/TILA compliance, I think that bodes well and we'll provide some list then well. We were very underpenetrated in wealth. And I think we had a great recruiting quarter in Q4. We got in 12 FCs, best quarter we've had in the long, long time. Coincidentally or not, we've had a new Head as well, who we have high hopes for. So in both mortgage and wealth, we have new leadership, and I think both have hit the ground running. So I think it's a bit across the board and yes, you're right, it would be great if we could exceed 5% to 7%, but I think fees in general in the industry have been little sluggish in the environment. And so I think we're just being measured and hopefully that's a range that we can step up from 4 and getting into that 5% to 7%. Eric, do you want to add anything?"

That service charge and fee line is over 40% of our total fee, right, that was up 2% for the year, but up 8% year-over-year this quarter, why because some of those fee increases that we talked about as part of top 2 are starting to play through. And so I think we have some confidence that, that can anchor the fee growth of 5% to 7%. And then given that 40% of the fee line, and then some of the other areas that we cover, I think all the areas where we're really driving hard on and we'll update as we go during the year."

So that's the kind of the anchor point that $5 million to $6 million off. Now that wasn't there in the first 3 quarters of this year that should go through consistently for 4 quarters next year and that's the basis. If there are little more in that fee increase besides the $5 million to $6 million, we play a little more, but I think we've seen the bulk of it.

I think in retail -- let me actually do the top of the house thing. In top of the house, we've actually had a focus on increasing over the last couple of months and quarters leading with nonprice-driven offer and really focusing on that core DDA and what we call check in with interest, right, which is really checking with a low amount of interest. And we've been doing that on the commercial side, on the consumer side or that's the cash management product, which is a low EPR and that's actually been growing nicely. If you actually look at this for DDA and checking with interest on the balance sheet, those are up 2% quarter-on-quarter, 6% year-on-year. And you can actually go back and you can see DDA has been up for the last 3 quarters in the row, checking with interest in the last 4 quarters in the row. So we're seeing the kind of engagement with clients in an nonprice-driven way that we've laid. Now we need to keep doing that and that needs to be an ongoing focus and part of what you have heard about the cash management investments, it's functionality is part of what we continue to do on consumers [indiscernible]. We've revised and improved value propositions to really draw clients. And that's what I would call the heart of what we do on deposits. I think the other part of deposit question is there's always a little bit of price-oriented deposits out there, and we, like any bank, take those; why? Because they are from our clients. Our clients are only funding with us. The issue is how do you do that in a disciplined way and so in commercial, with Don arriving, we've gone back to some of the large pools of deposits that we put on post the Chicago divestiture a year ago. Those were effectively promotional deposits and back in September, after the fed didn't go [ph], right? Remember in September the fed didn't go [ph]. That was a natural construct kind of take those off those old promotional rates. And then obviously, we matched a little bit of attrition, but then we reset and can grow off of a comfortable level. And that's where we really done in commercial and then emphasized the work of sales force needs to do on a cross-sell basis and that's segmented in a [indiscernible] this part of the year. On the retail side, you do something similar. We're quite disciplined region-by-region and with Brad's team, where they are thinking about, we're their opportunities to continue what you're doing on money market as we can see we pulled back on CDs much like the rest of the industry does and has been doing, and I think that's been fruitful. So all told, I think, the real nice performance across the funds on interest-bearing deposits down a bit, it's great to see. We'd obviously -- we'll keep pushing on that front."

I want to make sure that we're taking full advantage of the opportunities to add customers and grow the franchise and it's good to have a little bit of push in their in the overall capital ratios while -- until -- and that helps speed the ROE. It's kind of a circle. So we get our RRV up, then we don't need as much of a surplus. So I would say over time, we're clearly looking to get back to the pack and so if our peers are running at 10 or 10.5, there's no reason we shouldn't run where the peers are running. Once we're kind of fully operating where you want to operate in our returns or where we want them to be. It is -- I think we do look at the opportunity to buy back the stock and where it's trading and it's attractive here, we think. And so that will be factored into our thinking, but I just want to give you kind of the guard rails are we're coming down on a gradual glide path and it's somewhat also dictated by how fast we can get the RRV up and generate more capital and then we don't need that cushion."

I think it took us a little while to really establish a rhythm on that, but the good news is if we look at the second half of the last year, in 2015, we actually moved the NIM up by 5 basis points. So I think we're doing a better job at that -- some of that, I'll give the credit to the guy on the right here, Eric, for really driving that and spearheading that.

The other thing in my past has been what really tends to hurt institutions is concentration. And we do have a very rigorous concentration management system. And I think one of the interesting things that I've see at Citizens is just core diversification in the portfolio given that it's a mid-market lending activity predominantly is very, very great both on a geographic basis, on an industry basis and on an individual credit basis. So I think there is a little bit of hedge in the overall portfolio also.

2015 was a year of significant progress for Citizens. We completed our separation from RBS, becoming fully independent in late October. Our financial progress was in line with expectations and guidance in spite of a lower rate environment than anticipated. We achieved good loan and deposit growth. We delivered positive operating leverage as savings from our efficiency initiatives kept expenses flat notwithstanding significant investments in growth areas and in technology. We made strides in improving our product offerings and service quality, and customer satisfaction is trending upwards. We hired some great talent including Eric and Don, right here with me, and we had some great new initiatives on the colleague front like leadership development and career mapping. Our risk management capabilities continue to strengthen. We had a good result on CCAR and we're working hard to achieve the regulators' heightened standards. And we continue to deliver enhanced technology capabilities including a new backup data center, a new mortgage platform and expanded online and mobile capabilities. 
So all in all, solid performance on all dimensions, tracking well against our turnaround plan. 
We ended the year with a good fourth quarter, and we feel good about our trajectory as we head into 2016. In Q4, we achieved good loan growth as well as good NII and fee growth. We had expected to do even better, but the leverage credit markets became challenged during Q4, disrupting some of our capital markets pipeline. Hopefully, that market will come back later in Q1. Expenses increased modestly given technology-related spend and $6 million of costs largely associated with our growth and efficiency initiatives. 
Additionally, our credit provision grew by $15 million versus Q3 due to a reserve build. Earlier this year, we had seen back book improvements offset our reserve build tied to loan growth, but the back book is now so clean that we don't expect to see much of that continue. 
The balance sheet remains robust, with excellent capital, liquidity and funding position and strong ratios and metrics. 
For the full year, highlights include 13% adjusted EPS growth, positive operating leverage of 3%, 8% average loan growth and tangible book value per share growth of 5%, all of which, I might add, compare very favorably with peers. 
So now, I'd like to turn it over to Eric to give a little more color on the financials. Eric?"

Since Bruce hit some of the highlights, let me direct you to a few pages in our slide deck for some color on Q4. 
On Slide 6, on an adjusted basis, we grew EPS by 5% linked quarter and 8% from the fourth quarter of 2014. This included good operating leverage, with revenues up 4% and expenses up just 2%. We improved the efficiency ratio 135 basis points year-over-year. 
On Slide 9, you can see our NIM was up 1 basis point in the quarter. We've done a good job on growing our loan yields by adjusting our mix and risk appetite and being disciplined on pricing. We were also able to bring interest-bearing deposit costs down by a basis point this quarter. This is a real progress as we sharpen our offerings and pricing strategies. We did lose a basis point given higher cash balances tied to some of the long-term funding we raised in the quarter and the effects of those borrowing costs. 
Now on Slide 10. Noninterest income was up $9 million in the quarter, with momentum in both Consumer and Commercial service charges and fees, driven by progress in our Treasury Solutions initiatives and some seasonality. Capital markets fees were lower than expected given the fixed income market disruption during the quarter. Securities gains ticked up a bit to offset this along with lower other income. Recall that the third quarter included an $8 million brand sale gain. 
Now on Slide 11. As expected, our adjusted expenses were up linked quarter given an increase in technology expense. This was driven by the impact of our new backup data center coming online, along with the implementation of various technology and operations initiatives, to improve offerings and drive future revenue growth. Outside of this growth, we held salaries and benefits costs flat. 
We achieved good loan growth in both Consumer and Commercial during the fourth quarter, which you can see on Pages 13 and 14. In Consumer, growth was paced by continued expansion in mortgage and student and we also grew the other retail category, which includes our unsecured iPhone finance product, which generated $220 million in balances by year-end. We continued to do a nice job of repointing our growth to higher-return categories and the yield in Consumer expanded accordingly 4 basis points in the quarter. 
We also saw nice growth in Commercial, where we grew Commercial Real Estate loans as client relationships added earlier in the year passed their line. We also continued to execute well in Mid-Corporate, Franchise Finance and Corporate finance, which helped to mitigate some of the reductions in middle market as borrowers there continued to reduce line utilization. 
And in all our balance sheet measures on the next couple of pages, we had stronger-than-projected results, which you can see. 
Next, I'd like to take you to Slide 18. Here we show how Citizens performed against guidance we gave back in January of 2015. Overall, the results were largely in line. Balance sheet growth targets were achieved, and while revenue growth was a bit lower than expected largely due to first half NIM compression, we were able to offset that with additional efforts on expenses and favorable credit. 
On Slide 19, we show our progress against our strategic initiatives. Most of this is tracking well. But let me call out a few of the challenges and tell you what we are doing about them. In mortgage, our new Head, Chris Nard, has a clear plan focused on regaining operational excellence following our introduction of a new RESPA- and TILA-compliant origination platform in Q4 last year, which caused a slowdown in our throughput and impacted net recruiting. We believe execution of this plan will position us for a stronger 2016 in hiring, retention and productivity. 
In Wealth, under the new leadership of John Bahnken, we had a strong rebound in recruiting this quarter, only see good hiring momentum as we enter 2016. We will continue to migrate toward some more fee-based model. 
And in Asset Finance, we are positioned -- we are repositioning this as a cross-sell product to our corporate customers in the wake of the loss of the RBS customer referrals. We saw some good progress in Q4. 
So all in all, we posted solid results again this quarter and for the year and we continue to make good progress against our strategic initiatives, efficiency efforts and balance sheet repositioning. We are positioned well as we move into 2016. 
Back to you, Bruce."

I'd like to elevate a little starting up Slide 20 to focus on our goals in turning around Citizens. We aspire to be a top-performing bank that delivers well for its our stakeholders, with serving customers well at the heart of our culture. 
On Slide 21, we show some of the objectives we have within our plan. We made good progress in 2015, pretty much across-the-board, though there's still more to do. We're a work in progress. 
On Slide 22, you can see the financial targets that we laid out and the steady progress we are making in improving our results. 
So with that as a backdrop, let's shift to our outlook on 2016, Slide 23. The markets are off to a rough start so far, but our planning assumption is still for steady U.S. GDP growth, solid loan demand and, say, 1 to 2 more rate hikes coming in July and possibly December. 
To deliver strong performance, we have a few key objectives. We need to sustain robust loan growth and we need to keep NIM stable to trending up on an underlying basis. Rate hikes, if they come, will deliver additional benefit. We need to drive our fee initiatives and we need to deliver better fee growth. And we will need to keep finding ways to constrain expense growth given our plans and necessary investment in growth initiatives. If we do that well, we will again deliver meaningful positive operating leverage that will cover a normalization of provision and it'll drive good growth in earnings. And of course, we want to continue to work down our capital surplus through loan growth, a higher dividend and share repurchases. 
So let's move on now to Slide 25 and our guidance. Eric, back to you."

A few key items I'd call out. Loan growth of 6% to 8%. NII growth of 7% to 10%, with NIM improvement of 6 to 12 bps. The forward curve assumes rate hikes in July and December, which would help us get to the higher end of this range if they occur. Fee growth of 5% to 7%. Expense growth of 2.5% to 3.5% as our efficiency initiatives provided a greater offset to investment spending in 2015 than they will in 2016. Provision normalization to a $375 million to $425 million range, and a CET1 ratio of 11.2% to 11.5%. 
As an overall comment, we expect that we could achieve a better level of revenue growth in 2016 than 2015 due to better performance on NIM and on fees. This will cover a slightly higher expense growth and a modest bump from 4Q provision levels. We've laid out some useful details behind these growth rates on Slides 38 to 40 in the Appendix 2. Please take a look at your leisure. 
On Slide 39, for example, we detailed the impact to NII of the December 2015 rate hike, which is worth $40 million to $50 million and the potential impact of 2 more in 2016 per the forward curve that we used at the time when we concluded our plan, which would be worth $30 million to $40 million. The bulk of this additional benefit is from the July 2016 hike as there is minimal impact from the December '16 hike in the forthcoming year. If we don't get any more hikes, we'll have to pull harder on other NII levers and review expenses to find offsets. 
Also note that the coming dividend on the Fed stock decreases NII by $17 million and cost us $0.02 a share. 
We should also highlight that, on Slide 41, there's an accounting change for cards reward that we make prospectively in 2016, which you will need to factor into your models. 
Our outlook for Q1 is shown on Slide 26, fairly straightforward overall, with some typical seasonal impacts to consider.

And, Eric, I'll turn it over to you, but I would just say that we're not that reliant on rate hikes in 2016. So when we finish the plan, we had used the forward curve, which had one in July and one in December. The one in December doesn't really help '16; it's going to help '17. So if the one in July happens, it's good for us. If it doesn't happen, we have a range there that we were counting on, $30 million to $40 million of benefit, and if -- that's a manageable number. I mean, that's -- we'll have to pull the levers harder on either earning asset growth, or you can see right there, or loan mix and yields or go back and look at expenses. And so -- anyway, it's -- it would be a tailwind if it happens. It puts us closer to the higher end in the range, makes it easier, maybe it gives us 1% if it happens.

You actually saw that tick up a couple basis points from 2Q to 3Q, another basis point from 3Q to 4Q. And so the plan is pretty straightforward. We continue to grow loans, we continue to grow average assets -- earning assets and we hold NIM flattish to up a bit as we leg in to some of that mix shift that you see us doing, in particular, on Consumer. And then what I'd say is this past December hike, right, the one that was just a short while ago, literally a month ago, actually gives us a boost of 3 to 5 basis points. Why? Because LIBOR has floated up, commercial loans have started to reprice already and that gives us a little bit of a tailwind. So we have confidence that while there's good work to do, real work to do to continue on the kind of the pricing efforts, the mix and management efforts and the discipline, that the loan growth coupled with the NIM kind of guardrails that were on plus a little bit of tailwind from that December hike, we should be able to continue to deliver good progress on NII growth in the coming year."

But our guidance range of $375 million to $425 million, if you consider that we were at $91 million in Q4, that would annualize to roughly $365 million. And what happens in Q4 is that we continued with a steady level of NCOs around 31 bps and then we started to build the provisions tied to loan growth. And earlier in the year, we had back book cleanup, so we were effectively having credits come through to offset that need to build the reserve and so it was less pronounced earlier in the year. We think that's pretty much run its course, so now what you would expect to see is very, very modest migration on the NCOs, but the need to keep building the reserve because we're going to have a decent level of loan growth that we're calling out here. So that's really what's driving that overall range. We don't see anything dramatic shifting. In the consumer portfolios, maybe a little higher, because our risk appetite has shifted. In commercial, we're keeping our eye, as we said, on energy, but nothing that's rattling us at this point and nothing really broadly across the portfolio is migrating.

I mean, just to share the big picture, right, we are continuing to invest in a disciplined way on expenses, on headcount at the front end -- kind of the front-end sales, and we continue to need to spend some on technology and you see that coming through. But at this past year, we had that real effect of the Top I program and then part of that Top II program coming through and that shows you, on Page 40, a real sizable efficiency save. I think as you look through next year, right, what we're starting to see the continuation of the Top II savings, I think we mapped that out in quite a bit of detail this past summer and there's at least a percentage point of savings that will come from that incremental to 2015 and so we have high confidence there. I think beyond that, we are obviously disciplined as we go. So besides transforming operations and working on procurement, right, there's always the long list of opportunities that we focus on. We've done delayering in the past, but that doesn't mean that we don't go back and make sure that our headcount expansion is very disciplined on the front-end sales and continue to look at some of the middle-office and back-office personnel. So we're going to have to do that. And I think the easy part of that downdraft over and above Top II is that if revenues don't come in certain areas, were it to be mortgages, for example, then you're not paying out commissions, so that naturally falls to the bottom line. Beyond that, though, we're going to have to work hard and find areas to address and you can imagine we don't put a budget like this together without having a list of 3, 4, 5, 6 items that we're already to working on and contingencies that we can call if we don't see the economic activity that we would have anticipated."

And so one of the reasons that we feel confident in our higher revenue outlook is that things like our checkup program and pricing initiatives and the like are giving us some momentum on the revenue front. So you're going to see that and that's a little bit of a difference. We do have a commitment to continuous improvement. And so if there was a Top I and there was a Top II, you can speculate that there might be a Top III coming down the road, but that's the way we want to operate this place, is to constantly look to make sure we're running the bank better and that we're maximizing the utility of every expense and investment dollar that we have. And the last thing I would say is that if the rate hikes don't happen, it's not just an expense lever that we would look to, as I said, in the answer to Jill, there's also the other things, back on Page 39, in terms of can we drive a little more asset growth, can we focus a little more on the mix to try to get the yield up. So I think there's some embedded offsets potentially right in NII to compensate for that. But yes, you're right. Expenses would clearly, if the stock market's saying -- what are they saying? We don't know. It's not always a great leading indicator, but if revenue growth was little hard to come by, you'd certainly have to go back and look at your expenses again."

And over time, we will just be opportunistic on purchases. And as we keep playing offense and putting more originators out there, we'll be able to fully whet our appetite on own originations. But for now, we think we're getting some very high-quality assets that really fit the profile of what we can do on our own and augments that growth rate at a little bit.

We have slowed down the purchase of those SCUSA assets, so that's really more of a maintenance mode as opposed to growing, but we like the relationship with SoFi, which will supplement the loan growth in student. We will -- we expect to see some continued growth in mortgage. We have actually been in a position where our home equity portfolio has been going down a little bit in 2015, but we're reaching that point of that starting to moving back into the growth mode. So we had a very, very strong application and closing quarter in the fourth quarter in home equity. And we'll probably see -- it'll be modest, I think.

In '16, we expect to see some more growth in the Middle Market. We did quite a lot of hiring across our Middle Market teams last year and it's taken a little while for those new bankers to begin to ramp and to begin to get traction, so we expect to continue to see good growth where we saw it in '15 and get a little bit of incremental growth out of our Mid Market channels. So overall, we're expecting to grow slightly lower than 10% in terms of loan and interest growth.

So there will be a few drivers that dictate where that program goes: Do you expand that beyond just the Apple Store? Do they launch new products? Do you extend the program beyond just the current model following, so forth? So I guess, the way I would sum that up is we would certainly expect to see volume. We're 1 quarter of growth.

We're very pleased with the program. We think we've provided a very good customer experience. Can't speak for Apple, but I think they would say the same. They're very pleased with how the program is going so far. So we're optimistic. It is a nice program and they're a nice asset for us in terms of yield margins. So very attractive return for us."

A couple of years ago, we began to move into the construction lending business, which is higher margin. So we have seen our margins in real estate on a blended basis go up and we expect to continue to see that. As I think Eric mentioned, we have done a lot of business over the last 2 or 3 years with very targeted sponsors and very targeted NSAs on the construction side. And we've only just started to fund a lot of that. So there is some embedded growth in the book that we expect to see just as projects mature and we begin to fund up commitments that we've made already. We think we can grow the construction business at between a little over 10% as we move into 2016. We're seeing good flows. I expect the REIT business to stay roughly flattish and that's below our lower margin business. So I think you'll see blended growth of slightly under 10% and margin uptick as we roll through '16. And I think, as you mentioned, margin, we are cognizant of where we might be in the real estate cycle. It's been a very, very strong market for the last several years. We're not saying that the positive dynamics are changing. We don't really see the terms changing, but we're keeping an eye on that as we go into '16, and we will be disciplined based on what we see the marketplace doing."

So I mean, let me just kind of give you some directional information. If you think about some of the core portfolios that we have, I think we said previously and I'll reemphasize that as we have grown in Industry Verticals, Middle Market and Franchise Finance, we tend to put yields on that are higher than the portfolio to the tune of 30 to 40 basis points. It moves around quite a bit by quarter, but you get good benefit there that actually average up your yields. And that's actually been part of the reason why we've been able to held yields steady in commercial. You also get a bit of an uptick in Asset Finance, that's worth kind of 10 basis points over the average portfolio. And then the areas where you get a little less, Commercial Real Estate, you get a less, 10 basis points, but I think we -- for the right risk return, we feel like there is good economics there. And something like Mid-Corporate, which we did not emphasize as much because it tends to be higher-grade clients, right, probably you'll get demerit of 30 to 40 basis points in your loan origination, but more cross-sell, right, and bigger wallet into which to cross-sell. So there's kind of a mix of facts and that's in a way the texture that we use as the management team. We guide where do we want to emphasize, how much do we want to invest in these different areas. Don mentioned from the hiring in Middle Market quite obviously for us to hire and to continue to strengthen because of that 30 to 40 basis point lift that we get and the cross-sell that comes with that, whether it's deposits our cash management and that's kind of part of the, I guess, the tool set and the specificity of which we are -- we're carefully driving growth margin and getting the NIMs of where we like it to be."

As expected, right, the first hike has not resulted in a lot of movement in rate, right? That was the speculation everyone had, which is the Fed moves and there is all sorts of shift, right, but let me kind of decompose for you. On the retail side, there is little, even no movement. There's actually been a few downticks in a few geographies and obviously, we look at everything. We look at every geography, every city. We're looking at the online players and we're looking at the community banks and it's actually been very, very quiet there. And so that gives us some confidence that the betas that we've been talking about are sound, and as you recall, the betas are kind of over the cycle betas, right. So the beta on retail is going to be quite low for the first rate hike for the first couple of quarters. So that, I think, bodes well for us. On the commercial side, there's always the job owning because commercial clients have their loans repricing on LIBOR and some of them come back on deposits and obviously, that's the business we're in. I think -- there is -- there wasn't much change in December with what you saw, a little bit in January. And I think as you see the month play through, February and March, we'll have some amount of uptick and so it could be a little bit, but you're talking a handful of basis points on that side. And so if you look at it, we actually have some confidence we'll deliver good deposit pricing in the first quarter, right, with some nice corresponding uptick on loan yields, right, because those on the commercial side [indiscernible] LIBOR."

So I think, we will from time-to-time be making repositioning decisions in the portfolio and if we kind of cough up $5 million or $10 million here and there, that's, I think, ongoing income that we would expect to see. So -- yes, so the noninterest in guidance covers the whole category. When we strip out some of the, like onetimers, like the impact of Chicago, we think we grew about 4% last year. And the 5% -- 7% growth guidance is really where do you get the uptick? I think if you look for the uptick where the rebound in capital markets, hopefully, that market stabilizes in the leverage credit markets and that won't be a drag the way it was in Q4. And we're building at our product capabilities. So as we moved away from RBS, we've had to add our own capabilities and we were sharing some of those dollars with RBS and now those dollars go 100% to us and we get our broker dealer set up and then we move off on to our own FX and derivatives platform. There’s additional revenue opportunities that come from that. We've invested in the cash management business and are doing a better job of cross-selling. We have gone out and hired more sales resources, that get better penetration of our whole product set, so we see some good upside on the commercial side. And similarly on consumer, if we can get the mortgage business going and I'd say we took a little pause here in the fourth quarter as we had to move and focus on our system and the RESPA/TILA compliance, I think that bodes well and will provide some lift. And then wealth. We were very underpenetrated in wealth. And I think we had a great recruiting quarter in Q4. We got in 12 FCs, best quarter we've had in the long, long time. Coincidentally or not, we've had a new head of wealth, who we have high hopes for. So in both mortgage and wealth, we have new leadership, and I think both have hit the ground running. So I think it's a bit across the board and, yes, you're right, it would be great if we could exceed 5% to 7%, but I think fees in general in the industry have been a little sluggish in the environment. And so I think we're just being measured and hopefully that's a range that we can step up from 4% and getting into that 5% to 7%. Eric, do you want to add anything?"

In",540,"Yes, I think -- let me just describe deposits this way because there is work we do on the retail side, work we do on the commercial side and then there is kind of in-depth in each one. I think in retail -- let me actually do the top of the house thing. In top of the house, we've actually had a focus on increasing over the last couple of months and quarters leading with non-price-driven offers and really focusing on that core DDA and what we call checking with interest, right, which is really checking with a low amount of interest. And we've been doing that on the commercial side, on the consumer side. Part of that's the cash management product, which is a low EPR, and that's actually been growing nicely. If you actually look at the statistics for DDA and checking with interest on the balance sheet, those are up 2% quarter-on-quarter, 6% year-on-year. And you can actually go back and you can see DDA has been up for the last 3 quarters in a row, checking with interest the last 4 quarters in the row. So we're seeing the kind of engagement with clients in an non-price-driven way that we've laid. Now we need to keep doing that and that needs to be an ongoing focus and part of what you have heard about the cash management investments is functionality and part of what we continue to do on consumer is roll out revised and improved value propositions to really draw clients in. And that's what I would call the heart of what we do on deposits. I think the other part of the deposit question is there's always a little bit of price-oriented deposits out there, and we, like any bank, take those. Why? Because they are from our clients. Our clients are only funding with us. The issue is, how do you do that in a disciplined way and so in commercial, with Don arriving, we've gone back to some of the large pools of deposits that we put on post the Chicago divestiture a year ago. Those were effectively promotional deposits and back in September, after the Fed didn't go, right? Remember in September the Fed didn't go, that was a natural construct to kind of take those off those old promotional rates. And then obviously, we matched a little bit of attrition, but then we reset and can grow off of a comfortable level. And that's where we've really done in commercial and then emphasized the work that the sales force needs to do on a cross-sell basis and that's segmented in a nearer base that's probably too long to describe here. On the Retail side we something similar. We're quite disciplined region-by-region and with Brad's team, where they are thinking about? Where are there opportunities to continue what we do on money market? As we can see, we pulled back on CDs, much like the rest of the industry does and has been doing, and I think that's been fruitful. So all told, I think, a real nice performance. Across the front on interest-bearing deposits down a bit, it's great to see. We'd obviously -- we'll keep pushing on that front."

So we'll go through the process, and I think our guidance of 11.2 [ph] to 11.5 [ph] says that we're still going to be -- I would say moderate in our appetite as opposed to all out aggressive. And part of that reason is having a capital surplus that we're using to fund loan growth that is not -- our ROE today is not high enough to fund that level of loan growth. I want to make sure that we're taking full advantage of the opportunities to add customers and grow the franchise, and it's good to have a little bit of cushion there in the overall capital ratios while -- until -- and that helps speed the ROE. It's kind of a circle. So if we get our ROE up, then we don't need as much of a surplus. So I would say over time, we're clearly looking to get back to the pack and so if our peers are running at 10 or 10.5, there's no reason we shouldn't run where the peers are running. Once we're kind of fully operating where you want to operate and our returns or where we want them to be, it is -- I think we do look at the opportunity to buy back the stock and where it's trading and it's attractive here, we think. And so that will be factored into our thinking, but I just wanted to give you, kind of the guard rails are we're coming down on a gradual glide path and it's somewhat also dictated by how fast we can get the ROE up and generate more capital and then we don't need that cushion."

The thing that's been our challenge and we've spent a lot of time on this call talking about it is, how can we make sure that we're improving our asset yields and then growing deposits cost effectively? I think it took us a little while to really establish a rhythm on that, but the good news is if you look at the second half of the last year, in 2015, we actually moved the NIM up by 5 basis points. So I think we're doing a better job at that. Some of that, I'll give the credit to the guy on the right here, Eric, for really driving that and spearheading that. But that's the thing that we really have to focus on. We can't have any leakage. So last year, if we grew loans at 7 and we grew NII at 4, we have to -- if we grow loans at 7, I want to grow NII at 7 plus.

I think that's correct. Obviously, anybody is dependent upon high-yield market or the institutional market is on the sidelines right now, because they are effectively closed. One of the things we have heard and we just published our fifth annual M&A survey from mid-market companies, is an expectation across our client base that M&A activity could be quite interesting in this year and the next year just as people struggle a little bit with top line growth and look to supplement their businesses.

So that's usually your early signal, that you start to see people missing covenants and people having financial deterioration. The other thing in my past has been, what really tends to hurt institutions is concentrations. And we do have a very rigorous concentration management system. And I think one of the interesting things that I see at Citizens is just the core diversification in the portfolio given that it's a mid-market lending activity predominantly is very, very great both on a geographic basis, on an industry basis and on an individual credit basis. So I think there is a little bit of hedge in the overall portfolio also.

2015 was a year of significant progress for Citizens. We completed our separation from RBS, becoming fully independent in late October. Our financial progress was in line with expectations and guidance in spite of a lower rate environment than anticipated. We achieved good loan and deposit growth. We delivered positive operating leverage as savings from our efficiency initiatives kept expenses flat notwithstanding significant investments in growth areas and in technology. We made strides in improving our product offerings and service quality, and customer satisfaction is trending upwards. We hired some great talent including Eric and Don, right here with me, and we had some great new initiatives on the colleague front like leadership development and career mapping. Our risk management capabilities continue to strengthen. We had a good result on CCAR and we're working hard to achieve the regulators' heightened standards. And we continue to deliver enhanced technology capabilities including a new backup data center, a new mortgage platform and expanded online and mobile capabilities. 
So all in all, solid performance on all dimensions, tracking well against our turnaround plan. 
We ended the year with a good fourth quarter, and we feel good about our trajectory as we head into 2016. In Q4, we achieved good loan growth as well as good NII and fee growth. We had expected to do even better, but the leverage credit markets became challenged during Q4, disrupting some of our capital markets pipeline. Hopefully, that market will come back later in Q1. Expenses increased modestly given technology-related spend and $6 million of costs largely associated with our growth and efficiency initiatives. 
Additionally, our credit provision grew by $15 million versus Q3 due to a reserve build. Earlier this year, we had seen back book improvements offset our reserve build tied to loan growth, but the back book is now so clean that we don't expect to see much of that continue. 
The balance sheet remains robust, with excellent capital, liquidity and funding position and strong ratios and metrics. 
For the full year, highlights include 13% adjusted EPS growth, positive operating leverage of 3%, 8% average loan growth and tangible book value per share growth of 5%, all of which, I might add, compare very favorably with peers. 
So now, I'd like to turn it over to Eric to give a little more color on the financials. Eric?"

Since Bruce hit some of the highlights, let me direct you to a few pages in our slide deck for some color on Q4. 
On Slide 6, on an adjusted basis, we grew EPS by 5% linked quarter and 8% from the fourth quarter of 2014. This included good operating leverage, with revenues up 4% and expenses up just 2%. We improved the efficiency ratio 135 basis points year-over-year. 
On Slide 9, you can see our NIM was up 1 basis point in the quarter. We've done a good job on growing our loan yields by adjusting our mix and risk appetite and being disciplined on pricing. We were also able to bring interest-bearing deposit costs down by a basis point this quarter. This is a real progress as we sharpen our offerings and pricing strategies. We did lose a basis point given higher cash balances tied to some of the long-term funding we raised in the quarter and the effects of those borrowing costs. 
Now on Slide 10. Noninterest income was up $9 million in the quarter, with momentum in both Consumer and Commercial service charges and fees, driven by progress in our Treasury Solutions initiatives and some seasonality. Capital markets fees were lower than expected given the fixed income market disruption during the quarter. Securities gains ticked up a bit to offset this along with lower other income. Recall that the third quarter included an $8 million brand sale gain. 
Now on Slide 11. As expected, our adjusted expenses were up linked quarter given an increase in technology expense. This was driven by the impact of our new backup data center coming online, along with the implementation of various technology and operations initiatives, to improve offerings and drive future revenue growth. Outside of this growth, we held salaries and benefits costs flat. 
We achieved good loan growth in both Consumer and Commercial during the fourth quarter, which you can see on Pages 13 and 14. In Consumer, growth was paced by continued expansion in mortgage and student and we also grew the other retail category, which includes our unsecured iPhone finance product, which generated $220 million in balances by year-end. We continued to do a nice job of repointing our growth to higher-return categories and the yield in Consumer expanded accordingly 4 basis points in the quarter. 
We also saw nice growth in Commercial, where we grew Commercial Real Estate loans as client relationships added earlier in the year passed their line. We also continued to execute well in Mid-Corporate, Franchise Finance and Corporate finance, which helped to mitigate some of the reductions in middle market as borrowers there continued to reduce line utilization. 
And in all our balance sheet measures on the next couple of pages, we had stronger-than-projected results, which you can see. 
Next, I'd like to take you to Slide 18. Here we show how Citizens performed against guidance we gave back in January of 2015. Overall, the results were largely in line. Balance sheet growth targets were achieved, and while revenue growth was a bit lower than expected largely due to first half NIM compression, we were able to offset that with additional efforts on expenses and favorable credit. 
On Slide 19, we show our progress against our strategic initiatives. Most of this is tracking well. But let me call out a few of the challenges and tell you what we are doing about them. In mortgage, our new Head, Chris Nard, has a clear plan focused on regaining operational excellence following our introduction of a new RESPA- and TILA-compliant origination platform in Q4 last year, which caused a slowdown in our throughput and impacted net recruiting. We believe execution of this plan will position us for a stronger 2016 in hiring, retention and productivity. 
In Wealth, under the new leadership of John Bahnken, we had a strong rebound in recruiting this quarter, only see good hiring momentum as we enter 2016. We will continue to migrate toward some more fee-based model. 
And in Asset Finance, we are positioned -- we are repositioning this as a cross-sell product to our corporate customers in the wake of the loss of the RBS customer referrals. We saw some good progress in Q4. 
So all in all, we posted solid results again this quarter and for the year and we continue to make good progress against our strategic initiatives, efficiency efforts and balance sheet repositioning. We are positioned well as we move into 2016. 
Back to you, Bruce."

I'd like to elevate a little starting up Slide 20 to focus on our goals in turning around Citizens. We aspire to be a top-performing bank that delivers well for its our stakeholders, with serving customers well at the heart of our culture. 
On Slide 21, we show some of the objectives we have within our plan. We made good progress in 2015, pretty much across-the-board, though there's still more to do. We're a work in progress. 
On Slide 22, you can see the financial targets that we laid out and the steady progress we are making in improving our results. 
So with that as a backdrop, let's shift to our outlook on 2016, Slide 23. The markets are off to a rough start so far, but our planning assumption is still for steady U.S. GDP growth, solid loan demand and, say, 1 to 2 more rate hikes coming in July and possibly December. 
To deliver strong performance, we have a few key objectives. We need to sustain robust loan growth and we need to keep NIM stable to trending up on an underlying basis. Rate hikes, if they come, will deliver additional benefit. We need to drive our fee initiatives and we need to deliver better fee growth. And we will need to keep finding ways to constrain expense growth given our plans and necessary investment in growth initiatives. If we do that well, we will again deliver meaningful positive operating leverage that will cover a normalization of provision and it'll drive good growth in earnings. And of course, we want to continue to work down our capital surplus through loan growth, a higher dividend and share repurchases. 
So let's move on now to Slide 25 and our guidance. Eric, back to you."

A few key items I'd call out. Loan growth of 6% to 8%. NII growth of 7% to 10%, with NIM improvement of 6 to 12 bps. The forward curve assumes rate hikes in July and December, which would help us get to the higher end of this range if they occur. Fee growth of 5% to 7%. Expense growth of 2.5% to 3.5% as our efficiency initiatives provided a greater offset to investment spending in 2015 than they will in 2016. Provision normalization to a $375 million to $425 million range, and a CET1 ratio of 11.2% to 11.5%. 
As an overall comment, we expect that we could achieve a better level of revenue growth in 2016 than 2015 due to better performance on NIM and on fees. This will cover a slightly higher expense growth and a modest bump from 4Q provision levels. We've laid out some useful details behind these growth rates on Slides 38 to 40 in the Appendix 2. Please take a look at your leisure. 
On Slide 39, for example, we detailed the impact to NII of the December 2015 rate hike, which is worth $40 million to $50 million and the potential impact of 2 more in 2016 per the forward curve that we used at the time when we concluded our plan, which would be worth $30 million to $40 million. The bulk of this additional benefit is from the July 2016 hike as there is minimal impact from the December '16 hike in the forthcoming year. If we don't get any more hikes, we'll have to pull harder on other NII levers and review expenses to find offsets. 
Also note that the coming dividend on the Fed stock decreases NII by $17 million and cost us $0.02 a share. 
We should also highlight that, on Slide 41, there's an accounting change for cards reward that we make prospectively in 2016, which you will need to factor into your models. 
Our outlook for Q1 is shown on Slide 26, fairly straightforward overall, with some typical seasonal impacts to consider.

And then what I'd say is this past December hike, right, the one that was just a short while ago, literally a month ago, actually gives us a boost of 3 to 5 basis points. Why? Because LIBOR has floated up, commercial loans have started to reprice already and that gives us a little bit of a tailwind. So we have confidence that while there's good work to do, real work to do to continue on the kind of the pricing efforts, the mix and management efforts and the discipline, that the loan growth coupled with the NIM kind of guardrails that were on plus a little bit of tailwind from that December hike, we should be able to continue to deliver good progress on NII growth in the coming year."

And we had -- when you strip out all the noise in Chicago, we had maybe 4% fee growth and we're thinking that we should be able to move that up -- bump that up to 5% to 7% given the investments that we've been making in the product, quality and service in our commercial offerings, and so, for example, cash management in capital markets and global markets and then over in Consumer the additional sales force that we've been hiring in mortgage and Wealth in particular.

But our guidance range of $375 million to $425 million, if you consider that we were at $91 million in Q4, that would annualize to roughly $365 million. And what happens in Q4 is that we continued with a steady level of NCOs around 31 bps and then we started to build the provisions tied to loan growth. And earlier in the year, we had back book cleanup, so we were effectively having credits come through to offset that need to build the reserve and so it was less pronounced earlier in the year. We think that's pretty much run its course, so now what you would expect to see is very, very modest migration on the NCOs, but the need to keep building the reserve because we're going to have a decent level of loan growth that we're calling out here. So that's really what's driving that overall range. We don't see anything dramatic shifting. In the consumer portfolios, maybe a little higher, because our risk appetite has shifted. In commercial, we're keeping our eye, as we said, on energy, but nothing that's rattling us at this point and nothing really broadly across the portfolio is migrating.

I mean, just to share the big picture, right, we are continuing to invest in a disciplined way on expenses, on headcount at the front end -- kind of the front-end sales, and we continue to need to spend some on technology and you see that coming through. But at this past year, we had that real effect of the Top I program and then part of that Top II program coming through and that shows you, on Page 40, a real sizable efficiency save. I think as you look through next year, right, what we're starting to see the continuation of the Top II savings, I think we mapped that out in quite a bit of detail this past summer and there's at least a percentage point of savings that will come from that incremental to 2015 and so we have high confidence there. I think beyond that, we are obviously disciplined as we go. So besides transforming operations and working on procurement, right, there's always the long list of opportunities that we focus on. We've done delayering in the past, but that doesn't mean that we don't go back and make sure that our headcount expansion is very disciplined on the front-end sales and continue to look at some of the middle-office and back-office personnel. So we're going to have to do that. And I think the easy part of that downdraft over and above Top II is that if revenues don't come in certain areas, were it to be mortgages, for example, then you're not paying out commissions, so that naturally falls to the bottom line. Beyond that, though, we're going to have to work hard and find areas to address and you can imagine we don't put a budget like this together without having a list of 3, 4, 5, 6 items that we're already to working on and contingencies that we can call if we don't see the economic activity that we would have anticipated."

And so one of the reasons that we feel confident in our higher revenue outlook is that things like our checkup program and pricing initiatives and the like are giving us some momentum on the revenue front. So you're going to see that and that's a little bit of a difference. We do have a commitment to continuous improvement. And so if there was a Top I and there was a Top II, you can speculate that there might be a Top III coming down the road, but that's the way we want to operate this place, is to constantly look to make sure we're running the bank better and that we're maximizing the utility of every expense and investment dollar that we have. And the last thing I would say is that if the rate hikes don't happen, it's not just an expense lever that we would look to, as I said, in the answer to Jill, there's also the other things, back on Page 39, in terms of can we drive a little more asset growth, can we focus a little more on the mix to try to get the yield up. So I think there's some embedded offsets potentially right in NII to compensate for that. But yes, you're right. Expenses would clearly, if the stock market's saying -- what are they saying? We don't know. It's not always a great leading indicator, but if revenue growth was little hard to come by, you'd certainly have to go back and look at your expenses again."

And over time, we will just be opportunistic on purchases. And as we keep playing offense and putting more originators out there, we'll be able to fully whet our appetite on own originations. But for now, we think we're getting some very high-quality assets that really fit the profile of what we can do on our own and augments that growth rate at a little bit.

We have slowed down the purchase of those SCUSA assets, so that's really more of a maintenance mode as opposed to growing, but we like the relationship with SoFi, which will supplement the loan growth in student. We will -- we expect to see some continued growth in mortgage. We have actually been in a position where our home equity portfolio has been going down a little bit in 2015, but we're reaching that point of that starting to moving back into the growth mode. So we had a very, very strong application and closing quarter in the fourth quarter in home equity. And we'll probably see -- it'll be modest, I think.

In '16, we expect to see some more growth in the Middle Market. We did quite a lot of hiring across our Middle Market teams last year and it's taken a little while for those new bankers to begin to ramp and to begin to get traction, so we expect to continue to see good growth where we saw it in '15 and get a little bit of incremental growth out of our Mid Market channels. So overall, we're expecting to grow slightly lower than 10% in terms of loan and interest growth.

So there will be a few drivers that dictate where that program goes: Do you expand that beyond just the Apple Store? Do they launch new products? Do you extend the program beyond just the current model following, so forth? So I guess, the way I would sum that up is we would certainly expect to see volume. We're 1 quarter of growth. We're 1 quarter in and we generated $220 million. So you're certainly going to see growth. There is some question is to how fast that growth will be given some of those parameters. We're very pleased with the program. We think we've provided a very good customer experience. Can't speak for Apple, but I think they would say the same.

A couple of years ago, we began to move into the construction lending business, which is higher margin. So we have seen our margins in real estate on a blended basis go up and we expect to continue to see that. As I think Eric mentioned, we have done a lot of business over the last 2 or 3 years with very targeted sponsors and very targeted NSAs on the construction side. And we've only just started to fund a lot of that. So there is some embedded growth in the book that we expect to see just as projects mature and we begin to fund up commitments that we've made already. We think we can grow the construction business at between a little over 10% as we move into 2016. We're seeing good flows.

So I mean, let me just kind of give you some directional information. If you think about some of the core portfolios that we have, I think we said previously and I'll reemphasize that as we have grown in Industry Verticals, Middle Market and Franchise Finance, we tend to put yields on that are higher than the portfolio to the tune of 30 to 40 basis points. It moves around quite a bit by quarter, but you get good benefit there that actually average up your yields. And that's actually been part of the reason why we've been able to held yields steady in commercial. You also get a bit of an uptick in Asset Finance, that's worth kind of 10 basis points over the average portfolio. And then the areas where you get a little less, Commercial Real Estate, you get a less, 10 basis points, but I think we -- for the right risk return, we feel like there is good economics there. And something like Mid-Corporate, which we did not emphasize as much because it tends to be higher-grade clients, right, probably you'll get demerit of 30 to 40 basis points in your loan origination, but more cross-sell, right, and bigger wallet into which to cross-sell. So there's kind of a mix of facts and that's in a way the texture that we use as the management team. We guide where do we want to emphasize, how much do we want to invest in these different areas. Don mentioned from the hiring in Middle Market quite obviously for us to hire and to continue to strengthen because of that 30 to 40 basis point lift that we get and the cross-sell that comes with that, whether it's deposits our cash management and that's kind of part of the, I guess, the tool set and the specificity of which we are -- we're carefully driving growth margin and getting the NIMs of where we like it to be."

As expected, right, the first hike has not resulted in a lot of movement in rate, right? That was the speculation everyone had, which is the Fed moves and there is all sorts of shift, right, but let me kind of decompose for you. On the retail side, there is little, even no movement. There's actually been a few downticks in a few geographies and obviously, we look at everything. We look at every geography, every city. We're looking at the online players and we're looking at the community banks and it's actually been very, very quiet there. And so that gives us some confidence that the betas that we've been talking about are sound, and as you recall, the betas are kind of over the cycle betas, right. So the beta on retail is going to be quite low for the first rate hike for the first couple of quarters. So that, I think, bodes well for us. On the commercial side, there's always the job owning because commercial clients have their loans repricing on LIBOR and some of them come back on deposits and obviously, that's the business we're in. I think -- there is -- there wasn't much change in December with what you saw, a little bit in January. And I think as you see the month play through, February and March, we'll have some amount of uptick and so it could be a little bit, but you're talking a handful of basis points on that side. And so if you look at it, we actually have some confidence we'll deliver good deposit pricing in the first quarter, right, with some nice corresponding uptick on loan yields, right, because those on the commercial side [indiscernible] LIBOR."

So I think, we will from time-to-time be making repositioning decisions in the portfolio and if we kind of cough up $5 million or $10 million here and there, that's, I think, ongoing income that we would expect to see. So -- yes, so the noninterest in guidance covers the whole category. When we strip out some of the, like onetimers, like the impact of Chicago, we think we grew about 4% last year. And the 5% -- 7% growth guidance is really where do you get the uptick? I think if you look for the uptick where the rebound in capital markets, hopefully, that market stabilizes in the leverage credit markets and that won't be a drag the way it was in Q4. And we're building at our product capabilities. So as we moved away from RBS, we've had to add our own capabilities and we were sharing some of those dollars with RBS and now those dollars go 100% to us and we get our broker dealer set up and then we move off on to our own FX and derivatives platform. There’s additional revenue opportunities that come from that. We've invested in the cash management business and are doing a better job of cross-selling. We have gone out and hired more sales resources, that get better penetration of our whole product set, so we see some good upside on the commercial side. And similarly on consumer, if we can get the mortgage business going and I'd say we took a little pause here in the fourth quarter as we had to move and focus on our system and the RESPA/TILA compliance, I think that bodes well and will provide some lift. And then wealth. We were very underpenetrated in wealth. And I think we had a great recruiting quarter in Q4. We got in 12 FCs, best quarter we've had in the long, long time. Coincidentally or not, we've had a new head of wealth, who we have high hopes for. So in both mortgage and wealth, we have new leadership, and I think both have hit the ground running. So I think it's a bit across the board and, yes, you're right, it would be great if we could exceed 5% to 7%, but I think fees in general in the industry have been a little sluggish in the environment. And so I think we're just being measured and hopefully that's a range that we can step up from 4% and getting into that 5% to 7%. Eric, do you want to add anything?"

So that's the kind of the anchor point, that $5 million to $6 million off. Now that wasn't there in the first 3 quarters of this year, right, but should flow through consistently for 4 quarters next year and that's the basis. If there are little more in that fee increase besides the $5 million to $6 million? There's probably a little more, but I think we've seen the bulk of it. And now, we're kind of back in parity levels of fees, right? We're not trying to exceed; we're just trying to catch up for not having repriced in 4 or 5 years.

I think in retail -- let me actually do the top of the house thing. In top of the house, we've actually had a focus on increasing over the last couple of months and quarters leading with non-price-driven offers and really focusing on that core DDA and what we call checking with interest, right, which is really checking with a low amount of interest. And we've been doing that on the commercial side, on the consumer side. Part of that's the cash management product, which is a low EPR, and that's actually been growing nicely. If you actually look at the statistics for DDA and checking with interest on the balance sheet, those are up 2% quarter-on-quarter, 6% year-on-year. And you can actually go back and you can see DDA has been up for the last 3 quarters in a row, checking with interest the last 4 quarters in the row. So we're seeing the kind of engagement with clients in an non-price-driven way that we've laid. Now we need to keep doing that and that needs to be an ongoing focus and part of what you have heard about the cash management investments is functionality and part of what we continue to do on consumer is roll out revised and improved value propositions to really draw clients in. And that's what I would call the heart of what we do on deposits. I think the other part of the deposit question is there's always a little bit of price-oriented deposits out there, and we, like any bank, take those. Why? Because they are from our clients. Our clients are only funding with us. The issue is, how do you do that in a disciplined way and so in commercial, with Don arriving, we've gone back to some of the large pools of deposits that we put on post the Chicago divestiture a year ago. Those were effectively promotional deposits and back in September, after the Fed didn't go, right? Remember in September the Fed didn't go, that was a natural construct to kind of take those off those old promotional rates. And then obviously, we matched a little bit of attrition, but then we reset and can grow off of a comfortable level. And that's where we've really done in commercial and then emphasized the work that the sales force needs to do on a cross-sell basis and that's segmented in a nearer base that's probably too long to describe here. On the Retail side we something similar. We're quite disciplined region-by-region and with Brad's team, where they are thinking about? Where are there opportunities to continue what we do on money market? As we can see, we pulled back on CDs, much like the rest of the industry does and has been doing, and I think that's been fruitful. So all told, I think, a real nice performance. Across the front on interest-bearing deposits down a bit, it's great to see. We'd obviously -- we'll keep pushing on that front."

So I would say over time, we're clearly looking to get back to the pack and so if our peers are running at 10 or 10.5, there's no reason we shouldn't run where the peers are running. Once we're kind of fully operating where you want to operate and our returns or where we want them to be, it is -- I think we do look at the opportunity to buy back the stock and where it's trading and it's attractive here, we think. And so that will be factored into our thinking, but I just wanted to give you, kind of the guard rails are we're coming down on a gradual glide path and it's somewhat also dictated by how fast we can get the ROE up and generate more capital and then we don't need that cushion."

We could get a wildcard there that hopefully is a positive surprise, because I think we're being moderate in terms of how we're looking at that. And then on the commercial side, really there'd be more cyclicality, would be the concern if the stock market is prestaging concern over a slowdown and, therefore, corporate CEOs and CFOs decide to pull back a little bit on investing or on line utilization, then that could have an impact, but maybe Don, you want to add?"

The thing that's been our challenge and we've spent a lot of time on this call talking about it is, how can we make sure that we're improving our asset yields and then growing deposits cost effectively? I think it took us a little while to really establish a rhythm on that, but the good news is if you look at the second half of the last year, in 2015, we actually moved the NIM up by 5 basis points. So I think we're doing a better job at that. Some of that, I'll give the credit to the guy on the right here, Eric, for really driving that and spearheading that. But that's the thing that we really have to focus on. We can't have any leakage. So last year, if we grew loans at 7 and we grew NII at 4, we have to -- if we grow loans at 7, I want to grow NII at 7 plus.

And I think one of the interesting things that I see at Citizens is just the core diversification in the portfolio given that it's a mid-market lending activity predominantly is very, very great both on a geographic basis, on an industry basis and on an individual credit basis.

2015 was a year of significant progress for Citizens. We completed our separation from RBS, becoming fully independent in late October. Our financial progress was in line with expectations and guidance in spite of a lower rate environment than anticipated. We achieved good loan and deposit growth. We delivered positive operating leverage as savings from our efficiency initiatives kept expenses flat notwithstanding significant investments in growth areas and in technology. We made strides in improving our product offerings and service quality, and customer satisfaction is trending upwards. We hired some great talent including Eric and Don, right here with me, and we had some great new initiatives on the colleague front like leadership development and career mapping. Our risk management capabilities continue to strengthen. We had a good result on CCAR and we're working hard to achieve the regulators' heightened standards. And we continue to deliver enhanced technology capabilities including a new backup data center, a new mortgage platform and expanded online and mobile capabilities. 
So all in all, solid performance on all dimensions, tracking well against our turnaround plan. 
We ended the year with a good fourth quarter, and we feel good about our trajectory as we head into 2016. In Q4, we achieved good loan growth as well as good NII and fee growth. We had expected to do even better, but the leverage credit markets became challenged during Q4, disrupting some of our capital markets pipeline. Hopefully, that market will come back later in Q1. Expenses increased modestly given technology-related spend and $6 million of costs largely associated with our growth and efficiency initiatives. 
Additionally, our credit provision grew by $15 million versus Q3 due to a reserve build. Earlier this year, we had seen back book improvements offset our reserve build tied to loan growth, but the back book is now so clean that we don't expect to see much of that continue. 
The balance sheet remains robust, with excellent capital, liquidity and funding position and strong ratios and metrics. 
For the full year, highlights include 13% adjusted EPS growth, positive operating leverage of 3%, 8% average loan growth and tangible book value per share growth of 5%, all of which, I might add, compare very favorably with peers. 
So now I'd like to turn it over to Eric to give a little more color on the financials. Eric?"

Since Bruce hit some of the highlights, let me direct you to a few pages in our slide deck for some color on Q4. 
On Slide 6, on an adjusted basis, we grew EPS by 5% linked quarter and 8% from the fourth quarter of 2014. This included good operating leverage, with revenues up 4% and expenses up just 2%. We improved the efficiency ratio 135 basis points year-over-year. 
On Slide 9, you can see our NIM was up 1 basis point in the quarter. We've done a good job on growing our loan yields by adjusting our mix and risk appetite and being disciplined on pricing. We were also able to bring interest-bearing deposit costs down by a basis point this quarter. This is a real progress as we sharpen our offerings and pricing strategies. We did lose a basis point given higher cash balances tied to some of the long-term funding we raised in the quarter and the effects of those borrowing costs. 
Now on Slide 10. Noninterest income was up $9 million in the quarter, with momentum in both Consumer and Commercial service charges and fees, driven by progress in our Treasury Solutions initiatives and some seasonality. Capital markets fees were lower than expected given the fixed income market disruption during the quarter. Securities gains ticked up a bit to offset this along with lower other income. Recall that the third quarter included an $8 million brand sale gain. 
Now on Slide 11. As expected, our adjusted expenses were up linked quarter given an increase in technology expense. This was driven by the impact of our new backup data center coming online, along with the implementation of various technology and operations initiatives, to improve offerings and drive future revenue growth. Outside of this growth, we held salaries and benefits costs flat. 
We achieved good loan growth in both Consumer and Commercial during the fourth quarter, which you can see on Pages 13 and 14. In Consumer, growth was paced by continued expansion in mortgage and student and we also grew the other retail category, which includes our unsecured iPhone finance product, which generated $220 million in balances by year-end. We continued to do a nice job of repointing our growth to higher-return categories and the yield in Consumer expanded accordingly 4 basis points in the quarter. 
We also saw nice growth in Commercial, where we grew Commercial Real Estate loans as client relationships added earlier in the year passed their line. We also continued to execute well in Mid-Corporate, Franchise Finance and Corporate finance, which helped to mitigate some of the reductions in middle market as borrowers there continued to reduce line utilization. 
And in all our balance sheet measures on the next couple of pages, we had stronger-than-projected results, which you can see. 
Next, I'd like to take you to Slide 18. Here we show how Citizens performed against guidance we gave back in January of 2015. Overall, the results were largely in line. Balance sheet growth targets were achieved, and while revenue growth was a bit lower than expected largely due to first half NIM compression, we were able to offset that with additional efforts on expenses and favorable credit. 
On Slide 19, we show our progress against our strategic initiatives. Most of this is tracking well. But let me call out a few of the challenges and tell you what we are doing about them. In mortgage, our new Head, Chris Nard, has a clear plan focused on regaining operational excellence following our introduction of a new RESPA- and TILA-compliant origination platform in Q4 last year, which caused a slowdown in our throughput and impacted net recruiting. We believe execution of this plan will position us for a stronger 2016 in hiring, retention and productivity. 
In Wealth, under the new leadership of John Bahnken, we had a strong rebound in recruiting this quarter, only see good hiring momentum as we enter 2016. We will continue to migrate toward some more fee-based model. 
And in Asset Finance, we are positioned -- we are repositioning this as a cross-sell product to our corporate customers in the wake of the loss of the RBS customer referrals. We saw some good progress in Q4. 
So all in all, we posted solid results again this quarter and for the year and we continue to make good progress against our strategic initiatives, efficiency efforts and balance sheet repositioning. We are positioned well as we move into 2016. 
Back to you, Bruce."

I'd like to elevate a little starting up Slide 20 to focus on our goals in turning around Citizens. We aspire to be a top-performing bank that delivers well for its our stakeholders, with serving customers well at the heart of our culture. 
On Slide 21, we show some of the objectives we have within our plan. We made good progress in 2015, pretty much across-the-board, though there's still more to do. We're a work in progress. 
On Slide 22, you can see the financial targets that we laid out and the steady progress we are making in improving our results. 
So with that as a backdrop, let's shift to our outlook on 2016, Slide 23. The markets are off to a rough start so far, but our planning assumption is still for steady U.S. GDP growth, solid loan demand and, say, 1 to 2 more rate hikes coming in July and possibly December. 
To deliver strong performance, we have a few key objectives. We need to sustain robust loan growth and we need to keep NIM stable to trending up on an underlying basis. Rate hikes, if they come, will deliver additional benefit. We need to drive our fee initiatives and we need to deliver better fee growth. And we will need to keep finding ways to constrain expense growth given our plans and necessary investment in growth initiatives. If we do that well, we will again deliver meaningful positive operating leverage that will cover a normalization of provision and it'll drive good growth in earnings. And of course, we want to continue to work down our capital surplus through loan growth, a higher dividend and share repurchases. 
So let's move on now to Slide 25 and our guidance. Eric, back to you."

A few key items I'd call out. Loan growth of 6% to 8%. NII growth of 7% to 10%, with NIM improvement of 6 to 12 bps. The forward curve assumes rate hikes in July and December, which would help us get to the higher end of this range if they occur. Fee growth of 5% to 7%. Expense growth of 2.5% to 3.5% as our efficiency initiatives provided a greater offset to investment spending in 2015 than they will in 2016. Provision normalization to a $375 million to $425 million range, and a CET1 ratio of 11.2% to 11.5%. 
As an overall comment, we expect that we could achieve a better level of revenue growth in 2016 than 2015 due to better performance on NIM and on fees. This will cover a slightly higher expense growth and a modest bump from 4Q provision levels. We've laid out some useful details behind these growth rates on Slides 38 to 40 in the Appendix 2. Please take a look at your leisure. 
On Slide 39, for example, we detailed the impact to NII of the December 2015 rate hike, which is worth $40 million to $50 million and the potential impact of 2 more in 2016 per the forward curve that we used at the time when we concluded our plan, which would be worth $30 million to $40 million. The bulk of this additional benefit is from the July 2016 hike as there is minimal impact from the December '16 hike in the forthcoming year. If we don't get any more hikes, we'll have to pull harder on other NII levers and review expenses to find offsets. 
Also note that the coming dividend on the Fed stock decreases NII by $17 million and cost us $0.02 a share. 
We should also highlight that, on Slide 41, there's an accounting change for cards reward that we make prospectively in 2016, which you will need to factor into your models. 
Our outlook for Q1 is shown on Slide 26, fairly straightforward overall, with some typical seasonal impacts to consider.

So when we finish the plan, we had used the forward curve, which had one in July and one in December. The one in December doesn't really help '16; it's going to help '17. So if the one in July happens, it's good for us. If it doesn't happen, we have a range there that we were counting on, $30 million to $40 million of benefit, and if -- that's a manageable number. I mean, that's -- we'll have to pull the levers harder on either earning asset growth, or you can see right there, or loan mix and yields or go back and look at expenses. And so -- anyway, it's -- it would be a tailwind if it happens. It puts us closer to the higher end in the range, makes it easier, maybe it gives us 1% if it happens.

You actually saw that tick up a couple basis points from 2Q to 3Q, another basis point from 3Q to 4Q. And so the plan is pretty straightforward. We continue to grow loans, we continue to grow average assets -- earning assets and we hold NIM flattish to up a bit as we leg in to some of that mix shift that you see us doing, in particular, on Consumer. And then what I'd say is this past December hike, right, the one that was just a short while ago, literally a month ago, actually gives us a boost of 3 to 5 basis points. Why? Because LIBOR has floated up, commercial loans have started to reprice already and that gives us a little bit of a tailwind. So we have confidence that while there's good work to do, real work to do to continue on the kind of the pricing efforts, the mix and management efforts and the discipline, that the loan growth coupled with the NIM kind of guardrails that were on plus a little bit of tailwind from that December hike, we should be able to continue to deliver good progress on NII growth in the coming year."

But our guidance range of $375 million to $425 million, if you consider that we were at $91 million in Q4, that would annualize to roughly $365 million. And what happens in Q4 is that we continued with a steady level of NCOs around 31 bps and then we started to build the provisions tied to loan growth. And earlier in the year, we had back book cleanup, so we were effectively having credits come through to offset that need to build the reserve and so it was less pronounced earlier in the year. We think that's pretty much run its course, so now what you would expect to see is very, very modest migration on the NCOs, but the need to keep building the reserve because we're going to have a decent level of loan growth that we're calling out here. So that's really what's driving that overall range. We don't see anything dramatic shifting. In the consumer portfolios, maybe a little higher, because our risk appetite has shifted.

And then should the rate outlook not pan out as the forward curve had suggested, where are maybe some places that you'd have additional leverage on the cost side that you'd be thinking about at least initially?"

I mean, just to share the big picture, right, we are continuing to invest in a disciplined way on expenses, on headcount at the front end -- kind of the front-end sales, and we continue to need to spend some on technology and you see that coming through. But at this past year, we had that real effect of the Top I program and then part of that Top II program coming through and that shows you, on Page 40, a real sizable efficiency save. I think as you look through next year, right, what we're starting to see the continuation of the Top II savings, I think we mapped that out in quite a bit of detail this past summer and there's at least a percentage point of savings that will come from that incremental to 2015 and so we have high confidence there. I think beyond that, we are obviously disciplined as we go. So besides transforming operations and working on procurement, right, there's always the long list of opportunities that we focus on. We've done delayering in the past, but that doesn't mean that we don't go back and make sure that our headcount expansion is very disciplined on the front-end sales and continue to look at some of the middle-office and back-office personnel. So we're going to have to do that. And I think the easy part of that downdraft over and above Top II is that if revenues don't come in certain areas, were it to be mortgages, for example, then you're not paying out commissions, so that naturally falls to the bottom line. Beyond that, though, we're going to have to work hard and find areas to address and you can imagine we don't put a budget like this together without having a list of 3, 4, 5, 6 items that we're already to working on and contingencies that we can call if we don't see the economic activity that we would have anticipated."

And so one of the reasons that we feel confident in our higher revenue outlook is that things like our checkup program and pricing initiatives and the like are giving us some momentum on the revenue front. So you're going to see that and that's a little bit of a difference. We do have a commitment to continuous improvement. And so if there was a Top I and there was a Top II, you can speculate that there might be a Top III coming down the road, but that's the way we want to operate this place, is to constantly look to make sure we're running the bank better and that we're maximizing the utility of every expense and investment dollar that we have. And the last thing I would say is that if the rate hikes don't happen, it's not just an expense lever that we would look to, as I said, in the answer to Jill, there's also the other things, back on Page 39, in terms of can we drive a little more asset growth, can we focus a little more on the mix to try to get the yield up. So I think there's some embedded offsets potentially right in NII to compensate for that. But yes, you're right. Expenses would clearly, if the stock market's saying -- what are they saying? We don't know. It's not always a great leading indicator, but if revenue growth was little hard to come by, you'd certainly have to go back and look at your expenses again."

And it started out being more purchase of auto, and as we ramped up our own capabilities in prime auto origination, we've scaled back the auto purchases. We still like the student space and we struck a relationship with SoFi and so we now are purchasing some student loans and fewer auto loans. So I would expect to broadly see that. And over time, we will just be opportunistic on purchases. And as we keep playing offense and putting more originators out there, we'll be able to fully whet our appetite on own originations. But for now, we think we're getting some very high-quality assets that really fit the profile of what we can do on our own and augments that growth rate at a little bit. So that, maybe I could -- and I'd say the other thing is that we're pretty balanced in terms of the growth coming between Consumer and Commercial, you can see that in Q4.

We have slowed down the purchase of those SCUSA assets, so that's really more of a maintenance mode as opposed to growing, but we like the relationship with SoFi, which will supplement the loan growth in student. We will -- we expect to see some continued growth in mortgage. We have actually been in a position where our home equity portfolio has been going down a little bit in 2015, but we're reaching that point of that starting to moving back into the growth mode. So we had a very, very strong application and closing quarter in the fourth quarter in home equity. And we'll probably see -- it'll be modest, I think. We will probably see some growth in home equity.

So we saw solid double-digit growth in all of those verticals while also keeping a good pricing discipline and a good credit discipline, which I think is the balancing act that we will continue to focus on in 2016. In '16, we expect to see some more growth in the Middle Market. We did quite a lot of hiring across our Middle Market teams last year and it's taken a little while for those new bankers to begin to ramp and to begin to get traction, so we expect to continue to see good growth where we saw it in '15 and get a little bit of incremental growth out of our Mid Market channels. So overall, we're expecting to grow slightly lower than 10% in terms of loan and interest growth. And the other thing we think we will see in '16 is even more acceleration in the fee lines as we begin to take advantage of some of these investments that we've made around capital markets and treasury services in particular."

I think Eric had mentioned in his comments we ended the year at $220 million in balances and you would expect to continue to see that to grow. I would tell you it's a little hard to pin down exactly where we see it going for a couple of reasons: we're actually somewhat limited in the scope of that initiative today in that it's available only in the Apple Store and it's only available for the current model. So there will be a few drivers that dictate where that program goes: Do you expand that beyond just the Apple Store? Do they launch new products? Do you extend the program beyond just the current model following, so forth? So I guess, the way I would sum that up is we would certainly expect to see volume. We're 1 quarter of growth. We're 1 quarter in and we generated $220 million. So you're certainly going to see growth. There is some question is to how fast that growth will be given some of those parameters. We're very pleased with the program. We think we've provided a very good customer experience. Can't speak for Apple, but I think they would say the same.

A couple of years ago, we began to move into the construction lending business, which is higher margin. So we have seen our margins in real estate on a blended basis go up and we expect to continue to see that. As I think Eric mentioned, we have done a lot of business over the last 2 or 3 years with very targeted sponsors and very targeted NSAs on the construction side. And we've only just started to fund a lot of that. So there is some embedded growth in the book that we expect to see just as projects mature and we begin to fund up commitments that we've made already. We think we can grow the construction business at between a little over 10% as we move into 2016. We're seeing good flows. I expect the REIT business to stay roughly flattish and that's below our lower margin business. So I think you'll see blended growth of slightly under 10% and margin uptick as we roll through '16.

So I mean, let me just kind of give you some directional information. If you think about some of the core portfolios that we have, I think we said previously and I'll reemphasize that as we have grown in Industry Verticals, Middle Market and Franchise Finance, we tend to put yields on that are higher than the portfolio to the tune of 30 to 40 basis points. It moves around quite a bit by quarter, but you get good benefit there that actually average up your yields. And that's actually been part of the reason why we've been able to held yields steady in commercial. You also get a bit of an uptick in Asset Finance, that's worth kind of 10 basis points over the average portfolio. And then the areas where you get a little less, Commercial Real Estate, you get a less, 10 basis points, but I think we -- for the right risk return, we feel like there is good economics there. And something like Mid-Corporate, which we did not emphasize as much because it tends to be higher-grade clients, right, probably you'll get demerit of 30 to 40 basis points in your loan origination, but more cross-sell, right, and bigger wallet into which to cross-sell. So there's kind of a mix of facts and that's in a way the texture that we use as the management team. We guide where do we want to emphasize, how much do we want to invest in these different areas. Don mentioned from the hiring in Middle Market quite obviously for us to hire and to continue to strengthen because of that 30 to 40 basis point lift that we get and the cross-sell that comes with that, whether it's deposits our cash management and that's kind of part of the, I guess, the tool set and the specificity of which we are -- we're carefully driving growth margin and getting the NIMs of where we like it to be."

And so that gives us some confidence that the betas that we've been talking about are sound, and as you recall, the betas are kind of over the cycle betas, right. So the beta on retail is going to be quite low for the first rate hike for the first couple of quarters. So that, I think, bodes well for us. On the commercial side, there's always the job owning because commercial clients have their loans repricing on LIBOR and some of them come back on deposits and obviously, that's the business we're in. I think -- there is -- there wasn't much change in December with what you saw, a little bit in January. And I think as you see the month play through, February and March, we'll have some amount of uptick and so it could be a little bit, but you're talking a handful of basis points on that side. And so if you look at it, we actually have some confidence we'll deliver good deposit pricing in the first quarter, right, with some nice corresponding uptick on loan yields, right, because those on the commercial side [indiscernible] LIBOR."

So I think, we will from time-to-time be making repositioning decisions in the portfolio and if we kind of cough up $5 million or $10 million here and there, that's, I think, ongoing income that we would expect to see. So -- yes, so the noninterest in guidance covers the whole category. When we strip out some of the, like onetimers, like the impact of Chicago, we think we grew about 4% last year. And the 5% -- 7% growth guidance is really where do you get the uptick? I think if you look for the uptick where the rebound in capital markets, hopefully, that market stabilizes in the leverage credit markets and that won't be a drag the way it was in Q4. And we're building at our product capabilities. So as we moved away from RBS, we've had to add our own capabilities and we were sharing some of those dollars with RBS and now those dollars go 100% to us and we get our broker dealer set up and then we move off on to our own FX and derivatives platform. There’s additional revenue opportunities that come from that. We've invested in the cash management business and are doing a better job of cross-selling. We have gone out and hired more sales resources, that get better penetration of our whole product set, so we see some good upside on the commercial side. And similarly on consumer, if we can get the mortgage business going and I'd say we took a little pause here in the fourth quarter as we had to move and focus on our system and the RESPA/TILA compliance, I think that bodes well and will provide some lift. And then wealth. We were very underpenetrated in wealth. And I think we had a great recruiting quarter in Q4. We got in 12 FCs, best quarter we've had in the long, long time. Coincidentally or not, we've had a new head of wealth, who we have high hopes for. So in both mortgage and wealth, we have new leadership, and I think both have hit the ground running. So I think it's a bit across the board and, yes, you're right, it would be great if we could exceed 5% to 7%, but I think fees in general in the industry have been a little sluggish in the environment. And so I think we're just being measured and hopefully that's a range that we can step up from 4% and getting into that 5% to 7%. Eric, do you want to add anything?"

So that's the kind of the anchor point, that $5 million to $6 million off. Now that wasn't there in the first 3 quarters of this year, right, but should flow through consistently for 4 quarters next year and that's the basis. If there are little more in that fee increase besides the $5 million to $6 million? There's probably a little more, but I think we've seen the bulk of it.

I think in retail -- let me actually do the top of the house thing. In top of the house, we've actually had a focus on increasing over the last couple of months and quarters leading with non-price-driven offers and really focusing on that core DDA and what we call checking with interest, right, which is really checking with a low amount of interest. And we've been doing that on the commercial side, on the consumer side. Part of that's the cash management product, which is a low EPR, and that's actually been growing nicely. If you actually look at the statistics for DDA and checking with interest on the balance sheet, those are up 2% quarter-on-quarter, 6% year-on-year. And you can actually go back and you can see DDA has been up for the last 3 quarters in a row, checking with interest the last 4 quarters in the row. So we're seeing the kind of engagement with clients in an non-price-driven way that we've laid. Now we need to keep doing that and that needs to be an ongoing focus and part of what you have heard about the cash management investments is functionality and part of what we continue to do on consumer is roll out revised and improved value propositions to really draw clients in. And that's what I would call the heart of what we do on deposits. I think the other part of the deposit question is there's always a little bit of price-oriented deposits out there, and we, like any bank, take those. Why? Because they are from our clients. Our clients are only funding with us. The issue is, how do you do that in a disciplined way and so in commercial, with Don arriving, we've gone back to some of the large pools of deposits that we put on post the Chicago divestiture a year ago. Those were effectively promotional deposits and back in September, after the Fed didn't go, right? Remember in September the Fed didn't go, that was a natural construct to kind of take those off those old promotional rates. And then obviously, we matched a little bit of attrition, but then we reset and can grow off of a comfortable level. And that's where we've really done in commercial and then emphasized the work that the sales force needs to do on a cross-sell basis and that's segmented in a nearer base that's probably too long to describe here. On the Retail side we something similar. We're quite disciplined region-by-region and with Brad's team, where they are thinking about? Where are there opportunities to continue what we do on money market? As we can see, we pulled back on CDs, much like the rest of the industry does and has been doing, and I think that's been fruitful. So all told, I think, a real nice performance. Across the front on interest-bearing deposits down a bit, it's great to see. We'd obviously -- we'll keep pushing on that front."

I want to make sure that we're taking full advantage of the opportunities to add customers and grow the franchise, and it's good to have a little bit of cushion there in the overall capital ratios while -- until -- and that helps speed the ROE. It's kind of a circle. So if we get our ROE up, then we don't need as much of a surplus. So I would say over time, we're clearly looking to get back to the pack and so if our peers are running at 10 or 10.5, there's no reason we shouldn't run where the peers are running. Once we're kind of fully operating where you want to operate and our returns or where we want them to be, it is -- I think we do look at the opportunity to buy back the stock and where it's trading and it's attractive here, we think. And so that will be factored into our thinking, but I just wanted to give you, kind of the guard rails are we're coming down on a gradual glide path and it's somewhat also dictated by how fast we can get the ROE up and generate more capital and then we don't need that cushion."

And we obviously did that through '15 and have seen very modest deterioration in credit grades. So that's usually your early signal, that you start to see people missing covenants and people having financial deterioration. The other thing in my past has been, what really tends to hurt institutions is concentrations. And we do have a very rigorous concentration management system. And I think one of the interesting things that I see at Citizens is just the core diversification in the portfolio given that it's a mid-market lending activity predominantly is very, very great both on a geographic basis, on an industry basis and on an individual credit basis. So I think there is a little bit of hedge in the overall portfolio also. So we would look for credit deterioration in terms of credit grades, we'd look at any concentrations in the industries that are troubled as flash -- as things that would flash early to us and we are not seeing them to any extent at this moment."

Q1 was another good quarter for Citizens. Let me briefly cover you bring a few of the highlights. We were pleased that we continue to achieve good loan growth, while bringing new customers into the bank. We're doing a good job of delivering better risk-adjusted model and in managing our deposit costs. As a result, our net interest margin was up 9 basis points versus Q4 with half the benefit resulting from the December rate hike and half coming from our own actions. This strength in net interest income was partly offset by weakness in 3 categories, which is partly the result of seasonality, partly market conditions and partly some challenges in getting full traction on a couple of initiatives. That said, we're addressing the underlying challenges and we're hopeful that market conditions are improving as the year goes on.
Our discipline around expenses remain excellent. We have a mindset of continuous improvement and we recycle savings to fund investments to our growth initiatives. I was pleased that our tangible book value per share grew by 2% sequentially to $25.21 and that we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.12 per share. Our CET1 capital ratio remains very robust at 11.6%. Our credit metrics remain strong and stable an increase in NPAs and reserves related to the S&C review of oil and gas loans was largely offset by improvements in retial loans, including TER sale that Eric will fill you on in a minute. We feel a oil and gas exposure is modest and it's well reserved. We continue to focus on delivering well for all of our stakeholder groups, including customers, colleagues and communities. I continue to see good progress across the board. In addition, we're focused on improving our risk and regulatory capabilities and feel we put forth a strong effort on our CCAR submission. With that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through our financials in more detail. Eric?"

In the first quarter, we continue to make progress around our growth, efficiency and balance sheet initiatives. We're managing the balance sheet to generate attractive loan and deposit growth and actively managing them. We continue to control cost and deliver strong operating leverage. And once again, credit costs well behaved as we navigate through the current economic environment. My comments this morning refer to first quarter 2016 earnings presentation, which you could find at investor.citizensbank.com. Let's start on Page 4 with the first quarter financial summary where me provide GAAP results of $223 million and $0.41 a share. On Page 5, on a linked-quarter basis, GAAP net income of $223 million was flat to the fourth quarter on strong NII seasonally like fees, flat expensive and stable provision. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, net income increased $8 million or 4% with diluted EPS growth of 5%, driven by positive operating leverage of 3%. On a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue by $51 million or 4%. Net interest income of $904 million increased 8%, reflecting strong average loan growth. Noninterest income declined $17 million or 5% as growth in-service charges and fees were more than offset by lower mortgage banking fees and the impact of accounting change. 
Year-over-year, we continue to make measurable progress against our goal of enhancing our efficiencies, while reinvesting in the franchise. Expenses were up only 1%. Our efficiency ratio of 66% improved 2% relative to the first quarter of last year. Provision was up $33 million on an year-over-year basis, but first quarter 2015 included the benefit of large commercial recoveries of $22 million. Importantly, credit cost also remain stable linked quarter as commercial credit began to normalize and we saw including trends in our retail book. Note that tangible book value per share is now $25.21, up 2% relative to year-end 2015. 
Let's move on to Page 6. We saw a nice lift in net interest income this quarter, which was up $34 million or 4% from fourth quarter on the back of 9 basis points of NIM expansion. We continue to generate attractive average loan growth of 2%, with strength in commercial, student and mortgages. 
On an year-over-year basis, net interest income increased $68 million or 8%, due to strong average loan growth of 7%. These results also reflects our improving net interest margin. So as you can see on Page 7, our net interest margin increased 9 basis points on a linked quarter as our loan yield expanded, given the benefit of the December fed rate increase and we continue to shift our mix to higher-yielding asset classes. We were also able to hold deposit cost flat, notwithstanding the fed rate increase on average across our businesses. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of lower federal results stock dividend. The margin expansion this quarter came in a bit stronger than we had anticipated. While loan yield growth same LIBOR and prime rate, our deposit cost remained low. Specifically, we consciously lowered pricing of consumer interest during deposits down on 4 basis points as we saw good DDA growth. 
Commercial deposit costs did move up in response to fed tightening, less than expected. But we do expect deposits to creep up in the future and beat us to normalize. We were quite pleased the results we produced this quarter. We'll provide some more color on our NIM expectations for the second quarter shortly as we are also keeping a close watch on the long end of the yield curve. 
Relative to the first quarter of 2015, net interest margin also expanded 9 basis points, benefited by improved loan and mix and more efficient investment portfolio, partially offset by higher borrowing costs. We maintained a stable asset-sensitive position and ended the quarter at 6.9% compared with fourth quarter 2015 at approximately 6.1%. 
On Slide 8, let's take a closer look at noninterest income. Our linked-quarter results reflect both normal seasonality and service charges and card fees as well as some continued pressure from the market volatility in investment services, interest rate products and foreign exchange. These actually map the rebounding in our Capital Markets  fees. I need to remind that our results also reflect a $7 million decrease in card fees related to the expense accounting change we discussed last quarter. Without this change, card fees would have been down $3 million linked quarter, but up $5 million year-over-year or up 8%. 
On a year-over-year basis, we posted 7% growth in service charges and fees, driven by both continued house-hold growth as well as our Treasury Solutions pricing initiatives in both commercial and business banking. Investment service fees were up year-over-year, notwithstanding the recent market volatility and we now seen 2 strong quarters of hiring we should help drive future growth. 
In mortgage banking, we continue to see higher applications quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, but the lower mix and MRSA evaluation are impacting the revenue. In the first quarter of 2015, our results benefited from higher gains on sales. 
Turning to expenses on Slide 9. We've continued to do a great job of self-funding of investment initiatives as expenses were stable linked quarter and up only 1% on an adjusted basis, year-over-year. Linked quarter salaries and benefits were seasonally higher by $16 million as payroll taxes and incentives increased, while occupancy cost were slightly higher. We offset this increase by spending less than services as well as lower other expense, which included the impact of the card reward accounting change. On an year-over-year basis, salaries and employee benefits were up modestly, reflecting continued investments in growth initiatives to help drive top line revenues partially offset by our efficiency program. 
Let's jump over to Page 11. In consumer, we continue to grow balances at a nice pace, up 2% linked quarter and 7% year-over-year, driven by attractive opportunity predominantly in student and mortgage. We're also seeing a nice uptick in our unsecured retail loans, which include the iPhone product. Consumer loan yields increased 11 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher prime rates as well as continued improvement in mix. 
On Slide 12, commercial loan demand was strong this quarter. Commercial loans increased 3% linked quarter and 9% year-over-year as we can do to build momentum in more attractive return areas. On both the linked quarter and year-over-year basis, we generated growth across most of our target areas. Commercial real estate, Corporate Finance, Franchise Finance, link corporate and Industry Verticals. 
Slide 13 focuses on the liability side of the balance sheet and our funding costs. Average interest during deposits grew $630 million or 1% linked quarter with particular strength in checking and savings and money market. Our deposit cost remained stable this quarter, reflecting disciplined downward pricing actions in Consumer Banking as I mentioned earlier. 
On Slide 14, offers highlights on credit quality metrics, which remained relatively stable for the fourth quarter in aggregate. Our NPLs were essentially flat at $1.1 billion, notwithstanding a $210 million increase in our own GAAP nonperforming loans following the March review and revise the data guidance related to multitier structures. This increase was largely offset by improvement in retail from several items of roughly $100 million reduction in retail nonperforming loans, driven part of that TDR transactions I'll cover on the next page, but benefit from reclassifying guaranteed loans and a broad overall improvement in retail credit. 
Provision expense in the quarter were stable at $91 million. During the quarter, we increased results on oil and gas portfolio by $30 million to $61 million, which included a $17 million over life. On Slide 27, in the appendix, we provide more detail on the oil and gas portfolio, which reserves -- which results now at 6% for the more price-sensitive portfolios. This reserve build is partially offset by roughly $16 million in reserves moving a TDR portfolio to held for sale along with favorable trends in the retail performance. Our allowance to loan ratio came in at 1.21%, while our elements to NPL ratio was 113%, both of which are relatively flat to the fourth quarter. Overall, we feel good about credit quality and reserving levels, but we will continue to closely monitor the oil and gas portfolio. 
On Slide 15, we provide more details on our TDR transaction. As we have continued to focus on optimizing the balance sheet and generating more attractive returns on the capital, we work to identify additional areas like portfolio sales and securitization, where we can drive benefits. During the first quarter, we identified a $373 million portfolio of consumer real estate TDR loan that we plan to sell late in the second quarter or early third quarter. We transferred these loans 2 held-for-sale, which lowered our NPL by $97 million. Once the transaction closes, given current home values, we expect to realize a moderate gain as well as benefit our risk-weighted assets and provide a partial offset to third quarter formulated increase in FDIC assessment cost. 
On a net basis, these assessment costs are expected to have a very modest impact on second half 2016 expenses and no impact on our previous full year guidance. 
On Slide 16, you'll see our strong capital and liquidity ratios. You will also see that we executed subdebt buyback of $125 million in March outside of the traditional CCAR process. 
On Slide 17, we've laid out that key initiatives to support balance sheet and growth in our turnaround plan as well as incremental initiatives and assess progress during the quarter. We continue to lay strong foundation and gain momentum across most of these initiatives and are intensely addressing some of our challenges in mortgage while making solid progress in Wealth and Asset Finance. 
Turning to Slide 18. Let me summarize some of what you can expect next quarter, but on the context of the full year 2015 outlook that we previously provided and that we broadly reaffirm today. So compared to the first quarter of 2016, we expect to produce linked-quarter loan growth of roughly 2%. We also expect net interest margins to be relatively stable based on the current as of March 2016, which reflects some pressure from the long end and as I mentioned earlier. We're tightly defending the margin and believe there's more to do organically to control our deposit cost and improve our loan yield. We still expect the fed moving quite this year and we stay focused on what we can control. We do expect mid-single-digit fee growth without any 2Q security gains. We expect modest expense growth in Q2 as efficiency initiatives will provide partial offset the continued investments spend. We would expect to continue to generate strong positive operating leverage, thereby improving our efficiency ratio, profitability and returns. We expect underlying credit metrics to remain largely stable with a modest increase in provision in 2Q driven by volume growth. And finally, we expect to see our CET1 ratio coming at 11.6% and that we will manage the LDR to around 98%. With that, let me turn it back to Bruce"

One of the challenges we had is that we put in a new system, I think we said on the last call round the time that the rest of it came in and we had originate complained loans. So that took some work ultimately to down that system and get back to good operational metrics. That has slowed down our net hiring both in Q4 and Q1. So we're treading water a bit. But we expect that now -- I think we've got that under control and operating metrics continue to improve. So we should now be able to move towards positive net recruiting throughout the rest of the year. Part of that effort is to really focus on markets and producers that can deliver a greater mix of conforming originations compared to what we've had currently, which is roughly been about 60% nonconforming and 40% conforming. So I think part of it is selection, part of it is market geographic focus and then also having that operational excellence because those conforming oriented producers need to make sure that they can get their mortgages through the pipeline relatively quickly. So I'll turn it over to Brad."

The only couple of things I would add to that is, as you mentioned, we implemented our new loan origination system in conjunction with the one of the additional challenges that created for us in terms of conforming production is in order to get that system in, some of the product development work that we needed to do to get right conforming in FHA products in place, we had to put on hold. So we are working really hard to get new products in and that will be more attracting to conforming loan offers. And so we should make the point exactly right, which is we did have some operational stress and operational challenges and I think there's a little more painful in terms of attracting conforming officering -- the nonconforming officers. So we're working very, very hard. We really feel like we're turning the corner in terms of the operations. We did add capacity in terms of operations headcount. We had a good turn of the pipeline particularly in March, a good strong closing month in March. So we feel like we're turning the corner, so we start hiring and getting the traction with the more conforming loan officers."

If we end up a little late on the fees relative to that guidance, the places there, where we try and compensate, one would be trying to end up in the higher end of the range on net interest income, which I think we're off to a great start on net interest income and then to grind down on expenses a little bit, which were you can count on us to be thinking of ways to do that on a regular basis. So if you kind of average out those puts and takes, we think we're tracking to our expectations for the year.

So given that, it means we just have to keep being intensively focus on our deposit cost kind of management and we got to build balances and do them in a disciplined way. I think commercial clients will only be asking for a little more rate, because their loans were priced. So we got to address that and we will find a way to navigate that carefully.

So say that we're comfortable with the glide path that we've been on. So when we were separated -- when the plan was announced to separate cities from RBS, the good news is that we started with almost a 14% CET1 ratio. And then over the past 2.5, 3 years, we've been gliding down to an 11.6% through paying the dividend. We did our conversion transactions, which is effectively a buyback and then very strong loan growth in the 8% range. And I think that still feels good to us as we just continued to glide this done. We're a relatively new company. And I think our earnings are below, where we would like them to be in the longer-term. So we need to get our sources of capital up, but it's good that we have the kind of capital strength behind us that we can continue to take advantage of that. And we can grow loans aggressively. We can put in reasonably aggressive asks in the CCAR process and I don't really think it benefits us dramatically to think about going over 100 at this point."

Q1 was another good quarter for Citizens. Let me briefly cover a few of the highlights. We were pleased that we continue to achieve good loan growth, we're bringing new customers into the bank. We're doing a good job of delivering better risk-adjusted modules and in managing our deposit costs. As a result, our net interest margin was up 9 basis points versus Q4 with half the benefit resulting from the fed December rate hike and half coming from our own actions. 
This strength in net interest income was partly offset by weakness in 3 categories, which is partly the result of seasonality, partly market conditions and partly some challenges in getting full traction on a couple of initiatives. That said, we're addressing the underlying challenges and we're hopeful that market conditions are improving as the year goes on. Our discipline around expenses remains excellent. We have a mindset of continuous improvement and we recycle savings to fund investments in our growth initiatives. 
I was pleased that our tangible book value per share grew by 2% sequentially to $25.21 and then we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.12 per share. Our CET1 capital ratio remains very robust at 11.6%. Our credit quality metrics remain strong and stable. An increase in NPAs and reserves related to the SNC review of oil and gas loans was largely offset by improvements in retail loans, including a planned TDR sale that Eric will fill you on in a minute. We feel our oil and gas exposure is modest and it's well reserved. We continue to focus on delivering well for all of our stakeholder groups including customers, colleagues and communities. I continue to see good progress across the board. In addition, we're focused on improving our risk and regulatory capabilities and feel we put forth a strong effort on our CCAR and DFAST submission. 
With that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through our financials in more detail. Eric?"

In the first quarter, we continue to make progress around our growth, efficiency and balance sheet initiatives. We are managing the balance sheet to generate attractive loan and deposit growth and actively managing NIM. We continue to control cost and deliver strong operating leverage. And once again, credit costs are well behaved as we navigate through the current economic environment. 
My comments this morning refer to our first quarter 2016 earnings presentation, which you could find at citizensbank.com. Let's start on Page 4 with our first quarter financial summary where we provide our GAAP results of $223 million and $0.41 a share. 
On Page 5, on a linked-quarter basis, GAAP net income of $223 million was flat to the fourth quarter on strong NII, seasonally light fees, flat expensive and stable provision. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, net income increased $8 million or 4% with diluted EPS growth of 5%, driven by positive operating leverage of 3%. On a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue by $51 million or 4%. Net interest income of $904 million increased 8% reflecting strong average loan growth. Noninterest income declined $17 million or 5% as growth in service charges and fees were more than offset by lower mortgage banking fees and the impact of a card reward accounting change. 
Year-over-year, we continue to make measurable progress against our goal of enhancing our efficiency while reinvesting in the franchise. Expenses were up only 1%. Our efficiency ratio of 66% improved 2% relative to the first quarter of last year. Provision was up $33 million on an year-over-year basis, but first quarter 2015 included the benefit of large commercial recoveries of $22 million. Importantly, credit cost also remains stable linked quarter as commercial credit began to normalize and we saw improving trends in the retail book. Note that tangible book value per share is now $25.21, up 2% relative to year-end 2015. 
Let's move on to Page 6. We saw a nice lift in net interest income this quarter, which was up $34 million or 4% from fourth quarter on the back of 9 basis points of NIM expansion. We continue to generate attractive average loan growth of 2% with strength in commercial, student and mortgages. On an year-over-year basis, net interest income increased $68 million or 8% due to strong average loan growth of 7%. These results also reflects our improving net interest margin. 
So as you can see on Page 7, our net interest margin increased 9 basis points linked quarter, as our loan yields expanded given the benefit of the December fed rate increase and we continue to shift our mix to higher-yielding asset classes. We were also able to hold deposit cost flat, notwithstanding the fed rate increase on average across our businesses. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of a lower federal results stock dividend. 
The margin expansion this quarter came in a bit stronger than we had anticipated. While loan yields rose in sync with higher LIBOR and prime rate, our deposit cost remained low. Specifically, we consciously lowered pricing of consumer interest during deposit down 4 basis points as we saw good DDA growth. Commercial deposit cost did move up in response to fed tightening, but a bit less than expected. But we do expect deposits to creep up in the future and betas to normalize. We were quite pleased with the results we produced this quarter. We'll provide some more color on our NIM expectations for the second quarter shortly as we are also keeping a close watch on the long end of the yield curve. 
Relative to the first quarter of 2015, net interest margin also expanded 9 basis points benefited by improved loan yields and mix and a more efficient investment portfolio, partially offset by higher borrowing costs. We maintained a stable asset-sensitive position and ended the quarter at 6.9% compared with fourth quarter 2015 at approximately 6.1%. 
On Slide 8, let's take a closer look at noninterest income. Our linked-quarter results reflect both the impact of normal seasonality and service charges and card fees, as well as some continued pressure from the market volatility in investment services, interest rate products and foreign exchange. These actually maps some rebound in our capital markets fees. I need to remind you that our results also reflect a $7 million decrease in cards fees related to the rewards expense accounting change we've discussed last quarter. Without this change, card fees would have been down $3 million linked quarter, but up $5 million year-over-year or up 8%. 
On a year-over-year basis, we have posted 7% growth in service charges and fees driven by both continued household growth as well as our Treasury Solutions pricing initiatives in both commercial and business banking. Investment service fees were up year-over-year, notwithstanding the recent market volatility. And we've now seen 2 strong quarters of FC hiring which should help drive future growth. In mortgage banking, we continue to see higher applications quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year, but the lower conforming mix and MSR valuation are impacting fee revenue. In the first quarter of 2015, our results benefited from higher gains on loan sales. 
Turning to expenses on Slide 9. We've continued to do a great job of self-funding our investment initiatives as expenses were stable linked quarter and up only 1% on an adjusted basis year-over-year. Linked-quarter salaries and benefits were seasonally higher by $16 million as payroll taxes and incentives increased, while occupancy cost were slightly higher. We offset this increase by spending less in outside services as well as lower other expense, which included the impact of the card reward accounting change. On an year-on-year basis, salaries and employee benefits were up modestly reflecting continued investments in growth initiatives to help drive top line revenues partially offset by our efficiency program. 
Let's jump over to Page 11. In consumer, we continue to grow balances at a nice pace up 2% linked quarter and 7% year-over-year driven by attractive opportunities, predominantly in student and mortgage. We're also seeing a nice uptick in our unsecured retail loans which include the iPhone product. Consumer loan yields increased 11 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher prime rate as well as continued improvement in mix. 
On Slide 12, commercial loan demand was strong this quarter. Commercial loans increased 3% linked quarter and 9% year-over-year as we continue to build momentum in more attractive return areas. On both the linked quarter and year-over-year basis, we generated growth across most of our target areas: Commercial Real Estate, Corporate Finance, Franchise Finance, Mid-Corporate and Industry Verticals. 
Slide 13 focuses on the liability side of the balance sheet and our funding costs. Average interest during deposits grew $613 million or 1% linked quarter, with particular strength in checking and savings and money market. Our deposit costs remained stable this quarter reflecting disciplined downward pricing actions in Consumer Banking, as I mentioned earlier. 
On Slide 14, I'll hit the highlights on credit quality metrics which remained relatively stable for the fourth quarter in aggregate. Our NPLs were essentially flat at $1.1 billion, notwithstanding a $210 million increase in oil and gas nonperforming loans following the March sneak review and revised regulatory guidance related to multi-tier structures. This increase was largely offset by improvement in retail from several items of roughly $100 million reduction in retail nonperforming loans due part to the TDR transactions I'll cover on the next page, that benefit from reclassifying a pool of FHA and Ginnie Mae guaranteed loans and a broad overall improvement in retail credit. 
Provision expense in the quarter was stable at $91 million. During the quarter, we increased reserves on our oil and gas portfolio by $30 million to $61 million, which included a $17 million overlay. On Slide 27, in the appendix, we provide more detail on the oil and gas portfolio with reserves now at 6% for the more price-sensitive portfolios. This reserve build is partially offset by a release of roughly $60 million reserves tied to moving a TDR portfolio to held for sale, along with favorable trends in retail performance. Our allowance to loan ratio came in at 1.21% while our allowance to NPL ratio was 113%, both of which are relatively flat to the fourth quarter. Overall, we feel good about credit quality and reserving levels, but we will continue to closely monitor the oil and gas portfolio. 
On Slide 15, we provide more details on our TDR transaction. As we've continued to focus on optimizing the balance sheet and generating more attractive returns on capital, we work to identify additional areas like portfolio sales and securitization where we can drive benefits. During the first quarter, we identified a $373 million portfolio of consumer real estate TDR loan that we plan to sell late in the second quarter or early third quarter. We transferred these loans to held for sale, which lowered our NPL by $97 million. Once the transaction closes, given current home values, we expect to realize a moderate gain as well as benefit our risk-weighted asset and provide a partial offset to the third quarter formulaic increase in FDIC assessment cost. On a net basis, these assessment costs are expected to have a very modest impact on second half 2016 expenses and no impact on our previous full year guidance. 
On Slide 16, you see our strong capital and liquidity ratios. You will also see that we executed sub-debt buyback of $125 million in March outside of the traditional CCAR process. 
On Slide 17, we've laid out the key initiatives that support balance sheet and exceed growth in our turnaround plan, as well as incremental initiatives and assess progress during the quarter. We'll continue to lay strong foundation and gain momentum across most of these initiatives, and are intensely addressing some of our challenges in mortgage while making solid progress, key Wealth and Asset Finance. 
Turning to Slide 18, let me summarize some of what you can expect next quarter, but all in the context of the full year 2015 outlook that we previously provided and that we broadly reaffirm today. So compared to the first quarter of 2016, we expect to produce linked-quarter loan growth of roughly 2%. We also expect net interest margins to be relatively stable based on the curve as of March 2016, which reflects some pressure from the long end and as I mentioned earlier. We are tightly defending the margin and believe there's more we can do organically to control our deposit cost and improve our loan yield. We still anticipate the fed moving twice this year, but we'll stay focused on what we can control. 
We do expect mid-single-digit fee growth without any 2Q security gains. We expect modest expense growth in Q2 as efficiency initiatives will provide a partial offset the continued investments spend. We would expect to continue to generate strong positive operating leverage, thereby improving our efficiency ratio, profitability and returns. We expect underlying credit metrics to remain largely stable with a modest increase in provision in 2Q driven by volume growth. And finally, we expect to see our CET1 ratio come in at 11.6% and that we will manage the LDR to around 98%. 
With that, let me turn it back to Bruce."

One of the challenges we've had is that we put in a new system. I think we said on the last call around the time that the RESPA/TILA came in and we had to originate through the compliant loans. So that took some work ultimately to bed down that system and get back to good operational metrics. That has slowed down our net hiring both in Q4 and Q1, so we're treading water a bit. But we expect that now, I think, we've got that under control and the operating metrics continued to improve. So we should now be able to move towards positive net recruiting throughout the rest of the year. Part of that effort is to really focus on markets and producers that can deliver a greater mix of conforming originations compared to what we've had currently, which is roughly been about 60% nonconforming and 40% conforming. So I think part of it is selection, part of it is market geographic focus and then also having that operational excellence because those conforming oriented producers need to make sure that they can get their mortgages through the pipeline relatively quickly. So I'll turn it over to Brad."

And so I -- and we should make the point exactly right, which is we did have some operational stress and operational challenges and I think that's a little more painful in terms of attracting conforming loan officers than nonconforming officers. So we're working very, very hard. We really feel like we're turning the corner in terms of the operations. We did add capacity in terms of operations headcount. We had a good turn of the pipeline particularly in March, a good strong closing month in March.

So where we have attractive opportunities to grow the loan book, bring new customers into the bank, we want to make sure we're doing that.

Because we wanted to pace dividend levels with income growth. You've seen us deliver on that income growth quarter after quarter after quarter driven by the positive operating leverage and the performance of the franchise, and so this is a natural time during that plan, right, to raise the dividend. And given we delivered on the income, we had done the ask a year ago. We and board went ahead with that increase. We didn't need to ask anything special from the regulators. The only place we did do that was on the [indiscernible] buyback, which we did back in the February-March time period. And I think, as I mentioned in my opening comments, that was a special ask over and above the annual CCAR."

There is a little bit of headwind starting out of the gate in fee revenue, not just for us, but for the whole industry, frankly. And we've got to try to make up ground there. If we end up a little light on the fees relative to that guidance, the places there where we try and compensate, one would be trying to end up in the higher end of the range on net interest income, which I think we're off to a great start on net interest income, and then to grind down on expenses a little bit which we're -- you can count on us to be thinking of ways to do that on a regular basis. So if you kind of average out those puts and takes, we think we're tracking to our expectations for the year. I think the credit outlook, not withstanding some issues in the oil patch, we're still comfortable with that initial guidance we gave for the full year. So you can do the math on that.

And so given that, it means we just have to keep being intensely focused on our deposit cost kind of management and we got to build balances and do them in a disciplined way. I think commercial clients will always be asking for a little more rate because their loans were priced. So we've got to address that and we have to find a way to navigate that carefully.

I do think, to your question though, there is a point where we'll feel that it is appropriate to look for opportunities to deploy some of that excess capital into acquisitions and I think fee-based businesses would be of interest. Having said that, I think you have to be careful there because they typically are going to trade at premium valuations and then a lot of times their businesses, if they're a business like a wealth business or a capital markets business where the assets go out to the elevator every night, so you need to be careful about how you structure those deals. But I still think that's a bit down the road. I don't see us looking to do any acquisitions in 2016.

So just keep that in mind as you're going to compare and contrast. That said, I think the real uptake need to come on the investment side, right? And I thought it was actually nice that we did. We were up 3% year-on-year, notwithstanding the ugly markets we saw in January and February, remember what those felt like. Mortgages as we shift to conforming activity, and we talk through to that earlier in the call, right, gives us a very natural lift. You can just keep the pipeline common and the originations common, and if can shift that mix by 5 percentage points or at some point 10 percentage points, that's very powerful. And so a number of initiatives underway to do that, that takes time but that will come. And then, I think, there's a question on capital markets and a strong second quarter and a good second half of economic activities, you saw the economic signs out there are quite positive now, sharp contrast to what everyone felt like in January and February.

Q1 was another good quarter for Citizens. Let me briefly cover a few of the highlights. We were pleased that we continue to achieve good loan growth. We're bringing new customers into the bank. We're doing a good job of delivering better risk-adjusted loan yields and in managing our deposit costs. As a result, our net interest margin was up 9 basis points versus Q4 with half the benefit resulting from the Fed December rate hike and half coming from our own actions. 
This strength in net interest income was partly offset by weakness in fee categories, which is partly the result of seasonality, partly market conditions and partly some challenges in getting full traction on a couple of initiatives. That said, we're addressing the underlying challenges and we're hopeful that market conditions are improving as the year goes on. Our discipline around expenses remains excellent. We have a mindset of continuous improvement and we recycle savings to fund investments in our growth initiatives. 
I was pleased that our tangible book value per share grew by 2% sequentially to $25.21 and that we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.12 per share. Our CET1 capital ratio remains very robust at 11.6%. Our credit quality metrics remain strong and stable. An increase in NPAs and reserves related to the SNC review of oil and gas loans was largely offset by improvements in retail loans, including a planned TDR sale that Eric will fill you on in a minute. We feel our oil and gas exposure is modest, and it's well reserved. We continue to focus on delivering well for all of our stakeholder groups, including customers, colleagues and communities. I continue to see good progress across the board. In addition, we're focused on improving our risk and regulatory capabilities and feel we put forth a strong effort on our CCAR and DFAST submission. 
With that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through our financials in more detail. Eric?"

In the first quarter, we continued to make progress around our growth, efficiency and balance sheet initiatives. We are managing the balance sheet to generate attractive loan and deposit growth and actively managing NIM. We continue to control cost and deliver strong operating leverage. And once again, credit costs are well behaved as we navigate through the current economic environment.
My comments this morning refer to our first quarter 2016 earnings presentation, which you could find at citizensbank.com. Let's start on Page 4 with our first quarter financial summary where we provide our GAAP results of $223 million and $0.41 a share. 
On Page 5, on a linked-quarter basis, GAAP net income of $223 million was flat to the fourth quarter on strong NII, seasonally light fees, flat expenses and stable provision. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, net income increased $8 million or 4% with diluted EPS growth of 5%, driven by positive operating leverage of 3%. On a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue by $51 million or 4%. Net interest income of $904 million increased 8%, reflecting strong average loan growth. Noninterest income declined $17 million or 5% as growth in service charges and fees were more than offset by lower mortgage banking fees and the impact of a card reward accounting change. 
Year-over-year, we continue to make measurable progress against our goal of enhancing our efficiency while reinvesting in the franchise. Expenses were up only 1%. Our efficiency ratio of 66% improved 2% relative to the first quarter of last year. Provision was up $33 million on a year-over-year basis, but first quarter 2015 included the benefit of large commercial recoveries of $22 million. Importantly, credit cost also remains stable linked quarter as commercial credit began to normalize and we saw improving trends in the retail book. Note that tangible book value per share is now $25.21, up 2% relative to year-end 2015. 
Let's move on to Page 6. We saw a nice lift in net interest income this quarter, which was up $34 million or 4% from fourth quarter on the back of 9 basis points of NIM expansion. We continued to generate attractive average loan growth of 2% with strength in commercial, student and mortgages. On an year-over-year basis, net interest income increased $68 million or 8% due to strong average loan growth of 7%. These results also reflect our improving net interest margin. 
So as you can see on Page 7, our net interest margin increased 9 basis points linked quarter, as our loan yields expanded given the benefit of the December Fed rate increase and we continue to shift our mix to higher-yielding asset classes. We were also able to hold deposit costs flat notwithstanding the Fed rate increase on average across our businesses. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of a lower Federal Reserve stock dividend. 
The margin expansion this quarter came in a bit stronger than we had anticipated. While loan yields rose in sync with higher LIBOR and prime rate, our deposit costs remained low. Specifically, we consciously lowered pricing of consumer interest-bearing deposit down 4 basis points as we saw good DDA growth. Commercial deposit costs did move up in response to the Fed tightening, but a bit less than expected. But we do expect deposits to creep up in the future and betas to normalize. We were quite pleased with the results we produced this quarter. We'll provide some more color on our NIM expectations for the second quarter shortly as we are also keeping a close watch on the long end of the yield curve. 
Relative to the first quarter of 2015, net interest margin also expanded 9 basis points, benefited by improved loan yields and mix and a more efficient investment portfolio, partially offset by higher borrowing costs. We maintained a stable asset-sensitive position and ended the quarter at 6.9% compared with fourth quarter 2015 at approximately 6.1%. 
On Slide 8, let's take a closer look at noninterest income. Our linked-quarter results reflect both the impact of normal seasonality and service charges and card fees, as well as some continued pressure from the market volatility in investment services, interest rate products and foreign exchange. This actually maps to a rebound in our capital markets fees. I need to remind you that our results also reflect a $7 million decrease in cards fees related to the rewards expense accounting change we discussed last quarter. Without this change, card fees would have been down $3 million linked quarter, but up $5 million year-over-year or up 8%. 
On a year-over-year basis, we have posted 7% growth in service charges and fees driven by both continued household growth as well as our Treasury Solutions pricing initiatives in both commercial and business banking. Investment service fees were up year-over-year, notwithstanding the recent market volatility. And we've now seen 2 strong quarters of FC hiring which should help drive future growth. In mortgage banking, we continue to see higher applications quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year, but the lower conforming mix and MSR valuations are impacting fee revenue. In the first quarter of 2015, our results benefited from higher gains on loan sales. 
Turning to expenses on Slide 9. We've continued to do a great job of self-funding our investment initiatives as expenses were stable linked quarter and up only 1% on an adjusted basis year-over-year. Linked-quarter salaries and benefits were seasonally higher by $16 million as payroll taxes and incentives increased, while occupancy cost were slightly higher. We offset this increase by spending less on outside services as well as lower other expense, which included the impact of the card reward accounting change. On a year-on-year basis, salaries and employee benefits were up modestly reflecting continued investments in growth initiatives to help drive top line revenues partially offset by our efficiency program. 
Let's jump over to Page 11. In consumer, we continue to grow balances at a nice pace, up 2% linked quarter and 7% year-over-year driven by attractive opportunities, predominantly in student and mortgage. We're also seeing a nice uptick in our unsecured retail loans which include the iPhone product. Consumer loan yields increased 11 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher prime rate as well as continued improvement in mix. 
On Slide 12, commercial loan demand was strong this quarter. Commercial loans increased 3% linked quarter and 9% year-over-year as we continue to build momentum in more attractive return areas. On both the linked quarter and year-over-year basis, we generated growth across most of our target areas: Commercial Real Estate, Corporate Finance, Franchise Finance, Mid-Corporate and Industry Verticals. 
Slide 13 focuses on the liability side of the balance sheet and our funding costs. Average interest-bearing deposits grew $613 million or 1% linked quarter, with particular strength in checking and savings and money market. Our deposit costs remained stable this quarter reflecting disciplined downward pricing actions in Consumer Banking, as I mentioned earlier. 
On Slide 14, I'll hit the highlights on credit quality metrics, which remained relatively stable for the fourth quarter in aggregate. Our NPLs were essentially flat at $1.1 billion, notwithstanding a $210 million increase in oil and gas nonperforming loans following the March SNC review and revised regulatory guidance related to multi-tier structures. This increase was largely offset by improvement in retail from several items of roughly $100 million reduction in retail nonperforming loans due part to the TDR transactions I'll cover on the next page, that benefit from reclassifying a pool of FHA and Ginnie Mae guaranteed loans and a broad overall improvement in retail credit. 
Provision expense in the quarter was stable at $91 million. During the quarter, we increased reserves on our oil and gas portfolio by $30 million to $61 million, which included a $17 million overlay. On Slide 27, in the appendix, we provide more detail on the oil and gas portfolio with reserves now at 6% for the more price-sensitive portfolios. This reserve build is partially offset by a release of roughly $60 million in reserves tied to moving a TDR portfolio to held for sale, along with favorable trends in retail performance. Our allowance to loan ratio came in at 1.21% while our allowance to NPL ratio was 113%, both of which are relatively flat to the fourth quarter. Overall, we feel good about credit quality and reserving levels, but we will continue to closely monitor the oil and gas portfolio. 
On Slide 15, we provide more details on our TDR transaction. As we've continued to focus on optimizing the balance sheet and generating more attractive returns on capital, we work to identify additional areas like portfolio sales and securitization where we can drive benefits. During the first quarter, we identified a $373 million portfolio of consumer real estate TDR loans that we plan to sell late in the second quarter or early third quarter. We transferred these loans to held for sale, which lowered our NPL by $97 million. Once the transaction closes, given current home values, we expect to realize a moderate gain as well as benefit our risk-weighted asset and provide a partial offset to the third quarter formulaic increase in FDIC assessment cost. On a net basis, these assessment costs are expected to have a very modest impact on second half 2016 expenses and no impact on our previous full year guidance. 
On Slide 16, you see our strong capital and liquidity ratios. You will also see that we executed a sub-debt buyback of $125 million in March outside of the traditional CCAR process.
On Slide 17, we've laid out the key initiatives that support balance sheet and fee growth in our turnaround plan, as well as incremental initiatives and assess progress during the quarter. We'll continue to lay strong foundation and gain momentum across most of these initiatives, and are intensely addressing some of our challenges in mortgage while making solid progress in Wealth and Asset Finance. 
Turning to Slide 18, let me summarize some of what you can expect next quarter, but all in the context of the full year 2015 outlook that we previously provided and that we broadly reaffirm today. So compared to the first quarter of 2016, we expect to produce linked-quarter loan growth of roughly 2%. We also expect net interest margins to be relatively stable based on the curve as of March 2016, which reflects some pressure from the long end, as I mentioned earlier. We are tightly defending the margin and believe there's more we can do organically to control our deposit cost and improve our loan yield. We still anticipate the Fed moving twice this year, but we'll stay focused on what we can control.
We do expect mid-single-digit fee growth without any 2Q security gains. We expect modest expense growth in Q2 as efficiency initiatives will provide a partial offset to continued investment spend. We would expect to continue to generate strong positive operating leverage, thereby improving our efficiency ratio, profitability and returns. We expect underlying credit metrics to remain largely stable with a modest increase in provision in 2Q driven by volume growth. And finally, we expect to see our CET1 ratio come in at 11.6% and that we will manage the LDR to around 98%. 
With that, let me turn it back to Bruce."

One of the challenges we've had is that we put in a new system. I think we said on the last call around the time that the RESPA/TILA came in and we had to originate through the compliant loans. So that took some work ultimately to bed down that system and get back to good operational metrics. That has slowed down our net hiring both in Q4 and Q1, so we're treading water a bit. But we expect that now, I think, we've got that under control and the operating metrics continued to improve. So we should now be able to move towards positive net recruiting throughout the rest of the year. Part of that effort is to really focus on markets and producers that can deliver a greater mix of conforming originations compared to what we've had currently, which has roughly been about 60% nonconforming and 40% conforming. So I think part of it is selection, part of it is market geographic focus and then also having that operational excellence because those conforming oriented producers need to make sure that they can get their mortgages through the pipeline relatively quickly. So I'll turn it over to Brad."

So we are working really hard to get the new products in that will be more attractive to the conforming loan officers. And so I -- and we should make the point exactly right, which is we did have some operational stress and operational challenges and I think that's a little more painful in terms of attracting conforming loan officers than nonconforming officers. So we're working very, very hard. We really feel like we're turning the corner in terms of the operations. We did add capacity in terms of operations headcount. We had a good turn of the pipeline particularly in March, a good strong closing month in March. So we feel like we're turning the corner and we'll be able to start hiring and getting the traction with the more conforming loan officers."

So where we have attractive opportunities to grow the loan book, bring new customers into the bank, we want to make sure we're doing that. And then we also want to be shareholder friendly and buy back our stock with the most that we can do. I think we're in a kind of strong position at this point given the relatively high capital ratios to peers that we can do it all for the time being. So we are able to raise the dividend.

We got to find a way to come in at a strong operating leverage, and we have every intention to meter out and to carefully invest, but only behind revenues as opposed to the other way around."

So I think what we've said today, as Eric went over the guidance, is that we're broadly comfortable with that full year guidance. I think there'll be some puts and takes. There is a little bit of headwind starting out of the gate in fee revenue, not just for us, but for the whole industry, frankly. And we've got to try to make up ground there. If we end up a little light on the fees relative to that guidance, the places there where we try and compensate, one would be trying to end up in the higher end of the range on net interest income, which I think we're off to a great start on net interest income, and then to grind down on expenses a little bit which we're -- you can count on us to be thinking of ways to do that on a regular basis. So if you kind of average out those puts and takes, we think we're tracking to our expectations for the year. I think the credit outlook, notwithstanding some issues in the oil patch, we're still comfortable with that initial guidance we gave for the full year. So you can do the math on that. I do think the ROTCE will start to move higher as we deliver that positive operating leverage as we get some bigger EPS jumps as the year goes along and as we start buying back our stock when we get to the next CCAR cycle.

And so given that, it means we just have to keep being intensely focused on our deposit cost kind of management and we got to build balances and do them in a disciplined way.

So in our turnaround plan, I think we can get good organic growth, and we have to demonstrate that we can build our capabilities and run the bank better, which I think we're doing. I do think, to your question though, there is a point where we'll feel that it is appropriate to look for opportunities to deploy some of that excess capital into acquisitions, and I think fee-based businesses would be of interest. Having said that, I think you have to be careful there because they typically are going to trade at premium valuations and then a lot of times their businesses, if they're a business like a wealth business or a capital markets business where the assets go out to the elevator every night, so you need to be careful about how you structure those deals. But I still think that's a bit down the road. I don't see us looking to do any acquisitions in 2016. But as we continue to improve how we're running, I think we'll start to look potentially in '17 or '18."

So just keep that in mind as you kind of compare and contrast. That said, I think the real uptick needs to come on the investment side, right? And I thought it was actually nice that we did. We were up 3% year-on-year, notwithstanding the ugly markets we saw in January and February, remember what those felt like. Mortgages as we shift to conforming activity, and we talk through to that earlier in the call, right, gives us a very natural lift. You can just keep the pipeline coming and the originations coming, and if can shift that mix by 5 percentage points or at some point 10 percentage points, that's very powerful. And so a number of initiatives underway to do that. That takes time but that will come. And then, I think, there's a question on capital markets and a strong second quarter and a good second half of economic activities, you saw the economic signs out there are quite positive now, sharp contrast to what everyone felt like in January and February.

We delivered a completely clean $0.46 quarter with 15% year-on-year in EPS growth, positive operating leverage of over 3% and a 70 basis point improvement in ROTCE versus adjusted 2015. Our revenue growth of 7% was paced [ph] by loan growth of 7%. Our NIM was relatively stable as are our credit costs. We continue to be very disciplined on expenses. We're delivering on efficiency initiatives that allow us to self fund growth investments, particularly in our fee-based businesses.
I'd call out the outline of our TOP III program in today's materials. Recall that our TOP programs, TOP means tapping our potential, our TOP programs derived from our mindset of continuous improvement. This program should deliver approximately $100 million in benefits next year, which is similar to TOP II's impact on 2016. It's also worth commenting on the successful execution of our CBR sale, which was announced earlier this week. We expect a gain of approximately $70 million, a portion of which will be utilized to cover restructuring costs associated with TOP III.
We are pleased that we came through the CCAR process well this year, and we will pursue both strong loan growth and shareholder return of capital as we continue to normalize our CET1 and total capital ratios.
Our colleagues are putting customers first and are doing a great job in executing our plans. I'd like to recognize them for their excellent effort that continues to propel us forward.

In the second quarter, we continue to deliver on our growth, efficiency and balance sheet initiatives. We delivered strong operating leverage, controlling costs through our expense initiatives and improving efficiency. Earnings were up nicely, both linked quarter and year-over-year along with our returns.
Let's take a closer look at the details in our second quarter earnings presentation.
On Page 4, we provide our GAAP results, which include net income of $243 million and EPS of $0.46 per share, up $0.05 sequentially and $0.11 year-over-year, though second quarter 2015 result included $40 million of restructuring charges and special expense items.
On Page 5, you'll find the highlights of our adjusted results. Our net income came in at $243 million, up 9% linked quarter on revenue growth of 4% with the increases in both NII and non-interest income. We grew fees 8% on a linked-quarter basis, driven by strong growth in capital markets and good volumes in mortgage banking and higher service charges. 
Expenses were up 2%, reflecting higher operating expenses as well as higher salaries and employee benefits. Provision for credit losses remained relatively stable as lower net charge-offs was more than offset by reserved build tied to loan growth. So on a linked-quarter basis, EPS increased $0.05 or 12%.
Compared to adjusted second quarter 2015 results, net income increased $28 million or 13% on -- and earnings per share was up 15%. We grew revenue by $78 million or 7%, with a 10% increase in net interest income as we grew loans 7%, improved loan yields and mix and held deposit costs stable.
Non-interest income decreased $5 million from the second quarter of 2015, which did not include the impact of a reclass of $7 million of card reward costs now reflected as a contra revenue item. Excluding this impact, non-interest income was up $2 million or 1% year-over-year.
Non-interest expense was up $26 million or 3%, driven by salaries and employee benefits expense and a change in accounting of our merited bonus payments. On the credit side, our provision was up $13 million on a modest reserve build tied to loan growth.
In second quarter 2016, we continue to make demonstrable progress against our goals enhancing our efficiency while reinvesting the franchise. Our adjusted efficiency ratio of 65% improved 1% on a linked-quarter basis and improved 2% relative to a year ago as we saw the continuing benefits of TOP II. Additionally, we reduced our share count by 2%, positively impacting EPS. And finally, as of June 30, 2016, our tangible book value per share totaled $25.72, a 2% in improvement on a linked-quarter basis.
Let's move on to net interest income on Page 6. We grew NII $19 million or 2% linked quarter as we continue to generate loan growth with improving yields and portfolio mix while holding deposit costs flat. This underlying momentum was offset by pressure from the loan and the curve [ph] that played out in higher premium amortization and continued lower reinvestment opportunities in the securities portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased $83 million or 10%, and the NIM expanded 12 basis points.
Now on on Page 7. Our net interest margin, which was down 2 basis points linked quarter, reflects higher loan yields and a better mix, which were more than offset by the impact on our securities portfolio of a reduction long-term interest rate and higher borrowing costs associated with the issuance of senior debt. We continue to exercise good discipline with deposit costs, which were flat for the quarter.
Year-over-year, our NIM expanded 12 basis points, reflecting improving retail and commercial loan yields and portfolio mix, along with the impact of a December Fed rate rise. We are pleased with a positive results of our loan pricing and mix initiatives and our PACs [ph] actions were hold deposit costs flat. Our asset sensitivity ended the quarter at 6.8% at a gradual rise scenario, relatively unchanged from the first quarter of 2016.
Next up, let's take a closer look at our non-interest income. We grew non-interest income $25 million or 8% from the first quarter that strengthened nearly every category. We saw volume growth in service, charges and fees, also the seasonally lower levels in the first quarter and also benefited from improved pricing.
Card fees and investment services fees were up slightly while mortgage banking fees increased $7 million as we improved our origination volumes 42% with higher loan sales volumes and spread. Capital markets fees improved $13 million, reflecting the continued broadening of our capabilities across [indiscernible] as well as a strong increase in yield volume from lower first quarter 2016 levels. Security gains were modest and down $5 million.
On a year-over-year basis, non-interest income declined $5 million or 1% from the second quarter of 2015 levels, which did not include the impact of a reclass of $7 million of card reward costs of the contract revenue item.
Excluding this item, underlying non-interest income was up $2 million or 1%. We drove improved pricing and volumes in service, charges and fees, which increased $11 million with improvement in both consumer and commercial. 
In wealth, we continued to add to our advisory headcount, which should propell higher revenues going forward notwithstanding a shift to more fee-based product sales.
Mortgage banking fees decreased $5 million, as the benefit of higher application volume and sale volume and spread was more than offset by a reduction in the prior year MSR valuation increase.
Capital markets fees increased $5 million, reflecting a record quarter and a continued broadening of our capabilities.
Turning to expenses on Slide 9. We continue to manage our costs effectively while also redeploying cost base prudently to invest in products, infrastructure and talent to support the long-term growth of the franchise. On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest expense increased $16 million or 2%. Salaries and employee benefits were up $7 million linked quarter and $27 million year-over-year, largely related to a change in the timing of merit increases and incentive payments, which were paid in the first quarter last year. This led to higher payroll taxes and 401(k) [ph] matching contributions this quarter than we had last year.
Other expense was up $13 million from first quarter as we experienced higher regulatory fraud and insurance costs. Otherwise, we continue to make progress in controlling costs. You can see that headcount was down by 74 linked quarter and also down year-over-year. We continue to take actions to redeploy expense dollars out of less productive uses into areas that will drive future top line and bottom line benefit.
If you look at our balance sheet on Page 10, year-over-year average earning assets were up $6.3 billion or 5%. We generated 10% commercial loan growth and 5% retail loan growth. Average deposits increased $5.4 billion or 6% with strength in low-cost core deposits.
Let's move to Page 11 where Consumer Banking continues to make good progress on growing loans and loan portfolio while shifting the portfolio mix to more attractive opportunities. Loan growth was 7% year-over-year, driven by student lending, particularly our refinancing products and mortgage lending. Consumer loan yields increased 4 basis points, reflecting continued improvement in mix.
Next, on Slide 12, Commercial Banking delivered another strong showing. Commercial loans increased 5% linked quarter and 11% year-over-year with continued momentum in the more attractive return areas. On a year-over-year basis, we continue to generate growth across our targeted areas. Mixed corporate and Industry Verticals, Commercial Real Estate, franchise finance and Corporate Finance. Commercial loan yields increased 5 basis points linked quarter and 24 basis points year-over-year, which reflected higher rate, pricing discipline and improved mix.
Let's take a quick look to liability for the balance sheet and our funding costs on Slide 13. This quarter continue to see the benefit from the strategies and tactics upon continued loan growth in a more cost-effective manner. Our focus in growing low-cost core deposits helped drive a $1.7 billion increase in average interest bearing deposits, up 2% linked quarter with the CCAR strength in checking. We held the deposit costs stable for a third consecutive quarter, reflecting continued discipline, pricing strategies and tactics in Consumer Banking.
We also continue to replace our wholesale funding mix to align more closely with peers and are reducing our reliance on short-term borrowing and issuing senior debt.
Next, let's cover credit. On Slide 14, we saw broad-based improvement in our commercial and retail portfolios. Linked-quarter NPLs were down $35 million, reflecting a $23 million improvement in commercial, largely tied to the oil and gas portfolio; and a $12 million decrease in retail. Correspondingly, net charge-offs were down $18 million or 8 basis points to 25 basis points in loans. Provision expense in the quarter was relatively stable at $90 million, as we built [indiscernible] by $25 million largely tied for continued loan growth. The allowance to loans ratio of 1.2% was stable with the prior quarter, and our allowance to NPL coverage increased to 119%. Overall, we're pleased with the continued favorable trend in our credit metrics, and we expect credit costs to remain favorable this year.
On Slide 15, you can see our strong capital and liquidity ratio. We had significant progress in our capital management this quarter as we received a non-objection to our capital plan, which includes strong loan growth, $690 million of share repurchases over the next 4 quarters and an ability to increase our dividend by 17% next year. We're very pleased with the results and will enhance our returns for shareholders.
On Slide 16, we played out our key initiatives at the [indiscernible] balance sheet and fee growth in our turnaround plan. As you know, we [indiscernible] managed the plan with incremental initiatives and assess our progress against these initiatives this quarter. We're [indiscernible] a way strong foundations and gain momentum across most of these areas. Where we had challenges like mortgages, we're making good progress improving cycle time, which include the customer experience and allows us to receive growth in our sales force.
On Slide 17, you can see tangible evidence of that -- our strategic initiatives are bearing fruit. We continue to deliver positive operating leverage, consistently ahead of our peers. We've been able to generate good revenue growth, notwithstanding the modest economic growth and a lower-for-longer rate environment. Our disciplined approach to expense management reflects the importance of self funding our growth initiatives by actively managing our expense base and driving efficiencies throughout the organization.
On Slide 18, you can see that our biggest gap with peers has been revenue capture, particularly in our fee businesses, which outlines the opportunity set that will allow us to enhance our returns for shareholders. We're addressing this opportunity through growth investments in our wealth management, capital markets, Treasury Solutions businesses, among others. Additionally, we're making progress towards improving our return by addressing other drags on ROTCE such as excess capital position and a relatively high tax rate. We have improved ROTCE by almost 3 percentage points in sight [ph] of 3 years and will continue to focus on executions to drive further progress.
As you look at Slide 19, our top 2 initiatives have delivered well against our revenue and expense goals. In 2016, we're on track to realize $95 million to $100 million in total benefits from revenue initiatives and expense saving. We continue to foster our mindset of continuous improvement, running the bank better every day. 
On Slide 20, we outlined our plan to build and improve upon these efforts. Our TOP III initiative, which is taking shape, takes a greater emphasis on expenses. We are reducing our headcount in non-revenue areas and driving further efficiencies in the distribution network as well as streamlining end-to-end loan processes. We are actively reaching out to customers to protect our share of wallet and conducting a thorough assessment of opportunities to improve our tax rate to align more closely with peers. We will leverage our success with previous TOP programs to help ensure the TOP III improve the bank's overall efficiency and effectiveness while, at the same time, allowing us to self fund investments and drive future growth.
Slide 21. Given our focus on efficiency and TOP III, we remain committed to continuing to deliver positive operating leverage. The rate scenario will move around based on events. Currently, the forward curve projects a low probability of a Fed rate increase during 2016 and 2017. Traditionally, the curve has flattened with the long end significantly lower. 
While this scenario lessens the prospect of the hopr for tailwind, we have been delivering strong operating -- solid operating leverage, EPS growth and ROTCE improvement during the last 2 years with no net rate benefit as the one move in Fed funds rate has been more than offset by the impact of a flattening yield curve.
In any case, it is trying to look like a rate reaction in the wake of Brexit may have been a bit overdone. So I'll say we believe the key is to focus on what we can control and so can see that execute our plan to build a top-performing bank that delivers well for all our stakeholders.
In the back half of 2016, initial TOP III savings will help to offset some costs that were unforeseen at the beginning of the year. This include higher FDIC assessment costs, higher separation costs from RBS related to new vendor contract as well as a temporary increase in outsourcing costs.
In 2017, our TOP III benefit will be deployed towards containing its expense growth and generating positive operating leverage and EPS growth. This roughly $100 million impact will also help us self fund the investments we need to drive top line growth, particularly in fees, while still showing strong discipline on expenses. In addition to the efforts that we've outlined here, we are working on additional efficiencies in areas like optimizing our branch network to reduce occupancy costs.
Also note that we expect to utilize roughly 30% to 40% of the approximately $70 million TDR gains of fund costs associated with TOP III efficiencies and a continued optimization of the balance sheet.
Turning now to Slide 22 in our recent CCAR submission [indiscernible] outcome. We received a non-objection to the capital plan we've submitted as part of the 2016 CCAR process. Our strong capital position permits strong loan growth and shareholder return of capital while maintaining a robust common equity Tier 1 ratio. We will continue to allocate our capital prudently given the need for higher earnings in ROTCE improvements. All in, we've made great progress in improving the qualitative assets of our framework.
On Slide 23, we provide a high level of out line of TDR transaction. Earlier this week, we sold $310 [ph] million of troubled debt restructuring loan, and we'll look for a third quarter 2016 gain of approximately $70 million on the sale and other income. Benefit for this transaction includes an improvement in the bank asset quality, the ability to improve risk-adjusted return, the reduction in our CCAR stress lost level and a modest reduction in FDIC insurance expenses.
Let's turn to our third quarter outlook on Slide 24. We expect to produce linked-quarter loan growth of roughly 1.5%. We also expect net interest margins to be down slightly given the current curve for the currencies levels that posted some challenges, but we will tightly managed our deposit costs and continue to optimize our loan portfolio mix. We are focused on what we can control and continue to investigate additional opportunities to optimize our balance sheet. We expect to keep expenses broadly stable in the third quarter, as efficiency initiatives will offset continued investment spend.
We expect to continue to generate strong positive operating leverage, thereby improving our efficiency ratio, profitability and returns. We expect underlying credit metrics to remain favorable, which will lead to relatively stable provision in the third quarter.
And finally, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to 11.3% given that we've resumed buying back stock, and we'll manage the LDR to around 99%. Note that this guidance doesn't reflect the gain on the TDR transaction of approximately $70 million or any restructuring costs.
In summary, Slide 25, our strong results this quarter demonstrate our ability to continue to improve how we run the bank. We have delivered well against our strategic initiatives that help us drive underlying revenue growth and carefully manage our expense base. We remain committed to being prudent capital allocator and enhancing our returns for shareholders. In the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on execution and making progress for all our stakeholders.
With that, let me turn it back to Bruce."

And I think when you go back to think about how we revert from RBS, one of the good things is we were paired with a very high capital ratio, which has allowed us a lot of flexibility in terms of improving the bank and improving returns. So we're kind of in the rich man's position now where we can have relatively strong loan growth so we can use that capital position to grow the balance sheet, bring new customers into the bank. And also at the same time, we can cut very strong distributions of capital back to shareholders, and that's been bringing the capital ratio down at around 50 basis points or so for the past 2 years, that strategy of having aggressive loan growth and strong returns to shareholders. I think we're calling out kind of a low-11 type ending point this year, down from may be 11 8 when we started the year. So let's say, call it 60 basis point reduction. And I think we could do that again clearly, not -- we have to go through the process but the potential exists to do that again given that our peer capital ratios, the median is probably around 10% so we could do that may be once, may be twice again. But obviously, we've got to keep running the bank better. We have to get our ROCE up. We want to get to a sustainable position where kind of sources of capital equal uses because eventually that excess that we have will dissipate. So that's how we think about it.

The bar flows up in either credit modeling or PPNR or control the data. Our view is we need to stay ahead and be ahead, and we know what it takes to do that. I think what's also constructive in our CCAR results is if you look at the stress tests that are done, like the credit stress that we see in our book and that the Fed sees in our book tends to be a little lighter than some of the other regional banks. And so that kind of a higher quality of underwriting of credit and of mix I think bodes well for us because we have less -- slightly lower CCAR kind of drawdown on capital, and that gives us some confidence that the payouts that we have put forward this year and what we might recommend next year make a lot of sense."

I think the first thing I'd share with you is I think our initiatives in the businesses, whether I described them as pricing or mix, some of the loan side continue to bear fruit. I think this quarter, in particular, we saw a 2% uptick in yields. You saw it both in consumer and commercial. Some of that was the mix improvement that we continue to drive, and I think we can continue to do that. Some of it actually just came from outright targeting, and we have some improvements in yields as we really gave benchmarking tools to our bankers in commercial to make sure that they've got the yields that we deserve. And some of it came from pricing and consumer. We actually wanted to slow down over lending. Well, the natural way to do that is to take price off. You've got to do that carefully. But had about 15 basis points better origination pricing in auto on an apples-to-apples basis. So we think those initiatives will continue, and we think there is potential to continuing to drive those forward. And I think the same is true on deposits, that we have to do those, the tactics in deposits and we're also willing to new product programs. It's got a great new product for the [indiscernible] and in deposits on the consumer side, and I think those kinds of initiatives will bear fruit. I think more broadly on the balance sheet management and investment portfolio side, we're not uncomfortable with this level of asset sensitivity but we do want to position around the curve. Post Brexit, you saw rates at 10-year at 1 35, and I'm sure the folks are clamoring why not just close down the asset sensitive position where rates are at 1 60, right, over the last day. And we'd say, ""Hey, good treasures and smart managers of a treasury portfolio will look for rates in a range and choose their -- choose out of position. I think you've also seen mortgage basis widen out over the last couple of months. That provides an opportunity because we earn money in treasury both on the duration position and on the mortgage basis, and we can adjust which one we emphasize, which ones we deemphasize. And then I think you'll continue to see us do work around optimizing the kind of liability side of the balance sheet, right? We've got an upcoming subdebt redemption network plan that we have previously announced, the $500 million. And I think actions like that should help and help offset some of the lower-for-longer headwind."

And the thing that's propelled the NIM higher has been some of these self-help actions and this discipline that we've had. So when we think about 2017, that's what the game plan is to continue with that as we go into next year. It certainly would be helpful if the Fed starts to move again. It's interesting that right after Brexit, it looked like that was completely off the table for a couple of years and now the markets are saying, ""Well, may be not so fast on that one.""

It generally revolves around a maturity of the loan facility or something else going on with their coverage, and we haven't seen that materialize in size yet but we're hopeful and when we're actually talking to those kinds about joining the Citizens family."

If we need to use 20% to 30% of it, which is $20 million to $30 million, I think that will pretty much cover it. There's not only -- there's a more heavy expense element to TOP III but there's also revenue ideas, which really just require people investment or changes in processes so there's no big investment that goes with that. And then the tax strategies we have are largely around tax credit programs, which will throw up a little bit of have been on to non-interest income line but certainly benefit your tax line and with a net benefit. So in any case, I think that's the extent of it. What we've said, we earmarked the gain, the portion of the gain to cover."

We feel very good about the results that we announced today. We're executing our plan well, and the financial results continue to show steady and notable progress, particularly given the environment.
We delivered a completely clean $0.46 quarter, with 15% year-on-year in EPS growth, positive operating leverage of over 3% and a 70 basis point improvement in ROTCE versus adjusted 2015. Our revenue growth of 7% was paced by loan growth of 7%. Our NIM was relatively stable as are our credit costs. We continue to be very disciplined on expenses. We're delivering on efficiency initiatives that allow us to self-fund growth investments, particularly in our fee-based businesses.
I'd call out the outline of our TOP III program in today's materials. Recall that our TOP programs, TOP means Tapping Our Potential, our TOP programs derived from our mindset of continuous improvement. This program should deliver approximately $100 million in benefits next year, which is similar to TOP II's impact on 2016. 
It's also worth commenting on the successful execution of our TDR sale, which was announced earlier this week. We expect a gain of approximately $70 million, a portion of which will be utilized to cover restructuring costs associated with TOP III.
We are pleased that we came through the CCAR process well this year, and we will pursue both strong loan growth and shareholder return of capital as we continue to normalize our CET1 and total capital ratios.
Our colleagues are putting customers first and are doing a great job in executing our plans. I'd like to recognize them for their excellent effort that continues to propel us forward.

In the second quarter, we continue to deliver on our growth, efficiency and balance sheet initiatives. We delivered strong operating leverage, controlling costs through our expense initiative and improving efficiency. Earnings were up nicely, both linked quarter and year-over-year, along with our returns.
Let's take a closer look at the details in our second quarter earnings presentation.
On Page 4, we provide our GAAP results, which include net income of $243 million and EPS of $0.46 per share, up $0.05 sequentially and $0.11 year-over-year, though second quarter 2015 results included $40 million of restructuring charges and special expense items.
On Page 5, you'll find the highlights of our adjusted results. Our net income came in at $243 million, up 9% linked quarter on revenue growth of 4% with increases in both NII and noninterest income. We grew fees 8% on a linked-quarter basis, driven by strong growth in capital markets and good volumes in mortgage banking and higher service charges. 
Expenses were up 2%, reflecting higher operating expenses as well as higher salaries and employee benefits. Provision for credit losses remained relatively stable as lower net charge-offs were more than offset by reserved build tied to loan growth. So on a linked-quarter basis, EPS increased $0.05 or 12%.
Compared to adjusted second quarter 2015 results, net income increased $28 million or 13% on -- and earnings per share was up 15%. We grew revenue by $78 million or 7%, with a 10% increase in net interest income as we grew loans 7%, improved loan yields and mix and held deposit costs stable.
Noninterest income decreased $5 million from the second quarter of 2015, which did not include the impact of a reclass of $7 million of card reward costs now reflected as a contra revenue item. Excluding this impact, noninterest income was up $2 million or 1% year-over-year.
Noninterest expense was up $26 million or 3%, driven by salaries and employee benefits expense and a change in accounting of our merited bonus payments. On the credit side, our provision was up $13 million on a modest reserve build tied to loan growth.
In second quarter 2016, we continue to make demonstrable progress against our goal of enhancing our efficiency while reinvesting in the franchise. Our adjusted efficiency ratio of 65% improved 1% on a linked-quarter basis and improved 2% relative to a year ago as we saw the continuing benefits of TOP II. Additionally, we reduced our share count by 2%, positively impacting EPS. And finally, as of June 30, 2016, our tangible book value per share totaled $25.72, a 2% in improvement on a linked-quarter basis.
Let's move on to net interest income on Page 6. We grew NII $19 million or 2% linked quarter as we continue to generate loan growth with improving yields and portfolio mix while holding deposit costs flat. This underlying momentum was offset by a pressure from the long end of the curve that played out in higher premium amortization and continued lower reinvestment opportunities in the securities portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased $83 million or 10%, and the NIM expanded 12 basis points.
Now on Page 7. Our net interest margin, which was down 2 basis points linked quarter, reflects higher loan yields and a better mix, which were more than offset by the impact on our securities portfolio of a reduction in long-term interest rate and higher borrowing costs associated with the issuance of senior debt. We continue to exercise good discipline with deposit costs, which were flat for the quarter.
Year-over-year, our NIM expanded 12 basis points, reflecting improving retail and commercial loan yields and portfolio mix, along with the impact of a December Fed rate rise. We are pleased with the positive results of our loan pricing and mix initiatives and our taxable actions to hold deposit costs flat. Our asset sensitivity ended the quarter at 6.8% in a gradual rise scenario, relatively unchanged from the first quarter of 2016.
Next up, let's take a closer look at our noninterest income. We grew noninterest income $25 million or 8% from the first quarter that strengthened nearly every category. We saw volume growth in service charges and fees off of the seasonally lower levels in the first quarter and also benefited from improved pricing.
Card fees and investment services fees were up slightly, while mortgage banking fees increased $7 million as we improved our origination volumes 42%, with higher loan sales volumes and spread. 
Capital markets fees improved $13 million, reflecting the continued broadening of our capabilities and cross sell as well as a strong increase in yield volume from lower first quarter 2016 levels. Securities gains were modest and down $5 million.
On a year-over-year basis, noninterest income declined $5 million or 1% from the second quarter of 2015 levels, which did not include the impact of a reclass of $7 million of card reward costs of the contract revenue item.
Excluding this item, underlying noninterest income was up $2 million or 1%. We drove improved pricing and volumes in service charges and fees, which increased $11 million, with improvement in both consumer and commercial. 
In Wealth, we continued to add to our advisory headcount, which should propel higher revenues going forward, notwithstanding a shift to more fee-based product sales.
Mortgage banking fees decreased $5 million, as the benefit of higher application volume and sale volume and spread was more than offset by a reduction in the prior year MSR valuation increase.
Capital markets fees increased $5 million, reflecting a record quarter and a continued broadening of our capabilities.
Turning to expenses on Slide 9. We continue to manage our costs effectively while also redeploying cost base prudently to invest in products, infrastructure and talent to support the long-term growth of the franchise. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $16 million or 2%. Salaries and employee benefits were up $7 million linked quarter and $27 million year-over-year, largely related to a change in the timing of merit increases and incentive payments, which were paid in the first quarter last year. This led to higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching contributions this quarter than we had last year.
Other expense was up $13 million from the first quarter as we experienced higher regulatory fraud and insurance costs. Otherwise, we continue to make progress in controlling costs. 
You can see that headcount was down by 74 linked quarter and also down year-over-year. We continue to take actions to redeploy expense dollars out of less productive uses into areas that will drive future top line and bottom line benefit.
If you look at our balance sheet on Page 10, year-over-year average earning assets were up $6.3 billion or 5%. We generated 10% commercial loan growth and 5% retail loan growth. Average deposits increased $5.4 billion or 6%, with strength in low-cost core deposits.
Let's move to Page 11, where Consumer Banking continues to make good progress on growing loans -- the loan portfolio while shifting the portfolio mix toward more attractive opportunities. Loan growth was 7% year-over-year, driven by student lending, particularly our refinancing products and mortgage lending. Consumer loan yields increased 4 basis points, reflecting continued improvement in mix.
Next, on Slide 12, Commercial Banking delivered another strong showing. Commercial loans increased 5% linked quarter and 11% year-over-year, with continued momentum in the more attractive return areas. On a year-over-year basis, we continue to generate growth across our targeted areas: Mid-corporate and Industry Verticals, Commercial Real Estate, Franchise Finance and Corporate Finance. Commercial loan yields increased 5 basis points linked quarter and 24 basis points year-over-year, which reflected higher rate, pricing discipline and improved mix.
Let's take a quick look to the liability side of the balance sheet and our funding costs on Slide 13. This quarter continued to see the benefit from the strategies and tactics upon continued loan growth in a more cost-effective manner. Our focus in growing low-cost core deposits helped drive a $1.7 billion increase in average interest bearing deposits, up 2% linked quarter, with particular strength in checking. We held our deposit costs stable for a third consecutive quarter, reflecting continued discipline, pricing strategies and tactics in Consumer Banking.
We also continue to replace our wholesale funding mix to align more closely with peers and are reducing our reliance on short-term borrowing and issuing senior debt.
Next, let's cover credit. On Slide 14, we saw broad-based improvement in our commercial and retail portfolios. Linked-quarter NPLs were down $35 million, reflecting a $23 million improvement in commercial, largely tied to the oil and gas portfolio; and a $12 million decrease in retail. Correspondingly, net charge-offs were down $18 million or 8 basis points to 25 basis points in loans. Provision expense in the quarter was relatively stable at $90 million, as we built reserves by $25 million, largely tied for continued loan growth. 
The allowance to loans ratio of 1.2% was stable with the prior quarter, and our allowance to NPL coverage increased to 119%. 
Overall, we're pleased with the continued favorable trend in our credit metrics, and we expect credit costs to remain favorable this year.
On Slide 15, you can see our strong capital and liquidity ratios. We had significant progress in our capital management this quarter as we received a non-objection to our capital plan, which includes strong loan growth, $690 million of share repurchases over the next 4 quarters and an ability to increase our dividend by 17% next year. We're very pleased with the results as it will enhance our returns for shareholders.
On Slide 16, we played out our key initiatives that support the balance sheet and fee growth in our turnaround plan. As you know, we have augmented the plan with the incremental initiatives and assess our progress against these initiatives this quarter. We're continuing to lay strong foundations and gain momentum across most of these areas. Where we had challenges, like mortgages, we're making good progress improving cycle time, which include the customer experience and allows us to resume growth in our sales force.
On Slide 17, you can see tangible evidences that our strategic initiatives are bearing fruit. We continue to deliver a positive operating leverage, consistently ahead of our peers. We've been able to generate good revenue growth, notwithstanding the modest economic growth and a lower-for-longer rate environment. Our disciplined approach to expense management reflects the importance of self-funding our growth initiatives by actively managing our expense base and driving efficiencies throughout the organization.
On Slide 18, you can see that our biggest gap with peers has been revenue capture, particularly in our fee businesses, which outlines the opportunity set that will allow us to enhance our returns for shareholders. We're addressing this opportunity through growth investments in our Wealth management, Capital Markets, Treasury Solutions businesses, among others. Additionally, we're making progress towards improving our return by addressing other drags on ROTCE, such as our excess capital position and a relatively high tax rate. We have improved ROTCE by almost 3 percentage points inside of 3 years and will continue to focus on execution to drive further progress.
As you look at Slide 19, our top 2 initiatives have delivered well against our revenue and expense goals. In 2016, we're on track to realize $95 million to $100 million in total benefits from revenue initiatives and expense saving. We continue to foster a mindset of continuous improvement, running the bank better every day. 
On Slide 20, we outlined our plan to build and improve upon these efforts. Our TOP III initiative, which is taking shape, takes a greater emphasis on expenses. We are reducing our headcount in non-revenue areas and driving further efficiencies in the distribution network as well as streamlining end-to-end loan processes. We are actively reaching out to customers to protect our share of wallet and conducting a thorough assessment of opportunities to improve our tax rate to align more closely with peers. We will leverage our success with previous TOP programs to help ensure that TOP III improves the bank's overall efficiency and effectiveness while, at the same time, allowing us to self-fund investments and drive future growth.
Slide 21. Given our focus on efficiency and TOP III, we remain committed to continuing to deliver positive operating leverage. The rate scenario will move around based on events. Currently, the forward curve projects a low probability of a Fed rate increase during 2016 and 2017. Traditionally, the curve has flattened with the long end significantly lower. 
While this scenario lessens the prospect of the hopes for tailwind, we have been delivering strong operating -- solid operating leverage, EPS growth and ROTCE improvement during the last 2 years, with no net rate benefit as the one move in Fed funds rate has been more than offset by the impact of the flattening yield curve.
In any case, it is trying to look like the rate reaction and the wake of Brexit may have been a bit overdone. So I'll say, we believe the key is to focus on what we can control and to continue to execute on our plan to build a top-performing bank that delivers well for all our stakeholders.
In the back half of 2016, initial TOP III savings will help to offset some costs that were unforeseen at the beginning of the year. This include higher FDIC assessment costs, higher separation costs from RBS related to new vendor contract as well as a temporary increase in outsourcing costs.
In 2017, our TOP III benefit will be deployed towards containing its expense growth and generating positive operating leverage and EPS growth. This roughly $100 million impact will also help us self-fund the investments we need to drive top line growth, particularly in fees, while still showing strong discipline on expenses. In addition to the efforts that we've outlined here, we are working on additional efficiencies in areas like optimizing our branch network to reduce occupancy costs.
Also note that we expect to utilize roughly 30% to 40% of the approximately $70 million TDR gains of fund costs associated with TOP III efficiencies and the continued optimization of the balance sheet.
Turning now to Slide 22 in our recent CCAR submission/DFAST outcome. We received a non-objection to the capital plan we've submitted as part of the 2016 CCAR process. Our strong capital position permits strong loan growth and shareholder return of capital while maintaining a robust common equity Tier 1 ratio. We will continue to allocate our capital prudently given the need for higher earnings and ROTCE improvement. All in, we have made great progress in improving the qualitative aspects of our framework.
On Slide 23, we provide a high-level outline of the TDR transaction. Earlier this week, we sold $310 million of troubled debt restructuring loan, and we'll look for a third quarter 2016 gain of approximately $70 million on the sale and other income. Benefits of this transaction include an improvement in the bank asset quality, the ability to improve risk-adjusted return, the reduction in our CCAR stressed loss levels and a modest reduction in FDIC insurance expenses.
Let's turn to our third quarter outlook on Slide 24. We expect to produce linked-quarter loan growth of roughly 1.5%. We also expect net interest margin to be down slightly given the current curve. With the curve at these levels, this poses some challenges, but we will tightly manage our deposit costs and continue to optimize our loan portfolio mix. We are focused on what we can control and continue to investigate additional opportunities to optimize our balance sheet. We expect to keep expenses broadly stable in the third quarter, as efficiency initiatives will offset continued investment spend.
We expect to continue to generate strong positive operating leverage, thereby improving our efficiency ratio, profitability and returns. We expect underlying credit metrics to remain favorable, which will lead to relatively stable provision in the third quarter.
And finally, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to 11.3% given that we've resumed buying back stock and we'll manage the LDR to around 99%. Note that this guidance doesn't reflect the gain on the TDR transaction of approximately $70 million or any restructuring costs.
In summary, Slide 25, our strong results this quarter demonstrate our ability to continue to improve how we run the bank. We have delivered well against our strategic initiatives that help us drive underlying revenue growth and carefully manage our expense base. We remain committed to being prudent capital allocator and enhancing our returns to our shareholders. In the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on execution and making progress for all our stakeholders.
With that, let me turn it back to Bruce."

So it's really -- I think we'll get some immediate benefits in the second half of the year that'll cover things like higher FDIC assessment, then we'll run that out next year when we do the budget process.

But look, I think in terms of the CCAR process, we're very pleased, obviously, that we have upped our game and we're not -- we're making it through the qualitative side of it well. And I think we -- when you go back to think about how we revert from RBS, one of the good things is we were reverted with a very high capital ratio, which has allowed us a lot of flexibility in terms of improving the bank and improving returns. So we're kind of in a rich man's position now where we can have relatively strong loan growth, so we can use that capital position to grow the balance sheet, bring new customers into the bank. And also, at the same time, we can have very strong distributions of capital back to shareholders. And that's been bringing the capital ratio down at around 50 basis points or so for the past 2 years, that strategy of having aggressive loan growth and strong returns to shareholders. I think we're calling out kind of a low-11-type ending point this year, down from maybe 11.8 when we started the year. So let's say, call it 60-basis-point reduction. And I think we could do that again, clearly, not -- we have to go through the process, but the potential exists to do that again given that our peer capital ratios, the median is probably around 10%. So we could do that maybe once, maybe twice again. But obviously, we've got to keep running the bank better. And we have to get our ROCE up. We want to get to a sustainable position where kind of sources of capital equal uses, because eventually, that excess that we have will dissipate. So that's how we think about it.

Our view is we need to stay ahead and be ahead, and we know what it takes to do that. I think what's also constructive in our CCAR results is if you look at the stress tests that are done, right, the credit stress that we see in our book and that the Fed sees in our book tends to be a little lighter than some of the other regional banks. And so that kind of a higher quality of underwriting of credit and of mix, I think, bodes well for us because we have less -- slightly lower CCAR kind of drawdown on capital. And that gives us some confidence that the payouts that we have put forward this year and what we might recommend next year make a lot of sense."

I think the first thing I'd share with you is, I think our initiatives in the businesses, whether I described them as pricing or mix on the loan side, continue to bear fruit. I think this quarter, in particular, you saw a 2% uptick in yields. You saw it both in consumer and commercial. Some of that was the mix improvement that we continue to drive, and I think we can continue to do that. Some of it actually just came from outright targeting, and we had some improvements in yields as we really gave benchmarking tools to our bankers in commercial to make sure that they've got the yields that we deserve. And some of it came from pricing and consumer. We actually wanted to slow down at our lending. One of the natural way to do that is to take price off. You've got to do that carefully. But had about 15 basis points better origination pricing in auto on an apples-to-apples basis. So we think those initiatives will continue, and we think there is potential to continuing to drive those forward. And I think the same is true on deposits, that we have to do both the tactics in deposits and we're also rolling new product programs. We've got a great new product for the Apple [ph] in the deposits on the consumer side. And I think those kinds of initiatives will bear fruit. I think more broadly on the balance sheet management and investment portfolio side, we're not uncomfortable with this level of asset sensitivity, but we do want to position around the curve. Post-Brexit, you saw rates at 10-year at 1.35. And I'm sure the folks are clamoring why not just close down the asset sensitive position where rates are at 1.60, right, over the last day. And you'd say, ""Hey, good treasurers and smart managers of a treasury portfolio will look for rates in a range and choose their -- choose out a position."" I think you've also seen mortgage basis widen out over the last couple of months. That provides an opportunity because we earn money in treasury, both on the duration position and on the mortgage basis, and we can adjust which one we emphasize, which ones we deemphasize. And then I think you'll continue to see us do work around optimizing the kind of the liability side of the balance sheet, right?

And so we're kind of making sure that we can get good yields, so good risk-adjusted returns. But more than that, also making sure that we're playing in spaces where we can take in deposits and we can get the fee cross-sell. And so that's one of the things that we're constantly looking at trying to rotate is if there's an area, for example, the leasing business that we have is a bit light on fees and light on deposits and it has been a referral business that we were really dependent on our view as for large ticket referrals, we're refashioning that business into something that's more focused as a cross-sell product into middle market customer, so we can make it part of this whole relationship. So that's some of the continuing work that's taking place."

And the thing that's propelled the NIM higher has been some of these self-help actions and this discipline that we've had. So when we think about 2017, that's what the game plan is to continue with that as we go into next year. It certainly would be helpful if the Fed starts to move again. It's interesting that right after Brexit, it looked like that was completely off the table for a couple of years, and now that markets are saying, ""Well, maybe not so fast on that one.""

If we need to use 20% to 30% of it, which is $20 million to $30 million, I think that will pretty much cover it. There's not only -- there's a more heavy expense element to TOP III, but there's also revenue ideas, which really just require people investment or changes in processes, so there's no big investment that goes with that. And then the tax strategies we have are largely around tax credit programs, which will throw up a little bit of headwind on the noninterest income line, but certainly benefit your tax line and give a net benefit. So in any case, I think that's the extent of it. What we've said, we earmarked the gain, the portion of the gain to cover."

We feel very good about the results that we announced today. We're executing our plan well, and the financial results continue to show steady and notable progress, particularly given the environment.
We delivered a completely clean $0.46 quarter, with 15% year-on-year EPS growth, positive operating leverage of over 3% and a 70 basis point improvement in ROTCE versus adjusted 2015. Our revenue growth of 7% was paced by loan growth of 7%. Our NIM was relatively stable as are our credit costs. We continue to be very disciplined on expenses. We're delivering on efficiency initiatives that allow us to self-fund growth investments, particularly in our fee-based businesses.
I'd call out the outline of our TOP III program in today's materials. Recall that our TOP programs, TOP means Tapping Our Potential, our TOP programs derived from our mindset of continuous improvement. This program should deliver approximately $100 million in benefits next year, which is similar to TOP II's impact on 2016. 
It's also worth commenting on the successful execution of our TDR sale, which was announced earlier this week. We expect a gain of approximately $70 million, a portion of which will be utilized to cover restructuring costs associated with TOP III.
We were pleased that we came through the CCAR process well this year, and we will pursue both strong loan growth and shareholder return of capital as we continue to normalize our CET1 and total capital ratios.
Our colleagues are putting customers first and are doing a great job in executing our plans. I'd like to recognize them for their excellent effort that continues to propel us forward.

On Page 4, we provide our GAAP results, which include net income of $243 million and EPS of $0.46 per share, up $0.05 sequentially and $0.11 year-over-year, though second quarter 2015 results included $40 million of restructuring charges and special expense items.
On Page 5, you'll find the highlights of our adjusted results. Our net income came in at $243 million, up 9% linked quarter on revenue growth of 4% with increases in both NII and noninterest income. We grew fees 8% on a linked-quarter basis, driven by strong growth in capital markets and good volumes in mortgage banking and higher service charges. 
Expenses were up 2%, reflecting higher operating expenses as well as higher salaries and employee benefits. Provision for credit losses remained relatively stable as lower net charge-offs were more than offset by a reserve build tied to loan growth. So on a linked-quarter basis, EPS increased $0.05 or 12%.
Compared to adjusted second quarter 2015 results, net income increased $28 million or 13% on -- and earnings per share was up 15%. We grew revenue by $78 million or 7%, with a 10% increase in net interest income as we grew loans 7%, improved loan yields and mix and held deposit costs stable.
Noninterest income decreased $5 million from the second quarter of 2015, which did not include the impact of a reclass of $7 million of card reward costs now reflected as a contra revenue item. Excluding this impact, noninterest income was up $2 million or 1% year-over-year.
Noninterest expense was up $26 million or 3%, driven by salaries and employee benefits expense and a change in timing of our merit and bonus payments. On the credit side, our provision was up $13 million on a modest reserve build tied to loan growth.
In second quarter 2016, we continued to make demonstrable progress against our goal of enhancing our efficiency while reinvesting in the franchise. Our adjusted efficiency ratio of 65% improved 1% on a linked-quarter basis and improved 2% relative to a year ago as we saw the continuing benefits of TOP II. Additionally, we reduced our share count by 2%, positively impacting EPS. And finally, as of June 30, 2016, our tangible book value per share totaled $25.72, a 2% improvement on a linked-quarter basis.
Let's move on to net interest income on Page 6. We grew NII $19 million or 2% linked quarter as we continue to generate loan growth with improving yields and portfolio mix while holding deposit costs flat. This underlying momentum was offset by pressure from the long end of the curve that played out in higher premium amortization and continued lower reinvestment opportunities in the securities portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased $83 million or 10%, and the NIM expanded 12 basis points.
Now on Page 7. Our net interest margin, which was down 2 basis points linked quarter, reflects higher loan yields and a better mix, which were more than offset by the impact on our securities portfolio of a reduction in long-term interest rate and higher borrowing costs associated with the issuance of senior debt. We continue to exercise good discipline with deposit costs, which were flat for the quarter.
Year-over-year, our NIM expanded 12 basis points, reflecting improving retail and commercial loan yields and portfolio mix, along with the impact of a December Fed rate rise. We are pleased with the positive results of our loan pricing and mix initiatives and our taxable actions to hold deposit costs flat. Our asset sensitivity ended the quarter at 6.8% in a gradual rise scenario, relatively unchanged from the first quarter of 2016.
Next up, let's take a closer look at our noninterest income. We grew noninterest income $25 million or 8% from the first quarter with strength in nearly every category. We saw volume growth in service charges and fees off of seasonally lower levels in the first quarter and also benefited from improved pricing.
Card fees and investment services fees were up slightly, while mortgage banking fees increased $7 million as we improved our origination volumes 42%, with higher loan sale volumes and spread. 
Capital markets fees improved $13 million, reflecting the continued broadening of our capabilities and cross sell as well as a strong increase in yield volume from lower first quarter 2016 levels. Securities gains were modest and down $5 million.
On a year-over-year basis, noninterest income declined $5 million or 1% from the second quarter of 2015 levels, which did not include the impact of a reclass of $7 million of card reward costs of the contra revenue item.
Excluding this item, underlying noninterest income was up $2 million or 1%. We drove improved pricing and volumes in service charges and fees, which increased $11 million, with improvement in both consumer and commercial. 
In Wealth, we continued to add to our adviser headcount, which should propel higher revenues going forward, notwithstanding a shift to more fee-based product sales.
Mortgage banking fees decreased $5 million, as the benefit of higher application volumes and sale volume and spread was more than offset by a reduction in the prior year MSR valuation increase.
Capital markets fees increased $5 million, reflecting a record quarter and a continued broadening of our capabilities.
Turning to expenses on Slide 9. We continue to manage our costs effectively while also redeploying cost base prudently to invest in products, infrastructure and talent to support the long-term growth of the franchise. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $16 million or 2%. Salaries and employee benefits were up $7 million linked quarter and $27 million year-over-year, largely related to a change in the timing of merit increases and incentive payments, which were paid in the first quarter last year. This led to higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching contributions this quarter than we had last year.
Other expense was up $13 million from the first quarter as we experienced higher regulatory fraud and insurance costs. Otherwise, we continue to make progress in controlling costs. 
You can see that headcount was down by 74 linked quarter and also down year-over-year. We continue to take actions to redeploy expense dollars out of less productive uses into areas that will drive future top line and bottom line benefits.
If you look at our balance sheet on Page 10, year-over-year average earning assets were up $6.3 billion or 5%. We generated 10% commercial loan growth and 5% retail loan growth. Average deposits increased $5.4 billion or 6%, with strength in low-cost core deposits.
Let's move to Page 11, where Consumer Banking continues to make good progress on growing loans -- the loan portfolio while shifting the portfolio mix toward more attractive opportunities. Loan growth was 7% year-over-year, driven by student lending, particularly our refinancing products and mortgage lending. Consumer loan yields increased 4 basis points, reflecting continued improvement in mix.
Next, on Slide 12, Commercial Banking delivered another strong showing. Commercial loans increased 5% linked quarter and 11% year-over-year, with continued momentum in the more attractive return areas. On a year-over-year basis, we continue to generate growth across our targeted areas: Mid-corporate and Industry Verticals, Commercial Real Estate, Franchise Finance and Corporate Finance. Commercial loan yields increased 5 basis points linked quarter and 24 basis points year-over-year, which reflected higher rate, pricing discipline and improved mix.
Let's take a quick look to the liability side of the balance sheet and our funding costs on Slide 13. This quarter continued to see the benefit from the strategies and tactics to fund continued loan growth in a more cost-effective manner. Our focus in growing low-cost core deposits helped drive a $1.7 billion increase in average interest bearing deposits, up 2% linked quarter, with particular strength in checking. We held our deposit costs stable for a third consecutive quarter, reflecting continued discipline, pricing strategies and tactics in Consumer Banking.
We also continue to replace our wholesale funding mix to align more closely with peers and are reducing our reliance on short-term borrowing and issuing senior debt.
Next, let's cover credit. On Slide 14, we saw broad-based improvement in our commercial and retail portfolios. Linked-quarter NPLs were down $35 million, reflecting a $23 million improvement in commercial, largely tied to the oil and gas portfolio; and a $12 million decrease in retail. Correspondingly, net charge-offs were down $18 million or 8 basis points to 25 basis points in loans. Provision expense in the quarter was relatively stable at $90 million, as we built reserves by $25 million, largely tied for continued loan growth. 
The allowance to loans ratio of 1.2% was stable with the prior quarter, and our allowance to NPL coverage increased to 119%. 
Overall, we're pleased with the continued favorable trend in our credit metrics, and we expect credit costs to remain favorable this year.
On Slide 15, you can see our strong capital and liquidity ratios. We had significant progress in our capital management this quarter as we received a non-objection to our capital plan, which includes strong loan growth, $690 million of share repurchases over the next 4 quarters and an ability to increase our dividend by 17% next year. We're very pleased with the results since it will enhance our returns for shareholders.
On Slide 16, we played out our key initiatives that support the balance sheet and fee growth in our turnaround plan. As you know, we have augmented the plan with incremental initiatives and assess our progress against these initiatives each quarter. We're continuing to lay strong foundations and gain momentum across most of these areas. Where we had challenges, like in mortgages, we're making good progress improving cycle time, which include the customer experience and allows us to resume growth in our sales force.
On Slide 17, you can see tangible evidences that our strategic initiatives are bearing fruit. We continue to deliver a positive operating leverage, consistently ahead of our peers. We've been able to generate good revenue growth, notwithstanding the modest economic growth and a lower-for-longer rate environment. Our disciplined approach to expense management reflects the importance of self-funding our growth initiatives by actively managing our expense base and driving efficiencies throughout the organization.
On Slide 18, you can see that our biggest gap with peers has been revenue capture, particularly in our fee businesses, which outlines the opportunity set that will allow us to enhance our returns for shareholders. We're addressing this opportunity through growth investments in our Wealth management, Capital Markets, Treasury Solutions businesses, among others. Additionally, we're making progress towards improving our returns by addressing other drags on ROTCE, such as our excess capital position and a relatively high tax rate. We have improved ROTCE by almost 3 percentage points inside of 3 years and will continue to focus on execution to drive further progress.
As you look at Slide 19, our top 2 initiatives have delivered well against our revenue and expense goals. In 2016, we're on track to realize $95 million to $100 million in total benefits from revenue initiatives and expense saving. We continue to foster a mindset of continuous improvement, running the bank better every day. 
On Slide 20, we outlined our plan to build and improve upon these efforts. Our TOP III initiative, which is taking shape, places a greater emphasis on expenses. We are reducing our headcount in non-revenue areas and driving further efficiencies in the distribution network as well as streamlining end-to-end loan processes. We are actively reaching out to customers to protect our share of wallet and conducting a thorough assessment of opportunities to improve our tax rate to align more closely with peers. We will leverage our success with previous TOP programs to help ensure that TOP III improves the bank's overall efficiency and effectiveness while, at the same time, allowing us to self-fund investments and drive future growth.
Slide 21. Given our focus on efficiency and TOP III, we remain committed to continuing to deliver positive operating leverage. The rate scenario will move around based on events. Currently, the forward curve projects a low probability of a Fed rate increase during 2016 and 2017. Traditionally, the curve has flattened with the long end significantly lower. 
While this scenario lessens the prospect of a hope for a tailwind, we have been delivering strong operating -- solid operating leverage, EPS growth and ROTCE improvement during the last 2 years, with no net rate benefit as the one move in Fed funds rate has been more than offset by the impact of the flattening yield curve.
In any case, it is starting to look like the rate reaction in the wake of Brexit may have been a bit overdone. But we'll see. We believe the key is to focus on what we can control and to continue to execute on our plan to build a top-performing bank that delivers well for all our stakeholders.
In the back half of 2016, initial TOP III savings will help to offset some costs that were unforeseen at the beginning of the year. These include higher FDIC assessment costs, higher separation costs from RBS related to new vendor contracts, as well as a temporary increase in outsourcing costs.
In 2017, our TOP III benefit will be deployed towards containing its expense growth and generating positive operating leverage and EPS growth. This roughly $100 million impact will also help us self-fund the investments we need to drive top line growth, particularly in fees, while still showing strong discipline on expenses. In addition to the efforts that we've outlined here, we are working on additional efficiencies in areas like optimizing our branch network to reduce occupancy costs.
Also note that we expect to utilize roughly 30% to 40% of the approximately $70 million TDR gains of fund costs associated with TOP III efficiencies and the continued optimization of the balance sheet.
Turning now to Slide 22 in our recent CCAR submission/DFAST outcome. We received a non-objection to the capital plan we submitted as part of the 2016 CCAR process. Our strong capital position permits strong loan growth and shareholder return of capital while maintaining a robust common equity Tier 1 ratio. We will continue to allocate our capital prudently given the need for higher earnings and ROTCE improvement. All in, we have made great progress in improving the qualitative aspects of our framework.
On Slide 23, we provide a high-level outline of the TDR transaction. Earlier this week, we sold $310 million of troubled debt restructuring loan, and we'll look for a third quarter 2016 gain of approximately $70 million on the sale and other income. Benefits of this transaction include an improvement in the bank's asset quality, the ability to improve risk-adjusted return, the reduction in our CCAR stressed loss levels and a modest reduction in FDIC insurance expenses.
Let's turn to our third quarter outlook on Slide 24. We expect to produce linked-quarter loan growth of roughly 1.5%. We also expect net interest margin to be down slightly given the current curve. With the curve at these levels, this poses some challenges, but we will tightly manage our deposit costs and continue to optimize our loan portfolio mix. We are focused on what we can control and continue to investigate additional opportunities to optimize our balance sheet. We expect to keep expenses broadly stable in the third quarter, as efficiency initiatives will offset continued investment spend.
We expect to continue to generate strong positive operating leverage, thereby improving our efficiency ratio, profitability and returns. We expect underlying credit metrics to remain favorable, which would lead to relatively stable provision in the third quarter.
And finally, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to 11.3% given that we've resumed buying back stock and we'll manage the LDR to around 99%. Note that this guidance doesn't reflect the gain on the TDR transaction of approximately $70 million or any restructuring costs.
In summary, Slide 25, our strong results this quarter demonstrate our ability to continue to improve how we run the bank. We have delivered well against our strategic initiatives that help us drive underlying revenue growth and carefully manage our expense base. We remain committed to being prudent capital allocators and enhancing our returns to our shareholders. In the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on execution and making progress for all our stakeholders.
With that, let me turn it back to Bruce."

But look, I think in terms of the CCAR process, we're very pleased, obviously, that we have upped our game and we're not -- we're making it through the qualitative side of it well. And I think we -- when you go back to think about how we revert [ph] from RBS, one of the good things is we were reverted [ph] with a very high capital ratio, which has allowed us a lot of flexibility in terms of improving the bank and improving returns. So we're kind of in a rich man's position now where we can have relatively strong loan growth, so we can use that capital position to grow the balance sheet, bring new customers into the bank. And also, at the same time, we can have very strong distributions of capital back to shareholders. And that's been bringing the capital ratio down at around 50 basis points or so for the past 2 years, that strategy of having aggressive loan growth and strong returns to shareholders. I think we're calling out kind of a low-11-type ending point this year, down from maybe 11.8 when we started the year. So let's say, call it 60-basis-point reduction. And I think we could do that again, clearly, not -- we have to go through the process, but the potential exists to do that again given that our peer capital ratios, the median is probably around 10%. So we could do that maybe once, maybe twice again. But obviously, we've got to keep running the bank better. And we have to get our ROCE up. We want to get to a sustainable position where kind of sources of capital equal uses, because eventually, that excess that we have will dissipate. So that's how we think about it.

Our view is we need to stay ahead and be ahead, and we know what it takes to do that. I think what's also constructive in our CCAR results is if you look at the stress tests that are done, right, the credit stress that we see in our book and that the Fed sees in our book tends to be a little lighter than some of the other regional banks. And so that kind of higher quality of underwriting of credit and of mix, I think, bodes well for us because we have less -- slightly lower CCAR kind of drawdown on capital. And that gives us some confidence that the payouts that we have put forward this year and what we might recommend next year make a lot of sense."

Some of that was the mix improvement that we continue to drive, and I think we can continue to do that. Some of it actually just came from outright targeting, and we had some improvements in yields as we really gave benchmarking tools to our bankers in commercial to make sure that they've got the yields that we deserve. And some of it came from pricing and consumer. We actually wanted to slow down at our lending. One of the natural way to do that is to take price up. You've got to do that carefully. But had about 15 basis points better origination pricing in auto on an apples-to-apples basis. So we think those initiatives will continue, and we think there is potential to continuing to drive those forward. And I think the same is true on deposits, that we have to do both the tactics in deposits and we're also rolling new product programs. We've got a great new product for the affluent in deposits on the consumer side. And I think those kinds of initiatives will bear fruit. I think more broadly on the balance sheet management and investment portfolio side, we're not uncomfortable with this level of asset sensitivity, but we do want to position around the curve. Post-Brexit, you saw rates at 10-year at 1.35. And I'm sure the folks were clamoring why not just close down the asset sensitive position where rates are at 1.60, right, over the last day. And you'd say, ""Hey, good treasurers and smart managers of a treasury portfolio will look for rates in a range and choose their -- choose out a position."" I think you've also seen mortgage basis widen out over the last couple of months. That provides an opportunity because we earn money in treasury, both on the duration position and on the mortgage basis, and we can adjust which one we emphasize, which ones we deemphasize. And then I think you'll continue to see us do work around optimizing the kind of the liability side of the balance sheet, right? We've got an upcoming subdebt redemption that were planned that we had previously announced, the $500 million. And I think actions like that should help and help offset some of the lower-for-longer headwind."

And so we're kind of making sure that we can get good yields, so good risk-adjusted returns. But more than that, also making sure that we're playing in spaces where we can take in deposits and we can get the fee cross-sell. And so that's one of the things that we're constantly looking at trying to rotate is if there's an area, for example, the leasing business that we have is a bit light on fees and light on deposits and it has been a referral business that we were really dependent on RBS for large ticket deferrals, we're refashioning that business into something that's more focused as a cross-sell product into middle market customer, so we can make it part of this whole relationship. So that's some of the continuing work that's taking place."

And the thing that's propelled the NIM higher has been some of these self-help actions and this discipline that we've had. So when we think about 2017, that's what the game plan is to continue with that as we go into next year. It certainly would be helpful if the Fed starts to move again. It's interesting that right after Brexit, it looked like that was completely off the table for a couple of years, and now that markets are saying, ""Well, maybe not so fast on that one."" So anyway, we can't control that, but we will continue to influence the things that we can control."

And what we're waiting to see and what we hope to see with some economic growth is some new money financings and growth in borrowings by clients in our footprint. When I talk about that, I talk about -- I'm talking about our middle market client base. So if you look at our middle market client base, underneath our loan growth, that has been relatively flat for about a year now. So we're holding our clients, but they're just not growing their demand for credit. So most of our growth has come in our verticals and in our national businesses. An upside in the future could be economically driven loan growth within our middle market, but we're not seeing that right now."

If we need to use 20% to 30% of it, which is $20 million to $30 million, I think that will pretty much cover it. There's not only -- there's a more heavy expense element to TOP III, but there's also revenue ideas, which really just require people investment or changes in processes, so there's no big investment that goes with that. And then the tax strategies we have are largely around tax credit programs, which will throw off a little bit of headwind on the noninterest income line, but certainly benefit your tax line and give a net benefit. So in any case, I think that's the extent of it. What we've said, we earmarked the gain, the portion of the gain to cover."

We feel very good about the results that we announced today. We're executing our plan well, and the financial results continue to show steady and notable progress, particularly given the environment.
We delivered a completely clean $0.46 quarter, with 15% year-on-year EPS growth, positive operating leverage of over 3% and a 70 basis point improvement in ROTCE versus adjusted 2015. Our revenue growth of 7% was paced by loan growth of 7%. Our NIM was relatively stable as are our credit costs. We continue to be very disciplined on expenses. We're delivering on efficiency initiatives that allow us to self-fund growth investments, particularly in our fee-based businesses.
I'd call out the outline of our TOP III program in today's materials. Recall that our TOP programs, TOP means Tapping Our Potential, our TOP programs derived from our mindset of continuous improvement. This program should deliver approximately $100 million in benefits next year, which is similar to TOP II's impact on 2016. 
It's also worth commenting on the successful execution of our TDR sale, which was announced earlier this week. We expect a gain of approximately $70 million, a portion of which will be utilized to cover restructuring costs associated with TOP III.
We were pleased that we came through the CCAR process well this year, and we will pursue both strong loan growth and shareholder return of capital as we continue to normalize our CET1 and total capital ratios.
Our colleagues are putting customers first and are doing a great job in executing our plans. I'd like to recognize them for their excellent effort that continues to propel us forward.
With that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the details of the quarter."
46051729,346423457,1010946,"Citizens Financial Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Citizens Financial Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone.

In the second quarter, we continued to deliver on our growth, efficiency and balance sheet initiatives. We delivered strong operating leverage, controlling costs through our expense initiative and improving efficiency. Earnings were up nicely, both linked quarter and year-over-year, along with our returns.
Let's take a closer look at the details in our second quarter earnings presentation.
On Page 4, we provide our GAAP results, which include net income of $243 million and EPS of $0.46 per share, up $0.05 sequentially and $0.11 year-over-year, though second quarter 2015 results included $40 million of restructuring charges and special expense items.
On Page 5, you'll find the highlights of our adjusted results. Our net income came in at $243 million, up 9% linked quarter on revenue growth of 4% with increases in both NII and noninterest income. We grew fees 8% on a linked-quarter basis, driven by strong growth in capital markets and good volumes in mortgage banking and higher service charges. 
Expenses were up 2%, reflecting higher operating expenses as well as higher salaries and employee benefits. Provision for credit losses remained relatively stable as lower net charge-offs were more than offset by a reserve build tied to loan growth. So on a linked-quarter basis, EPS increased $0.05 or 12%.
Compared to adjusted second quarter 2015 results, net income increased $28 million or 13% on -- and earnings per share was up 15%. We grew revenue by $78 million or 7%, with a 10% increase in net interest income as we grew loans 7%, improved loan yields and mix and held deposit costs stable.
Noninterest income decreased $5 million from the second quarter of 2015, which did not include the impact of a reclass of $7 million of card reward costs now reflected as a contra revenue item. Excluding this impact, noninterest income was up $2 million or 1% year-over-year.
Noninterest expense was up $26 million or 3%, driven by salaries and employee benefits expense and a change in timing of our merit and bonus payments. On the credit side, our provision was up $13 million on a modest reserve build tied to loan growth.
In second quarter 2016, we continued to make demonstrable progress against our goal of enhancing our efficiency while reinvesting in the franchise. Our adjusted efficiency ratio of 65% improved 1% on a linked-quarter basis and improved 2% relative to a year ago as we saw the continuing benefits of TOP II. Additionally, we reduced our share count by 2%, positively impacting EPS. And finally, as of June 30, 2016, our tangible book value per share totaled $25.72, a 2% improvement on a linked-quarter basis.
Let's move on to net interest income on Page 6. We grew NII $19 million or 2% linked quarter as we continue to generate loan growth with improving yields and portfolio mix while holding deposit costs flat. This underlying momentum was offset by pressure from the long end of the curve that played out in higher premium amortization and continued lower reinvestment opportunities in the securities portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased $83 million or 10%, and the NIM expanded 12 basis points.
Now on Page 7. Our net interest margin, which was down 2 basis points linked quarter, reflects higher loan yields and a better mix, which were more than offset by the impact on our securities portfolio of a reduction in long-term interest rate and higher borrowing costs associated with the issuance of senior debt. We continue to exercise good discipline with deposit costs, which were flat for the quarter.
Year-over-year, our NIM expanded 12 basis points, reflecting improving retail and commercial loan yields and portfolio mix, along with the impact of a December Fed rate rise. We are pleased with the positive results of our loan pricing and mix initiatives and our taxable actions to hold deposit costs flat. Our asset sensitivity ended the quarter at 6.8% in a gradual rise scenario, relatively unchanged from the first quarter of 2016.
Next up, let's take a closer look at our noninterest income. We grew noninterest income $25 million or 8% from the first quarter with strength in nearly every category. We saw volume growth in service charges and fees off of seasonally lower levels in the first quarter and also benefited from improved pricing.
Card fees and investment services fees were up slightly, while mortgage banking fees increased $7 million as we improved our origination volumes 42%, with higher loan sale volumes and spread. 
Capital markets fees improved $13 million, reflecting the continued broadening of our capabilities and cross sell as well as a strong increase in yield volume from lower first quarter 2016 levels. Securities gains were modest and down $5 million.
On a year-over-year basis, noninterest income declined $5 million or 1% from the second quarter of 2015 levels, which did not include the impact of a reclass of $7 million of card reward costs of the contra revenue item.
Excluding this item, underlying noninterest income was up $2 million or 1%. We drove improved pricing and volumes in service charges and fees, which increased $11 million, with improvement in both consumer and commercial. 
In Wealth, we continued to add to our adviser headcount, which should propel higher revenues going forward, notwithstanding a shift to more fee-based product sales.
Mortgage banking fees decreased $5 million, as the benefit of higher application volumes and sale volume and spread was more than offset by a reduction in the prior year MSR valuation increase.
Capital markets fees increased $5 million, reflecting a record quarter and a continued broadening of our capabilities.
Turning to expenses on Slide 9. We continue to manage our costs effectively while also redeploying cost base prudently to invest in products, infrastructure and talent to support the long-term growth of the franchise. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $16 million or 2%. Salaries and employee benefits were up $7 million linked quarter and $27 million year-over-year, largely related to a change in the timing of merit increases and incentive payments, which were paid in the first quarter last year. This led to higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching contributions this quarter than we had last year.
Other expense was up $13 million from the first quarter as we experienced higher regulatory fraud and insurance costs. Otherwise, we continue to make progress in controlling costs. 
You can see that headcount was down by 74 linked quarter and also down year-over-year. We continue to take actions to redeploy expense dollars out of less productive uses into areas that will drive future top line and bottom line benefits.
If you look at our balance sheet on Page 10, year-over-year average earning assets were up $6.3 billion or 5%. We generated 10% commercial loan growth and 5% retail loan growth. Average deposits increased $5.4 billion or 6%, with strength in low-cost core deposits.
Let's move to Page 11, where Consumer Banking continues to make good progress on growing loans -- the loan portfolio while shifting the portfolio mix toward more attractive opportunities. Loan growth was 7% year-over-year, driven by student lending, particularly our refinancing products and mortgage lending. Consumer loan yields increased 4 basis points, reflecting continued improvement in mix.
Next, on Slide 12, Commercial Banking delivered another strong showing. Commercial loans increased 5% linked quarter and 11% year-over-year, with continued momentum in the more attractive return areas. On a year-over-year basis, we continue to generate growth across our targeted areas: Mid-corporate and Industry Verticals, Commercial Real Estate, Franchise Finance and Corporate Finance. Commercial loan yields increased 5 basis points linked quarter and 24 basis points year-over-year, which reflected higher rate, pricing discipline and improved mix.
Let's take a quick look to the liability side of the balance sheet and our funding costs on Slide 13. This quarter continued to see the benefit from the strategies and tactics to fund continued loan growth in a more cost-effective manner. Our focus in growing low-cost core deposits helped drive a $1.7 billion increase in average interest bearing deposits, up 2% linked quarter, with particular strength in checking. We held our deposit costs stable for a third consecutive quarter, reflecting continued discipline, pricing strategies and tactics in Consumer Banking.
We also continue to replace our wholesale funding mix to align more closely with peers and are reducing our reliance on short-term borrowing and issuing senior debt.
Next, let's cover credit. On Slide 14, we saw broad-based improvement in our commercial and retail portfolios. Linked-quarter NPLs were down $35 million, reflecting a $23 million improvement in commercial, largely tied to the oil and gas portfolio; and a $12 million decrease in retail. Correspondingly, net charge-offs were down $18 million or 8 basis points to 25 basis points in loans. Provision expense in the quarter was relatively stable at $90 million, as we built reserves by $25 million, largely tied for continued loan growth. 
The allowance to loans ratio of 1.2% was stable with the prior quarter, and our allowance to NPL coverage increased to 119%. 
Overall, we're pleased with the continued favorable trend in our credit metrics, and we expect credit costs to remain favorable this year.
On Slide 15, you can see our strong capital and liquidity ratios. We had significant progress in our capital management this quarter as we received a non-objection to our capital plan, which includes strong loan growth, $690 million of share repurchases over the next 4 quarters and an ability to increase our dividend by 17% next year. We're very pleased with the results since it will enhance our returns for shareholders.
On Slide 16, we played out our key initiatives that support the balance sheet and fee growth in our turnaround plan. As you know, we have augmented the plan with incremental initiatives and assess our progress against these initiatives each quarter. We're continuing to lay strong foundations and gain momentum across most of these areas. Where we had challenges, like in mortgages, we're making good progress improving cycle time, which include the customer experience and allows us to resume growth in our sales force.
On Slide 17, you can see tangible evidences that our strategic initiatives are bearing fruit. We continue to deliver a positive operating leverage, consistently ahead of our peers. We've been able to generate good revenue growth, notwithstanding the modest economic growth and a lower-for-longer rate environment. Our disciplined approach to expense management reflects the importance of self-funding our growth initiatives by actively managing our expense base and driving efficiencies throughout the organization.
On Slide 18, you can see that our biggest gap with peers has been revenue capture, particularly in our fee businesses, which outlines the opportunity set that will allow us to enhance our returns for shareholders. We're addressing this opportunity through growth investments in our Wealth management, Capital Markets, Treasury Solutions businesses, among others. Additionally, we're making progress towards improving our returns by addressing other drags on ROTCE, such as our excess capital position and a relatively high tax rate. We have improved ROTCE by almost 3 percentage points inside of 3 years and will continue to focus on execution to drive further progress.
As you look at Slide 19, our top 2 initiatives have delivered well against our revenue and expense goals. In 2016, we're on track to realize $95 million to $100 million in total benefits from revenue initiatives and expense saving. We continue to foster a mindset of continuous improvement, running the bank better every day. 
On Slide 20, we outlined our plan to build and improve upon these efforts. Our TOP III initiative, which is taking shape, places a greater emphasis on expenses. We are reducing our headcount in non-revenue areas and driving further efficiencies in the distribution network as well as streamlining end-to-end loan processes. We are actively reaching out to customers to protect our share of wallet and conducting a thorough assessment of opportunities to improve our tax rate to align more closely with peers. We will leverage our success with previous TOP programs to help ensure that TOP III improves the bank's overall efficiency and effectiveness while, at the same time, allowing us to self-fund investments and drive future growth.
Slide 21. Given our focus on efficiency and TOP III, we remain committed to continuing to deliver positive operating leverage. The rate scenario will move around based on events. Currently, the forward curve projects a low probability of a Fed rate increase during 2016 and 2017. Traditionally, the curve has flattened with the long end significantly lower. 
While this scenario lessens the prospect of a hope for a tailwind, we have been delivering strong operating -- solid operating leverage, EPS growth and ROTCE improvement during the last 2 years, with no net rate benefit as the one move in Fed funds rate has been more than offset by the impact of the flattening yield curve.
In any case, it is starting to look like the rate reaction in the wake of Brexit may have been a bit overdone. But we'll see. We believe the key is to focus on what we can control and to continue to execute on our plan to build a top-performing bank that delivers well for all our stakeholders.
In the back half of 2016, initial TOP III savings will help to offset some costs that were unforeseen at the beginning of the year. These include higher FDIC assessment costs, higher separation costs from RBS related to new vendor contracts, as well as a temporary increase in outsourcing costs.
In 2017, our TOP III benefit will be deployed towards containing its expense growth and generating positive operating leverage and EPS growth. This roughly $100 million impact will also help us self-fund the investments we need to drive top line growth, particularly in fees, while still showing strong discipline on expenses. In addition to the efforts that we've outlined here, we are working on additional efficiencies in areas like optimizing our branch network to reduce occupancy costs.
Also note that we expect to utilize roughly 30% to 40% of the approximately $70 million TDR gains of fund costs associated with TOP III efficiencies and the continued optimization of the balance sheet.
Turning now to Slide 22 in our recent CCAR submission/DFAST outcome. We received a non-objection to the capital plan we submitted as part of the 2016 CCAR process. Our strong capital position permits strong loan growth and shareholder return of capital while maintaining a robust common equity Tier 1 ratio. We will continue to allocate our capital prudently given the need for higher earnings and ROTCE improvement. All in, we have made great progress in improving the qualitative aspects of our framework.
On Slide 23, we provide a high-level outline of the TDR transaction. Earlier this week, we sold $310 million of troubled debt restructuring loan, and we'll look for a third quarter 2016 gain of approximately $70 million on the sale and other income. Benefits of this transaction include an improvement in the bank's asset quality, the ability to improve risk-adjusted return, the reduction in our CCAR stressed loss levels and a modest reduction in FDIC insurance expenses.
Let's turn to our third quarter outlook on Slide 24. We expect to produce linked-quarter loan growth of roughly 1.5%. We also expect net interest margin to be down slightly given the current curve. With the curve at these levels, this poses some challenges, but we will tightly manage our deposit costs and continue to optimize our loan portfolio mix. We are focused on what we can control and continue to investigate additional opportunities to optimize our balance sheet. We expect to keep expenses broadly stable in the third quarter, as efficiency initiatives will offset continued investment spend.
We expect to continue to generate strong positive operating leverage, thereby improving our efficiency ratio, profitability and returns. We expect underlying credit metrics to remain favorable, which would lead to relatively stable provision in the third quarter.
And finally, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to 11.3% given that we've resumed buying back stock and we'll manage the LDR to around 99%. Note that this guidance doesn't reflect the gain on the TDR transaction of approximately $70 million or any restructuring costs.
In summary, Slide 25, our strong results this quarter demonstrate our ability to continue to improve how we run the bank. We have delivered well against our strategic initiatives that help us drive underlying revenue growth and carefully manage our expense base. We remain committed to being prudent capital allocators and enhancing our returns to our shareholders. In the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on execution and making progress for all our stakeholders.
With that, let me turn it back to Bruce."

But look, I think in terms of the CCAR process, we're very pleased, obviously, that we have upped our game and we're not -- we're making it through the qualitative side of it well. And I think we -- when you go back to think about how we revert [ph] from RBS, one of the good things is we were reverted [ph] with a very high capital ratio, which has allowed us a lot of flexibility in terms of improving the bank and improving returns. So we're kind of in a rich man's position now where we can have relatively strong loan growth, so we can use that capital position to grow the balance sheet, bring new customers into the bank. And also, at the same time, we can have very strong distributions of capital back to shareholders. And that's been bringing the capital ratio down at around 50 basis points or so for the past 2 years, that strategy of having aggressive loan growth and strong returns to shareholders. I think we're calling out kind of a low-11-type ending point this year, down from maybe 11.8 when we started the year. So let's say, call it 60-basis-point reduction. And I think we could do that again, clearly, not -- we have to go through the process, but the potential exists to do that again given that our peer capital ratios, the median is probably around 10%. So we could do that maybe once, maybe twice again. But obviously, we've got to keep running the bank better. And we have to get our ROCE up. We want to get to a sustainable position where kind of sources of capital equal uses, because eventually, that excess that we have will dissipate. So that's how we think about it.

Our view is we need to stay ahead and be ahead, and we know what it takes to do that. I think what's also constructive in our CCAR results is if you look at the stress tests that are done, right, the credit stress that we see in our book and that the Fed sees in our book tends to be a little lighter than some of the other regional banks. And so that kind of higher quality of underwriting of credit and of mix, I think, bodes well for us because we have less -- slightly lower CCAR kind of drawdown on capital. And that gives us some confidence that the payouts that we have put forward this year and what we might recommend next year make a lot of sense."

I think the first thing I'd share with you is, I think our initiatives in the businesses, whether I describe them as pricing or mix on the loan side, continue to bear fruit. I think this quarter, in particular, you saw a 2% uptick in yields. You saw it both in consumer and commercial. Some of that was the mix improvement that we continue to drive, and I think we can continue to do that. Some of it actually just came from outright targeting, and we had some improvements in yields as we really gave benchmarking tools to our bankers in commercial to make sure that they've got the yields that we deserve. And some of it came from pricing and consumer. We actually wanted to slow down at our lending. One of the natural way to do that is to take price up. You've got to do that carefully. But had about 15 basis points better origination pricing in auto on an apples-to-apples basis. So we think those initiatives will continue, and we think there is potential to continuing to drive those forward. And I think the same is true on deposits, that we have to do both the tactics in deposits and we're also rolling new product programs. We've got a great new product for the affluent in deposits on the consumer side. And I think those kinds of initiatives will bear fruit. I think more broadly on the balance sheet management and investment portfolio side, we're not uncomfortable with this level of asset sensitivity, but we do want to position around the curve. Post-Brexit, you saw rates at 10-year at 1.35. And I'm sure the folks were clamoring why not just close down the asset sensitive position where rates are at 1.60, right, over the last day. And you'd say, ""Hey, good treasurers and smart managers of a treasury portfolio will look for rates in a range and choose their -- choose out a position."" I think you've also seen mortgage basis widen out over the last couple of months. That provides an opportunity because we earn money in treasury, both on the duration position and on the mortgage basis, and we can adjust which one we emphasize, which ones we deemphasize. And then I think you'll continue to see us do work around optimizing the kind of the liability side of the balance sheet, right? We've got an upcoming subdebt redemption that were planned that we had previously announced, the $500 million. And I think actions like that should help and help offset some of the lower-for-longer headwind."

But more than that, also making sure that we're playing in spaces where we can take in deposits and we can get the fee cross-sell. And so that's one of the things that we're constantly looking at trying to rotate is if there's an area, for example, the leasing business that we have is a bit light on fees and light on deposits and it has been a referral business that we were really dependent on RBS for large ticket deferrals, we're refashioning that business into something that's more focused as a cross-sell product into middle market customer, so we can make it part of this whole relationship. So that's some of the continuing work that's taking place."

And the thing that's propelled the NIM higher has been some of these self-help actions and this discipline that we've had. So when we think about 2017, that's what the game plan is to continue with that as we go into next year. It certainly would be helpful if the Fed starts to move again. It's interesting that right after Brexit, it looked like that was completely off the table for a couple of years, and now that markets are saying, ""Well, maybe not so fast on that one.""

When I talk about that, I talk about -- I'm talking about our middle market client base. So if you look at our middle market client base, underneath our loan growth, that has been relatively flat for about a year now. So we're holding our clients, but they're just not growing their demand for credit. So most of our growth has come in our verticals and in our national businesses.

There's not only -- there's a more heavy expense element to TOP III, but there's also revenue ideas, which really just require people investment or changes in processes, so there's no big investment that goes with that. And then the tax strategies we have are largely around tax credit programs, which will throw off a little bit of headwind on the noninterest income line, but certainly benefit your tax line and give a net benefit.

We've reported some very strong results today as we continue to execute well on our turnaround strategy for Citizens. Eric will take you through the whole team numbers and color in a moment, but let me call out some of the highlights.  EPS for the quarter was $0.56, but that included $0.04 or what we referred to as notable items. The TDR sales gain, partially offset by several charges and write-downs. The underlying adjusted result of $0.52 per share was up 13% linked quarter and 30% year-on-year, really terrific.  The good momentum we had in Q2 continued into Q3, and the environment broke our way with good capital markets and global markets activity levels, a bump in LIBOR rates and a less drag from the long end of the curve. Our team is executing very well. We continue to run the bank better for all of our stakeholders. We remain very focused on delivering a differentiated superior customer experience as the key to our long-term success.  It is nice to see ROTCE reach 8%. We've delivered the controllable part of our original ROTCE walk. It's the lower-for-longer rates environment that has held us back from even better results. But rest assured, we are not waiting around for rates to rise. We are focused on continuous improvement. We delivered 450 basis points of positive operating leverage year-on-year adjusted basis, and our efficiency ratio has improved by 3% to 63%. We're getting some lift in fees as the investments that we've been patiently making are starting to show some traction. Capital Markets and mortgage, in particular, had strong quarters. We did a good job on net recruiting. We added 47 mortgage LOs in Q3 and 11 financial consultants in Wealth.  It will be important to stay focused and to continue to execute well in Q4 and in 2017. We can expect these types of sequential EPS jumps every quarter, but it's pleasing to see the hard work is paying off. 
With that, let me turn it over to Eric."

Our third quarter results highlights strong progress as we continue to grow our balance sheet, deliver robust positive operating leverage and smartly manage our capital base. Our key metrics continue to improve nicely. EPS growth, efficiency ratio and ROTCE, and this marks the ninth straight quarter that we delivered positive operating leverage.
Our earnings of $0.56 on a GAAP basis include some notable items as we've detailed on Page 4 of the earnings presentation. As previously announced, as part of our focus on optimizing the balance sheet, we completed the sale of $310 million of home-equity and mortgage loans classified as trouble debt restructuring at a pretax gain of $72 million. As part of that work, what we did in conjunction with those TDR transaction, we conducted a broad technology and operational review related to the home-equity business. We ended operating [indiscernible] software and adjusting some legacy processes to enhance customer experience and outcomes. The cost of these items was $8 million, which was altered from the remaining benefit from the gain of $64 million.
A further down to optimization results in a charge of $16 million as we completed a deep dive review of our Asset Finance business, annualized [indiscernible] certain single product leasing only client relationships and to run off that were tied to our legacy RBS business model. These relationships don't fit our target client profiles and return hurdles. In connection with this type of decision, our experiences with clients [indiscernible] less work with resolve issues [indiscernible] and this fact, coupled with the recent decline in several aircraft valuations, resulted in impairment write-downs of $16 million on the residual values on the leases.  And lastly, we incurred a $17 million expense associated with our top 3 expense initiatives related to severance and consultants.
So with that, let's take a closer look at our third quarter 2016 earnings or sensation, starting on Page 5. These GAAP results included notable items in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we generated net income to common stockholders of $290 million, an EPS of $0.56 per share, which was up 19% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. On Page 6, you can see the highlights of our third quarter adjusted financial results, which exclude the impact of notable items. We believe this due provides the best picture of underlying momentum. Net income to comp of $271 million is up 12% sequentially and 27% year-over-year. We grew net interest income $22 million or 2% linked quarter as we continue to deliver solid loan growth and health being stable and performance was better-than-expected as we saw better than anticipated lift from LIBOR and continued strong results in shifting portfolio mix.  We also continued to make progress on fee income confront, with adjusted noninterest income up to 4% sequentially, driven by strength in mortgage banking and service charges and fees. At the same time, we held expenses relatively stable linked quarter despite our continued investments in frontline personnel. And credit continues to be benign as provision expense was down $4 million.  So on a linked-quarter basis, adjusted EPS increased $0.06 or 13%. 
Compared to adjusted third quarter 2015 results, net income to stockholders increased $58 million or 27%, with earnings per share up by 30%. We grew NII 10%, reflecting strong loan growth and an 8 basis point improvement to NIM given higher loan yields and short-term rates. ROTCE was 8.6% in the quarter and adjusted ROTCE hit 8% for the quarter, up 1.4 percentage points from a year ago.
On Pages 7 and 8, you can see the drivers of our NIM performance this quarter. With 1 month LIBOR increasing and the continuing mix shift within the retail loan growth to more attractive categories, we picked up 3 basis points on loan yields. However, we gave up 1 basis point of spread in the investment portfolio and deposit costs increased 2 basis points, largely tied to the commercial book. Year-over-year, we picked up 12 basis points on asset yield, reflecting pricing initiatives and improved portfolio mix, along with the impact of an increase in interest rates.
Traditionally, our term funding costs rose by 3 basis points, tied to the higher rates and more term debt issuance. This strong performance over the past year in spite of much lower long rates and a [indiscernible] yield curve is a testament to how effectively we're executing on our optimization strategy.
Our asset sensitivity at the quarter at 5.8% and at 200 basis point gradual [indiscernible] scenario compared with 6.8% as of June 30. We have reduced our asset sensitivity modestly and expect to continue to be at the low end of the 6% to 7% range given the likelihood of the pace of fed tightening will be slower than past cycles.
Turning to noninterest income on Slide 9, you can see we continue to make progress. On a reported basis, due to the impact of notable items, we grew noninterest income 23% from third quarter 2015. Excluding this impact, noninterest income was up 4% year-over-year. Note that the prior year quarter had $16 million in benefits from a branch sale gain and the [indiscernible] accounting change.
Results were paced with another strong capital markets quarter where we continue to see nice traction in loan syndications as well as the impact of establishing our own broker-dealer post RBS operation. There are also over gaining ground in mortgage banking. This quarter's results reflect continued improvement in our conforming application mix, as well as a decrease in pipeline term times all which helped lead to higher loan sale gains and improved spends on higher refinance volumes.  You can also see continued improvement in service charges and fees with progress on both consumer and commercial, which were up 3% and 5% respectively for the benefit from higher volumes and improved pricing. Our card fees were down year-over-year due to the card reward accounting change.
Trust and investment services fees were down slightly, investment sales were up 14% year-over-year in line with higher [indiscernible] accounts. But as we continue to focus our wealth management efforts on achieving a better mix of transaction and fee base recurring revenue, our commission. Other income increased $73 million, almost entirely due to the impact of the TDR transaction and pretax gain.
Let's take a closer look at expenses on Slide 10. GAAP non-interest expense increased to $40 million or 5% linked quarter, including $36 million of notable items largely in salaries and benefits and outside services. On an adjusted basis, noninterest expense increased $4 million, roughly flat with the previous quarter. Salaries and employee benefits expense were down by $11 million. 2Q '16 included higher payroll taxes and benefits associated with incentive payments. In addition, we brought our headcount down by 200 driven by our top efficiency initiatives.
Offsetting the reductions, salaries and benefits, our outside services expense was up from relatively low second quarter levels, largely related to higher technology outsourcing and consumer loan product origination costs. As expected, we also saw some more modest increases in equipment and software amortization given our interest structure investments as well as a $4 million increase in FDIC insurance costs.  In effect, the puts and takes offset each other, and we were left with a cost of the FDIC increase.
On a year-over-year basis, the noninterest expense increased $69 million or 9%, driven by the notable items. On an adjusted basis, noninterest expense was up 4%. Salaries and benefits are up $17 million, largely related to growth initiatives, as well as higher revenue-related and incentive costs. Our headcount is down by almost 200 year-over-year, which reflects our efficiency initiatives, more than offset an increase in Consumer Banking sales force, largely in mortgage and wealth.
In third quarter 2016, we continue to make progress against our goals enhancing the bank's efficiency, even as we continue to reinvest in the business to generate future growth. Our efficiency ratio of 63% improved by 3 percentage points year-over-year on an adjusted basis and 5% over the last 2 years as we continue to consistently deliver positive operating leverage.
If you look at our balance sheet on Page 11, average earning assets were up $8.7 billion year-over-year or 7%. We generated 10% commercial loan growth, and retail loans were up 5% across multiple product lines. Average supplies have increased 6%, reflecting our ability to grow lower cost core deposits and you can see that our borrowed funds increased $2.4 billion, which reflects growth and long-term senior debt and long term FHLB borrowings which replaced $3 billion short term MHB borrowings as we continue to strengthen our funding profile.
Let's move to Page 12, where you can see that Consumer Banking contributed 7% loan growth year-over-year and improved yields at 22 basis points. Loan growth was driven by education finance, mortgage and other unsecured retail. Consumer loan yields have increased each quarter this year reflecting our key initiatives to improve risk-adjusted returns and the benefit of higher interest rates.
On Slide 13, you can see that Commercial Banking experienced another strong quarter. Commercial loans increased 11% year-over-year, with continued momentum in mid-corporate and Industry Verticals, Commercial Real Estate and franchise finance. Our commercial team have improved loan yields by 25 basis points, which reflects an increase in LIBOR as well as a more attractive mix.
Slide 14 deposit costs were up 3 basis points linked quarter, driven by strong commercial deposit growth and rising short-term interest rates. And we are comfortable with this increase. We will continue to find opportunities to balance our desire to grow deposits with the need to defend our margins.  On a year-over-year basis, deposit costs increased 2 basis points as with continued pricing discipline, largely offset higher short-term rates.
Next, let's move over to Slide 15 and cover credit. Overall, credit quality remained broadly stable during the quarter despite a rise in commercial charge-offs and nonperforming loans tied to energy- and commodity-related borrowers. We feel good about our reserve levels in the energy portfolio but expect to see some modest migration to charge-offs and MPL notwithstanding higher oil and gas prices.  The remainder of the commercial and retail portfolios continue to demonstrate broad stability and the outlook for credit performance in 4Q remains positive. [indiscernible] ratio of 1.18% was relatively stable through the prior quarter. Our allowance to NPL coverage decreased to 112%, given the bump in NPLs, which have already been incorporated into our reserves.
On Slide 16, you can see that we continue to have strong capital and liquidity position. This quarter, as part of our 2016 CCAR plan, we purchased $250 million of shares from the market at an average cost of $22.60, returning $313 million to shareholders, including dividends. We ended the quarter with a 1 [ph] ratio of 11.3% which efforts capital structure in line with peers.  As a reminder, our CCAR plan includes the ability to repurchase up to $690 million of shares during the CCAR horizon, so more to follow.
On Slide 17, we provide an update on our key initiatives tied to our turnaround plan. We believe it's important to assess our progress against these initiative each quarter. We continue to deliver nicely and balance sheet growth across the platform. In consumer, we continue to engage with customers across multiple channels, and we are regaining momentum in mortgage and wealth, although we still have room to improve.  In commercial, we're seeing lift in capital markets benefiting from the establishment of our broker-dealer and this quarter, we took steps to refocus our efforts in Asset Finance. All in all, good execution across these initiatives is driving our strong momentum.
On Slide 18, our top programs continued to deliver important benefits. As a reminder, the company launched Tapping Our Potential in 2013 with a company-wide bottoms up focus, and we have committed to continuing to harvest ideas to deliver improving revenue and expense trends every year.
These programs have been key to our continued momentum in operating leverage and enabled us to reduce staff and non-revenue areas and streamline end-to-end processes while ensuring that we continue to generate good revenue growth, notwithstanding the low-rate environment.  With Top II, we are nearing completion of the program with roughly $50 million in expense sales, as well as providing nearly $50 million in revenue benefit on an annualized basis for year end 2016. We kicked off TOP III this summer and have already made the progress across all the initiatives. In commercial, we completed the end to end portfolio management and processes work and are focused on leveraging data to improve customer retention. In consumer, we are particularly pleased with our unsecured lending initiative, and we are also digging in on the brand strategy.  And we're ahead of plan on taxes, some of which you see this quarter.  Bottom line, we're well on our way to delivering on the $90 million to $100 million we are targeting by the end of 2017.
Let's turn to our fourth quarter outlook on Slide 19. We expect to continue to drive attractive balance sheet growth and are targeting average loan growth of roughly 1.5% to 2% over the third quarter. We also expect net interest margin to be relatively stable.  And we expect some continued improvement in LIBOR, along with the benefit from continuing shift in asset mix and the benefit of pay fix swap runoff to drive these results. Our the fee income front, we expect puts and takes to result in a relatively stable trend from our adjusted third quarter base of $368 million. We expect Capital Markets to continue to post strong results with mortgage fees should be down somewhat from exceptional third quarter levels.  Additionally, we may generate some relatively modest security gains as we position the portfolio for next year.
We then continue to discipline on expenses and expect a modest increase given seasonality. Overall, we remain committed to generating strong positive operating leverage, which has been key to improvement in EPS and ROTCE. We expect underlying credit to remain favorable but expect to see a modest build in the quarter for loan growth. And finally, as we continue to grow loans and return capital to shareholders though both dividends and repurchases, we expect to manage our set 1 ratio to around 11.2%.
Overall, we are pleased with what we remained broadly on track for 2016 full year operating earnings guidance we provided back in January a strong balance sheet growth and performance, good expense discipline in favorable credit has more than offset lower than projected fee income and the lack of fed funds hikes. Overall, this is a reflection of strong execution and our mindset of continuous improvement.
So with that, let me turn it back to Bruce."

The first is that we do a lot of legwork work internally and some amount of external consultant support to determine what kind of opportunities that we have and which areas and businesses and functions and which processes and which parts of our business. And so there is some kind of preparatory work, and we saw that come through, and I think we call that out in the expenses, the higher expenses this quarter, which cost about $6 million, right? In addition, once we do that preparatory work, we need to take severance and reserve effectively for the anticipated headcount actions. And then as those actions take place, those costs bang up against the reserve, and you won't see the impacts of that in the full period. So bottom line is you'll see most of the expense preparation and severance this quarter. That's what we called out. We don't expect that to be significant going forward. But you'll start to see the benefit build over the coming months as we actually effectuate some of those headcount actions in particular, which will benefit starting in the fourth quarter and one  more into the coming year."

So as we think about fourth quarter, we think we can continue to drive that mix shift, which is worth a couple basis points of yield on our book. And then we'll just have to see whether LIBOR flows up or not. I think what you always have to consider is that as we grow the balance sheet, we also incur some deposit costs, and at this rate of growth, those inch up a little bit as well.

And so what you find this quarter, for example, we added north of $2.5 billion of deposits quarter-on-quarter, even more year-on-year. when you're growing on a year-on-year basis of commercial deposits of 10% to 15% range, what ends up happening is you end up paying a little more of some of the new money that you're bringing in. Is it manageable? I think we've demonstrated that it is. But it will trickle through the deposit costs and we'll just continue to be careful as we bring in those funds."

And we aren't going to be relevant to those borrowers going forward. So they weren't penciling out from a hurdle rate standpoint, and we decided and so on, on a E3 basis, the returns were not very attractive and so Lou if you put those runoff, we shrink that book and start to focus more on using leasing as a cross-sell into the Middle Market and into our mid-corporate customer base.

And I think you could go back from broad context as to how this affected last year because if remember, it was literally 11 months ago, right. Soon it will be another December month where the Fed raised rates 25 basis points. And I think you saw some good performance starting into the first quarter. I think mechanically, what happens is the Fed rates is raised and then what will tend to play through is that those rates float up on the LIBOR basis, the LIBOR rates that are tied to our commercial lending book, 85% of our commercial lending book on prices. They tend to price in a year, so part of the book will be priced starting January  and other part in February. But we'll get a nice bump into the first quarter as a result. I think what we previously said is the value 25 basis points of front end of the curve is worth about $65 million [ph]. The challenge is, and we learned that the hard way as they say this past year, is that it's a back-end of the curve, moves up and down, sideways or twists, that can have some other effects, including some headwinds, and we obviously had good-sized headwinds like other banks had on that this year. So I think the question will obviously be will the Fed raise rates, is there a lot of anticipation there? But there's been anticipation before and then the question is what will happen to the rest of the curve?"

The challenges on name will continue to be intense on the commercial side, which done team has been navigating through quite well. And little bit of deposit costs will flow up as well as LIBOR comes through and as we grow deposits a bit more quickly than the market. And then it'll largely depend on what happens with the back end of the curve. That's a 10-year stay where it is today, which is certainly a possibility, right, as it slows back up to where it was.

We've moved about $1 billion of these aircraft leases into noncore and put them into runoff. We have another of our own loan yielding book of leases that we're just going to manage down. So I think the steady state portfolio is going to be around low  4s, $4 billion to $4.25 billion [ph]. And overtime, the duration of that portfolio is about 4 years. We'll continue to churn that and target that towards our existing Citizens customer base. A lot of that was spoonfed for us from RBS, and we need to actually integrate this into our offerings with our customers. And so I'd say we call it yellow because we're kind of at the last stage of the thought process, to restructure it, and now we have to reorient the business and get the calling in place and the coverage bankers to really be understand the product and kind of have a targeted plan where we can expand the product into that customer base. But I think you should start to see that move towards green now that we've nearly figured out what we want to do. Don, anything further?"

We've -- we oriented -- we revamped our products and reoriented the customer targeting more towards [indiscernible] affluent. And so we're really focused a bit more on fee-based products than traditional commission products. And that is reflecting a little bit of a drag because you make more money right up front off your commission products and you build a book on your fee-based products. I'd say proof in the pudding here our investment sales year-on-year were up 15% versus a year ago. So the sales effort is tracking to the growth in FCs and the better penetration of customer base.

And a number of folks seem to be put back for one reason or another just having weaker growth?"

We've reported some very strong results today as we continue to execute well on our turnaround strategy for Citizens. Eric will take you through a lot of the numbers and color in a moment, but let me call out some of the highlights.  
EPS for the quarter was $0.56 but that included $0.04 of what we refer to as notable items, the TDR sales gain partially offset by several charges and write-downs. The underlying adjusted result of $0.52 per share was up 13% linked quarter and 30% year-on-year, really terrific. The good momentum we had in Q2 continued into Q3, and the environment broke our way with good capital markets and global markets activity levels, a bump in LIBOR rates and lessening drag from the long end of the curve. 
Our team is executing very well. We continue to run the bank better for all of our stakeholders. We remain very focused on delivering a differentiated superior customer experience as the key to our long-term success. 
It is nice to see ROTCE reach 8%. We've delivered the controllable part of our original ROTCE walk. It's the lower-for-longer rates environment that has held us back from even better results. But rest assured, we are not waiting around for rates to rise. We're focused on continuous improvement. 
We delivered 450 basis points of positive operating leverage year-on-year, adjusted basis, and our efficiency ratio has improved by 3% to 63%. We're getting some lift in fees as the investments that we've been patiently making are starting to show some traction. Capital Markets and mortgage, in particular, had strong quarters. We did a good job on net recruiting. We added 47 mortgage LOs in Q3 and 11 financial consultants in Wealth.  
It will be important to stay focused and to continue to execute well in Q4 and in 2017. We can't expect these types of sequential EPS jumps every quarter, but it's pleasing to see the hard work is paying off. 
With that, let me turn it over to Eric."

Our third quarter results highlight strong progress as we continued to grow our balance sheet, deliver robust positive operating leverage and smartly manage our capital base. Our key metrics continue to improve nicely, EPS growth, efficiency ratio and ROTCE. And this marks the ninth straight quarter that we've delivered positive operating leverage.
Our earnings of $0.56 on a GAAP basis include some notable items, as we've detailed on Page 4 of the earnings presentation. As previously announced, as part of our focus on optimizing the balance sheet, we completed the sale of $310 million of home equity and mortgage loans classified as troubled debt restructuring at a pretax gain of $72 million. As part of that work, what we did in conjunction with the TDR transaction, we conducted a broad technology and operational review related to the home equity business. We ended up writing off some software and adjusting some legacy processes to enhance customer experience and outcomes. The cost of these items was $8 million, which resulted in a remaining benefit from the gain of $64 million.
A further balance sheet optimization which had resulted in a charge of $16 million as we completed a deep dive review of our Asset Finance business and elected to put certain single-product, leasing-only client relationships into runoff that were tied to our legacy RBS business model. These relationships don't fit our target client profiles and return hurdles. In connection with this type of decision, our experience is that clients are less likely to work with us to resolve issues regarding the value of the collateral, and this fact, coupled with the recent decline in several aircraft valuations, resulted in impairment write-downs of $16 million on the residual values on the leases.  And lastly, we incurred a $17 million expense associated with our TOP III expense initiatives related to severance and consultants.
So with that, let's take a closer look at our third quarter 2016 earnings presentation, starting with Page 5. These GAAP results include the notable items in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we generated net income to common stockholders of $290 million, an EPS of $0.56 per share, which was up 19% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. 
On Page 6, you can see the highlights of our third quarter adjusted financial results, which exclude the impact of notable items. We believe this view provides the best picture of underlying momentum. Net income to common of $271 million is up 12% sequentially and 27% year-over-year. We grew net interest income $22 million or 2% linked quarter as we continued to deliver solid loan growth and held NIM stable. The NIM performance was better than expected as we saw a better-than-anticipated lift from LIBOR and continued strong results in shifting portfolio mix.  
We also continued to make progress on fee income front, with adjusted noninterest income up to 4% sequentially, driven by strength in mortgage banking and service charges and fees. At the same time, we held expenses relatively stable linked quarter despite our continued investments in frontline personnel. And credit continues to be benign as provision expense was down $4 million. So on a linked-quarter basis, adjusted EPS increased $0.06 or 13%. 
Compared to adjusted third quarter 2015 results, net income to common stockholders increased $58 million or 27%, with earnings per share up 30%. We grew NII 10%, reflecting strong loan growth and an 8 basis point improvement to NIM given the higher loan yields and short-term rates. ROTCE was 8.6% in the quarter, and adjusted ROTCE hit 8% for the quarter, up 1.4 percentage points from a year ago.
On Pages 7 and 8, you can see the drivers of our NIM performance this quarter. With 1-month LIBOR increasing and the continuing mix shift within the retail loan book to more attractive categories, we picked up 3 basis points on loan yields. However, we gave up 1 basis point of spread in the investment portfolio, and deposit costs increased 2 basis points, largely tied to the commercial book. Year-over-year, we picked up 12 basis points on asset yield, reflecting pricing initiatives and improved portfolio mix, along with the impact of an increase in interest rates.
Additionally, our term funding costs rose by 3 basis points, tied to the higher rates and more term debt issuance. This strong performance over the past year, in spite of much lower long rates and a flatter yield curve, is a testament to how effectively we are executing on our optimization strategies.  Our asset sensitivity ended the quarter at 5.8% in a 200 basis point gradual rise scenario compared with 6.8% as of June 30. We have reduced our asset sensitivity modestly and expect to continue to be at the low end of the 6% to 7% range given that likelihood of the pace of Fed tightening will be slower than past cycles.
Turning to noninterest income on Slide 9. You can see we continued to make progress. On a reported basis, due to the impact of notable items, we grew noninterest income 23% from third quarter 2015. Excluding this impact, noninterest income was up 4% year-over-year. Note that the prior year quarter had $60 million in benefits from a branch sale gain and the card accounting change.
The results were paved by another strong Capital Markets quarter, where we continue to see nice traction in loan syndications, as well as the impact of establishing our own broker-dealer post-RBS operation. We're also regaining ground in mortgage banking. This quarter's results reflect continued improvement in our conforming application mix as well as a decrease in pipeline term times, all of which helped lead to higher loan sale gains and improved spreads on higher refinance volumes. You can also see continued improvement in service charges and fees with progress on both consumer and commercial, which were up 3% and 5%, respectively, with a benefit from higher volumes and improved pricing. Our card fees were down year-over-year due to the card reward accounting change.
Trust and investment services fees were down slightly. Investment sales were up 14% year-over-year in line with higher FC counts. But as we continue to focus our wealth management efforts on achieving a better mix of transaction and fee-based recurring revenue, our commission revenue is lighter. Other income increased $73 million, almost entirely due to the impact of the TDR transaction pretax gain.
Let's take a closer look at expenses on Slide 10. GAAP noninterest expense increased $40 million or 5% linked quarter, including $36 million of notable items, largely in salaries and benefits and outside services. On an adjusted basis, noninterest expense increased $4 million, roughly flat with the previous quarter. Salaries and employee benefits expense were down by $11 million. 2Q '16 included higher payroll taxes and benefits associated with incentive payments. In addition, we brought our headcount down by 200, driven by our TOP efficiency initiatives.
Offsetting the reduction in salaries and benefits, our outside services expense was up from relatively low second quarter levels, largely related to higher technology outsourcing and consumer loan product origination costs. As expected, we also saw some more -- modest increases in equipment and software amortization given our infrastructure investments as well as a $4 million increase in FDIC insurance costs. In effect, the puts and takes offset each other, and we were left with the cost of the FDIC increase.
On a year-over-year basis, our noninterest expense increased $69 million or 9%, driven by the notable items. On an adjusted basis, noninterest expense was up 4%. Salaries and benefits are up $17 million, largely related to growth initiatives as well as higher revenue-related incentive costs. Our headcount is down by almost 200 year-over-year, which reflects our efficiency initiatives, more than offsetting an increase in the Consumer Banking sales force, largely in mortgage and Wealth.
In third quarter 2016, we continue to make progress against our goals enhancing the bank's efficiency even as we continue to reinvest in the business to generate future growth. Our efficiency ratio of 63% improved by 3 percentage points year-over-year on an adjusted basis and 5% over the last 2 years as we continue to consistently deliver positive operating leverage.
If you look at our balance sheet on Page 11, average earning assets were up $8.7 billion year-over-year or 7%. We generated 10% commercial loan growth, and retail loans were up 5% across multiple product lines. Average deposits increased 6%, reflecting our ability to grow lower-cost core deposits. And you can see that our borrowed funds increased $2.4 billion, which reflects growth in long-term senior debt and long-term FHLB  borrowings, which replaced $3 billion short-term FHLB borrowings as we continue to strengthen our funding profile.
Let's move to Page 12, where you can see that Consumer Banking contributed 7% loan growth year-over-year and improved yields 22 basis points. Loan growth was driven by education finance, mortgage and other unsecured retail. Consumer loan yields have increased each quarter this year, reflecting our team's initiatives to improve risk-adjusted returns and the benefit of higher interest rates.
On Slide 13, you can see that Commercial Banking experienced another strong quarter. Commercial loans increased 11% year-over-year, with continued momentum in mid-corporate and Industry Verticals, Commercial Real Estate and franchise finance. Our commercial team had improved loan yields by 25 basis points, which reflects an increase in LIBOR as well as a more attractive mix.
Slide 14. Deposit costs were up 3 basis points linked quarter, driven by strong commercial deposit growth and rising short-term interest rates. While we are comfortable with this increase, we will continue to find opportunities to balance our desire to grow deposits with the need to defend our margins. On a year-over-year basis, deposit costs increased 2 basis points as our continued pricing discipline largely offset higher short-term rates.
Next, let's move over to Slide 15 and cover credit. Overall, credit quality remained broadly stable during the quarter despite a rise in commercial charge-offs and nonperforming loans tied to energy- and commodity-related borrowers. We feel good about our reserve levels in the energy portfolio but expect to see some modest migration to charge-offs and NPL, notwithstanding higher oil and gas prices.  The remainder of the commercial and retail portfolios continued to demonstrate broad stability, and the outlook for credit performance in 4Q remains positive. The allowance-to-loans ratio of 1.18% was relatively stable compared to prior quarter. Our allowance to NPL coverage decreased to 112%, given the bump in NPLs, which have already been incorporated into our reserves.
On Slide 16, you can see that we continue to have strong capital and liquidity position. This quarter, as part of our 2016 CCAR plan, we've repurchased $250 million of shares from the market at an average cost of $22.60, returning $313 million to shareholders including dividends. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.3%, which reflects our efforts to bring our capital structure more in line with peers. As a reminder, our CCAR plan includes the ability to repurchase up to $690 million of shares during the CCAR horizon, so more to follow.
On Slide 17, we provide an update on our key initiatives tied to our turnaround plan. We believe it's important to assess our progress against these initiatives each quarter. We continue to deliver nicely on balance sheet growth across the platform. In consumer, we continue to engage with customers across multiple channels, and we are regaining momentum in mortgage and Wealth, although we still have room to improve.  In commercial, we are seeing lift in Capital Markets, benefiting from the establishment of our broker-dealer, and this quarter, we took steps to refocus our efforts in Asset Finance. All in all, good execution across these initiatives is driving our strong momentum.
On Slide 18, our TOP programs continued to deliver important benefits. As a reminder, the company launched Tapping Our Potential in 2013 with a company-wide, bottoms-up focus, and we have committed to continuing to harvest ideas to deliver improving revenue and expense trends every year. These programs have been key to our continued momentum in operating leverage and enabled us to reduce staff in non-revenue areas and streamline end-to-end processes while ensuring that we continue to generate good revenue growth, notwithstanding the low rate environment.  
With Top II, we are nearing completion of the program with roughly $50 million in expense saves as well as providing nearly $50 million in revenue benefit on an annualized basis for year-end 2016. We kicked off TOP III this summer and have already made good progress across all the initiatives. In commercial, we completed the end-to-end portfolio management and processes work and are focused on leveraging data to improve customer retention. In consumer, we are particularly pleased with our unsecured lending initiative, and we are also digging in on the brand strategy.  And we're ahead of plan on taxes, some of which you see this quarter.  Bottom line, we are well on our way to delivering on the $90 million to $100 million we are targeting by the end of 2017.
Let's turn to our fourth quarter outlook on Slide 19. We expect to continue to drive attractive balance sheet growth and are targeting average loan growth of roughly 1.5% to 2% over the third quarter. We also expect net interest margin to be relatively stable. We expect some continued improvement in LIBOR, along with the benefit from continuing shift in asset mix and the benefit of pay-fixed swap runoff to drive these results. On the fee income front, we expect puts and takes to result in a relatively stable trend from our adjusted third quarter base of $368 million. We expect Capital Markets to continue to post strong results with mortgage fees -- while mortgage fees should be down somewhat from exceptional third quarter levels.  Additionally, we may generate some relatively modest securities gains as we position the portfolio for next year.
We plan to continue our discipline on expenses and expect a modest increase given seasonality. Overall, we remain committed to generating strong positive operating leverage, which has been the key to our improvement in EPS and ROTCE. We expect underlying credit to remain favorable but expect to see a modest build in the quarter for loan growth. And finally, as we continue to grow loans and return capital to shareholders through both dividends and repurchases, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to around 11.2%.
Overall, we are pleased with -- that we remained broadly on track for our 2016 full year operating earnings guidance we provided back in January. Our strong balance sheet growth and NIM performance, good expense discipline and favorable credit have more than offset lower-than-projected fee income and the lack of Fed funds hikes. Overall, this is a reflection of strong execution and our mindset of continuous improvement.
So with that, let me turn it back to Bruce."

I think what we have, as we considered the fourth quarter guidance that we gave, is we might get a little bit of uptick from the front-end LIBOR, which helps reprice our -- with pricing in our commercial loan book, right? We have some old swaps rolling off so that will be a tailwind.

The first is that we do a lot of legwork -- work internally and with some amount of external consultant support to determine what kind of opportunities we have and which areas and businesses and functions and which processes and which parts of our business. And so there is some kind of preparatory work, and you saw that come through. And I think we called that out in the expenses -- the higher expenses this quarter, which cost about $6 million, right? In addition, once we do that preparatory work, we need to take severance and reserve effectively for the anticipated headcount actions. And then as those actions take place, those costs bang up against the reserve and you won't see the impacts of that in the forward period. So bottom line is you'll see most of the expense preparation and severance this quarter. That's what we've called out. We don't expect that to be significant going forward. But you'll start to see the benefit build over the coming months as we actually effectuate some of those headcount actions in particular, which will benefit starting in the fourth quarter and one more into the coming year."

But that'll just flow into the run rate, and those benefits that we're showing are net benefits. So I think to Eric's point, we've reflected most of those costs at this point."

Let me give you the color. I think we expect loan yields to continue to inch upwards. The biggest driver of that has been, over the last couple of quarters, our mix shift, in particular in consumer; and earlier in the year, was the  uptick in LIBOR, which helped the commercial loan yields. So as we think about fourth quarter, right, we think we can continue to drive that mix shift, which is worth a couple basis points of yield on our book. And then we'll just have to see whether LIBOR floats up or not. I think what you always have to consider is that as we grow the balance sheet, we also incur some deposit costs, and at this rate of growth, those inch up a little bit as well.

I think we are growing our balance sheet at closer to 7% on the loan side. We need to fund that with deposits. We found -- we've made a conscious choice to increase deposit balances on the commercial side. We find them that -- find that they're lower cost there than retail in aggregate and on the margin. And so what you find -- this quarter, for example, we added north of $2.5 billion of deposits quarter-on-quarter, even more year-on-year. When you're growing on a year-on-year basis commercial deposits in 10% to 15% range, what ends up happening is you end up paying a little more on some of the new money that you're bringing in. Is it manageable? I think we've demonstrated that it is. But it will trickle through the deposit costs, and we'll just continue to be careful as we bring in those funds."

The -- and I think you could go back for broad context as to how this affected us last year. Because, if you remember, it was literally 11 months ago, right, and so soon we'll be into another December month, where the Fed raised rates 25 basis points. And I think you saw some good performance starting into the first quarter. I think mechanically, what happens is the Fed rate is raised and then what will tend to play through is that those rates float up on a LIBOR basis. The LIBOR rates then are tied to our commercial lending book. 85% of our commercial lending book reprices. They tend to reprice in arrears, so there'll be -- part of the book will be priced starting January, another part in this -- in February. But we'll get a nice bump into the first quarter as a result. I think what we previously said is that the value of 25 basis points at the front end of the curve is worth about $65 million. The challenge is, and we learned that the hard way, as they say, this past year, is that, as the back end of the curve moves up, down, sideways or twists, that can have some other effects, including some headwinds. And we obviously had good-sized headwinds, like other banks had on that this year. So I think the question will obviously be, will the Fed raise rates? There's a lot of anticipation there, but that's -- there's been anticipation before. And then the question is, what will happen to the rest of the curve?"

And we'll give more fulsome guidance in January when it comes to NIM. What I would say is that the -- a boost in the front end should be a positive, right, an uptick -- should help with an uptick to NIM. Our loan mix initiatives should continue. That, Brad has been shepherding, so we expect that to be a positive. The challenges on NIM will continue to be intense competition on the commercial side, which Don's team has been navigating through quite well. A little bit of deposit cost will float up as well as LIBOR comes through and as we grow deposits a bit more quickly than the market. And then it'll largely depend on what happens with the back end of the curve. Does the 10-year stay where it is today, which is certainly a possibility, right? Does it float back up to where it was? Remember where it was a year ago. It was quite nice when it was at the 2.20% level, not only 2% but 2.20%. But does it stay where we are or does it move in another direction, I think that's the big open item. And I think to be honest, we'll see more of that develop through December and early January, and that'll help us give you some good guidance into '17."

So I think you have to really be better served to focus on the individual line items where we've had some growth in service charges. We've had very strong growth in mortgage. Probably the one disappointing area to date is on the Wealth fee line. Having said that, we feel quite positive about what's happening in our Wealth business. So we have a strong, new leader for that business, and we've had very consistent success now in growing our financial consultant scores. We added another 11 this quarter. We've reoriented -- revamped our product set and reoriented the customer targeting more towards not affluent with an affluent. And so we're really focused a bit more on fee-based products than traditional commissioned products. And that is reflecting a little bit of a drag because you make more money right upfront off your commissioned products and you build a book on your fee-based products. I'd say the proof in the pudding here are our investment sales year-on-year were up 15% versus a year ago. So the sales effort is tracking to the growth in FCs and the better penetration of the customer base. But there's a mix change in the product, which is holding back revenues a little bit for the short term. But in the long run, it's a good thing. Brad?"

And in the long run, that's a good thing. So I think we're a little behind what we originally thought. I think we're building the right foundation [indiscernible]. The only comment I'd make on the consumer fee is that the question sort of dismissed the growth that we've had in mortgage. To some degree, rightfully so, everybody seems strong [indiscernible] with the refinance activity, but I don't want to quickly dismiss that because there's a really strong underlying trend. We have said for a few quarters that we had a slowdown on our hiring because we need to get our operations where it needed to be, and we feel like we've accomplished that, and we've had 2 really strong quarters of hiring mortgage loan officers. So we do believe even after the mortgage refinance slows a little bit, that we'd be able to see pretty strong mortgage fees into the future. So that I think there's some good underlying trends in mortgage as well."

We started to work on taxes I think in an industrious way in the springtime, and folded it into our TOP III initiative. And you're seeing some of the early returns on that. And I think we're doing what the other regional banks are doing. There's nothing really special here. We're availing ourselves that federal R&D tax credit, state investments tax credit. And so what you saw this quarter was a little bit of the catch-up activity from the prior years. I think going forward, what you'll see is kind of the annual version of those tax credit programs, plus the standard tax benefits that come from the LIHTC, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. We do a modest amount of wind farms and some other tax advantage investing, and we'll continue to do that. So I think we had a particularly strong quarter this time around. I think you saw that we've guided to 31.5% for next quarter. So down now 150 basis points from that 33% area that we were running at. And if you think about it, it's just part of the benchmarking and review of how they optimize our regional bank and improve ROTCE, right? Part of that this operating leverage, part of that is fee income growth and part of that is operating with an attractive tax rate. . And so it's part of that continued effort.

We've reported some very strong results today as we continue to execute well on our turnaround strategy for Citizens. Eric will take you through all the key numbers and color in a moment, but let me call out some of the highlights.  
EPS for the quarter was $0.56 but that included $0.04 of what we refer to as notable items, the TDR sales gain partially offset by several charges and write-downs. The underlying adjusted result of $0.52 per share was up 13% linked quarter and 30% year-on-year, really terrific. The good momentum we had in Q2 continued into Q3, and the environment broke our way with good capital markets and global markets activity levels, a bump in LIBOR rates and lessening drag from the long end of the curve. 
Our team is executing very well. We continue to run the bank better for all of our stakeholders. We remain very focused on delivering a differentiated superior customer experience as the key to our long-term success. 
It is nice to see ROTCE reach 8%. We've delivered the controllable part of our original ROTCE walk. It's the lower-for-longer rates environment that has held us back from even better results. But rest assured, we are not waiting around for rates to rise. We're focused on continuous improvement. 
We delivered 450 basis points of positive operating leverage year-on-year, adjusted basis, and our efficiency ratio has improved by 3% to 63%. We're getting some lift in fees as the investments that we've been patiently making are starting to show some traction. Capital Markets and mortgage, in particular, had strong quarters. We did a good job on net recruiting. We added 47 mortgage LOs in Q3 and 11 financial consultants in Wealth.  
It will be important to stay focused and to continue to execute well in Q4 and in 2017. We can't expect these types of sequential EPS jumps every quarter, but it's pleasing to see the hard work is paying off. 
With that, let me turn it over to Eric."

Our third quarter results highlight strong progress as we continued to grow our balance sheet, deliver robust positive operating leverage and smartly manage our capital base. Our key metrics continue to improve nicely, EPS growth, efficiency ratio and ROTCE. And this marks the ninth straight quarter that we've delivered positive operating leverage.
Our earnings of $0.56 on a GAAP basis include some notable items, as we've detailed on Page 4 of the earnings presentation. As previously announced, as part of our focus on optimizing the balance sheet, we completed the sale of $310 million of home equity and mortgage loans classified as troubled debt restructuring at a pretax gain of $72 million. As part of that work, what we did in conjunction with the TDR transaction, we conducted a broad technology and operational review related to the home equity business. We ended up writing off some software and adjusting some legacy processes to enhance customer experience and outcomes. The cost of these items was $8 million, which resulted in a remaining benefit from the gain of $64 million.
A further balance sheet optimization which had resulted in a charge of $16 million as we completed a deep dive review of our Asset Finance business and elected to put certain single-product, leasing-only client relationships into runoff that were tied to our legacy RBS business model. These relationships don't fit our target client profiles and return hurdles. In connection with this type of decision, our experience is that clients are less likely to work with us to resolve issues regarding the value of the collateral, and this fact, coupled with the recent decline in several aircraft valuations, resulted in impairment write-downs of $16 million on the residual values on the leases.  And lastly, we incurred a $17 million expense associated with our TOP III expense initiatives related to severance and consultants.
So with that, let's take a closer look at our third quarter 2016 earnings presentation, starting with Page 5. These GAAP results include the notable items in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we generated net income to common stockholders of $290 million, an EPS of $0.56 per share, which was up 19% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. 
On Page 6, you can see the highlights of our third quarter adjusted financial results, which exclude the impact of notable items. We believe this view provides the best picture of underlying momentum. Net income to common of $271 million is up 12% sequentially and 27% year-over-year. We grew net interest income $22 million or 2% linked quarter as we continued to deliver solid loan growth and held NIM stable. The NIM performance was better than expected as we saw a better-than-anticipated lift from LIBOR and continued strong results in shifting portfolio mix.  
We also continued to make progress on fee income front, with adjusted noninterest income up to 4% sequentially, driven by strength in mortgage banking and service charges and fees. At the same time, we held expenses relatively stable linked quarter despite our continued investments in frontline personnel. And credit continues to be benign as provision expense was down $4 million. So on a linked-quarter basis, adjusted EPS increased $0.06 or 13%. 
Compared to adjusted third quarter 2015 results, net income to common stockholders increased $58 million or 27%, with earnings per share up 30%. We grew NII 10%, reflecting strong loan growth and an 8 basis point improvement to NIM given the higher loan yields and short-term rates. ROTCE was 8.6% in the quarter, and adjusted ROTCE hit 8% for the quarter, up 1.4 percentage points from a year ago.
On Pages 7 and 8, you can see the drivers of our NIM performance this quarter. With 1-month LIBOR increasing and the continuing mix shift within the retail loan book to more attractive categories, we picked up 3 basis points on loan yields. However, we gave up 1 basis point of spread in the investment portfolio, and deposit costs increased 2 basis points, largely tied to the commercial book. Year-over-year, we picked up 12 basis points on asset yield, reflecting pricing initiatives and improved portfolio mix, along with the impact of an increase in interest rates.
Additionally, our term funding costs rose by 3 basis points, tied to the higher rates and more term debt issuance. This strong performance over the past year, in spite of much lower long rates and a flatter yield curve, is a testament to how effectively we are executing on our optimization strategies.  Our asset sensitivity ended the quarter at 5.8% in a 200 basis point gradual rise scenario compared with 6.8% as of June 30. We have reduced our asset sensitivity modestly and expect to continue to be at the low end of the 6% to 7% range, given that likelihood of the pace of Fed tightening will be slower than past cycles.
Turning to noninterest income on Slide 9. You can see we continued to make progress. On a reported basis, due to the impact of notable items, we grew noninterest income 23% from third quarter 2015. Excluding this impact, noninterest income was up 4% year-over-year. Note that the prior year quarter had $60 million in benefits from a branch sale gain and the card accounting change.
The results were paved by another strong Capital Markets quarter, where we continue to see nice traction in loan syndications, as well as the impact of establishing our own broker-dealer post-RBS operation. We're also regaining ground in mortgage banking. This quarter's results reflect continued improvement in our conforming application mix as well as a decrease in pipeline term times, all of which helped lead to higher loan sale gains and improved spreads on higher refinance volumes. You can also see continued improvement in service charges and fees with progress on both consumer and commercial, which were up 3% and 5%, respectively, with a benefit from higher volumes and improved pricing. Our card fees were down year-over-year due to the card reward accounting change.
Trust and investment services fees were down slightly. The investment sales were up 14% year-over-year in line with higher FC counts. But as we continue to focus our wealth management efforts on achieving a better mix of transaction and fee-based recurring revenue, our commission revenue is lighter. Other income increased $73 million, almost entirely due to the impact of the TDR transaction pretax gain.
Let's take a closer look at expenses on Slide 10. GAAP noninterest expense increased $40 million or 5% linked quarter, including $36 million of notable items, largely in salaries and benefits and outside services. On an adjusted basis, noninterest expense increased $4 million, roughly flat with the previous quarter. Salaries and employee benefits expense were down by $11 million. 2Q '16 included higher payroll taxes and benefits associated with incentive payments. In addition, we brought our headcount down by 200, driven by our TOP efficiency initiatives.
Offsetting the reduction in salaries and benefits, our outside services expense was up from relatively low second quarter levels, largely related to higher technology outsourcing and consumer loan product origination costs. As expected, we also saw some more modest increases in equipment and software amortization given our infrastructure investments as well as a $4 million increase in FDIC insurance costs. In effect, the puts and takes offset each other, and we were left with the cost of the FDIC increase.
On a year-over-year basis, our noninterest expense increased $69 million or 9%, driven by the notable items. On an adjusted basis, noninterest expense was up 4%. Salaries and benefits are up $17 million, largely related to growth initiatives as well as higher revenue-related incentive costs. Our headcount is down by almost 200 year-over-year, which reflects our efficiency initiatives, more than offsetting an increase in the Consumer Banking sales force, largely in mortgage and Wealth.
In third quarter 2016, we continue to make progress against our goals enhancing the bank's efficiency even as we continue to reinvest in the business to generate future growth. Our efficiency ratio of 63% improved by 3 percentage points year-over-year on an adjusted basis and 5% over the last 2 years as we continue to consistently deliver positive operating leverage.
If you look at our balance sheet on Page 11, average earning assets were up $8.7 billion year-over-year or 7%. We generated 10% commercial loan growth, and retail loans were up 5% across multiple product lines. Average deposits increased 6%, reflecting our ability to grow lower-cost core deposits. And you can see that our borrowed funds increased $2.4 billion, which reflects growth in long-term senior debt and long-term FHLB  borrowings, which replaced $3 billion short-term FHLB borrowings as we continue to strengthen our funding profile.
Let's move to Page 12, where you can see that Consumer Banking contributed 7% loan growth year-over-year and improved yields 22 basis points. Loan growth was driven by education finance, mortgage and other unsecured retail. Consumer loan yields have increased each quarter this year, reflecting our team's initiatives to improve risk-adjusted returns and the benefit of higher interest rates.
On Slide 13, you can see that Commercial Banking experienced another strong quarter. Commercial loans increased 11% year-over-year, with continued momentum in mid-corporate and Industry Verticals, Commercial Real Estate and franchise finance. Our commercial team had improved loan yields by 25 basis points, which reflects an increase in LIBOR as well as a more attractive mix.
Slide 14. Deposit costs were up 3 basis points linked quarter, driven by strong commercial deposit growth and rising short-term interest rates. While we are comfortable with this increase, we will continue to find opportunities to balance our desire to grow deposits with the need to defend our margins. On a year-over-year basis, deposit costs increased 2 basis points as our continued pricing discipline largely offset higher short-term rates.
Next, let's move over to Slide 15 and cover credit. Overall, credit quality remained broadly stable during the quarter despite a rise in commercial charge-offs and nonperforming loans tied to energy- and commodity-related borrowers. We feel good about our reserve levels in the energy portfolio but expect to see some modest migration to charge-offs and NPL, notwithstanding higher oil and gas prices.  The remainder of the commercial and retail portfolios continued to demonstrate broad stability, and the outlook for credit performance in 4Q remains positive. The allowance-to-loans ratio of 1.18% was relatively stable through the prior quarter. Our allowance to NPL coverage decreased to 112%, given the bump in NPLs, which have already been incorporated into our reserves.
On Slide 16, you can see that we continue to have strong capital and liquidity position. This quarter, as part of our 2016 CCAR plan, we've repurchased $250 million of shares from the market at an average cost of $22.60, returning $313 million to shareholders including dividends. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.3%, which reflects our efforts to bring our capital structure more in line with peers. As a reminder, our CCAR plan includes the ability to repurchase up to $690 million of shares during the CCAR horizon, so more to follow.
On Slide 17, we provide an update on our key initiatives tied to our turnaround plan. We believe it's important to assess our progress against these initiatives each quarter. We continue to deliver nicely on balance sheet growth across the platform. In consumer, we continue to engage with customers across multiple channels, and we are regaining momentum in mortgage and Wealth, although we still have room to improve.  In commercial, we are seeing lift in Capital Markets, benefiting from the establishment of our broker-dealer, and this quarter, we took steps to refocus our efforts in Asset Finance. All in all, good execution across these initiatives is driving our strong momentum.
On Slide 18, our TOP programs continued to deliver important benefits. As a reminder, the company launched Tapping Our Potential in 2013 with a company-wide, bottoms-up focus, and we have committed to continuing to harvest ideas to deliver improving revenue and expense trends every year. These programs have been key to our continued momentum in operating leverage and enabled us to reduce staff in non-revenue areas and streamline end-to-end processes while ensuring that we continue to generate good revenue growth, notwithstanding the low rate environment.  
With Top II, we are nearing completion of the program with roughly $50 million in expense saves as well as providing nearly $50 million in revenue benefit on an annualized basis for year-end 2016. We kicked off TOP III this summer and have already made good progress across all the initiatives. In commercial, we completed the end-to-end portfolio management and processes work and are focused on leveraging data to improve customer retention. In consumer, we are particularly pleased with our unsecured lending initiative, and we are also digging in on the brand strategy.  And we're ahead of plan on taxes, some of which you see this quarter.  Bottom line, we are well on our way to delivering on the $90 million to $100 million we are targeting by the end of 2017.
Let's turn to our fourth quarter outlook on Slide 19. We expect to continue to drive attractive balance sheet growth and are targeting average loan growth of roughly 1.5% to 2% over the third quarter. We also expect net interest margin to be relatively stable. We expect some continued improvement in LIBOR, along with the benefit from continuing shift in asset mix and the benefit of pay-fixed swap runoff to drive these results. On the fee income front, we expect puts and takes to result in a relatively stable trend from our adjusted third quarter base of $368 million. We expect Capital Markets to continue to post strong results with mortgage fees -- while mortgage fees should be down somewhat from exceptional third quarter levels.  Additionally, we may generate some relatively modest securities gains as we position the portfolio for next year.
We plan to continue our discipline on expenses and expect a modest increase, given seasonality. Overall, we remain committed to generating strong positive operating leverage, which has been the key to our improvement in EPS and ROTCE. We expect underlying credit to remain favorable but expect to see a modest build in the quarter for loan growth. And finally, as we continue to grow loans and return capital to shareholders through both dividends and repurchases, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to around 11.2%.
Overall, we are pleased with -- that we remained broadly on track for our 2016 full year operating earnings guidance we provided back in January. Our strong balance sheet growth and NIM performance, good expense discipline and favorable credit have more than offset lower-than-projected fee income and the lack of Fed funds hikes.

The first is that we do a lot of legwork both internally and with some amount of external consultant support to determine what kind of opportunities we have and which areas and businesses and functions and which processes and which parts of our business. And so there is some kind of preparatory work, and you saw that come through. And I think we called that out in the expenses -- the higher expenses this quarter, which cost about $6 million, right? In addition, once we do that preparatory work, we need to take severance and reserve effectively for the anticipated headcount actions. And then as those actions take place, those costs bang up against the reserve and you won't see the impacts of that in the forward period. So bottom line is you'll see most of the expense preparation and severance this quarter. That's what we've called out. We don't expect that to be significant going forward.

We found -- we've made a conscious choice to increase deposit balances on the commercial side. We find them that -- find that they're lower cost there than retail in aggregate and on the margin. And so what you find -- this quarter, for example, we added north of $2.5 billion of deposits quarter-on-quarter, even more year-on-year. When you're growing on a year-on-year basis commercial deposits in the 10% to 15% range, what ends up happening is you end up paying a little more on some of the new money that you're bringing in. Is it manageable? I think we've demonstrated that it is. But it will trickle through the deposit costs, and we'll just continue to be careful as we bring in those funds."

The -- and I think you could go back for broad context as to how this affected us last year. Because, if you remember, it was literally 11 months ago, right, and so soon we'll be into another December month, where the Fed raised rates 25 basis points. And I think you saw some good performance starting into the first quarter. I think mechanically, what happens is the Fed rate is raised and then what will tend to play through is that those rates float up on a LIBOR basis. The LIBOR rates then are tied to our commercial lending book. 85% of our commercial lending book reprices. They tend to reprice in arrears, so there'll be -- part of the book will be priced starting January, another part in this -- in February. But we'll get a nice bump into the first quarter as a result. I think what we previously said is that a value of 25 basis points at the front end of the curve is worth about $65 million. The challenge is, and we learned that the hard way, as they say, this past year, is that, as the back end of the curve moves up, down, sideways or twists, that can have some other effects, including some headwinds. And we obviously had good-sized headwinds, like other banks had on that this year. So I think the question will obviously be, will the Fed raise rates?

That, Brad has been shepherding, so we expect that to be a positive. The challenges on NIM will continue to be intense competition on the commercial side, which Don's team has been navigating through quite well. A little bit of deposit cost will float up as well as LIBOR comes through and as we grow deposits a bit more quickly than the market. And then it'll largely depend on what happens with the back end of the curve. Does the 10-year stay where it is today, which is certainly a possibility, right? Does it float back up to where it was? Remember where it was a year ago. It was quite nice when it was at the 2.20% level, not only 2% but 2.20%. Or does it stay where we are? Or does it move in another direction?

The only other comment I'd make on the consumer fee is that the question sort of dismissed the growth that we've had in mortgage. To some degree, rightfully so, everybody's seen strong mortgage with the refinance activity, but I don't want to quickly dismiss that because there's a really strong underlying trend. And we have said for a few quarters that we had a slowdown on our hiring because we need to get our operations where it needed to be, and we feel like we've accomplished that, and we've had 2 really strong quarters of hiring mortgage loan officers.

We started to work on taxes I think in an industrious way in the springtime, and folded it into our TOP III initiative. And you're seeing some of the early returns on that. And I think we're doing what the other regional banks are doing. There's nothing really special here. We're availing ourselves of federal R&D tax credit, state investment tax credit. And so what you saw this quarter was a little bit of a catch-up activity from the prior years. I think going forward, what you'll see is kind of the annual version of those tax credit programs, plus the standard tax benefits that come from the LIHTC, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. We do a modest amount of wind farms and some other tax advantage investing, and we'll continue to do that. So I think we had a particularly strong quarter this time around. I think you saw that we've guided to 31.5% for next quarter. So down now 150 basis point from that 33% area that we were running at. And if you think about it, it's just part of the benchmarking and review of how do you optimize a regional bank and improve ROTCE, right?

We've reported some very strong results today as we continue to execute well on our turnaround strategy for Citizens. Eric will take you through all the key numbers and color in a moment, but let me call out some of the highlights.  
EPS for the quarter was $0.56 but that included $0.04 of what we refer to as notable items, the TDR sales gain partially offset by several charges and write-downs. The underlying adjusted result of $0.52 per share was up 13% linked quarter and 30% year-on-year, really terrific. The good momentum we had in Q2 continued into Q3, and the environment broke our way with good capital markets and global markets activity levels, a bump in LIBOR rates and lessening drag from the long end of the curve. 
Our team is executing very well. We continue to run the bank better for all of our stakeholders. We remain very focused on delivering a differentiated superior customer experience as the key to our long-term success. 
It is nice to see ROTCE reach 8%. We've delivered the controllable part of our original ROTCE walk. It's the lower-for-longer rates environment that has held us back from even better results. But rest assured, we are not waiting around for rates to rise. We're focused on continuous improvement. 
We delivered 450 basis points of positive operating leverage year-on-year, adjusted basis, and our efficiency ratio has improved by 3% to 63%. We're getting some lift in fees as the investments that we've been patiently making are starting to show some traction. Capital Markets and mortgage, in particular, had strong quarters. We did a good job on net recruiting. We added 47 mortgage LOs in Q3 and 11 financial consultants in Wealth.  
It will be important to stay focused and to continue to execute well in Q4 and in 2017. We can't expect these types of sequential EPS jumps every quarter, but it's pleasing to see the hard work is paying off. 
With that, let me turn it over to Eric."

Our third quarter results highlight strong progress as we continued to grow our balance sheet, deliver robust positive operating leverage and smartly manage our capital base. Our key metrics continue to improve nicely, EPS growth, efficiency ratio and ROTCE. And this marks the ninth straight quarter that we've delivered positive operating leverage.
Our earnings of $0.56 on a GAAP basis include some notable items, as we've detailed on Page 4 of the earnings presentation. As previously announced, as part of our focus on optimizing the balance sheet, we completed the sale of $310 million of home equity and mortgage loans classified as troubled debt restructuring at a pretax gain of $72 million. As part of that work, what we did in conjunction with the TDR transaction, we conducted a broad technology and operational review related to the home equity business. We ended up writing off some software and adjusting some legacy processes to enhance customer experience and outcomes. The cost of these items was $8 million, which resulted in a remaining benefit from the gain of $64 million.
A further balance sheet optimization which had resulted in a charge of $16 million as we completed a deep dive review of our Asset Finance business and elected to put certain single-product, leasing-only client relationships into runoff that were tied to our legacy RBS business model. These relationships don't fit our target client profiles and return hurdles. In connection with this type of decision, our experience is that clients are less likely to work with us to resolve issues regarding the value of the collateral, and this fact, coupled with the recent decline in several aircraft valuations, resulted in impairment write-downs of $16 million on the residual values on the leases.  And lastly, we incurred a $17 million expense associated with our TOP III expense initiatives related to severance and consultants.
So with that, let's take a closer look at our third quarter 2016 earnings presentation, starting with Page 5. These GAAP results include the notable items in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we generated net income to common stockholders of $290 million, an EPS of $0.56 per share, which was up 19% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. 
On Page 6, you can see the highlights of our third quarter adjusted financial results, which exclude the impact of notable items. We believe this view provides the best picture of underlying momentum. Net income to common of $271 million is up 12% sequentially and 27% year-over-year. We grew net interest income $22 million or 2% linked quarter as we continued to deliver solid loan growth and held NIM stable. The NIM performance was better than expected as we saw a better-than-anticipated lift from LIBOR and continued strong results in shifting portfolio mix.  
We also continued to make progress on fee income front, with adjusted noninterest income up to 4% sequentially, driven by strength in mortgage banking and service charges and fees. At the same time, we held expenses relatively stable linked quarter despite our continued investments in frontline personnel. And credit continues to be benign as provision expense was down $4 million. So on a linked-quarter basis, adjusted EPS increased $0.06 or 13%. 
Compared to adjusted third quarter 2015 results, net income to common stockholders increased $58 million or 27%, with earnings per share up 30%. We grew NII 10%, reflecting strong loan growth and an 8 basis point improvement to NIM given the higher loan yields and short-term rates. ROTCE was 8.6% in the quarter, and adjusted ROTCE hit 8% for the quarter, up 1.4 percentage points from a year ago.
On Pages 7 and 8, you can see the drivers of our NIM performance this quarter. With 1-month LIBOR increasing and the continuing mix shift within the retail loan book to more attractive categories, we picked up 3 basis points on loan yields. However, we gave up 1 basis point of spread in the investment portfolio, and deposit costs increased 2 basis points, largely tied to the commercial book. Year-over-year, we picked up 12 basis points on asset yield, reflecting pricing initiatives and improved portfolio mix, along with the impact of an increase in interest rates.
Additionally, our term funding costs rose by 3 basis points, tied to the higher rates and more term debt issuance. This strong performance over the past year, in spite of much lower long rates and a flatter yield curve, is a testament to how effectively we are executing on our optimization strategies.  Our asset sensitivity ended the quarter at 5.8% in a 200 basis point gradual rise scenario compared with 6.8% as of June 30. We have reduced our asset sensitivity modestly and expect to continue to be at the low end of the 6% to 7% range, given that likelihood of the pace of Fed tightening will be slower than past cycles.
Turning to noninterest income on Slide 9. You can see we continued to make progress. On a reported basis, due to the impact of notable items, we grew noninterest income 23% from third quarter 2015. Excluding this impact, noninterest income was up 4% year-over-year. Note that the prior year quarter had $60 million in benefits from a branch sale gain and the card accounting change.
The results were paved by another strong Capital Markets quarter, where we continue to see nice traction in loan syndications, as well as the impact of establishing our own broker-dealer post-RBS operation. We're also regaining ground in mortgage banking. This quarter's results reflect continued improvement in our conforming application mix as well as a decrease in pipeline term times, all of which helped lead to higher loan sale gains and improved spreads on higher refinance volumes. You can also see continued improvement in service charges and fees with progress on both consumer and commercial, which were up 3% and 5%, respectively, with a benefit from higher volumes and improved pricing. Our card fees were down year-over-year due to the card reward accounting change.
Trust and investment services fees were down slightly. The investment sales were up 14% year-over-year in line with higher FC counts. But as we continue to focus our wealth management efforts on achieving a better mix of transaction and fee-based recurring revenue, our commission revenue is lighter. Other income increased $73 million, almost entirely due to the impact of the TDR transaction pretax gain.
Let's take a closer look at expenses on Slide 10. GAAP noninterest expense increased $40 million or 5% linked quarter, including $36 million of notable items, largely in salaries and benefits and outside services. On an adjusted basis, noninterest expense increased $4 million, roughly flat with the previous quarter. Salaries and employee benefits expense were down by $11 million. 2Q '16 included higher payroll taxes and benefits associated with incentive payments. In addition, we brought our headcount down by 200, driven by our TOP efficiency initiatives.
Offsetting the reduction in salaries and benefits, our outside services expense was up from relatively low second quarter levels, largely related to higher technology outsourcing and consumer loan product origination costs. As expected, we also saw some more modest increases in equipment and software amortization given our infrastructure investments as well as a $4 million increase in FDIC insurance costs. In effect, the puts and takes offset each other, and we were left with the cost of the FDIC increase.
On a year-over-year basis, our noninterest expense increased $69 million or 9%, driven by the notable items. On an adjusted basis, noninterest expense was up 4%. Salaries and benefits are up $17 million, largely related to growth initiatives as well as higher revenue-related incentive costs. Our headcount is down by almost 200 year-over-year, which reflects our efficiency initiatives, more than offsetting an increase in the Consumer Banking sales force, largely in mortgage and Wealth.
In third quarter 2016, we continue to make progress against our goals enhancing the bank's efficiency even as we continue to reinvest in the business to generate future growth. Our efficiency ratio of 63% improved by 3 percentage points year-over-year on an adjusted basis and 5% over the last 2 years as we continue to consistently deliver positive operating leverage.
If you look at our balance sheet on Page 11, average earning assets were up $8.7 billion year-over-year or 7%. We generated 10% commercial loan growth, and retail loans were up 5% across multiple product lines. Average deposits increased 6%, reflecting our ability to grow lower-cost core deposits. And you can see that our borrowed funds increased $2.4 billion, which reflects growth in long-term senior debt and long-term FHLB  borrowings, which replaced $3 billion short-term FHLB borrowings as we continue to strengthen our funding profile.
Let's move to Page 12, where you can see that Consumer Banking contributed 7% loan growth year-over-year and improved yields 22 basis points. Loan growth was driven by education finance, mortgage and other unsecured retail. Consumer loan yields have increased each quarter this year, reflecting our team's initiatives to improve risk-adjusted returns and the benefit of higher interest rates.
On Slide 13, you can see that Commercial Banking experienced another strong quarter. Commercial loans increased 11% year-over-year, with continued momentum in mid-corporate and Industry Verticals, Commercial Real Estate and franchise finance. Our commercial team had improved loan yields by 25 basis points, which reflects an increase in LIBOR as well as a more attractive mix.
Slide 14. Deposit costs were up 3 basis points linked quarter, driven by strong commercial deposit growth and rising short-term interest rates. While we are comfortable with this increase, we will continue to find opportunities to balance our desire to grow deposits with the need to defend our margins. On a year-over-year basis, deposit costs increased 2 basis points as our continued pricing discipline largely offset higher short-term rates.
Next, let's move over to Slide 15 and cover credit. Overall, credit quality remained broadly stable during the quarter despite a rise in commercial charge-offs and nonperforming loans tied to energy- and commodity-related borrowers. We feel good about our reserve levels in the energy portfolio but expect to see some modest migration to charge-offs and NPL, notwithstanding higher oil and gas prices.  The remainder of the commercial and retail portfolios continued to demonstrate broad stability, and the outlook for credit performance in 4Q remains positive. The allowance-to-loans ratio of 1.18% was relatively stable through the prior quarter. Our allowance to NPL coverage decreased to 112%, given the bump in NPLs, which have already been incorporated into our reserves.
On Slide 16, you can see that we continue to have strong capital and liquidity position. This quarter, as part of our 2016 CCAR plan, we've repurchased $250 million of shares from the market at an average cost of $22.60, returning $313 million to shareholders including dividends. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.3%, which reflects our efforts to bring our capital structure more in line with peers. As a reminder, our CCAR plan includes the ability to repurchase up to $690 million of shares during the CCAR horizon, so more to follow.
On Slide 17, we provide an update on our key initiatives tied to our turnaround plan. We believe it's important to assess our progress against these initiatives each quarter. We continue to deliver nicely on balance sheet growth across the platform. In consumer, we continue to engage with customers across multiple channels, and we are regaining momentum in mortgage and Wealth, although we still have room to improve.  In commercial, we are seeing lift in Capital Markets, benefiting from the establishment of our broker-dealer, and this quarter, we took steps to refocus our efforts in Asset Finance. All in all, good execution across these initiatives is driving our strong momentum.
On Slide 18, our TOP programs continued to deliver important benefits. As a reminder, the company launched Tapping Our Potential in 2013 with a company-wide, bottoms-up focus, and we have committed to continuing to harvest ideas to deliver improving revenue and expense trends every year. These programs have been key to our continued momentum in operating leverage and enabled us to reduce staff in non-revenue areas and streamline end-to-end processes while ensuring that we continue to generate good revenue growth, notwithstanding the low rate environment.  
With Top II, we are nearing completion of the program with roughly $50 million in expense saves as well as providing nearly $50 million in revenue benefit on an annualized basis for year-end 2016. We kicked off TOP III this summer and have already made good progress across all the initiatives. In commercial, we completed the end-to-end portfolio management and processes work and are focused on leveraging data to improve customer retention. In consumer, we are particularly pleased with our unsecured lending initiative, and we are also digging in on the brand strategy.  And we're ahead of plan on taxes, some of which you see this quarter.  Bottom line, we are well on our way to delivering on the $90 million to $100 million we are targeting by the end of 2017.
Let's turn to our fourth quarter outlook on Slide 19. We expect to continue to drive attractive balance sheet growth and are targeting average loan growth of roughly 1.5% to 2% over the third quarter. We also expect net interest margin to be relatively stable. We expect some continued improvement in LIBOR, along with the benefit from continuing shift in asset mix and the benefit of pay-fixed swap runoff to drive these results. On the fee income front, we expect puts and takes to result in a relatively stable trend from our adjusted third quarter base of $368 million. We expect Capital Markets to continue to post strong results with mortgage fees -- while mortgage fees should be down somewhat from exceptional third quarter levels.  Additionally, we may generate some relatively modest securities gains as we position the portfolio for next year.
We plan to continue our discipline on expenses and expect a modest increase, given seasonality. Overall, we remain committed to generating strong positive operating leverage, which has been the key to our improvement in EPS and ROTCE. We expect underlying credit to remain favorable but expect to see a modest build in the quarter for loan growth. And finally, as we continue to grow loans and return capital to shareholders through both dividends and repurchases, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to around 11.2%.
Overall, we are pleased with -- that we remained broadly on track for our 2016 full year operating earnings guidance we provided back in January. Our strong balance sheet growth and NIM performance, good expense discipline and favorable credit have more than offset lower-than-projected fee income and the lack of Fed funds hikes. Overall, this is a reflection of strong execution and our mindset of continuous improvement.
So with that, let me turn it back to Bruce."

And so there is some kind of preparatory work, and you saw that come through. And I think we called that out in the expenses -- the higher expenses this quarter, which cost about $6 million, right? In addition, once we do that preparatory work, we need to take severance and reserve effectively for the anticipated headcount actions. And then as those actions take place, those costs bang up against the reserve and you won't see the impacts of that in the forward period. So bottom line is you'll see most of the expense preparation and severance this quarter. That's what we've called out. We don't expect that to be significant going forward. But you'll start to see the benefit build over the coming months as we actually effectuate some of those headcount actions in particular, which will benefit starting in the fourth quarter and one more into the coming year."

But that'll just flow into the run rate, and those benefits that we're showing are net benefits. So I think to Eric's point, we've reflected most of those costs at this point."

The biggest driver of that has been, over the last couple of quarters, our mix shift, in particular in consumer; and earlier in the year, it was the  uptick in LIBOR, which helped the commercial loan yields. So as we think about fourth quarter, right, we think we can continue to drive that mix shift, which is worth a couple basis points of yield on our book. And then we'll just have to see whether LIBOR floats up or not. I think what you always have to consider is that as we grow the balance sheet, we also incur some deposit costs, and at this rate of growth, those inch up a little bit as well. We're obviously actively managing that. But between the 2 of those effects, I think we expect to be roughly constant into the fourth quarter."

I think the way I would describe that is that if you're growing deposits at 3%, 4%, at market rates, which many other banks are doing, then you don't expect much growth in deposit costs because it's kind of BAU going forward. I think we are growing our balance sheet at closer to 7% on the loan side. We need to fund that with deposit. We found -- we've made a conscious choice to increase deposit balances on the commercial side. We find them that -- find that they're lower cost there than retail in aggregate and on the margin. And so what you find -- this quarter, for example, we added north of $2.5 billion of deposits quarter-on-quarter, even more year-on-year. When you're growing on a year-on-year basis commercial deposits in the 10% to 15% range, what ends up happening is you end up paying a little more on some of the new money that you're bringing in. Is it manageable? I think we've demonstrated that it is. But it will trickle through the deposit costs, and we'll just continue to be careful as we bring in those funds."

So they weren't penciling out from a hurdle rate standpoint, and we decided and so on. And on a Q3 [ph] basis, the returns were not very attractive, so we put those into runoff.

The -- and I think you could go back for broad context as to how this affected us last year. Because, if you remember, it was literally 11 months ago, right, and so soon we'll be into another December month, where the Fed raised rates 25 basis points. And I think you saw some good performance starting into the first quarter. I think mechanically, what happens is the Fed rate is raised and then what will tend to play through is that those rates float up on a LIBOR basis. The LIBOR rates then are tied to our commercial lending book. 85% of our commercial lending book reprices. They tend to reprice in arrears, so there'll be -- part of the book will be priced starting January, another part in this -- in February. But we'll get a nice bump into the first quarter as a result. I think what we previously said is that a value of 25 basis points at the front end of the curve is worth about $65 million. The challenge is, and we learned that the hard way, as they say, this past year, is that, as the back end of the curve moves up, down, sideways or twists, that can have some other effects, including some headwinds. And we obviously had good-sized headwinds, like other banks had on that this year. So I think the question will obviously be, will the Fed raise rates? There's a lot of anticipation there, but that's -- there's been anticipation before. And then the question is, what will happen to the rest of the curve?"

That, Brad has been shepherding, so we expect that to be a positive. The challenges on NIM will continue to be intense competition on the commercial side, which Don's team has been navigating through quite well. A little bit of deposit cost will float up as well as LIBOR comes through and as we grow deposits a bit more quickly than the market. And then it'll largely depend on what happens with the back end of the curve. Does the 10-year stay where it is today, which is certainly a possibility, right? Does it float back up to where it was? Remember where it was a year ago. It was quite nice when it was at the 2.20% level, not only 2% but 2.20%. Or does it stay where we are? Or does it move in another direction?

So -- and I think the supervisors would expect us to continue a fair amount of that. But being out of the drama of whether you have a qualitative pass or fail is a nice thing in and of itself. It will just go back in the supervisory process. I think our philosophy on gliding down that capital surplus has been sound. We're a relatively new company separated from our parent. And so we're still demonstrating our capabilities as an independent bank. We have been in a fortunate position where I'd like to say we can have our cake and eat it, too. So we've got very robust loan growth. We have very robust returns of capital to shareholders. And that -- having that capital cushion behind us allows us to continue that, which is really helping to drive these very favorable results. It's important that we get our ROE to higher levels so that we can sustain that kind of an approach on a standalone basis once the cushion is gone.

We've reoriented -- revamped our product set and reoriented the customer targeting more towards not affluent with an affluent. And so we're really focused a bit more on fee-based products than traditional commissioned products. And that is reflecting a little bit of a drag because you make more money right upfront off your commissioned products and you build a book on your fee-based products. I'd say the proof in the pudding here are our investment sales year-on-year were up 15% versus a year ago.

The only other comment I'd make on the consumer fee is that the question sort of dismissed the growth that we've had in mortgage. To some degree, rightfully so, everybody's seen strong mortgage with the refinance activity, but I don't want to quickly dismiss that because there's a really strong underlying trend. And we have said for a few quarters that we had a slowdown on our hiring because we need to get our operations where it needed to be, and we feel like we've accomplished that, and we've had 2 really strong quarters of hiring mortgage loan officers. So we do believe even after the mortgage refinance slows a little bit, that we'd be able to see pretty strong mortgage fees into the future.

We started to work on taxes I think in an industrious way in the springtime, and folded it into our TOP III initiative. And you're seeing some of the early returns on that. And I think we're doing what the other regional banks are doing. There's nothing really special here. We're availing ourselves of federal R&D tax credit, state investment tax credit. And so what you saw this quarter was a little bit of a catch-up activity from the prior years. I think going forward, what you'll see is kind of the annual version of those tax credit programs, plus the standard tax benefits that come from the LIHTC, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. We do a modest amount of wind farms and some other tax advantage investing, and we'll continue to do that. So I think we had a particularly strong quarter this time around. I think you saw that we've guided to 31.5% for next quarter. So down now 150 basis point from that 33% area that we were running at. And if you think about it, it's just part of the benchmarking and review of how do you optimize a regional bank and improve ROTCE, right? Part of that this operating leverage, part of that is fee income growth and part of that is operating with an attractive tax rate. . And so it's part of that continued effort. I think in terms of next year, we'll give a little more guidance in January as we pull together our plan. But I think clearly, we're on a nice path here."
