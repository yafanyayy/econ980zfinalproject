1027055,324695632,939054,"Verisk Analytics, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2016",2016-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Eva, and good morning, everyone. We reported another year of industry-leading high single-digit organic revenue growth with margin expansion and excellent free cash flow generation. Fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations with to",836,"Thanks, Eva, and good morning, everyone. We reported another year of industry-leading high single-digit organic revenue growth with margin expansion and excellent free cash flow generation. Fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations with total revenue growth of about 21% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of about 23%. Full year revenue grew 18% and diluted adjusted EPS increased about 29%. We grew the top line, excluding the health care analytics business and recent acquisitions, over 5% in the quarter and 7% for the full year. Profitability was strong as adjusted EBITDA, excluding acquisitions, grew about 7% in the quarter and 14% for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were 47% in the quarter and 48% for the full year. 
We continue to work on our comprehensive review of strategic alternatives for the health care analytics business. There's a range of alternatives and not solely limited to the sale of the business. As responsible stewards of shareholder capital, we are being methodical and thoughtful in our approach. The volatility of the equity leverage market in the last quarter of 2015 and beginning of 2016 has contributed to the timing of our efforts. We expect to be able to provide you with an update by the time we report first quarter earnings. 
We're always looking to innovate to drive growth at Verisk. For example, in our insurance business, one of the solutions which is contributing to growth in Risk Assessment is the ISO electronic rating contents suite. We rolled out new features, including an automated maintenance feed that allows insurers to import the most recent changes to ISO loss costs and rating algorithms directly into their rating systems. This is innovation which helps our customers to implement rate changes more quickly and more efficiently. 
And other recent news, WoodMac announced a commercial alliance with Thomson Reuters. This alliance gives customers with the ICON platform a direct link to WoodMac's oilfield data and research. The information and analysis we're providing includes crude oil production, oil product balances in stocks, oil product prices, crack spreads and refining margins. This is an important new channel for WoodMac, extending our reach to customers we were largely not already serving. 
Looking at capital deployment. We're on track to meet our deleveraging commitment even as we had made a number of tuck-in acquisitions and return capital to our shareholders through repurchases. 
We made a couple of acquisitions in the fourth quarter for about $50 million. We acquired Infield Systems, including its proprietary database of offshore asset prices. We also acquired PCI Group, which has proprietary data assets and deep chemical industry domain expertise. These 2 acquisitions complement and enhance our data and capabilities at WoodMac very nicely. 
During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders through the repurchase of over $20 million of stock. Our remaining authorization at the end of 2015 was $469 million after a $300 million increase in December. And we remain buyers of our stock at current levels. We are committed to a prudent mix of M&A and share repurchases over time to complement and enhance our core businesses. This combination positions us very well to deliver the kinds of shareholder returns over the next several years that we expect of ourselves and you expect of us. 
Our initiatives during the past year position us well to execute on our plans for 2016, and we are constructive on the outlook. We expect our combined insurance businesses will grow at least as fast as they did in 2015. This reflects the quality and value of the solutions we provide and the strength of our relationships. As we discussed at Investor Day in December, we expect WoodMac to grow in constant currency even when including the effect of Infield and PCI -- excuse me, even when excluding the impact of Infield and PCI. Given the end-market dynamics, we think this is a strong reflection of the quality of our team, the strength of our intellectual property and the depth of our customer relationships. Our health care business grew 6% in 2015 with expanding margins, and we anticipate a higher rate of growth and additional margin expansion in 2016. We also expect Argus to grow double digits for the full year 2016 even with the onetime project revenue we had in the first quarter of 2015. Over and above all of this, in 2016, we will strengthen our foundation. Our internal environment for handling large amounts of diverse data types is rapidly and continuously improving. Our data assets, already among the largest private data sets in the world, will expand, and our global footprint and a key to providing organic growth opportunities over the long term is now in place and growing. Verisk is today one of the world's most valuable, vertically-oriented data analytics companies. Our robust plans for the year 2020 will lead to new levels of distinction and performance. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover the financials in more detail."

Revenue grew 20.6% in the fourth quarter and 18.4% for the full year. And health care pass-through revenue, and excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, total revenue grew 3.9% in the fourth quarter and 7.4% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes second quarter hedge gain and WoodMac onetime acquisition cost, grew 22.5% to $263 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA grew 24% to $996 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year was 47.4%, excluding the $15.6 million third [ph] quarter warrant gain. And adjusted EBITDA margins, excluding health care, acquisitions and third quarter warrant gains, were over 50% for the quarter and year-to-date. 
Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 29% in the fourth quarter and 5.3% excluding health care and acquisitions. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by insurance. Over the full year, Decision Analytics revenue grew 25.9% and 9.3% excluding health care and acquisitions. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by strong growth in loss quantification solutions with good contributions from insurance and claim solutions and underwriting solutions. Catastrophe modeling solutions also contributed to the growth. Full year Decision Analytics insurance growth was a solid 8.1%. 
Financial services revenue declined to 2.6% in the quarter due to project work in the prior year period, which did not recur this year. For the full year, financial services revenue grew 20.5% as a result of media effectiveness project revenue and the continued demand for analytics solutions and services in the U.S., and notably expanding globally. 
The health care business again performed slightly ahead of our internal forecast. Net of pass-through revenue, health care declined 2.4% in the quarter but grew 6.2% for the full year. Population solutions led the growth in the quarter while payment solutions led the growth for the full year. All areas contributed to full year growth, and full year margins improved versus 2014. 
Energy and specialized revenue increased 410% in the fourth quarter and 264% for the full year. Organic growth in the quarter was 4.3%, and for the full year, 5.1%. Commercial weather and climate analytics and environmental health and safety solutions led to growth. 
WoodMac revenue in pounds and on a comparable basis declined 1% in the quarter and increased approximately 5% for the full year. For the period of our ownership, WoodMac contributed $211 million, slightly ahead of what we discussed with you last quarter, despite exchange rate headwinds. 
We're pleased with WoodMac's performance in an extraordinary time for their customers. Annual contract value of signs were up in 2015. Customer retention remains strong, and client engagement as measured by portal activity, was up 26% versus 2014. 
Turning to Risk Assessment. Revenue grew 5.4% in the quarter, indicating the value to our long-standing insurance customers. The overall increase within the segment was due in part to 5.5% revenue growth of industry-standard insurance programs, resulting primarily from growth in 2015 invoices, effective from January 1. Property-specific rating and underwriting revenue increased 4.9% in the quarter. Growth was the result of new sales with higher committed volumes. For the full year, Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.8%, driven by 6% growth in industry standard programs and 5.1% growth in the property-specific rating and underwriting category. 
As I mentioned earlier, EBITDA increased 22.5% in the quarter to $263 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 46.9%. Decisions Analytics adjusted EBITDA increased 30.8% to $161 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions, growth of the business and lower professional services fees. 
Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, second quarter WoodMac onetime items and the third quarter warrant gain, Decision Analytics adjusted EBITDA increased 3.7% in the quarter and 13% for the full year. 
EBITDA margins for the health care analytics business, net of pass-through revenue expenses, were 24.8% in the quarter and 25% for the full year. Fourth quarter 2015 EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 11.4% to $102 million as a result of good revenue growth, good expense management and the talent realignment cost in the prior period. Excluding prior period talent realignment cost, EBITDA grew 5.8% in the quarter and 8.8% for the full year. 
Reported interest expense was $33 million in the quarter. At December 31, 2015, total debt was about $3.2 billion, including about $870 million in revolver borrowings. Our leverage at the end of the fourth quarter was about 2.9x. We remain committed to bring the leverage down to about 2.5x by the end of 2016. Since the end of the fourth quarter, we have paid an additional $165 million. Our cash and cash equivalents were about $138 million at the end of 2015. 
Reported effective tax rate was 30.3% in the quarter. For the full year 2015, the effective tax rate was 29.3%. Adjusted net income increased 28% to $138 million in the quarter and 28.1% to $520 million for the full year. The average diluted share count was 172.6 million shares in the quarter. On December 31, 2015, our diluted share count was 172.2 million shares. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.80 in the quarter, an increase of 23.1%. For the full year, adjusted EPS grew 28.8% to $3.09. For shares purchased in the quarter, the average purchase price was $73.20. At December 31, 2015, the company had about $469 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs well above our cost of capital. In 2015, free cash flow grew 33.5% compared with prior year period of $458 million and representing 46% of adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the 12 months of 2015. Growth and free cash flow was driven by improved profitability in the business and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the WoodMac acquisition. Capital expenditures were $166 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $19 million [ph] over the same period in 2014. 
Capital expenditures were 8% of revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015. We continue to manage the capital intensity of the business and expect it to continue to move slower as it has over the past several years. 
As you think about your models for 2016, we expect CapEx of about $175 million, fixed asset depreciation-amortization of about $140 million and amortization of intangibles of about $121 million. Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $130 million. We expect the tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 33%. For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will use 28% to reflect the tax rate applicable to our intangible assets. 
And finally, we expected diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases. As a reminder, first quarter 2015 still had health care pass-through revenue included in the reported results. You will recall that after adjusting for the pass-through revenue of about $6.7 million, first quarter 2015 would have been $68.4 million. Also in the first quarter of 2015, we had about $11 million of project revenue at Argus, which had higher than average margins. Overall, we're pleased with the results for 2015 and excited about the plan for 2016 and the opportunities ahead. We expect to see growth from multiple verticals, and we're managing the business to generate long-term shareholder returns. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Eva for comment before Q&A."

To the point about data, the basic point I would make to you is that, obviously, data is very important and the data analytic kind of work that we do and others do and every one -- all of the third-party vendors do, but the distinction that we're trying to draw is when you look at the vast majority of the data that we've got inside of the insurance vertical, the financial services, retail banking vertical and the oil and gas, metals and mining vertical, a lot of what we got is very, very unique. The nature of regulation and industry structure in the health care world in the United States makes it relatively harder to have distinct data assets. That's the point that we've been trying to stress. So it's not that we don't have data. We actually have a lot of data, but we very much want Verisk to be a highly distinctive, very differentiated partner to our customers. And one of the things that provides distinction is unique data assets, and they're just harder to achieve in the health care space."

And good morning, everyone.We reported another year of industry-leading high single-digit organic revenue growth with margin expansion and excellent free cash flow generation.

We reported another year of industry-leading high single-digit organic revenue growth with margin expansion and excellent free cash flow generation. Fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations with total revenue growth of about 21% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of about 23%. Full year revenue grew 18%, and diluted adjusted EPS increased about 29%. We grew the top line, excluding the health care analytics business and recent acquisitions, over 5% in the quarter and 7% for the full year. Profitability was strong, as adjusted EBITDA, excluding acquisitions, grew about 7% in the quarter and 14% for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were 47% in the quarter and 48% for the full year.
We continue to work on our comprehensive review of strategic alternatives for the health care analytics business. There is a range of alternatives and not solely limited to the sale of the business. As responsible stewards of shareholder capital, we are being methodical and thoughtful in our approach. The volatility of the equity and leverage markets in the last quarter of 2015 and the beginning of 2016 has contributed to the timing of our efforts. We expect to be able to provide you with an update by the time we report first quarter earnings.
We're always looking to innovate to drive growth at Verisk. For example, in our insurance business, one of the solutions which has been contributing to growth in Risk Assessment is the ISO Electronic Rating Content Suite. We rolled out new features, including an automated maintenance feed that allows insurers to import the most recent changes to ISO loss costs and rating algorithms directly into their rating systems. This is innovation which helps our customers to implement rate changes more quickly and more efficiently.
In other recent news, WoodMac announced a commercial alliance with Thomson Reuters. This alliance gives customers of the Eikon platform a direct link to WoodMac's oil field data and research. The information and analysis we are providing includes crude oil production, oil product balances and stocks, oil product prices, crack spreads and refining margins. This is an important new channel for WoodMac extending our reach to customers we were largely not already serving.
Looking at capital deployment. We are on track to meet our deleveraging commitment even as we have made a number of tuck-in acquisitions and returned capital to our shareholders through repurchases. We made a couple of acquisitions in the fourth quarter for about $50 million. We acquired Infield Systems, including its proprietary database of offshore asset prices. We also acquired PCI Group, which has proprietary data assets and deep chemical industry domain expertise. These 2 acquisitions complement and enhance our data and capabilities at WoodMac very nicely. During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders through the repurchase of over $20 million of stock. Our remaining authorization at the end of 2015 was $469 million after a $300 million increase in December, and we remain buyers of our stock at current levels. We are committed to a prudent mix of M&A and share repurchases over time to complement and enhance our core businesses. This combination positions us very well to deliver the kinds of shareholder returns over the next several years that we expect of ourselves and you expect of us.
Our initiatives during the past year positioned us well to execute on our plans for 2016, and we are constructive on the outlook. We expect our combined insurance businesses will grow at least as fast as they did in 2015. This reflects the quality and value of the solutions we provide and the strength of our relationships. As we discussed at Investor Day in December, we expect WoodMac to grow in constant currency even when including the effect of Infield and PCI -- excuse me, even when excluding the effect of Infield and PCI. Given the end market dynamics, we think this is a strong reflection of the quality of our team, the strength of our intellectual property and the depth of our customer relationships. Our health care business grew 6% in 2015, with expanding margins, and we anticipate a higher rate of growth and additional margin expansion in 2016. We also expect Argus to grow double digits for the full year 2016, even with the onetime project revenue we had in the first quarter of 2015.
Over and above all of this, in 2016, we will strengthen our foundation. Our internal environment for handling large amounts of diverse data types is rapidly and continuously improving. Our data assets, already among the largest private data sets in the world, will expand. And our global footprint, a key to providing organic growth opportunities over the long term, is now in place and growing. Verisk is today one of the world's most valuable, vertically oriented data analytics companies. Our robust plans to the year 2020 will lead to new levels of distinction and performance.
So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover the financials in more detail."

For the fourth quarter, we again delivered solid revenue and EBIT growth while also investing for the future. Revenue grew 20.6% in the fourth quarter and 18.4% for the full year. Net of health care pass-through revenue and excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, total revenue grew 3.9% in the fourth quarter and 7.4% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the second quarter hedge gain and WoodMac onetime acquisition costs, grew 22.5% to $263 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA grew 24% to $996 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year was 47.4%, excluding the $15.6 million third quarter warrant gain. And adjusted EBITDA margins excluding health care, acquisitions and third quarter warrant gains were over 50% for the quarter and year-to-date.
Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 29% in the fourth quarter and 5.3% excluding health care and acquisitions. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by insurance. Over the full year, Decision Analytics revenue grew 25.9% and 9.3% excluding health care and acquisitions. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by strong growth in loss quantification solutions, with good contributions from insurance antifraud claim solutions and underwriting solutions. Catastrophe modeling solutions also contributed to the growth. Full year Decision Analytics insurance growth was a solid 8.1%.
Financial services revenue declined to -- 2.6% in the quarter due to project work in the prior year period which did not recur this year. For the full year, financial services revenue grew 20.5% as a result of media effectiveness project revenue and a continued demand for analytics solutions and services in the U.S. and notably expanding globally.
The health care business again performed slightly ahead of our internal forecasts. Net of pass-through revenue, health care declined 2.4% in the quarter but grew 6.2% for the full year. Population solutions led the growth in the quarter, while payment solutions led the growth for the full year. All areas contributed to full year growth, and full year margins improved versus 2014.
Energy and specialized revenue increased 410% in the fourth quarter and 264% for the full year. Organic growth in the quarter was 4.3%, and for the full year 5.1%. Commercial weather and climate analytics and environmental health and safety solutions led the growth.
WoodMac revenue in pounds and on a comparable basis declined 1% in the quarter and increased approximately 5% for the full year. For the period of our ownership, WoodMac contributed $211 million, slightly ahead of what we discussed with you last quarter despite exchange rate headwinds. We're pleased with WoodMac's performance in an extraordinary time for their customers. Annual contract value of signs [ph] were up in 2015. Customer retention remained strong, and client engagement as measured by portal activity was up 26% versus 2014.
Turning to Risk Assessment. Revenue grew 5.4% in the quarter, indicating the value to our longstanding insurance customers. The overall increase within the segment was due in part to 5.5% revenue growth of industry-standard insurance programs, resulting primarily from growth in 2015 invoices effective from January 1. Property-specific rating and underwriting revenue increased 4.9% in the quarter. Growth was the result of new sales with higher committed volumes.
For the full year, Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.8%, driven by a 6% growth in industry-standard programs and 5.1% growth in the property-specific rating and underwriting category.
As I mentioned earlier, EBITDA increased 22.5% in the quarter to $263 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 46.9%. Decisions analytics adjusted EBITDA increased 30.8% to $161 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions, growth in the business and lower professional services fees. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, second quarter WoodMac onetime items and the third quarter warrant gain, Decision Analytics adjusted EBITDA increased 3.7% in the quarter and 13% for the full year. EBITDA margins for the health care analytics business, net of pass-through revenue expenses, were 24.8% in the quarter and 25% for the full year. Fourth quarter 2015 EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 11.4% to $102 million as a result of good revenue growth, good expense management and the talent realignment costs in the prior period. Excluding the prior period talent realignment costs, EBITDA grew 5.8% in the quarter and 8.8% for the full year.
Reported interest expense was $33 million in the quarter. At December 31, 2015, total debt was about $3.2 billion, including about $870 million in revolver borrowings. Our leverage at the end of the fourth quarter was about 2.9x. We remain committed to bringing the leverage down to about 2.5x by the end of 2016. Since the end of the fourth quarter, we have paid an additional $165 million.
Our cash and cash equivalents were about $138 million at the end of 2015.
Our reported effective tax rate was 30.3% in the quarter. For the full year of 2015, the effective tax rate was 29.3%.
Adjusted net income increased 28% to $138 million in the quarter and 28.1% to $520 million for the full year. The average diluted share count was 172.6 million shares in the quarter. On December 31, 2015, our diluted share count was 172.2 million shares. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.80 in the quarter, an increase of 23.1%. For the full year, adjusted EPS grew 28.8% to $3.09. For shares purchased in the quarter, the average purchase price was $73.20. At December 31, 2015, the company had about $469 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs well above our cost of capital.
In 2015, free cash flow grew 33.5% compared with the prior year period of -- $458 million and representing 46% of adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the 12 months of 2015. Growth in free cash flow was driven by improved profitability in the business and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the WoodMac acquisition.
Capital expenditures were $166 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $19 million over the same period in 2014. Capital expenditures were 8% of revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015. We continue to manage the capital intensity of the business and expect it to continue to move lower, as it has over the past several years.
As you think about your models for 2016, we expect CapEx of about $175 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $140 million and amortization of intangibles of about $121 million. Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $130 million. We expect the tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 33%. For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will use 28% to reflect the tax rate applicable to our intangible assets. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases.
As a reminder, first quarter of 2015 still had health care pass-through revenue included in the reported results. You will recall that, after adjusting for the pass-through revenue of about $6.7 million, first quarter 2015 would have been $68.4 million. Also in the first quarter of 2015, we had about $11 million of project revenue at Argus, which had higher-than-average margins.
Overall, we're pleased with the results for 2015 and excited about the plan for 2016 and the opportunities ahead. We expect to see growth from multiple verticals, and we're managing the business to generate long-term shareholder returns.
With that, I'll turn it back to Eva for a comment before Q&A."

Now we already -- I mean, if you subscribe to WoodMac product, you know that they already use of forward prices as well as the supply-side volume as well as dollar value. So that will all continue to be a part of what we do. And our thought process is entirely around what is it that we can do to bring more value to our customers.

And we're very focused on how do -- the business that we've got, what are the future opportunities, how can they be maximized and how do we maximize shareholder value for our shareholders. So yes, of course, we've referenced things that are going on like that transaction, but in reality, I think that our situation is relatively custom. To the point about data, the basic point I would make to you is that obviously data is very important in the data analytic kind of work that we do and others do and everyone's -- all of the third-party vendors do, but the distinction that we're trying to draw is, when you look at the vast majority of the data that we've got inside of the insurance vertical; the financial services, retail banking vertical; and the oil and gas, metals and mining vertical, a lot of what we've got is very, very unique. The nature of regulation and industry structure in the health care world in the United States makes it relatively harder to have distinct data assets. That's the point that we've been trying to stress. So it's not that we don't have data. We actually have a lot of data, but we very much want Verisk to be a highly distinctive, very differentiated partner through [ph] our customers. And one of the things that provides distinction is unique data assets, and they're just harder to achieve in the health care space."

And our hope is that, yes, that type of investment would lead us towards kind of a sustainable growth in the future. And it's probably a little bit of a longer-term march than a short-term march, but we're optimistic, like we described earlier, in those initiatives. With regard to timing, I think we've seen quite a few people hired in the latter part of 2015 and into the first quarter here of '16.

We reported another year of industry-leading high single-digit organic revenue growth with margin expansion and excellent free cash flow generation. Fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations with total revenue growth of about 21% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of about 23%. Full year revenue grew 18%, and diluted adjusted EPS increased about 29%. We grew the top line, excluding the health care analytics business and recent acquisitions, over 5% in the quarter and 7% for the full year. Profitability was strong, as adjusted EBITDA, excluding acquisitions, grew about 7% in the quarter and 14% for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were 47% in the quarter and 48% for the full year.
We continue to work on our comprehensive review of strategic alternatives for the health care analytics business. There is a range of alternatives and not solely limited to the sale of the business. As responsible stewards of shareholder capital, we are being methodical and thoughtful in our approach. The volatility of the equity and leverage markets in the last quarter of 2015 and the beginning of 2016 has contributed to the timing of our efforts. We expect to be able to provide you with an update by the time we report first quarter earnings.
We're always looking to innovate to drive growth at Verisk. For example, in our insurance business, one of the solutions which has been contributing to growth in Risk Assessment is the ISO Electronic Rating Content Suite. We rolled out new features, including an automated maintenance feed that allows insurers to import the most recent changes to ISO loss costs and rating algorithms directly into their rating systems. This is innovation which helps our customers to implement rate changes more quickly and more efficiently.
In other recent news, WoodMac announced a commercial alliance with Thomson Reuters. This alliance gives customers of the Eikon platform a direct link to WoodMac's oilfield data and research. The information and analysis we are providing includes crude oil production, oil product balances and stocks, oil product prices, crack spreads and refining margins. This is an important new channel for WoodMac extending our reach to customers we were largely not already serving.
Looking at capital deployment. We are on track to meet our deleveraging commitment even as we have made a number of tuck-in acquisitions and returned capital to our shareholders through repurchases. We made a couple of acquisitions in the fourth quarter for about $50 million. We acquired Infield Systems, including its proprietary database of offshore asset prices. We also acquired PCI Group, which has proprietary data assets and deep chemical industry domain expertise. These 2 acquisitions complement and enhance our data and capabilities at WoodMac very nicely. During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders through the repurchase of over $20 million of stock. Our remaining authorization at the end of 2015 was $469 million after a $300 million increase in December, and we remain buyers of our stock at current levels. We are committed to a prudent mix of M&A and share repurchases over time to complement and enhance our core businesses. This combination positions us very well to deliver the kinds of shareholder returns over the next several years that we expect of ourselves and you expect of us.
Our initiatives during the past year position us well to execute on our plans for 2016, and we are constructive on the outlook. We expect our combined insurance businesses will grow at least as fast as they did in 2015. This reflects the quality and value of the solutions we provide and the strength of our relationships. As we discussed at Investor Day in December, we expect WoodMac to grow in constant currency even when including the effect of Infield and PCI -- excuse me, even when excluding the effect of Infield and PCI. Given the end market dynamics, we think this is a strong reflection of the quality of our team, the strength of our intellectual property and the depth of our customer relationships. Our health care business grew 6% in 2015, with expanding margins, and we anticipate a higher rate of growth and additional margin expansion in 2016. We also expect Argus to grow double digits for the full year 2016, even with the onetime project revenue we had in the first quarter of 2015.
Over and above all of this, in 2016, we will strengthen our foundation. Our internal environment for handling large amounts of diverse data types is rapidly and continuously improving. Our data assets, already among the largest private data sets in the world, will expand. And our global footprint, a key to providing organic growth opportunities over the long term, is now in place and growing. Verisk is today one of the world's most valuable, vertically oriented data analytics companies. Our robust plans to the year 2020 will lead to new levels of distinction and performance.
So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover the financials in more detail."

Revenue grew 20.6% in the fourth quarter and 18.4% for the full year. Net of health care pass-through revenue and excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, total revenue grew 3.9% in the fourth quarter and 7.4% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the second quarter hedge gain and WoodMac onetime acquisition costs, grew 22.5% to $263 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA grew 24% to $996 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year was 47.4%, excluding the $15.6 million third quarter warrant gain. And adjusted EBITDA margins excluding health care, acquisitions and third quarter warrant gains were over 50% for the quarter and year-to-date.
Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 29% in the fourth quarter and 5.3% excluding health care and acquisitions. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by insurance. Over the full year, Decision Analytics revenue grew 25.9% and 9.3% excluding health care and acquisitions. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by strong growth in loss quantification solutions, with good contributions from insurance antifraud claim solutions and underwriting solutions. Catastrophe modeling solutions also contributed to the growth. Full year Decision Analytics insurance growth was a solid 8.1%.
Financial services revenue declined 2.6% in the quarter due to project work in the prior year period which did not recur this year. For the full year, financial services revenue grew 20.5% as a result of media effectiveness project revenue and a continued demand for analytics solutions and services in the U.S. and notably expanding globally. The health care business again performed slightly ahead of our internal forecasts. Net of pass-through revenue, health care declined 2.4% in the quarter but grew 6.2% for the full year. Population solutions led the growth in the quarter, while payment solutions led the growth for the full year. All areas contributed to full year growth, and full year margins improved versus 2014. Energy and specialized revenue increased 410% in the fourth quarter and 264% for the full year. Organic growth in the quarter was 4.3%, and for the full year 5.1%. Commercial weather and climate analytics and environmental health and safety solutions led the growth.
WoodMac revenue in pounds and on a comparable basis declined 1% in the quarter and increased approximately 5% for the full year. For the period of our ownership, WoodMac contributed $211 million, slightly ahead of what we discussed with you last quarter despite exchange rate headwinds. We're pleased with WoodMac's performance in an extraordinary time for their customers. Annual contract value of signings were up in 2015. Customer retention remained strong, and client engagement as measured by portal activity was up 26% versus 2014.
Turning to Risk Assessment. Revenue grew 5.4% in the quarter, indicating the value to our longstanding insurance customers. The overall increase within the segment was due in part to 5.5% revenue growth of industry-standard insurance programs, resulting primarily from growth in 2015 invoices effective from January 1. Property-specific rating and underwriting revenue increased 4.9% in the quarter. Growth was the result of new sales with higher committed volumes. For the full year, Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.8%, driven by a 6% growth in industry-standard programs and 5.1% growth in the property-specific rating and underwriting category.
As I mentioned earlier, EBITDA increased 22.5% in the quarter to $263 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 46.9%. Decisions analytics adjusted EBITDA increased 30.8% to $161 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions, growth in the business and lower professional services fees. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, second quarter WoodMac onetime items and the third quarter warrant gain, Decision Analytics adjusted EBITDA increased 3.7% in the quarter and 13% for the full year. EBITDA margins for the health care analytics business, net of pass-through revenue expenses, were 24.8% in the quarter and 25% for the full year. Fourth quarter 2015 EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 11.4% to $102 million as a result of good revenue growth, good expense management and the talent realignment costs in the prior period. Excluding the prior period talent realignment costs, EBITDA grew 5.8% in the quarter and 8.8% for the full year.
Reported interest expense was $33 million in the quarter. At December 31, 2015, total debt was about $3.2 billion, including about $870 million in revolver borrowings. Our leverage at the end of fourth quarter was about 2.9x. We remain committed to bringing the leverage down to about 2.5x by the end of 2016. Since the end of the fourth quarter, we have paid an additional $165 million. Our cash and cash equivalents were about $138 million at the end of 2015. Our reported effective tax rate was 30.3% in the quarter. For the full year of 2015, the effective tax rate was 29.3%.
Adjusted net income increased 28% to $138 million in the quarter and 28.1% to $520 million for the full year. The average diluted share count was 172.6 million shares in the quarter. On December 31, 2015, our diluted share count was 172.2 million shares. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.80 in the quarter, an increase of 23.1%. For the full year, adjusted EPS grew 28.8% to $3.09. For shares purchased in the quarter, the average purchase price was $73.20. At December 31, 2015, the company had about $469 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs well above our cost of capital. In 2015, free cash flow grew 33.5% compared with the prior year period of $458 million and representing 46% of adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the 12 months of 2015. Growth in free cash flow was driven by improved profitability in the business and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the WoodMac acquisition.
Capital expenditures were $166 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $19 million over the same period in 2014. Capital expenditures were 8% of revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015. We continue to manage the capital intensity of the business and expect it to continue to move lower, as it has over the past several years. As you think about your models for 2016, we expect CapEx of about $175 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $140 million and amortization of intangibles of about $121 million. Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $130 million. We expect the tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 33%. For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will use 28% to reflect the tax rate applicable to our intangible assets. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases.
As a reminder, first quarter of 2015 still had health care pass-through revenue included in the reported results. You will recall that, after adjusting for the pass-through revenue of about $6.7 million, first quarter 2015 would have been $68.4 million. Also in the first quarter of 2015, we had about $11 million of project revenue at Argus, which had higher-than-average margins. Overall, we're pleased with the results for 2015 and excited about the plan for 2016 and the opportunities ahead. We expect to see growth from multiple verticals, and we're managing the business to generate long-term shareholder returns.
With that, I'll turn it back to Eva for a comment before Q&A."

As they use more solutions, that will give us some upside. I think, the combination of some of the work that we're doing to make the business, I'll call it, a little more industrial strength around IT; and also to invest in the sales pipeline, that gives us an extension to more people to sell to. We've been investing from a sales perspective and more. And we've also from a technology perspective so we can, for the most part, take some of the solutions in maybe smaller swaths; and maybe more a confined view, a little bit more downstream in the sense of smaller customers.

So yes, of course, we've referenced things that are going on like that transaction, but in reality, I think that our situation is relatively custom. To the point about data, the basic point I would make to you is that obviously data is very important in the data analytic kind of work that we do and others do and everyone -- all of the third-party vendors do, but the distinction that we're trying to draw is, when you look at the vast majority of the data that we've got inside of the insurance vertical; the financial services, retail banking vertical; and the oil and gas, metals and mining vertical, a lot of what we've got is very, very unique. The nature of regulation and industry structure in the health care world in the United States makes it relatively harder to have distinct data assets. That's the point that we've been trying to stress. So it's not that we don't have data. We actually have a lot of data, but we very much want Verisk to be a highly distinctive, very differentiated partner to our customers. And one of the things that provides distinction is unique data assets, and they're just harder to achieve in the health care space."

And then with respect to the rest of our customer base where we still do reference premiums from 2 years before, just want to remind you that there are 3 terms in the pricing algorithm, and premium is only 1 of the 3. And we have complete freedom with respect to the other 2, which is the mill rate and the flat fees. And so the actual literal effect of what's going on in the premium environment is actually very muted at this point. And it's really value-based pricing. It's the work that we do every year to try to enhance and bring current what it is that we're providing to our customers. Our customers understand the value of that kind of work, and it's really on that basis that we set the prices."

Good morning, all. In the first quarter, we delivered strong overall results with total revenue growth of 28%, EBITDA growth of 24% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 19%.
Organic revenue growth was 5% and was 7% excluding the first quarter 2015 nonrecurring project revenue and a onetime true up of partner revenue this year in the Decision Analytics insurance segment. Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins of 50%. We continue to be encouraged about the performance of our businesses, and our key verticals of interest, financial services and energy. This quarter is a good start to the year and we will look to build on these results.
On April 25, 2016, as you know, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell the health care business to Veritas Capital for $820 million. We expect the sales to close by the end of the second quarter. The returns we generated on the business reflect value creation for our shareholders with a pretax IRR of about 12% through our ownership period which began in 2004. One of our most important responsibilities is the careful stewardship of our shareholders capital. We continually assess our assets and our productivity as well as opportunities to deploy new capital, in line with our strategic priority.
Consistent with our capital allocation approach, we identified and evaluated a range of alternatives. We determined that we have better uses for the capital invested in the business and for any future capital, which would have been required to make the operation more Verisk-like. Additionally, we believe that management time should be directed to areas where we have the most impact in driving shareholder returns. This transaction will allow us to focus on data analytic businesses in our key verticals, which are most closely aligned with our strategy, our distinctive and global ambition and where we believe we can add the most value.
The majority of the proceeds will be allocated towards future acquisitions and repurchases, consistent with our long-term approach with a -- view in the past. We remain committed to our 2.5x steady state leverage, pro forma for the sale of the health care business and related proceeds at March 31, we would have been at that level.
I'm glad to have found strong ownership for our health care business and very much wish the team continued success. We go forward from here better aligned with the key distinctives which marked excellence vertical data analytics business. We have higher margins, more stable revenue growth, less seasonality, a higher mix of subscription revenue and stronger free cash flow conversion post this transaction. Overall, we look even more like the Verisk business value that we own value. 
During the quarter, return capital to shareholders through the repurchase of $116 million of our stock. At March 31, 2016, we have $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we remain active looking for our strategic and financially sound tuck-in acquisitions. As you may have seen, we recently acquired Risk Intelligence Ireland, a leading provider of broad protection compliance, risk control and process automation services to the Irish insurance industry, which becomes part of our ISO solutions business. This acquisition advances our efforts to expand our insurance business beyond the United States.
We remain constructive on the outlook and expect acceleration in our combined insurance businesses and double-digit growth at Argus. WoodMac continues to perform remarkably well in extraordinarily difficult environment -- in an environment which is extraordinarily difficult for our customers. The team is working very hard to achieve growth for the year even as we acknowledge the macro environment continues to be challenging relative to historic norms. 
In recent achievement of note, Verisk was included in the -- of Americas Best Employer of 2016. This follows our inclusion in the Forbes World's Most Innovative Companies List. Verisk is 1 of only 15 companies to appear on both lists. We are working hard to attract and retain the great talent as we continue to make progress fostering a culture of innovation. We apply that innovative thinking and working with our customers to find new solutions to the challenges by leveraging our unique data aspect and method. And I personally am inspired by the efforts of our people, and I think that shows through in the results we've been delivering.
We are well-positioned to execute on our strategies and global ambitions in the future. So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail."

In the first quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing for the future. Revenue grew 28.2%. Organic revenue grew 5%, including recent acquisitions. -- Adjusted for $11 million nonrecurring revenue Argus first quarter of 2015 and $7 million of revenue in insurance this year. Organic revenue growth was 7% in the quarter. EBITDA grew 24% to $248 million. EBITDA margins were 50.4% for the quarter.
Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 46.7% and 4.8% in the first quarter, excluding acquisitions. Adjusting for the nonrecurring financial services project revenue last year and true up insurance revenue this year, organic revenue growth in the segment was 8.5%. Revenue in the quarter was again driven by insurance. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 11.6% in the first quarter. The increase was led by strong growth in claims analytics solutions with good growth and quantification, catastrophe modeling and underwriting solution for the quarter. Even excluding the $7 million of true-up revenue, growth in Decision Analytics insurance was about 9%.
Financial services revenue decreased 19% in the quarter and increased 17.7% after adjusting for last year's nonrecurring project revenue. Solid underlying demand for our core solutions and services offset by prior year project revenue of $11 million, which did not recur in 2016.
Energy and specialized markets revenue grew by over 306%, including the recently acquired Wood Mackenzie, PCI and infield business. Organic revenue declined 3.6% as growth in the environmental health and safety solutions was offset by a decline in weather and climate analytics. WoodMac revenue, in constant currency, excluding PCI in the field increased slightly in the first quarter of 2016 and as reported, declined slightly when -- when including the effect of purchase accounting. We expect pro forma constant currency revenue to be flat in the second quarter, as reported. As we think about the full-year outlook, as reported, we expect to be near flat. Also, as we move through the year, keep in mind the currency will have an impact on our reported results.
Risk assessment revenue grew 5.2%, continuing to demonstrate the value of our long-standing insurance customers. Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.2% reflecting our 2016 invoices, which were effective January 1 and continued contribution from numerous solutions such as models and electric rating content. Property-specific rating underwriting information revenue increased 4.9% in the quarter. This increase was driven by higher volumes in our commercial underwriting business.
EBITDA increased 24% in the quarter to $248 million resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.4%. Decision Analytics EBITDA increased 40% to $139 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions and profitable growth in the business.
The EBITDA and risk assessment increased 8.3% to $109 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management. Reported interest expense was $32 million in the quarter. Total debt was $3 billion at March 31, 2016. Our leverage at the end of first quarter was about 2.6x.
After the sale of the health care business, we expect to be at the 2.5x leverage target ahead of plan. Our reported effective tax rate was 31.7% for the quarter. Adjusted net income increased 26.1% to $127 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.75 for the quarter, an increase of 19%. Discontinued operations includes about $0.03 related to health care operation and a negative $0.11 for tax liability as a result of classifying health care business as discontinued ops. As a result, we reported discontinued operation adjusted EPS of a negative $0.08.
The average diluted share count was 171.5 million shares in the quarter. At March 31, 2016, our diluted share count was 170.9 million shares. For shares purchased in the quarter, the average price paid was $69.97. [ph] At March 31, 2016, the company had about 353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. Free cash flow increased 20% to $256 million for the first 3 months ended March 31, 2016, including WoodMac. This represented 103.2% of EBITDA as our first quarters typically our strong cash flow generation due to invoicing pattern. These numbers are also continuing operations.
Growth and free cash flow was driven by improved possibility of our business and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest rates and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Capital expenditures increased 22.7% to $25 million for the 3-month period ended March 31, 2016, driven in part by the addition of WoodMac. OpEx was 5.1% of revenue. We now expect our CapEx to be about $150 million to $155 million, pro forma for the divestiture of the health care business. We continue to manage our capital intensity.
We are pleased with the announced agreement to sell the health care business and the opportunity to focus on our core competencies and our distinctives. The sales price of $820 million consists of $720 million of cash and $100 million subordinated promissory note and other contingent considerations. As you saw on our 10-Q, the note had an 8-year maturity and a 9% pick interest rate. It continued consideration, which is unrelated to the note, tied to the future value of the health care business and provides upside to our sales price under certain conditions. We expect the deal to close by the end of the second quarter. We anticipate the after-tax proceeds of approximately $675 million, of which about $600 million will be received the closing and the remainder on repayment of promissory note. The tax amounts will be determined after we've all adjusted for the working capital fund estimated after-tax basis in the IR generated exceeds our cost of capital.
Of the cash proceeds, we expect that the majority we allocate to our long-standing capital allocation authorities. In the near term, we intend to use the proceeds to repay our revolver drawings, but we'll then use that increased revolver capacity for our long-term capital allocation finance. While we manage the transition, some of the corporate costs for health care business will remain with Verisk. I'd like to thank all of our Verisk and Verisk teams for the hard work that is going through this transaction.
We are excited for the future of Verisk, and we wish our colleagues at Verisk Health the very best as they move forward. As you think about your models for 2016, on a continuing operations basis, we encourage you to review table 8 and last night's press release, which contains selected financial metrics for 2015 on a continued operation basis by quarter. We expect that based upon current FX rates there is about a $10 million impact full year relative -- revenue relative to where rates were at that the start of the year. As FX is the component that has become more relevant to Verisk, we look to provide more insight going forward. For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx of about $150 million to $155 million, fixed asset depreciation amortization of $132 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. Based upon our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $123 million. We estimate the tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 33%. The health care divestiture may help that tax rate a bit, but by less than 50 basis points based upon the information we now have.
For the intangible amortization add back in the adjusted net income calculation, we use 26% to reflect tax rates to our intangible assets. And finally, we expect diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases. Overall, we are pleased with our plan for 2016, excited about the financial profile of the company. We are executing on our operational plan, and we are well-positioned for profitable growth in the future. With that, I'll turn it back to evaluate for a comment before Q&A."

What we also do is we give our equity warrant, so what will happen is this year's equity warrants will come in, the equity warrants from 4 years ago will kind of move out as they are adopted, so those 2 things will affect the rest of the year. The other thing we always just like to remind, we continue to make progress but we did the most part have this talent realignment in staff that we are continuing to hire and that will ramp up as we progressed through the year. We did some hiring in first quarter but probably still at the behind what we expect for those are the couple points that I will call out. The other thing that to your earlier question, remember, we have business scalable. It kind of comes to how much investment we want to do, and we talk about the opportunity to take advantage of that operating leverage.

So it's really -- it's not any 1 thing.

I had a -- I had the opportunity, the latter half of last year to visit many of our WoodMac offices around the world. And it really caught my attention when I was in Beijing. So in Beijing, we have about 30 to 40 WoodMac people. And at the moment, we have 4 or 5 people for our AIR unit, which is our catastrophe modeling unit in the insurance business. We brought them all together in order to just talk about the company and just your typical Tallent Hall meeting and to talk about the future. You would have thought that these were long-lost relatives who just found 1 another after decades. There's the pleasure of being able to pull together in a single market, share ideas and share just even infrastructure, so all those folks previously had not been co-located. Now they're collocated. In an intellectual property business like ours, it's just absolutely golden when you can get people ideating with 1 another and we remain very interested in the intersection of energy and insurance. And it is something that increasingly is going to be very important for us. And so just had a very basic level, the ability to pull together intelligent people have been sharing what it is they're doing and finding the mutual opportunities, is so big and we've commented many times in these calls that the right way to think about a global Verisk is as a multi-domestic Verisk. In other words, in many other markets we serve, and I'll use insurance as an example, a Chinese primary carrier is not really all that interested in what happened in the United States last quarter in terms of premiums and indemnity losses. There just -- they just aren't. It's just not that relevant for them. So we have to be more Chinese in China. But the fact that we're legitimate in China actually means quite a bit. And it's just very supportive and also as we try to source new talent, the fact that we're a reputable, credible prayer in all of these markets is a very major factor, and we're experiencing that right now as we try to add new highly talented, local market appropriate associates in a number of places around the globe. So it's -- maybe it's a little bit difficult to spot from a distance. It's a very powerful effect, actually, inside the company. Mark, I think you wanted to..."

In the first quarter, we delivered strong overall results with total revenue growth of 28%, EBITDA growth of 24% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 19%.Organic revenue growth was 5% and was 7% excluding the first",761,"Thanks, Eva. Good morning, all. In the first quarter, we delivered strong overall results with total revenue growth of 28%, EBITDA growth of 24% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 19%.
Organic revenue growth was 5% and was 7% excluding the first quarter 2015 nonrecurring project revenue at Argus and a onetime true-up of partner revenue this year in the Decision Analytics insurance segment. Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins of 50%. We continue to be encouraged about the performance of our businesses in our key verticals of insurance, financial services and energy. This quarter is a good start to the year, and we will look to build on these results.
On April 25, 2016, as you know, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell the health care business to Veritas Capital for $820 million. We expect the sale to close by the end of the second quarter. The returns we generated on the business reflect value creation for our shareholders with a pretax IRR of about 12% through our ownership period which began in 2004. One of our most important responsibilities is the careful stewardship of our shareholders' capital. We continually assess our assets and our productivity, as well as opportunities to deploy new capital, in line with our strategic priority.
Consistent with our capital allocation approach, we identified and evaluated a range of alternatives. We determined that we have better uses for the capital invested in the business and for any future capital, which would have been required to make the operations more Verisk-like. Additionally, we believe the management time should be directed to areas where we can have the most impact in driving shareholder returns. This transaction will allow us to focus on data analytic businesses in our key verticals, which are most closely aligned with our strategy, our distinctive and global ambition and where we believe we can add the most value.
The majority of the proceeds will be allocated towards future acquisitions and repurchases, consistent with our long-term approach we discussed with you in the past. We remain committed to our 2.5x steady-state leverage. Pro forma for the sale of the health care business and related proceeds at March 31, we would have been at that level.
I'm glad to have found strong ownership for our health care business and very much wish the team continued success. We go forward from here better aligned with the key distinctives which mark excellent vertical data analytics businesses. We have higher margins, more stable revenue growth, less seasonality, a higher mix of subscription revenue and stronger free cash flow conversion post this transaction. Overall, we look even more like the Verisk business model that we all value. 
During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders through the repurchase of $116 million of our stock. At March 31, 2016, we have $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we remain active looking for strategic and financially sound tuck-in acquisitions. As you may have seen, we recently acquired Risk Intelligence Ireland, a leading provider of fraud detection, compliance, risk control, and process automation services to the Irish insurance industry, which becomes part of our ISO Solutions business. This acquisition advances our efforts to expand our insurance business beyond the United States.
We remain constructive on the outlook and expect acceleration in our combined insurance businesses and double-digit growth at Argus. WoodMac continues to perform remarkably well in extraordinarily difficult environment -- in an environment which is extraordinarily difficult for our customers. The team is working very hard to achieve growth for the year even as we acknowledge the macro environment continues to be challenging relative to historic norms. 
In a recent achievement of note, Verisk was included in the Forbes list of America's Best Employer 2016. This follows our inclusion in the Forbes World's Most Innovative Companies List. Verisk is 1 of only 15 companies to appear on both lists. We are working hard to attract and retain great talent, as we continue to make progress fostering a culture of innovation. We apply that innovative thinking and working with our customers to find new solutions to their challenges by leveraging our unique data assets and methods. And I -- personally, I'm inspired by the efforts of our people, and I think that shows through in the results we've been delivering.
We are well-positioned to execute on our strategies and global ambitions in the future. So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail."
1027055,331614211,972396,"Verisk Analytics, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. In the first quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, while also investing for the future. Revenue grew 28.2%. Organic revenue grew 5%, excluding recent acquisitions.

Revenue grew 28.2%. Organic revenue grew 5%, excluding recent acquisitions. If you adjust for the $11 million nonrecurring project revenue at Argus in the first quarter of 2015 and $7 million of true-up revenue in Decision Analytics insurance of this year, organic revenue growth was 7% in the quarter. EBITDA grew 24% to $248 million. EBITDA margins were 50.4% for the quarter.
Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 46.7% and 4.8% in the first quarter, excluding acquisitions. Adjusting for the nonrecurring financial services project revenue last year and true-up insurance revenue this year, organic revenue growth in the segment was 8.5%. Revenue in the quarter was again driven by insurance. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 11.6% in the first quarter. The increase was led by strong growth in claims analytics solutions with good growth in loss quantification, catastrophe modeling and underwriting solutions in the quarter. Even excluding the $7 million of true-up revenue, growth in Decision Analytics insurance was about 9%.
Financial services revenue decreased 19% in the quarter and increased 17.7% after adjusting for last year's nonrecurring project revenue, with solid underlying demand for our core solutions and services, offset by prior year project revenue of $11 million, which did not recur in 2016.
Energy and specialized markets revenue grew by over 350%, including the recently acquired Wood Mackenzie, PCI and Infield businesses. Organic revenue declined 3.6% as growth in the environmental health and safety solutions was offset by decline in weather and climate analytics. WoodMac revenue, in constant currency, excluding PCI and Infield, increased slightly in the first quarter of 2016, and, as reported, declined slightly when -- when including the effect of purchase accounting. We expect pro forma constant-currency revenue to be flat in the second quarter, as reported. As we think about the full year outlook, as reported, we expect to be near flat. Also, as we move through the year, keep in mind, the currency will have an impact on our reported results.
Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.2%, continuing to demonstrate the value of our longstanding insurance customers. Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.2%, reflecting our 2016 invoices, which were effective January 1, and continued contribution from numerous solutions, such as predictive models and electronic rating content. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 4.9% in the quarter. This increase was driven by higher committed volumes in our commercial underwriting business.
EBITDA increased 24% in the quarter to $248 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.4%. Decision Analytics EBITDA increased 40% to $139 million in the quarter, as a result of acquisitions and profitable growth in the business.
The EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 8.3% to $109 million, as a result of revenue growth and good expense management. Reported interest expense was $32 million in the quarter. Total debt was $3 billion at March 31, 2016. Our leverage at the end of first quarter was about 2.6x.
After the sale of the health care business, we expect to be at the 2.5x leverage target ahead of plan. Our reported effective tax rate was 31.7% for the quarter. Adjusted net income increased 26.1% to $127 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.75 for the quarter, an increase of $0.19 -- 19%. Discontinued operations includes about $0.03 related to health care operations and a negative $0.11 for tax liability as a result of classifying health care business as discontinued ops. As a result, we reported discontinued operations adjusted EPS of a negative $0.08.
The average diluted share count was 171.5 million shares in the quarter. At March 31, 2016, our diluted share count was 170.9 million shares. For shares purchased in the quarter, the average price paid was $69.97. At March 31, 2016, the company had about $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. Free cash flow increased 20% to $256 million for the first 3 months ended March 31, 2016, including WoodMac. This represented 103.2% of EBITDA as our first quarter is typically our strongest for free cash flow generation, due to invoicing patterns. These numbers are all for continuing the operations.
Growth in free cash flow was driven by improved profitability of our business and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest rates and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Capital expenditures increased 22.7% to $25 million for the 3-month period ended March 31, 2016, driven in part by the addition of WoodMac. CapEx was 5.1% of revenue. We now expect CapEx of about $150 million to $155 million, pro forma for the divestiture of the health care business. We continue to manage our capital intensity.
We are pleased with the announced agreement to sell the health care business and the opportunity to focus on our core competencies, and our distinctives. The sales price of $820 million consists of $720 million of cash and $100 million subordinated promissory note and other contingent considerations. As you saw on our 10-Q, the note has an 8-year maturity and a 9% pick interest rate. The [indiscernible] consideration, which is unrelated to the note, is tied to the future value of the health care business and provides upside to our sales price under certain conditions. We expect the deal to close by the end of the second quarter. We anticipate the after-tax proceeds of approximately $675 million, of which about $600 million will be received at closing and the remainder on the repayment of the promissory note. The [indiscernible] amounts will be determined after we've all adjusted for the working capital. On an estimated after-tax basis, the IRR generated exceeds our cost of capital.
Of the cash proceeds, we expect that the majority we allocate to our longstanding capital allocation priorities. In near-term, we intend to use the proceeds to repay our revolver drawings, but we'll then use that increased revolver capacity as opportunities arise for our long-term capital allocation plans. While we manage the transition, some of the corporate costs to support the health care business will remain with Verisk. I'd like to thank all of our Verisk and Verisk help teams for the hard work that is going into this transaction.
We're excited for the future of Verisk, and we wish our colleagues at Verisk Health the very best, as they move forward. As you think about your models for 2016, on a continuing operations basis, we encourage you to review table 8 in last night's press release, which contains selected financial metrics for 2015 on a continuing operation basis by quarter. We expect that based upon current FX rates. There is about a $10 million impact to full year relative -- revenue relative to where rates were at that the start of the year. As FX is the component that has become more relevant to Verisk, we look to provide more insight going forward. For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx of about $150 million to $155 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $132 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. Based upon our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $123 million. We estimate the tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 33%. The health care divestiture may help that tax rate a bit, but by less than 50 basis points based upon the information we now have.
For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we'll use 26% to reflect the tax rate applicable [ph] to our intangible assets. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases. Overall, we are pleased with our plan for 2016, excited about the [indiscernible] financial profile of the company. We are executing on our operational plans, and we are well-positioned for profitable growth in the future. With that, I'll turn it back to Eva for a comment before Q&A."

Second quarter, we do have our salary increases, a majority of -- a super majority of both married and promotional increases come in effective April 1, so that typically help -- hurts us from a margin perspective as you progress through the year. What we also do is we give out our equity warrant. So what will happen is, this year's equity warrants will come in, the equity warrants from 4 years ago will kind of move out, because they are vested. So those 2 things will affect the rest of the year. The other thing we always like to just remind, we continue to make progress, but we did the most part to have just talent realignment in Risk Assessment. So there is some staff that we are continuing to hire and that will ramp up as we progress through the year. We did some hiring in first quarter, but probably still little bit behind of what was we expect. So those are the couple points that I will call out. The other thing that -- I think to your earlier question, remember, what we have is a business that's is wonderfully scalable. It kind of comes to how much investment we want to do, and we -- when we talk about the opportunity to take advantage of that operating leverage. I don't think we see a lot of incremental investment relative to revenue, so I think we have -- over the long term, an opportunity to continue to work on margins and move those in a positive direction."

It's actually very broadly based, new products that bring, for example, more analytic acuity to trying to figure out, within the claims flows, which one -- which claim should really get the most attention because they represent the greatest dollar recovery opportunity for the customers, and that's just one example. But the general story is think of it as embroidering on top of the platforms that we've already got. And then, Mark, maybe you want to take the question about the true-up."

So for example, the on balance -- and also you have to concede that language issues are here a little bit also. U.K. is a little bit better for us than, say, Germany. So we can sort of pick our spots that way. Japan is a highly developed economy, that also doesn't have an overly concentrated insurance market, so that would be another. So that's kind of your first sort. But the other part of it is, we are interested in emerging situations as well. And to that I would call out there, you have to consider China still to be an emerging situation, so that's one that we look at. But it's also interesting that when you look at the some of Southeast Asia, turns out that Singapore is becoming something of a hub.

And then we just look into the data in terms of, for example, the number of users of our portal offering and the rate at which they're making use of our content, all of which are going up really pretty strongly. But it's also the case that even now, kind of well into the nosedive in the pricing of the commodity, there are still reactions in terms of our customers trying to get their own cost structures right. And so -- and in the same way that there was a little bit of a lagging effect in terms of the commodity price coming down and then the reaction of the energy companies. You have to expect that there'll be some of that also on the way back up. So there will be some timing effects inside of all. I would not expect instantaneous reaction of the -- of our customers to what the price of the commodity is doing because the price of the commodity has to work its way into, not only their forward plans, but also the way that they're actually spending their own CapEx dollars, and they're just will be -- there will be time dependencies inside of that."

The share of the identified capons that our team analyzed was very high and as -- I think everybody knows, we almost always have the vast majority of that market anyway.

In the first quarter, we delivered strong overall results with total revenue growth of 28%, EBITDA growth of 24% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 19%.Organic revenue growth was 5% and was 7% excluding the first",760,"Thanks, Eva. Good morning, all. In the first quarter, we delivered strong overall results with total revenue growth of 28%, EBITDA growth of 24% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 19%.
Organic revenue growth was 5% and was 7% excluding the first quarter 2015 nonrecurring project revenue at Argus and a onetime true-up of partner revenue this year in the Decision Analytics insurance segment. Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins of 50%. We continue to be encouraged about the performance of our businesses in our key verticals of insurance, financial services and energy. This quarter was a good start to the year and we will look to build on these results.
On April 25, 2016, as you know, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell the health care business to Veritas Capital for $820 million. We expect the sale to close by the end of the second quarter. The returns we generated on the business reflect value creation for our shareholders with a pretax IRR of about 12% through our ownership period which began in 2004. One of our most important responsibilities is the careful stewardship of our shareholders' capital. We continually assess our assets and our productivity, as well as opportunities to deploy new capital, in line with our strategic priorities.
Consistent with our capital allocation approach, we identified and evaluated a range of alternatives. We determined that we have better uses for the capital invested in the business and for any future capital which would have been required to make the operations more Verisk-like. Additionally, we believe that management time should be directed to areas where we can have the most impact in driving shareholder returns. This transaction will allow us to focus on data analytics businesses in our key verticals which are most closely aligned with our strategy, are distinctive and global ambition and where we believe we can add the most value.
The majority of the proceeds will be allocated towards future acquisitions and repurchases, consistent with our long-term approach we've discussed with you in the past. We remain committed to our 2.5x steady-state leverage. Pro forma for the sale of the health care business and related proceeds at March 31, we would have been at that level.
I'm glad to have found strong ownership for our health care business and very much wish the team continued success. We go forward from here better aligned with the key distinctives which mark excellent vertical data analytics businesses. We have higher margins, more stable revenue growth, less seasonality, a higher mix of subscription revenue and stronger free cash flow conversion post this transaction. Overall, we look even more like the Verisk business model that we all value. 
During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders through the repurchase of $116 million of our stock. At March 31, 2016, we had $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we remain active looking for strategic and financially sound tuck-in acquisitions. As you may have seen, we recently acquired Risk Intelligence Ireland, a leading provider of fraud detection, compliance, risk control, and process automation services to the Irish insurance industry, which becomes part of our ISO Solutions business. This acquisition advances our efforts to expand our insurance business beyond the United States.
We remain constructive on the outlook and expect acceleration in our combined insurance businesses and double-digit growth at Argus. WoodMac continues to perform remarkably well in extraordinarily difficult environment -- in an environment which is extraordinarily difficult for our customers. The team is working very hard to achieve growth for the year even as we acknowledge the macro environment continues to be challenging relative to historic norms. 
In a recent achievement of note, Verisk was included in the Forbes list of America's Best Employers 2016. This follows our inclusion in the Forbes World's Most Innovative Companies List. Verisk is 1 of only 15 companies to appear on both lists. We are working hard to attract and retain great talent, as we continue to make progress fostering a culture of innovation. We apply that innovative thinking and working with our customers to find new solutions to their challenges by leveraging our unique data assets and methods. And I, personally, am inspired by the efforts of our people, and I think that shows through in the results we've been delivering.
We are well-positioned to execute on our strategies and global ambitions in the future. So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail."
1027055,331614211,972655,"Verisk Analytics, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott.

Revenue grew 28.2%. Organic revenue grew 5%, excluding recent acquisitions. If you adjust for the $11 million nonrecurring project revenue at Argus in the first quarter of 2015 and several million of true-up revenue in Decision Analytics insurance this year, organic revenue growth was 7% in the quarter. EBITDA grew 24% to $248 million. EBITDA margins were 50.4% for the quarter.
Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 46.7% and 4.8% in the first quarter, excluding acquisitions. Adjusting for the nonrecurring financial services project revenue last year and true-up insurance revenue this year, organic revenue growth in the segment was 8.5%. Revenue in the quarter was again driven by insurance. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 11.6% in the first quarter. The increase was led by strong growth in claims analytics solutions with good growth in loss quantification, catastrophe modeling and underwriting solutions in the quarter. Even excluding the several million of true-up revenue, growth in Decision Analytics insurance was about 9%.
Financial services revenue decreased 19% in the quarter and increased 17.7% after adjusting for last year's nonrecurring project revenue, with solid underlying demand for our core solutions and services, offset by prior year project revenue of $11 million, which did not recur in 2016.
Energy and specialized markets revenue grew by over 350%, including the recently acquired Wood Mackenzie, PCI and Infield businesses. Organic revenue declined 3.6% as growth in the environmental health and safety solutions was offset by a decline in weather and climate analytics. WoodMac revenue, in constant currency, excluding PCI and Infield, increased slightly in the first quarter of 2016, and, as reported, declined slightly when -- when including the effect of purchase accounting. We expect pro forma constant-currency revenue to be flat in the second quarter, as reported. As we think about the full year outlook, as reported, we expect to be near flat. Also, as we move through the year, keep in mind, that currency will have an impact on our reported results.
Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.2%, continuing to demonstrate the value of our longstanding insurance customers. Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.2%, reflecting our 2016 invoices, which were effective January 1, and continued contribution from newer solutions, such as predictive models and electronic rating content. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 4.9% in the quarter. This increase was driven by higher committed volumes in our commercial underwriting business.
EBITDA increased 24% in the quarter to $248 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.4%. Decision Analytics EBITDA increased 40% to $139 million in the quarter, as a result of acquisitions and profitable growth in the business.
The EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 8.3% to $109 million, as a result of revenue growth and good expense management. Reported interest expense was $32 million in the quarter. Total debt was $3 billion at March 31, 2016. Our leverage at the end of first quarter was about 2.6x.
After the sale of the health care business, we expect to be at the 2.5x leverage target ahead of plan. Our reported effective tax rate was 31.7% for the quarter. Adjusted net income increased 26.1% to $127 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.75 for the quarter, an increase of $0.19 -- 19%. Discontinued operations includes about $0.03 related to health care operations and a negative $0.11 for tax liability as a result of classifying health care business as discontinued ops. As a result, we reported discontinued operations adjusted EPS of a negative $0.08.
The average diluted share count was 171.5 million shares in the quarter. At March 31, 2016, our diluted share count was 170.9 million shares. For shares purchased in the quarter, the average price paid was $69.97. At March 31, 2016, the company had about $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. Free cash flow increased 20% to $256 million for the first 3 months ended March 31, 2016, including WoodMac. This represented 103.2% of EBITDA as our first quarter is typically our strongest for free cash flow generation, due to invoicing patterns. These numbers are all for continuing operations.
Growth in free cash flow was driven by improved profitability of our business and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest rates and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Capital expenditures increased 22.7% to $25 million for the 3-month period ended March 31, 2016, driven in part by the addition of WoodMac. CapEx was 5.1% of revenue. We now expect CapEx of about $150 million to $155 million, pro forma for the divestiture of the health care business. We continue to manage our capital intensity.
We are pleased with the announced agreement to sell the health care business and the opportunity to focus on our core competencies and our distinctives. The sales price of $820 million consists of $720 million of cash and $100 million subordinated promissory note and other contingent considerations. As you saw on our 10-Q, the note has an 8-year maturity and a 9% pick interest rate. The contingency consideration, which is unrelated to the note, is tied to the future value of the health care business and provides upside to our sales price under certain conditions. We expect the deal to close by the end of the second quarter. We anticipate the after-tax proceeds to be approximately $675 million, of which about $600 million will be received at closing and the remainder on the repayment of the promissory note. The precise tax amounts will be determined after we've all adjusted for the working capital. On an estimated after-tax basis, the IRR generated exceeds our cost of capital.
Of the cash proceeds, we expect that the majority will be allocated to our longstanding capital allocation priorities. In near-term, we intend to use the proceeds to repay our revolver drawings, but we'll then use that increased revolver capacity as opportunities arise for our long-term capital allocation plans. While we manage the transition, some of the corporate costs to support the health care business will remain with Verisk. I'd like to thank all of our Verisk and Verisk Health teams for the hard work that has gone into this transaction.
We are excited for the future of Verisk, and we wish our colleagues at Verisk Health the very best as they move forward. As you think about your models for 2016, on a continuing operations basis, we encourage you to review table 8 in last night's press release, which contains selected financial metrics for 2015 on a continuing operation basis by quarter. We expect that based upon current FX rates. There is about a $10 million impact to full year relative -- revenue relative to where rates were at that the start of the year. As FX is the component that has become more relevant to Verisk, we will look to provide more insight going forward. For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx of about $150 million to $155 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $132 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. Based upon our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $123 million. We estimate the tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 33%. The health care divestiture may help that tax rate a bit, but by less than 50 basis points based upon the information we now have.
For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will use 26% to reflect the tax rate applicable [ph] to our intangible assets. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases. Overall, we are pleased with our plan for 2016, excited about the go-forward financial profile of the company. We are executing on our operational plans and we are well-positioned for profitable growth in the future. With that, I'll turn it back to Eva for a comment before Q&A."

Second quarter, we do have our salary increases, a majority of -- a super majority of both merit and promotional increases come in effective April 1, so that typically help -- hurts us from a margin perspective as you progress through the year. What we also do is we give out our equity awards. So what will happen is, this year's equity awards will come in, the equity awards from 4 years ago will kind of move out, because they are vested. So those 2 things will affect the rest of the year. The other thing we always like to just remind, we continue to make progress, but we did, for the most part, have had this talent realignment and risk assessment. So there is some staff that we are continuing to hire and that will ramp up as we progress through the year. We did some hiring in first quarter, but probably still a little bit behind the levels we expect. So those are the couple points that I will call out. The other thing that -- I think to your earlier question, remember, what we have is a business that's wonderfully scalable. It kind of comes to how much investment we want them to do and we -- and we need to kind of talk about the opportunity to take advantage of that operating leverage.

But what we've been doing is working to enhance the value, in many cases, by sort of building around the platform, adding features which help the customers get more value out of what we're doing, and that's true not only on the claims side but that's also true on the underwriting side as well. So it's really -- it's not any one thing. It's actually very broadly based, new products that bring, for example, more analytic acuity to trying to figure out, within the claims flows, which one -- which claims should really get the most attention because they represent the greatest dollar recovery opportunity for the customers, and that's just one example.

Customer retention is very high, the new product pipeline is robust, the utilization of our portal offerings is growing strongly, and we're also opening up new channels of distribution for our proprietary content. The challenge of the moment is the extreme pressure on our customers, who are almost 2 years into this down cycle and they're still laying off some of their associates. And so they are seeking, even at this time, cost savings anywhere they can find them. But our view is, because our customers are leaning out their staffs, when the market returns to more normal conditions, demand for WoodMac tools and solutions will escalate strongly, and that's why we are staying the course, and we're remaining invested in the present and the future at WoodMac. Having said all of that, the one thing that we will never do is make pinpoint predictions of the commodity. We certainly expect more normalized conditions into the future, and we'll see when those occur, and we're hopeful about that because it'll be good for our customers.

And it is something that increasingly is going to be very important for us. And so just at a very basic level, the ability to pull together intelligent people, have them sharing what it is they're doing and finding the mutual opportunities, is so big, and we've commented many times in these calls that the right way to think about a global Verisk is as a multi-domestic Verisk. In other words, in many of the markets we serve, and I'll use insurance as an example, a Chinese primary carrier is not really all that interested in what happened in the United States last quarter in terms of premiums and indemnity losses, they're just -- they just aren't. It's not that relevant for them. So we have to be more Chinese in China. But the fact that we're already legitimate in China, actually, means quite a bit. And it's just very supportive and also as we try to source new talent, the fact that we're a reputable, credible player in all of these markets is a very major factor, and we're experiencing that right now, as we try to add new highly talented, local market appropriate associates in a number of places around the globe.

So we can sort of pick our spots that way. Japan is a highly developed economy that also doesn't have an overly concentrated insurance market, so that would be another. So that's kind of your first sort. But the other part of it is, we are interested in emerging situations as well.

Conversations with customers are overall very encouraging. I had the chance, I don't know, 1 month, 1.5 months ago, to sit with the Deputy CEO of one of the world's largest energy companies. And the stories they tell about how they make use of WoodMac content, and their focus upon WoodMac as a partner, these are very, very encouraging kinds of stories. And then we just look into the data in terms of, for example, the number of users of our portal offering and the rate at which they're making use of our content, all of which are going up really pretty strongly. But it's also the case that even now, kind of well into the nosedive in the pricing of the commodity, there are still reactions in terms of our customers trying to get their own cost structures right. And so -- and in the same way that there was a little bit of a lagging effect in terms of the commodity price coming down and then the reaction of the energy companies. You have to expect that there will be some of that also on the way back up. So there will be some timing effects inside of all. I would not expect instantaneous reaction of the -- of our customers to what the price of the commodity is doing because the price of the commodity has to work its way into, not only their forward plans but also the way that they're actually spending their own CapEx dollars, and there just will be -- there will be time dependencies inside of that."

It's interesting to look at it because you can sort of carve it out and identify it. You're right, it was a good moment for cat bonds and our AIR business did very well. The share of the identified cat bonds that our team analyzed was very high and as -- I think everybody knows, we almost always have the vast majority of that market anyway. So, yes, it was helpful, but there's movement also in the cat bond world, don't miss that. There's the move towards the so-called mini-cat bonds and there are different ways that you can actually analyze cat bonds. So it's kind of -- it's a dynamic environment. I'll put it that way.

In the first quarter, we delivered strong overall results with total revenue growth of 28%, EBITDA growth of 24% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 19%.Organic revenue growth was 5% and was 7% excluding the first",760,"Thanks, Eva. Good morning, all. In the first quarter, we delivered strong overall results with total revenue growth of 28%, EBITDA growth of 24% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 19%.
Organic revenue growth was 5% and was 7% excluding the first quarter 2015 nonrecurring project revenue at Argus and a onetime true-up of partner revenue this year in the Decision Analytics insurance segment. Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins of 50%. We continue to be encouraged about the performance of our businesses in our key verticals of insurance, financial services and energy. This quarter was a good start to the year and we will look to build on these results.
On April 25, 2016, as you know, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell the health care business to Veritas Capital for $820 million. We expect the sale to close by the end of the second quarter. The returns we generated on the business reflect value creation for our shareholders with a pretax IRR of about 12% through our ownership period which began in 2004. One of our most important responsibilities is the careful stewardship of our shareholders' capital. We continually assess our assets and our productivity, as well as opportunities to deploy new capital, in line with our strategic priorities.
Consistent with our capital allocation approach, we identified and evaluated a range of alternatives. We determined that we have better uses for the capital invested in the business and for any future capital which would have been required to make the operations more Verisk-like. Additionally, we believe that management time should be directed to areas where we can have the most impact in driving shareholder returns. This transaction will allow us to focus on data analytics businesses in our key verticals which are most closely aligned with our strategy, our distinctive and global ambition and where we believe we can add the most value.
The majority of the proceeds will be allocated towards future acquisitions and repurchases, consistent with our long-term approach we've discussed with you in the past. We remain committed to our 2.5x steady-state leverage. Pro forma for the sale of the health care business and related proceeds at March 31, we would have been at that level.
I'm glad to have found strong ownership for our health care business and very much wish the team continued success. We go forward from here better aligned with the key distinctives which mark excellent vertical data analytics businesses. We have higher margins, more stable revenue growth, less seasonality, a higher mix of subscription revenue and stronger free cash flow conversion post this transaction. Overall, we look even more like the Verisk business model that we all value. 
During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders through the repurchase of $116 million of our stock. At March 31, 2016, we had $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we remain active looking for strategic and financially sound tuck-in acquisitions. As you may have seen, we recently acquired Risk Intelligence Ireland, a leading provider of fraud detection, compliance, risk control, and process automation services to the Irish insurance industry, which becomes part of our ISO Solutions business. This acquisition advances our efforts to expand our insurance business beyond the United States.
We remain constructive on the outlook and expect acceleration in our combined insurance businesses and double-digit growth at Argus. WoodMac continues to perform remarkably well in extraordinarily difficult environment -- in an environment which is extraordinarily difficult for our customers. The team is working very hard to achieve growth for the year even as we acknowledge the macro environment continues to be challenging relative to historic norms. 
In a recent achievement of note, Verisk was included in the Forbes list of America's Best Employers 2016. This follows our inclusion in the Forbes World's Most Innovative Companies List. Verisk is 1 of only 15 companies to appear on both lists. We are working hard to attract and retain great talent, as we continue to make progress fostering a culture of innovation. We apply that innovative thinking and working with our customers to find new solutions to their challenges by leveraging our unique data assets and methods. And I, personally, am inspired by the efforts of our people, and I think that shows through in the results we've been delivering.
We are well-positioned to execute on our strategies and global ambitions in the future. So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail."

Revenue grew 28.2%. Organic revenue grew 5%, excluding recent acquisitions. If you adjust for the $11 million nonrecurring project revenue at Argus in the first quarter of 2015 and several million of true-up revenue in Decision Analytics insurance this year, organic revenue growth was 7% in the quarter. EBITDA grew 24% to $248 million. EBITDA margins were 50.4% for the quarter.
Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 46.7% and 4.8% in the first quarter, excluding acquisitions. Adjusting for the nonrecurring financial services project revenue last year and true-up insurance revenue this year, organic revenue growth in the segment was 8.5%. Revenue in the quarter was again driven by insurance. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 11.6% in the first quarter. The increase was led by strong growth in claims analytics solutions with good growth in loss quantification, catastrophe modeling and underwriting solutions in the quarter. Even excluding the several million of true-up revenue, growth in Decision Analytics insurance was about 9%.
Financial services revenue decreased 19% in the quarter and increased 17.7% after adjusting for last year's nonrecurring project revenue, with solid underlying demand for our core solutions and services, offset by prior year project revenue of $11 million, which did not recur in 2016.
Energy and specialized markets revenue grew by over 350%, including the recently acquired Wood Mackenzie, PCI and Infield businesses. Organic revenue declined 3.6% as growth in the environmental health and safety solutions was offset by a decline in weather and climate analytics. WoodMac revenue, in constant currency, excluding PCI and Infield, increased slightly in the first quarter of 2016, and, as reported, declined slightly when -- when including the effect of purchase accounting. We expect pro forma constant-currency revenue to be flat in the second quarter, as reported. As we think about the full year outlook, as reported, we expect to be near flat. Also, as we move through the year, keep in mind, that currency will have an impact on our reported results.
Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.2%, continuing to demonstrate the value of our longstanding insurance customers. Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.2%, reflecting our 2016 invoices, which were effective January 1, and continued contribution from newer solutions, such as predictive models and electronic rating content. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 4.9% in the quarter. This increase was driven by higher committed volumes in our commercial underwriting business.
EBITDA increased 24% in the quarter to $248 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.4%. Decision Analytics EBITDA increased 40% to $139 million in the quarter, as a result of acquisitions and profitable growth in the business.
The EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 8.3% to $109 million, as a result of revenue growth and good expense management. Reported interest expense was $32 million in the quarter. Total debt was $3 billion at March 31, 2016. Our leverage at the end of first quarter was about 2.6x.
After the sale of the health care business, we expect to be at the 2.5x leverage target ahead of plan. Our reported effective tax rate was 31.7% for the quarter. Adjusted net income increased 26.1% to $127 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.75 for the quarter, an increase of $0.19 -- 19%. Discontinued operations includes about $0.03 related to health care operations and a negative $0.11 for tax liability as a result of classifying health care business as discontinued ops. As a result, we reported discontinued operations adjusted EPS of a negative $0.08.
The average diluted share count was 171.5 million shares in the quarter. At March 31, 2016, our diluted share count was 170.9 million shares. For shares purchased in the quarter, the average price paid was $69.97. At March 31, 2016, the company had about $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. Free cash flow increased 20% to $256 million for the first 3 months ended March 31, 2016, including WoodMac. This represented 103.2% of EBITDA as our first quarter is typically our strongest for free cash flow generation, due to invoicing patterns. These numbers are all for continuing operations.
Growth in free cash flow was driven by improved profitability of our business and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest rates and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Capital expenditures increased 22.7% to $25 million for the 3-month period ended March 31, 2016, driven in part by the addition of WoodMac. CapEx was 5.1% of revenue. We now expect CapEx of about $150 million to $155 million, pro forma for the divestiture of the health care business. We continue to manage our capital intensity.
We are pleased with the announced agreement to sell the health care business and the opportunity to focus on our core competencies and our distinctives. The sales price of $820 million consists of $720 million of cash and $100 million subordinated promissory note and other contingent considerations. As you saw on our 10-Q, the note has an 8-year maturity and a 9% pick interest rate. The contingency consideration, which is unrelated to the note, is tied to the future value of the health care business and provides upside to our sales price under certain conditions. We expect the deal to close by the end of the second quarter. We anticipate the after-tax proceeds to be approximately $675 million, of which about $600 million will be received at closing and the remainder on the repayment of the promissory note. The precise tax amounts will be determined after we've all adjusted for the working capital. On an estimated after-tax basis, the IRR generated exceeds our cost of capital.
Of the cash proceeds, we expect that the majority will be allocated to our longstanding capital allocation priorities. In near-term, we intend to use the proceeds to repay our revolver drawings, but we'll then use that increased revolver capacity as opportunities arise for our long-term capital allocation plans. While we manage the transition, some of the corporate costs to support the health care business will remain with Verisk. I'd like to thank all of our Verisk and Verisk Health teams for the hard work that has gone into this transaction.
We are excited for the future of Verisk, and we wish our colleagues at Verisk Health the very best as they move forward. As you think about your models for 2016, on a continuing operations basis, we encourage you to review table 8 in last night's press release, which contains selected financial metrics for 2015 on a continuing operation basis by quarter. We expect that based upon current FX rates. There is about a $10 million impact to full year relative -- revenue relative to where rates were at that the start of the year. As FX is the component that has become more relevant to Verisk, we will look to provide more insight going forward. For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx of about $150 million to $155 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $132 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. Based upon our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $123 million. We estimate the tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 33%. The health care divestiture may help that tax rate a bit, but by less than 50 basis points based upon the information we now have.
For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will use 26% to reflect the tax rate applicable [ph] to our intangible assets. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases. Overall, we are pleased with our plan for 2016, excited about the go-forward financial profile of the company. We are executing on our operational plans and we are well-positioned for profitable growth in the future. With that, I'll turn it back to Eva for a comment before Q&A."

Second quarter, we do have our salary increases, a majority of -- a super majority of both merit and promotional increases come in effective April 1, so that typically help -- hurts us from a margin perspective as you progress through the year. What we also do is we give out our equity awards. So what will happen is, this year's equity awards will come in, the equity awards from 4 years ago will kind of move out, because they are vested. So those 2 things will affect the rest of the year. The other thing we always like to just remind, we continue to make progress, but we did, for the most part, have had this talent realignment and risk assessment. So there is some staff that we are continuing to hire and that will ramp up as we progress through the year. We did some hiring in first quarter, but probably still a little bit behind the levels we expect. So those are the couple points that I will call out. The other thing that -- I think to your earlier question, remember, what we have is a business that's wonderfully scalable. It kind of comes to how much investment we want them to do and we -- and we need to kind of talk about the opportunity to take advantage of that operating leverage. I don't think we see a lot of incremental investment relative to revenue, so I think we have -- over the long term, an opportunity to continue to work on margins and move those in a positive direction."

There is something going on in claims, which actually is going on across many of the things we do in insurance, and that is, we are -- implicit in your question, we are well-platformed, that is true. But what we've been doing is working to enhance the value, in many cases, by sort of building around the platform, adding features which help the customers get more value out of what we're doing, and that's true not only on the claims side but that's also true on the underwriting side as well. So it's really -- it's not any one thing. It's actually very broadly based, new products that bring, for example, more analytic acuity to trying to figure out, within the claims flows, which one -- which claims should really get the most attention because they represent the greatest dollar recovery opportunity for the customers, and that's just one example. But the general story is think of it as embroidering on top of the platforms that we've already got. And then, Mark, maybe you want to take the question about the true-up."

WoodMac right now, in our view, is laying the foundation for its next round of growth. So what's going on right now? Customer retention is very high, the new product pipeline is robust, the utilization of our portal offerings is growing strongly, and we're also opening up new channels of distribution for our proprietary content. The challenge of the moment is the extreme pressure on our customers, who are almost 2 years into this down cycle and they're still laying off some of their associates. And so they are seeking, even at this time, cost savings anywhere they can find them. But our view is, because our customers are leaning out their staffs, when the market returns to more normal conditions, demand for WoodMac tools and solutions will escalate strongly, and that's why we are staying the course, and we're remaining invested in the present and the future at WoodMac. Having said all of that, the one thing that we will never do is make pinpoint predictions of the commodity. We certainly expect more normalized conditions into the future, and we'll see when those occur, and we're hopeful about that because it'll be good for our customers. But the -- we've said from the beginning and we still maintain that in normalized market conditions, we expect Wood Mackenzie and the pieces that we've added to Wood Mackenzie to grow at or above the rate of organic growth of the rest of Verisk."

So in Beijing, we have about 30 to 40 WoodMac people. And at the moment, we have 4 or 5 people for our AIR unit, which is our catastrophe modeling unit in the insurance business. We brought them all together in order to just talk about the company and just your typical town hall meeting and to talk about the future. You would have thought that these were long-lost relatives who had just found one another after decades. The pleasure of being able to pull together in a single market, share ideas and share -- just even infrastructure, so all those folks previously had not been co-located. Now they're co-located. In an intellectual property business like ours, it's just absolutely golden when you can get people ideating with one another, and we remain very interested in the intersection of energy and insurance. And it is something that increasingly is going to be very important for us. And so just at a very basic level, the ability to pull together intelligent people, have them sharing what it is they're doing and finding the mutual opportunities, is so big, and we've commented many times in these calls that the right way to think about a global Verisk is as a multi-domestic Verisk. In other words, in many of the markets we serve, and I'll use insurance as an example, a Chinese primary carrier is not really all that interested in what happened in the United States last quarter in terms of premiums and indemnity losses, they're just -- they just aren't. It's not that relevant for them. So we have to be more Chinese in China. But the fact that we're already legitimate in China, actually, means quite a bit. And it's just very supportive and also as we try to source new talent, the fact that we're a reputable, credible player in all of these markets is a very major factor, and we're experiencing that right now, as we try to add new highly talented, local market appropriate associates in a number of places around the globe.

So for example, on balance -- and also you have to concede the language issues are here a little bit also. U.K. is a little bit better for us than, say, Germany. So we can sort of pick our spots that way. Japan is a highly developed economy that also doesn't have an overly concentrated insurance market, so that would be another. So that's kind of your first sort. But the other part of it is, we are interested in emerging situations as well. And 2 that I would call out there -- you have to consider China still to be an emerging situation, so that's one that we look at. But it's also interesting that when you look at the sum of Southeast Asia, it turns out that Singapore is becoming something of a hub.

And so -- and in the same way that there was a little bit of a lagging effect in terms of the commodity price coming down and then the reaction of the energy companies.

The share of the identified cat bonds that our team analyzed was very high and as -- I think everybody knows, we almost always have the vast majority of that market anyway. So, yes, it was helpful, but there's movement also in the cat bond world, don't miss that.

In the second quarter, we delivered solid overall results with total revenue growth of about 16%, adjusted EBITDA growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 1.4%, including the impact of the shares we issued last year for the WoodMac transaction. Year-to-date, free cash flow was up 21%. 
Organic revenue growth was 5.4% as we continue to grow faster than our underlying end markets. We've spoken of higher, longer-term organic growth, and the underlying trends remain encouraging. Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins over 49%. 
We're focused on leveraging our Verisk distinct, which are: one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into customer workflows. And our core capabilities to add value for our customers and in turn for our shareholders. We're also seeing traction in these solutions that are being developed and continue to be optimistic about their long-term potential to contribute to customers and, ultimately, our financial performance. 
As we announced in June, I'm excited to have expanded the roles of several members of our senior leadership team. Mark who have been our CFO since we before our 2009 IPO, is now Verisk's Chief Operating Officer, with responsibility for our insurance businesses and our technology and customer experience organizations. Eva Huston is now our Chief Financial Officer, responsible for financial strategy, including accounting, tax, treasury and Investor Relations. I'm also pleased to have appointed [indiscernible] and Steve Holliday as group presidents. Mana leads Argus [indiscernible] and Verisk retail. Steve leads Wood Mackenzie 3E Company and Verisk Maplecroft. 
The strength of our platform and the clarity of our vision, combined with greater scope of response but he for these 4 proven professionals, will support our growth agenda and global push into the near and long term. These are all natural evolutions from their previous roles and will help us continue to deliver value to our customers and employees and shareholders. 
During the quarter, we close the sale of Healthcare business and used the proceeds to pay down our revolver, giving us plenty of capacity to support our long-stated capital allocation strategy for a balanced approach over time to acquisitions and repurchases. We had $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of June 30, 2016. 
We remain active in evaluating possible acquisitions, in particular, as we make buy versus build decisions in pursuit of our international expansion. We also see M&A as a channel for expanding our solution footprint. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, you saw that we purchased Greentech Media, an industry-leading information services provider for next-generation electricity and renewable sectors. Greentech media joins WoodMac, enhancing our research and other capabilities for subsectors, including solar generation, energy storage and smart grids that react dynamically to changes in supply and demand. These are very exciting areas in the energy and power markets and an excellent complement our outstanding oil and gas franchise. 
I remain encouraged by the opportunities we see for growth both near and long term. We're excited about a number of early-stage efforts where we are developing new and innovative solutions for our customers and where we are expanding existing solutions around the world. Near term, we continue to expect acceleration of our combined insurance businesses and double-digit growth at Argus. WoodMac is performing in line with the expectations we discussed with you last quarter.

Across our businesses which serve the property/casualty insurance industry, we've seen several key industry themes, including vertical Big Data, industry automation and digital engagement. With these themes in mind, I'll briefly describe a number of positive recent developments in our businesses. Reflecting on all 3 themes, Verisk insurance solutions launched a new integration option for 360Value, a web-based replacement cost estimator for homeowners insurance. 360Value is built on our unique industry-standard construction materials and labor cost data. This solution helps our customers estimate coverage limits for residential, commercial and agricultural properties. Our customers can now integrate 360Value directly into their online homeowners quoting platforms. This helps the industry deploy more engaging solutions, which include pre-filling an online insurance application with property-specific information when a homeowner enters an address. 
Another recent launch is [indiscernible] a new product development platform, increasing engagement in automation, which helps our clients to easily research, create and distribute coverage language, providing efficiencies and time to market for new products and critical coverage updates. [indiscernible] will help our customers accelerate growth, reduce expense ratios and enhance in compliance.
Leveraging Big Data message, cutting-edge technology in pioneering automation, AIR released a hosted cloud solution for its catastrophe risk management platforms, Touchstone More than a dozen companies are already up and running on the AIR cloud, which enables them to conduct all of their analysis remotely while minimizing capital expenditures. Finally, in addition to the new deployment option, AIR recently expanded its coverage model of Southeast Asia.

In the second quarter, we again delivered revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth going forward. Revenue grew 16.3% and 5.4% organically. EBITDA grew 12.4% to $245 million. EBITDA margins were 49.2% in the quarter. 
Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 23.5% and 5.5% organically. Financial services was the fastest-growing organic revenue end market, while insurance-focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to grow. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 6.2% in the second quarter. The increase was led by strong growth in loss quantification and claims analytics solutions. Underwriting solutions also grew in the quarter. Our catastrophe modeling solutions saw modest decline versus the prior year as a result of lower cat issuance and consulting revenues. Customer retention remains very high, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. 
Financial services revenue returned to strong growth, up to 15.9% in the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the contributions from the media solutions, which grew very well in the quarter. Our international revenue continues to grow nicely here as well, which does mean that FX may influence the reported results throughout the rest of the year. As Scott noted, we remain comfortable with double-digit growth based on accelerating growth in the second half of the year.
Energy and Specialized Markets revenue grew 70.4%, [ph] including WoodMac, which was acquired in May 2015. In this year's second quarter, WoodMac revenue was around flat on a constant currency basis. The decline in the British pound late in q2 will have a larger effect on the reported results starting in Q3 as the average Q2 rate was 1.43 and is currently in the low 130s. Organic revenue, excluding WoodMac, PCI and Infield, declined $2.4 million in the quarter. Services revenue peaked in the prior year as customers met 2015 compliance deadlines. We are also transitioning to a subscription revenue model, which is better for Verisk and better for our customers over the long term. The dollar impact remains small in relation to Verisk as a whole. Finally, as a reminder, WoodMac is organic starting in Q3. 
Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.5% and 5.3% on an organic basis, continuing to demonstrate the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Additionally, contributions of new solutions that are in early stages and the inclusion of Risk Intelligence Ireland, which we have rebranded as Verisk Insurance Solutions Ireland, added growth. Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 6.0%, reflecting our 2015 invoices and continued contribution from newer solution such as predictive models and electronic rating content. Our property-specific rating an underwriting information revenue increased 3.8% in the quarter. Growth was led an by increase in commercial underwriting solutions subscription revenue. 
EBITDA increased 12.4% in the quarter $245 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 49.2%. Decision Analytics EBITDA increased 20.8% to $141 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions and growth in our existing businesses. EBITDA and Risk Assessment increased 2.9% to $105 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management, offset in part by current realignment initiatives we have been discussing with you. This resulted in moderated margins versus Q1 as the hiring stages take effect as well as the impact of our annual merit increases.
We are very excited about the additions we've made to the team, and we look forward to their contributions over time. Reported interest expense was $31 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at June 30, 2016, after a repayment facilitating by cash flow generation and the proceeds from the sale of the Healthcare business. Our leverage at the end of the 2Q was about 2.2x pro forma for the health care divestiture, and we're pleased to have reached our target ahead of plan. We appreciate the support and confidence of our debt holders as we acquire WoodMac with a goal of returning to the 2.5x steady-state leverage. 
Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 33.5%. Adjusted net income in 2Q increased 3.7% to $124 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully-diluted basis was $0.73 in the quarter, an increase of 1.4%. Adjusted EPS increased because of solid operations both organic and acquired and lower interest expense. The increases were partially offset by higher fixed asset depreciation and amortization, only a partial quarter of WoodMac ownership in the prior period and increase in shares outstanding related to the 2015 acquisition of WoodMac. We expect that our adjusted EPS growth will normalize over time to reflect similar trends you see in our underlying business results. 
The average diluted share count was 171.2 million shares in the quarter, and on June 30, 2016, our diluted share count was 171.4 million shares. We do not repurchase any shares in the quarter as we continue to balance our appetite for share repurchase with our desire to maintain flexibility for M&A. At June 30, 2016, we had about $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. 
Free cash flow increased 21.1% and for the second q [ph] to $305 million, including WoodMac. This represented 61.9% of EBITDA. These numbers are all for continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by greater profitability of our businesses and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and, therefore, shareholder value. Capital expenditures increased 4.6% to $80 million [ph] for the 6-month period ended June 30, 2016, due to the inclusion of WoodMac's CapEx for the full quarter. 
CapEx was 5.2% of revenue. We expect CapEx for the full year to be $150 million to $155 million [indiscernible] the Healthcare business. We continue to manage our capital intensity to enable free cash flow growth. 
As you think about your models for 2016 on a continuing operations basis, we expect that based on current FX rate, there's about a $25 million impact full year revenue relative to where rates were at the start of 2016. This is up from our estimate last quarter of a $10 million impact. FX is a new factor as you think about our future growth, and we will look to provide more insight going forward to help you include it in your forecasting.
As you think about Q3, keep in mind that last year EBITDA included a $15.6 million warrant sale gain, which will not recur this year. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we expect to have a onetime P&L charge of $19 million related to the ESOP. This is a nonrecurring item related to adjustments made to the ESOP at the time of the IPO, which will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. This does not affect the underlying business profitability, and we just wanted to be on your radar ahead of time. 
For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx of $150 million to $155 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $132 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. We knew these items are hard to project, which is why we share them with you each quarter. 
Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense after paying down the revolver with the divestiture proceeds to be around $120 million. We estimate the tax rate will be in the range of 32% to 33%. For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% to reflect the tax rate applicable to our intangible asset. And finally, we expect the diluted weighted average share count about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases. Overall, we're working hard to execute on our 2016 plan and remain excited about the go-forward financial profile of the company. We're well positioned for profitable growth in the future and have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for continued long-term growth. We continue to appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up.

We'll come back to that true-up question, but the way that observe our business, Tim, it's always really going through pipelines and conversion rates on renewable opportunities or new business opportunities, so it's very much a bottoms-up view",628,"Scott here. We'll come back to that true-up question, but the way that observe our business, Tim, it's always really going through pipelines and conversion rates on renewable opportunities or new business opportunities, so it's very much a bottoms-up view. If I look at across -- if I look at across the insurance vertical, it's pretty broadly based in terms of our expectations for the latter half of the year. I wouldn't say that any one theme really stands out. We called out that in this quarter some of the transaction-based business around the cat modeling space were soft. But overall, as we look at the latter half of 2016, it's really pretty broadly based across claims, underwriting, industry-standard solutions and catastrophe modeling. One perspective I thought I might just add here is, if you just think about the kind of the world in which Verisk sits at the moment and you think about really exogenous factors, there's really 3 things that they're kind of out there that are just sort of bubbling at the moment probably in order of importance when you think about Verisk outcomes overall. When would be that our customers into oil and gas industry are under a lot of pressure at the moment because of where the commodity stance. We think that, that's a moment in time effect. We don't predict the oil price, but we expect a more normalized environment. The second is that -- and there has been a lot of extreme event activity over the last couple of years, and that really tends to have 2 effects. And now I'm in the insurance vertical. That tends to have 2 effects. One is, the reinsurance world has softened, the pricing has softened and there has been some consolidation. And so that works its way in a little bit and then cap-on issuance has actually responded to that as well, the lack of extreme events. And as Eva said, we continue to get the overwhelming share of the cat bond activity, it's just that the absolute volumes have turned down there. We get asked a lot, by the way, whether overall premium progressions in the insurance industry tends to affect us. The answer is basically no because of the way we contract with our customers. But when there's a sustained periods of less extreme event activity, it actually, it shows a up little bit because the underlying markets respond to that. And also, a few of the things we do like repair cost estimating, there is an element of it which responds to the absolute number of claims. And when you have extreme events, you have more claims. And then the third thing is, as Eva was pointing out in 2015, a lot of our environmental health and safety customers needed to really scramble to make sure that they were compliant with regulations that required compliance by the end of 2015. So there was a bit of surge of work in that regard. So you have kind of a moment in time effect, which is -- that was kind of powering the business up to 2015. That is also a part of the business we are when you look at subscription-based revenues, we're actually happy with what's happening. So I just thought I would throw up that perspective of our overall in a sense that on the one hand, I don't really think our business is that affected by what's happening in the outside world. But it's not as if we're totally immune and probably all the dials are pointed in the wrong direction. It's just at this moment, the performance of our company is good. I'm really happy with it. So then, Mark, did you want to just take on the..."

And we're very confident in this business, and so we have continued to invest knowing that at this moment in time, we have the kinds of just macro factors that I talked about before. Specifically, with respect to ISO Solutions, we are very interested in amplifying what it is that we do there. And so the kind of talent that we brought in with respect to topics like, and all of these relate to the insurance world: cyber, Internet of Things, the linkage between the energy ecosystem and the insurance world, et cetera, we've really created a substantially new talent base that we just didn't have before, also resilience issues as they relate to extreme events and I could go on. We're excited to have -- we're excited to have this new talent inside the organization.

I think if you look back, historically, you would see that as well. With regards to Decision Analytics, one, I would just point out that the nonsubs revenue that we've been talking about a bit, actually unlike some of the historical transactional revenue that we used to have been business as we no longer own, that's actually pretty high-margin business, and. So when we don't have that come through, that can have some impact on the margin in the moment.

The second point I would make is that we're very excited about Greentech Media because of the depth of expertise there with respect to solar and smart grids and grid age technologies and storage technologies. And we -- what we're finding is that our existing hydrocarbon-based customers are increasingly interested in the alternatives. And so not only is it in a sense new business for us, the degree to which we're now looking specifically at the dynamics of what's going on in solar generation specifically in terms of what's going on with respect to grid edge FX, not only is it new business, but it's also actually makes us a more compelling partner for our existing customers in the hydrocarbon ecosystem. So we're really excited about it. We think that it's really going to be helpful. And then I think overall, you were just kind of looking for what's the forward profile. Well, I'd make a couple of comments. One is, there have been some very large trades in the oil and gas space, and we've been participating as you saw. And we continue to ask questions about what strategically would advantage this business the most, but we're certainly not enamored with the thought of large deals. And a lot of it is, we're going to make the business that we have run well. I think that around again, kind of around the edges, we will try to support that which we already do and there will be opportunities that are kind of thematic in a way, let's say, Greentech is thematic."

So Bill, maybe I'll take the second part, and I'll let Mark talk a little bit about some of the specific products in Insurance Solutions. If you were to think about Decision Analytics overall, the mix between subscription and nonsubscription is about 77% subscription. I would say insurance and Decision Analytics looks fairly similar to the rest of Decision Analytics now, now that we don't have highly transactional difference in health care in there anymore. There's more uniformity across that. So I think that we love where we sit. We've always thought it was natural to have some amount of nonsubscription revenue I think in Decision Analytics. We have a bit more of that, and that includes things we do that provide his opportunities to work closely with customers and develop those new solutions.

Our vision, our focus for this year and next is to bring out what refer to I'll as a more integrated solution, which brings together Xactimate that's used probably 85% of the property repair cost estimates across the United States, in combination with XactAnalysis, which is the BI tool and everything around it so that you can work and use your back office in an efficient way. In addition, Contents, which represents all the information about pricing materials inside the home to replace TV rugs and things. So our focus make it more integrated, easier to use, more focus on the claim as opposed to the assignment, which is doing the work but more on the claim. All of that has been kind of a focus from customer perspective and our perspective to achieve those things. Very much in our core vision is to take that solution at more simplified solution and bring it to global insurance market, customizing in the way that it's fit for use in that market. And we put a lot of time and resource in making progress there. The final component to this is we are seeing a lot of activity in the U.S. market where people are interested in trying to make access to the quote engine getting -- going online and getting quotes for auto and home more and more interactive with a customer and our ability to help our customers do that through the intense 360Value value. But you as a homeowner go online and make sure you have the proper coverage for your home. That's valuable, that's helpful, and it's easy. You have policyholder of the person doing it part of themselves, and that's the type of innovation we want to work within help our customers with their customers. Last piece, as we think about this, bringing it together, we're finding increased interest in basically the whole property suite of solutions as we go overseas. So we kind of let in with a claim side of things. But clearly, people are looking for information about large commercial buildings. So replicating some of the things we do here in the United States using both remote sensing and aerial images, providing with insight into risk about the building and helping them understand what the insurance to value is, meaning what's the replacement cost if there's a total loss. And all of those themes, I think we're trying to be more comprehensive, more seamless both internationally, and that will obviously revert back with our U.S. customers as well. So I probably said a lot. I want to make sure I respond to some of the question."

Posted the sale of health care, you have more subscription revenue, more visibility on cash flow. You indicated a preference for small, tuck-in, data-oriented acquisitions. I guess, 2 questions. First, how do you think about opportunities in the acquisition pipeline versus share repurchase given the current price of your stock? And then secondly, with the higher subscription base revenue, more visible cash flow, higher margin profile, how do you think about the possibility of initiating a dividend?"

If you look at our company over extended periods of time, the program of acquisition and the share repurchase program have both done very well for our shareholders, both have done very well. And there's really nothing in our situation that would cause us to think that anything fundamentally is going to be different in the future than in the past. You actually pointed out one of the features of our company, which is that the cash flow visibility is, if anything, even greater than it was. So we would continue to see both of those as real pillars inside of the way that we do what we do. And so at any given moment, this moment, for example, we're always taking stock of where we stand in the M&A pipeline and how eminent we think good opportunities are. And we remain very interested in deploying capital in terms of returning it to shareholders when we feel that the sort of that which is right at the head of the pipeline and the size is such that we still have capacity. And I would say that we do have we have capacity as we sit here. So we're very alert to the application of capital and will remain so, and that's a statement for the third quarter and the fourth quarter and really forever. I actually thought your second question, Dave, was going to be different, more about sort of a higher leverage target rather than a dividend. We're very interested in returning capital to shareholders, I guess, is the way that I would put it. Our analysis to date has not indicated that there's anything fundamentally superior about it in the form of dividends versus the buyback program that we've had. So that's kind of where we sit with that thought at the moment. By the way, even David and I and Mark and all that sit out there talking to investors, we actually answer that question all the time. How do you feel about it? And so we remain open to the conversation, but I would say that we haven't drawn the conclusion that a dividend is superior way of expressing our commitment to returning capital to shareholders."

I think if you take WoodMac, PCI and Infield out of specialized, those are all inorganic in the quarter. You primarily have our environmental health and safety solutions and some of our weather solutions. We referenced in the press release and on the call, when you think about the HNS, there were some double standards that went into place in 2015, which gave us the opportunity to serve our customers and making those transitions. Those transitions are completed, and so you kind of see a normalization about that type of work this year, which is leading to the organic result of the decline there. I would say that, that's probably the primary impact. And if you were to think about it, I think the headline growth decline as a percentage is larger than the actual dollar impact on Verisk. The other thing we mentioned is with regards to that area we're transitioning into more subscription-based revenues and I think that's really great both for us and for our customers. So in a moment in time, if you're going for more transaction, the more subscription, the great thing about subscription is it's recognized over time. But in the moment, transaction is not there and subscription is only the portion of what you're going to recognize you're going to see a little impact."

In the second quarter, we delivered solid overall results with total revenue growth of about 16%, adjusted EBITDA growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 1.4%, including the impact of the s",584,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered solid overall results with total revenue growth of about 16%, adjusted EBITDA growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 1.4%, including the impact of the shares we issued last year for the WoodMac transaction. Year-to-date, free cash flow was up 21%. 
Organic revenue growth was 5.4% as we continue to grow faster than our underlying end markets. We've spoken of higher, longer-term organic growth, and the underlying trends remain encouraging. Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins over 49%. 
We're focused on leveraging our Verisk distinct, which are: one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into customer workflows. And our core capabilities to add value for our customers and in turn for our shareholders. We're also seeing traction in these solutions that are being developed and continue to be optimistic about their long-term potential to contribute to customers and, ultimately, our financial performance. 
As we announced in June, I'm excited to have expanded the roles of several members of our senior leadership team. Mark who have been our CFO since we before our 2009 IPO, is now Verisk's Chief Operating Officer, with responsibility for our insurance businesses and our technology and customer experience organizations. Eva Huston is now our Chief Financial Officer, responsible for financial strategy, including accounting, tax, treasury and Investor Relations. I'm also pleased to have appointed [indiscernible] and Steve Holliday as group presidents. Mana leads Argus [indiscernible] and Verisk retail. Steve leads Wood Mackenzie 3E Company and Verisk Maplecroft. 
The strength of our platform and the clarity of our vision, combined with greater scope of response but he for these 4 proven professionals, will support our growth agenda and global push into the near and long term. These are all natural evolutions from their previous roles and will help us continue to deliver value to our customers and employees and shareholders. 
During the quarter, we close the sale of Healthcare business and used the proceeds to pay down our revolver, giving us plenty of capacity to support our long-stated capital allocation strategy for a balanced approach over time to acquisitions and repurchases. We had $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of June 30, 2016. 
We remain active in evaluating possible acquisitions, in particular, as we make buy versus build decisions in pursuit of our international expansion. We also see M&A as a channel for expanding our solution footprint. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, you saw that we purchased Greentech Media, an industry-leading information services provider for next-generation electricity and renewable sectors. Greentech media joins WoodMac, enhancing our research and other capabilities for subsectors, including solar generation, energy storage and smart grids that react dynamically to changes in supply and demand. These are very exciting areas in the energy and power markets and an excellent complement our outstanding oil and gas franchise. 
I remain encouraged by the opportunities we see for growth both near and long term. We're excited about a number of early-stage efforts where we are developing new and innovative solutions for our customers and where we are expanding existing solutions around the world. Near term, we continue to expect acceleration of our combined insurance businesses and double-digit growth at Argus. WoodMac is performing in line with the expectations we discussed with you last quarter. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Mark for some additional comments."

Across our businesses which serve the property/casualty insurance industry, we've seen several key industry themes, including vertical Big Data, industry automation and digital engagement. With these themes in mind, I'll briefly describe a number of positive recent developments in our businesses. Reflecting on all 3 themes, Verisk insurance solutions launched a new integration option for 360Value, a web-based replacement cost estimator for homeowners insurance. 360Value is built on our unique industry-standard construction materials and labor cost data. This solution helps our customers estimate coverage limits for residential, commercial and agricultural properties. Our customers can now integrate 360Value directly into their online homeowners quoting platforms. This helps the industry deploy more engaging solutions, which include pre-filling an online insurance application with property-specific information when a homeowner enters an address. 
Another recent launch is [indiscernible] a new product development platform, increasing engagement in automation, which helps our clients to easily research, create and distribute coverage language, providing efficiencies and time to market for new products and critical coverage updates. [indiscernible] will help our customers accelerate growth, reduce expense ratios and enhance in compliance.
Leveraging Big Data message, cutting-edge technology in pioneering automation, AIR released a hosted cloud solution for its catastrophe risk management platforms, Touchstone More than a dozen companies are already up and running on the AIR cloud, which enables them to conduct all of their analysis remotely while minimizing capital expenditures. Finally, in addition to the new deployment option, AIR recently expanded its coverage model of Southeast Asia. These models combined 10 years of extensive scientific research by AIR scientists by finding some studies of local building codes, damage surveys, wealth experience data and structural engineering research. 
With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results in more detail."

In the second quarter, we again delivered revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth going forward. Revenue grew 16.3% and 5.4% organically. EBITDA grew 12.4% to $245 million",1379,"Thank you, Mark. In the second quarter, we again delivered revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth going forward. Revenue grew 16.3% and 5.4% organically. EBITDA grew 12.4% to $245 million. EBITDA margins were 49.2% in the quarter. 
Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 23.5% and 5.5% organically. Financial services was the fastest-growing organic revenue end market, while insurance-focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to grow. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 6.2% in the second quarter. The increase was led by strong growth in loss quantification and claims analytics solutions. Underwriting solutions also grew in the quarter. Our catastrophe modeling solutions saw modest decline versus the prior year as a result of lower cat issuance and consulting revenues. Customer retention remains very high, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. 
Financial services revenue returned to strong growth, up to 15.9% in the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the contributions from the media solutions, which grew very well in the quarter. Our international revenue continues to grow nicely here as well, which does mean that FX may influence the reported results throughout the rest of the year. As Scott noted, we remain comfortable with double-digit growth based on accelerating growth in the second half of the year.
Energy and Specialized Markets revenue grew 70.4%, [ph] including WoodMac, which was acquired in May 2015. In this year's second quarter, WoodMac revenue was around flat on a constant currency basis. The decline in the British pound late in q2 will have a larger effect on the reported results starting in Q3 as the average Q2 rate was 1.43 and is currently in the low 130s. Organic revenue, excluding WoodMac, PCI and Infield, declined $2.4 million in the quarter. Services revenue peaked in the prior year as customers met 2015 compliance deadlines. We are also transitioning to a subscription revenue model, which is better for Verisk and better for our customers over the long term. The dollar impact remains small in relation to Verisk as a whole. Finally, as a reminder, WoodMac is organic starting in Q3. 
Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.5% and 5.3% on an organic basis, continuing to demonstrate the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Additionally, contributions of new solutions that are in early stages and the inclusion of Risk Intelligence Ireland, which we have rebranded as Verisk Insurance Solutions Ireland, added growth. Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 6.0%, reflecting our 2015 invoices and continued contribution from newer solution such as predictive models and electronic rating content. Our property-specific rating an underwriting information revenue increased 3.8% in the quarter. Growth was led an by increase in commercial underwriting solutions subscription revenue. 
EBITDA increased 12.4% in the quarter $245 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 49.2%. Decision Analytics EBITDA increased 20.8% to $141 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions and growth in our existing businesses. EBITDA and Risk Assessment increased 2.9% to $105 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management, offset in part by current realignment initiatives we have been discussing with you. This resulted in moderated margins versus Q1 as the hiring stages take effect as well as the impact of our annual merit increases.
We are very excited about the additions we've made to the team, and we look forward to their contributions over time. Reported interest expense was $31 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at June 30, 2016, after a repayment facilitating by cash flow generation and the proceeds from the sale of the Healthcare business. Our leverage at the end of the 2Q was about 2.2x pro forma for the health care divestiture, and we're pleased to have reached our target ahead of plan. We appreciate the support and confidence of our debt holders as we acquire WoodMac with a goal of returning to the 2.5x steady-state leverage. 
Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 33.5%. Adjusted net income in 2Q increased 3.7% to $124 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully-diluted basis was $0.73 in the quarter, an increase of 1.4%. Adjusted EPS increased because of solid operations both organic and acquired and lower interest expense. The increases were partially offset by higher fixed asset depreciation and amortization, only a partial quarter of WoodMac ownership in the prior period and increase in shares outstanding related to the 2015 acquisition of WoodMac. We expect that our adjusted EPS growth will normalize over time to reflect similar trends you see in our underlying business results. 
The average diluted share count was 171.2 million shares in the quarter, and on June 30, 2016, our diluted share count was 171.4 million shares. We do not repurchase any shares in the quarter as we continue to balance our appetite for share repurchase with our desire to maintain flexibility for M&A. At June 30, 2016, we had about $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. 
Free cash flow increased 21.1% and for the second q [ph] to $305 million, including WoodMac. This represented 61.9% of EBITDA. These numbers are all for continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by greater profitability of our businesses and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and, therefore, shareholder value. Capital expenditures increased 4.6% to $80 million [ph] for the 6-month period ended June 30, 2016, due to the inclusion of WoodMac's CapEx for the full quarter. 
CapEx was 5.2% of revenue. We expect CapEx for the full year to be $150 million to $155 million [indiscernible] the Healthcare business. We continue to manage our capital intensity to enable free cash flow growth. 
As you think about your models for 2016 on a continuing operations basis, we expect that based on current FX rate, there's about a $25 million impact full year revenue relative to where rates were at the start of 2016. This is up from our estimate last quarter of a $10 million impact. FX is a new factor as you think about our future growth, and we will look to provide more insight going forward to help you include it in your forecasting.
As you think about Q3, keep in mind that last year EBITDA included a $15.6 million warrant sale gain, which will not recur this year. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we expect to have a onetime P&L charge of $19 million related to the ESOP. This is a nonrecurring item related to adjustments made to the ESOP at the time of the IPO, which will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. This does not affect the underlying business profitability, and we just wanted to be on your radar ahead of time. 
For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx of $150 million to $155 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $132 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. We knew these items are hard to project, which is why we share them with you each quarter. 
Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense after paying down the revolver with the divestiture proceeds to be around $120 million. We estimate the tax rate will be in the range of 32% to 33%. For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% to reflect the tax rate applicable to our intangible asset. And finally, we expect the diluted weighted average share count about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases. Overall, we're working hard to execute on our 2016 plan and remain excited about the go-forward financial profile of the company. We're well positioned for profitable growth in the future and have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for continued long-term growth. We continue to appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions."

We'll come back to that true-up question, but the way that observe our business, Tim, it's always really going through pipelines and conversion rates on renewable opportunities or new business opportunities, so it's very much a bottoms-up view",628,"Scott here. We'll come back to that true-up question, but the way that observe our business, Tim, it's always really going through pipelines and conversion rates on renewable opportunities or new business opportunities, so it's very much a bottoms-up view. If I look at across -- if I look at across the insurance vertical, it's pretty broadly based in terms of our expectations for the latter half of the year. I wouldn't say that any one theme really stands out. We called out that in this quarter some of the transaction-based business around the cat modeling space were soft. But overall, as we look at the latter half of 2016, it's really pretty broadly based across claims, underwriting, industry-standard solutions and catastrophe modeling. One perspective I thought I might just add here is, if you just think about the kind of the world in which Verisk sits at the moment and you think about really exogenous factors, there's really 3 things that they're kind of out there that are just sort of bubbling at the moment probably in order of importance when you think about Verisk outcomes overall. When would be that our customers into oil and gas industry are under a lot of pressure at the moment because of where the commodity stance. We think that, that's a moment in time effect. We don't predict the oil price, but we expect a more normalized environment. The second is that -- and there has been a lot of extreme event activity over the last couple of years, and that really tends to have 2 effects. And now I'm in the insurance vertical. That tends to have 2 effects. One is, the reinsurance world has softened, the pricing has softened and there has been some consolidation. And so that works its way in a little bit and then cap-on issuance has actually responded to that as well, the lack of extreme events. And as Eva said, we continue to get the overwhelming share of the cat bond activity, it's just that the absolute volumes have turned down there. We get asked a lot, by the way, whether overall premium progressions in the insurance industry tends to affect us. The answer is basically no because of the way we contract with our customers. But when there's a sustained periods of less extreme event activity, it actually, it shows a up little bit because the underlying markets respond to that. And also, a few of the things we do like repair cost estimating, there is an element of it which responds to the absolute number of claims. And when you have extreme events, you have more claims. And then the third thing is, as Eva was pointing out in 2015, a lot of our environmental health and safety customers needed to really scramble to make sure that they were compliant with regulations that required compliance by the end of 2015. So there was a bit of surge of work in that regard. So you have kind of a moment in time effect, which is -- that was kind of powering the business up to 2015. That is also a part of the business we are when you look at subscription-based revenues, we're actually happy with what's happening. So I just thought I would throw up that perspective of our overall in a sense that on the one hand, I don't really think our business is that affected by what's happening in the outside world. But it's not as if we're totally immune and probably all the dials are pointed in the wrong direction. It's just at this moment, the performance of our company is good. I'm really happy with it. So then, Mark, did you want to just take on the..."

Specifically, with respect to ISO Solutions, we are very interested in amplifying what it is that we do there. And so the kind of talent that we brought in with respect to topics like, and all of these relate to the insurance world: cyber, Internet of Things, the linkage between the energy ecosystem and the insurance world, et cetera, we've really created a substantially new talent base that we just didn't have before, also resilience issues as they relate to extreme events and I could go on.

I think if you look back, historically, you would see that as well. With regards to Decision Analytics, one, I would just point out that the nonsubs revenue that we've been talking about a bit, actually unlike some of the historical transactional revenue that we used to have been business as we no longer own, that's actually pretty high-margin business, and. So when we don't have that come through, that can have some impact on the margin in the moment.

The second point I would make is that we're very excited about Greentech Media because of the depth of expertise there with respect to solar and smart grids and grid age technologies and storage technologies. And we -- what we're finding is that our existing hydrocarbon-based customers are increasingly interested in the alternatives. And so not only is it in a sense new business for us, the degree to which we're now looking specifically at the dynamics of what's going on in solar generation specifically in terms of what's going on with respect to grid edge FX, not only is it new business, but it's also actually makes us a more compelling partner for our existing customers in the hydrocarbon ecosystem. So we're really excited about it. We think that it's really going to be helpful. And then I think overall, you were just kind of looking for what's the forward profile. Well, I'd make a couple of comments. One is, there have been some very large trades in the oil and gas space, and we've been participating as you saw. And we continue to ask questions about what strategically would advantage this business the most, but we're certainly not enamored with the thought of large deals. And a lot of it is, we're going to make the business that we have run well. I think that around again, kind of around the edges, we will try to support that which we already do and there will be opportunities that are kind of thematic in a way, let's say, Greentech is thematic."

Our vision, our focus for this year and next is to bring out what refer to I'll as a more integrated solution, which brings together Xactimate that's used probably 85% of the property repair cost estimates across the United States, in combination with XactAnalysis, which is the BI tool and everything around it so that you can work and use your back office in an efficient way. In addition, Contents, which represents all the information about pricing materials inside the home to replace TV rugs and things. So our focus make it more integrated, easier to use, more focus on the claim as opposed to the assignment, which is doing the work but more on the claim. All of that has been kind of a focus from customer perspective and our perspective to achieve those things. Very much in our core vision is to take that solution at more simplified solution and bring it to global insurance market, customizing in the way that it's fit for use in that market. And we put a lot of time and resource in making progress there. The final component to this is we are seeing a lot of activity in the U.S. market where people are interested in trying to make access to the quote engine getting -- going online and getting quotes for auto and home more and more interactive with a customer and our ability to help our customers do that through the intense 360Value value. But you as a homeowner go online and make sure you have the proper coverage for your home. That's valuable, that's helpful, and it's easy. You have policyholder of the person doing it part of themselves, and that's the type of innovation we want to work within help our customers with their customers. Last piece, as we think about this, bringing it together, we're finding increased interest in basically the whole property suite of solutions as we go overseas. So we kind of let in with a claim side of things. But clearly, people are looking for information about large commercial buildings. So replicating some of the things we do here in the United States using both remote sensing and aerial images, providing with insight into risk about the building and helping them understand what the insurance to value is, meaning what's the replacement cost if there's a total loss. And all of those themes, I think we're trying to be more comprehensive, more seamless both internationally, and that will obviously revert back with our U.S. customers as well. So I probably said a lot. I want to make sure I respond to some of the question."

Posted the sale of health care, you have more subscription revenue, more visibility on cash flow. You indicated a preference for small, tuck-in, data-oriented acquisitions. I guess, 2 questions. First, how do you think about opportunities in the acquisition pipeline versus share repurchase given the current price of your stock? And then secondly, with the higher subscription base revenue, more visible cash flow, higher margin profile, how do you think about the possibility of initiating a dividend?"

If you look at our company over extended periods of time, the program of acquisition and the share repurchase program have both done very well for our shareholders, both have done very well. And there's really nothing in our situation that would cause us to think that anything fundamentally is going to be different in the future than in the past. You actually pointed out one of the features of our company, which is that the cash flow visibility is, if anything, even greater than it was. So we would continue to see both of those as real pillars inside of the way that we do what we do. And so at any given moment, this moment, for example, we're always taking stock of where we stand in the M&A pipeline and how eminent we think good opportunities are. And we remain very interested in deploying capital in terms of returning it to shareholders when we feel that the sort of that which is right at the head of the pipeline and the size is such that we still have capacity. And I would say that we do have we have capacity as we sit here. So we're very alert to the application of capital and will remain so, and that's a statement for the third quarter and the fourth quarter and really forever. I actually thought your second question, Dave, was going to be different, more about sort of a higher leverage target rather than a dividend. We're very interested in returning capital to shareholders, I guess, is the way that I would put it. Our analysis to date has not indicated that there's anything fundamentally superior about it in the form of dividends versus the buyback program that we've had. So that's kind of where we sit with that thought at the moment. By the way, even David and I and Mark and all that sit out there talking to investors, we actually answer that question all the time. How do you feel about it? And so we remain open to the conversation, but I would say that we haven't drawn the conclusion that a dividend is superior way of expressing our commitment to returning capital to shareholders."

I think if you take WoodMac, PCI and Infield out of specialized, those are all inorganic in the quarter. You primarily have our environmental health and safety solutions and some of our weather solutions. We referenced in the press release and on the call, when you think about the HNS, there were some double standards that went into place in 2015, which gave us the opportunity to serve our customers and making those transitions. Those transitions are completed, and so you kind of see a normalization about that type of work this year, which is leading to the organic result of the decline there. I would say that, that's probably the primary impact. And if you were to think about it, I think the headline growth decline as a percentage is larger than the actual dollar impact on Verisk. The other thing we mentioned is with regards to that area we're transitioning into more subscription-based revenues and I think that's really great both for us and for our customers. So in a moment in time, if you're going for more transaction, the more subscription, the great thing about subscription is it's recognized over time. But in the moment, transaction is not there and subscription is only the portion of what you're going to recognize you're going to see a little impact."

They really do come these moments where the customers are open to and maybe even wanting to move to a subscription because they want more certainty and visibility in terms of the future. So it's kind of a natural sort of a development for newer kinds of solutions. And Eva was describing that with respect to some of what goes on in the [indiscernible] side. Same thing in country and political risk side, we're seeing -- we're doing the same thing."

I would say that like many of our businesses, I think there's opportunity for us to add incremental revenue through project revenue and certainly that's something that you can move -- that could move a growth rate in a short term. But I think fundamentally, when we talk about the double-digit growth rate, again, given the comparable that we have last year, we think that it was very strong."

As I did observe in the quarter, in particular, when you have some high-margin nonsubscription business like cat bonds and have less of that, that will have a moment in time impact on the margin in the quarter.

In the second quarter, we delivered solid overall results, with total revenue growth of about 16%, adjusted EBITDA growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 1.4%, including the impact of the shares we issued last year for the WoodMac transaction. Year-to-date, free cash flow was up 21%. 
Organic revenue growth was 5.4% as we continue to grow faster than our underlying end markets. We've spoken of higher, longer-term organic growth, and the underlying trends remain encouraging. Profitability remains strong with total EBITDA margins over 49%. 
We're focused on leveraging our Verisk's distinct tips, which are: one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into customer workflows and our core capabilities to add value for our customers and in turn for our shareholders. We're also seeing traction in new solutions that are being developed and continue to be optimistic about their long-term potential to contribute to customers and, ultimately, our financial performance. 
As we announced in June, I'm excited to have expanded the roles of several members of our senior leadership team. Mark Anquillare, who had been our CFO since before our 2009 IPO, is now Verisk's Chief Operating Officer, with responsibility for our insurance businesses and our technology and customer experience organizations. Eva Huston is now our Chief Financial Officer, responsible for financial strategy, including accounting, tax, treasury and Investor Relations. I'm also pleased to have appointed Nana Banerjee and Steve Halliday as group presidents. Nana leads Argus, Geomni and Verisk Retail. Steve leads Wood Mackenzie, 3E Company and Verisk Maplecroft. 
The strength of our platform and the clarity of our vision, combined with greater scope of responsibility for these 4 proven professionals, will support our growth agenda and global push into the near and long term. These are all natural evolutions from their previous roles and will help us continue to deliver value to our customers, employees and shareholders. 
During the quarter, we closed the sale of the health care business and used the proceeds to pay down our revolver, giving us plenty of capacity to support our long-stated capital allocation strategy for a balanced approach over time to acquisitions and repurchases. We had $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of June 30, 2016. 
We remain active in evaluating possible acquisitions, in particular as we make buy versus build decisions in pursuit of our international expansion. We also see M&A as a channel for expanding our solution footprint. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, you saw that we purchased Greentech Media, an industry-leading information services provider for next-generation electricity and renewable sectors. Greentech Media joins WoodMac, enhancing our research and other capabilities for subsectors, including solar generation, energy storage and smart grids that react dynamically to changes in supply and demand. These are very exciting areas in the energy and power markets and an excellent complement to our outstanding oil and gas franchise. 
I remain encouraged by the opportunities we see for growth both near and long term. We're excited about a number of early-stage efforts where we are developing new and innovative solutions for our customers and where we are expanding existing solutions around the world. Near term, we continue to expect acceleration of our combined insurance businesses and double-digit growth at Argus. WoodMac is performing in line with the expectations we discussed with you last quarter. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Mark for some additional comments."

Across our businesses, which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we've seen several key industry themes, including vertical big data, industry automation and digital engagement. With these themes in mind, I'll briefly describe a number of positive recent developments in our businesses. Reflecting on all 3 themes, Verisk Insurance Solutions launched a new integration option for 360Value, a web-based replacement cost estimator for homeowners insurance. 360Value is built on our unique industry-standard construction materials and labor cost data. This solution helps our customers estimate coverage limits for residential, commercial and agricultural properties. Our customers can now integrate 360Value directly into their online homeowners quoting platforms. This helps the industry deploy more engaging solutions, which include prefilling an online insurance application with property-specific information when a homeowner enters an address. 
Another recent launch is Mozart, a new product development platform, increasing engagement in automation, which helps our clients to easily research, create and distribute coverage language, providing efficiencies in time to market for new products and critical coverage updates. Mozart will help our customers accelerate profitable growth, reduce expense ratios and enhance audit and compliance.
Leveraging big data methods, cutting-edge technology and pioneering automation, AIR released a hosted cloud solution for its catastrophe risk management platforms, Touchstone and CATRADER. More than a dozen companies are already up and running on the AIR cloud, which enables them to conduct all of their analyses remotely while minimizing capital expenditures. Finally, in addition to the new deployment option, AIR recently expanded its coverage model of Southeast Asia. These models combined 10 years of extensive scientific research by our AIR scientists, with finding some studies of local building codes, damage surveys, lots of experience data and structural engineering research. 
With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results in more detail."

In the second quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth going forward. Revenue grew 16.3% and 5.4% organically. EBITDA grew 12.4% to $245 million. EBITDA margins were 49.2% in the quarter. 
Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 23.5% and 5.5% organically. Financial services was the fastest-growing organic revenue end market, while insurance-focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to grow. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 6.2% in the second quarter. The increase was led by strong growth in loss quantification and claims analytics solutions. Underwriting solutions also grew in the quarter. Our catastrophe modeling solutions saw a modest decline versus the prior year as a result of lower cat bond issuance and consulting revenues. Customer retention remains very high, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. 
Financial services revenue returned to strong growth, up 15.9% in the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the contributions from the media effectiveness solutions, which grew very well in the quarter. Our international revenue continues to grow nicely here as well, which does mean that FX may influence the reported results throughout the rest of the year. As Scott noted, we remain comfortable with double-digit growth based on accelerating growth in the second half of the year.
Energy and Specialized Markets revenue grew 70.4%, including WoodMac, which was acquired in May 2015. In this year's second quarter, WoodMac revenue was around flat on a constant currency basis. The decline in the British pound late in Q2 will have a larger effect on the reported results starting in Q3, as the average Q2 rate was 1.43 and is currently in the low 130s. Organic revenue, excluding WoodMac, PCI and Infield, declined $2.4 million in the quarter. Services revenue peaked in the prior year as customers met 2015 compliance deadlines. We are also transitioning to a subscription revenue model, which is better for Verisk and better for our customers over the long term. The dollar impact remains small in relation to Verisk as a whole. Finally, as a reminder, WoodMac is organic starting in Q3. 
Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.5% and 5.3% on an organic basis, continuing to demonstrate the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Additionally, contribution to the new solutions that are in early stages and the inclusion of Risk Intelligence Ireland, which we have rebranded as Verisk Insurance Solutions Ireland, added growth. Industry-standard insurance programs' revenue grew 6.0%, reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solution, such as predictive models and electronic rating content. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 3.8% in the quarter. Growth was led by an increase in commercial underwriting solutions' subscription revenue. 
EBITDA increased 12.4% in the quarter to $245 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 49.2%. Decision Analytics' EBITDA increased 20.8% to $141 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions and growth in our existing businesses. EBITDA and Risk Assessment increased 2.9% to $105 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management, offset in part by talent realignment initiatives we have been discussing with you. This resulted in moderated margins versus Q1 as the hiring started to take effect as well as the impact of our annual merit increases.
We are very excited about the additions we've made to the team, and we look forward to their contributions over time. Reported interest expense was $31 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at June 30, 2016, after a repayment facilitated by cash flow generation and the proceeds from the sale of the health care business. Our leverage at the end of the second quarter was about 2.2x pro forma for the health care divestiture, and we're pleased to have reached our target ahead of plan. We appreciate the support and confidence of our debt holders, as we acquired WoodMac with a goal of returning to the 2.5x steady-state leverage. 
Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 33.5%. Adjusted net income in 2Q increased 3.7% to $124 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully-diluted basis was $0.73 in the quarter, an increase of 1.4%. Adjusted EPS increased because of solid operations both organic and acquired, and lower interest expense. The increases were partially offset by a higher fixed asset depreciation and amortization, only a partial quarter of WoodMac ownership in the prior period and an increase in shares outstanding related to the 2015 acquisition of WoodMac. We expect that our adjusted EPS growth will normalize over time to reflect similar trends you see in our underlying business results. 
The average diluted share count was 171.2 million shares in the quarter, and on June 30, 2016, our diluted share count was 171.4 million shares. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter, as we continue to balance our appetite for share repurchase with our desire to maintain flexibility for M&A. At June 30, 2016, we had about $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. 
Free cash flow increased 21.1% for the 6-month period to $305 million, including WoodMac. This represented 61.9% of EBITDA. These numbers are all for continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by greater profitability of our businesses and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and, therefore, shareholder value. Capital expenditures increased 4.6% to $52 million for the 6-month period ended June 30, 2016, due to the inclusion of WoodMac's CapEx for the full quarter. 
CapEx was 5.2% of revenue. We expect CapEx for the full year to be $150 million to $155 million pro forma for the divestiture of the health care business. We continue to manage our capital intensity to enable free cash flow growth. 
As you think about your models for 2016 on a continuing operations basis, we expect that based on current FX rate, there's about a $25 million impact full year revenue relative to where rates were at the start of 2016. This is up from our estimate last quarter of $10 million impact. FX is a new factor as you think about our future growth, and we will look to provide more insight going forward to help you include it in your forecasting.
As you think about Q3, keep in mind that last year, EBITDA included a $15.6 million warrant sale gain, which will not recur this year. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we expect to have a onetime P&L charge of $19 million related to the ESOP. This is a nonrecurring item related to adjustments made to the ESOP at the time of the IPO, which will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. This does not affect the underlying business profitability, and we just want it to be on your radar ahead of time. 
For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx of $150 million to $155 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $132 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. We know these are items that are hard to project, which is why we share them with you each quarter. 
Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense after paying down the revolver with the divestiture proceeds to be around $120 million. We estimate the tax rate will be in the range of 32% to 33%. For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% to reflect the tax rate applicable to our intangible assets. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases. Overall, we're working hard to execute on our 2016 plan and remain excited about the go-forward financial profile of the company. We're well positioned for profitable growth in the future and have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for continued long-term growth. We continue to appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up. 
And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions."

We'll come back to that true-up question, but the way that observe our business, Tim, is always really going through pipelines and conversion rates on renewable opportunities or new business opportunities. So it's very much a bottoms-up view.",619,"Scott here. We'll come back to that true-up question, but the way that observe our business, Tim, is always really going through pipelines and conversion rates on renewable opportunities or new business opportunities. So it's very much a bottoms-up view. If I look across -- if I look across the insurance vertical, it's pretty broadly based in terms of our expectations for the latter half of the year. I wouldn't say that any one theme really stands out. We called out in this quarter some of the transaction-based business around the cat modeling space were soft. But overall, as we look at the latter half of 2016, it's really pretty broadly based across claims, underwriting, industry-standard solutions and catastrophe modeling. One perspective I thought I might just add here is if you just think about the kind of the world in which Verisk sits at the moment and you think about really exogenous factors, there's really 3 things that they're kind of out there that are just sort of bubbling at the moment probably in order of importance when you think about Verisk outcomes overall. One would be that our customers in the oil and gas industry are under a lot of pressure at the moment because of where the commodity stands. We think that that's a moment-in-time effect. We don't predict the oil price, but we expect a more normalized environment. The second is that there hasn't been a lot of extreme event activity over the last couple of years, and that really tends to have 2 effects. Now I'm in the insurance vertical. That tends to have 2 effects. One is the reinsurance world has softened, the pricing has softened and there has been some consolidation. And so that works its way in a little bit. And then cat bond issuance has actually responded to that as well, the lack of extreme events. And as Eva said, we continue to get the overwhelming share of the cat bond activity. It's just that the absolute volumes have turned down there. We get asked a lot, by the way, whether overall premium progression in the insurance industry tends to affect us. The answer is basically no because of the way we contract with our customers. But when there's a sustained period of less extreme event activity, it actually -- it shows up a little bit because the underlying markets respond to that. And also, a few of the things we do like repair cost estimating, there is an element of it, which responds to the absolute number of claims, and when you have extreme events, you have more claims. And then the third thing is, as Eva was pointing out, in 2015, a lot of our environmental health and safety customers needed to really scramble to make sure that they were compliant with regulations that required compliance by the end of 2015. So there was a bit of surge of work in that regard. So you have kind of a moment-in-time effect, which is -- that was kind of powering the business up to 2015. That is also a part of the business, where when you look at subscription-based revenues, we're actually happy with what's happening. So I just thought I would throw up that perspective overall in the sense that on the one hand, I don't really think our business is that affected by what's happening in the outside world, but it's not as if we're totally immune and probably all the dials are pointed in the wrong direction just at this moment, and yet the performance of our company is good. I'm really happy with it. So then, Mark, did you want to just take on the...?"

Are you going to continue to invest? And we're very confident in this business and so we have continued to invest knowing that at this moment in time, we have the kinds of just macro factors that I talked about before. Specifically, with respect to ISO Solutions, we are very interested in amplifying what it is that we do there. And so the kind of talent that we brought in with respect to topics like -- and all of these relate to the insurance world: cyber, internet of things, the linkage between the energy, ecosystem and the insurance world, et cetera. We've really created a substantially new talent base that we just didn't have before. Also resilience issues as they relate to extreme events and I could go on. We're excited to have -- we're excited to have this new talent inside of the organization.

I think if you look back historically, you would see that as well. With regards to Decision Analytics, one, I would just point out that the nonsubs revenue that we've been talking about a bit, actually unlike some of the historical transactional revenue that we used to have in businesses we no longer own. That's actually pretty high-margin business. And so when we don't have that come through, that can have some impact on the margin in the moment. I would also point out to you, I mentioned in my comments FX, and FX can have some impact on margin as well.

How much is it more opportunity in the market because of what's going on in the end market? And then just any -- what's your appetite for a potentially larger deal for WoodMac?"

So part of what we've done on the M&A front has been what I would consider to be small and tuck-in and really about trying to give ourselves additional distinctive data assets. That, for example, would be Infield acquisitions. So that's sort of point one. The second point I would make is that we're very excited about Greentech Media because of the depth of the expertise there with respect to solar, smart grids and grid edge technologies, and storage technologies. And we -- what we're finding is that our existing hydrocarbon-based customers are increasingly interested in the alternatives. And so not only is it in a sense new business for us, the degree to which we're now looking specifically at the dynamics of what's going on in solar generation, specifically in terms of what's going on with respect to grid edge effects. Not only is it new business, but it also actually makes us a more compelling partner for our existing customers in the hydrocarbon ecosystem. So there's -- we're really excited about it. We think that it's really going to be helpful. And then I think overall, you are kind of looking for what's the broader profile. Well, I'd make a couple of comments. One is there have been some very large trades in the oil and gas space, and we've been participating, as you saw. And we continue to ask questions about what strategically would advantage this business the most, but we're certainly not enamored at the thought of large deals. And a lot of it is we're going to make the business that we have run well. I think that, again, kind of around the edges, we will try to support that which we already do and there will be opportunities that are kind of thematic in the way that's, say, Greentech is thematic."

I would say insurance and Decision Analytics looks fairly similar to the rest of Decision Analytics now, now that we don't have that highly transactional difference in health care in there anymore. There's more uniformity across that. So I think that we love where we sit. We've always thought it was natural to have some amount of nonsubscription revenue. And I think, in Decision Analytics, we have a bit more of that and that includes things we do that provide us opportunities to work closely with customers and develop those new solutions.

So let me just quickly highlight the fact that we continue to improve the suite of Xactware solutions. Our vision and our focus for this year and next is to bring out what I'll refer to as a more integrated solution, which brings together Xactimate that's used in probably about 85% of the property repair cost estimates across the United States, in combination with XactAnalysis, which is the BI tool and everything around it, so that you can work and use your back office in an efficient way. In addition, Contents, which represents all of the information about pricing materials inside the home to replace TV, couches, rugs and things. So our focus make it more integrated, easier to use, more focused on the claim as opposed to the assignment, which is doing the work, but more on the claim. All of that has been kind of a focus from a customer perspective and our perspective to achieve those things. Very much in our forward vision is to take that solution at more simplified solution and bring it to global insurance market, customizing it in a way that it's fit for use in that market. And we've put a lot of time and resource in making progress there. The final component to this is we are seeing a lot of activity in the U.S. market, where people are interested in trying to make access to the quote engine [indiscernible] getting -- going online and getting quote for auto and home, more and more interactive with the customer and our ability to help our customers do that through the enhanced inherit [ph] 360Value. But you, as a homeowner, go online to make sure you have the proper coverage for your home. That's valuable. That's helpful, and it's easy. You have the policyholder or the person who is getting quote do it themselves, and that's the type of innovation we want to work with and help our customers with their customers. Last piece, as we think about this bringing it together, we're finding increased interest in basically the whole property suite of solutions as we go overseas. So we kind of let in with the claim side of things, but clearly, people are looking for information about large commercial buildings. So replicating some of the things we do here in the United States using both remote sensing and aerial imageries, providing with insights into risk about a building and helping them understand what the insurance the value is, meaning, what's the replacement cost if there was a total loss. And all of those themes, I think, we're trying to be more comprehensive, more seamless, both internationally and that will obviously revert back with our U.S. customers as well. So I probably said a lot, but I want to make sure I responded to some of the questions."

Post the sale of health care, you have more subscription revenue, more visibility on cash flow. You indicated a preference for small, tuck-in, data-oriented acquisitions. I guess, 2 questions. First, how do you think about opportunities in the acquisition pipeline versus share repurchase given the current price of your stock? And then secondly, with the higher subscription base revenue, more visible cash flow, higher margin profile, how do you think about the possibility of initiating a dividend?"

I mean, all good -- all good topics. So maybe back to the top. If you look at our company over extended periods of time, the program of acquisition and the share repurchase program have both done very well for our shareholders, both have done very well. And there's really nothing in our situation that would cause us to think that anything fundamentally is going to be different in the future than in the past. You actually pointed out one of the features of our company, which is that the cash flow visibility is, if anything, even greater than it was. So we would continue to see both of those as real pillars inside of the way that we do what we do. And so at any given moment -- this moment, for example, we're always taking stock of where we stand in the M&A pipeline and how imminent we think good opportunities are. And we remain very interested in deploying capital in terms of returning it to shareholders when we feel that the sort of that which is right at the head of the pipeline and the size is such that we still have capacity. And I would say that we do have -- we have capacity as we sit here. So we're very alert to the application of capital and will remain so, and that's a statement for the third quarter and the fourth quarter and really forever. I actually thought your second question, Dave, was going to be different, more about sort of a higher leverage target rather than a dividend. We're very interested in returning capital to shareholders. I guess, it's the way that I would put it. Our analysis to date has not indicated that there's anything fundamentally superior about doing it in the form of a dividend versus the buyback program that we've had. So that's kind of where we sit with that thought at the moment. By the way, even David and I and Mark and all that sit out there talking to investors, we actually ask that question all the time: how do you feel about it? And so we remain open to the conversation, but I would say that we haven't drawn the conclusion that a dividend is a superior way of expressing our commitment to returning capital to shareholders."

We referenced in the press release and on the call, when you think about EH&S, there were some global standards that went into place in 2015, which gave us the opportunity to serve our customers and making those transitions. Those transitions are complete, and so you'll kind of see a normalization about that type of work this year, which is leading to the organic result of a decline there. I would say that that's probably the primary impact. And if you were to think about it, I think the headline growth decline as a percentage is larger than the actual dollar impact on Verisk. The other thing we mentioned is with regards to that area, we're transitioning into more subscription-based revenues and I think that's really great both for us and for our customers. So in a moment in time, if you're going for more transaction and more subscription, the great thing about subscription is it's recognized over time. But in the moment, transaction is not there and subscription is only the portion of what you're going to recognize, you're going to see a little impact."

So it's kind of a natural sort of a development for newer kinds of solutions. And Eva was describing that with respect to some of which goes on, on the EH&S side.

In the second quarter, we delivered solid overall results, with total revenue growth of about 16%, adjusted EBITDA growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 1.4%, including the impact of the",585,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered solid overall results, with total revenue growth of about 16%, adjusted EBITDA growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 1.4%, including the impact of the shares we issued last year for the WoodMac transaction. Year-to-date, free cash flow was up 21%. 
Organic revenue growth was 5.4% as we continue to grow faster than our underlying end markets. We've spoken of higher, longer-term organic growth, and the underlying trends remain encouraging. Profitability remains strong with total EBITDA margins over 49%. 
We're focused on leveraging our Verisk's distinctives, which are: one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into customer workflows and our core capabilities to add value for our customers and in turn for our shareholders. We're also seeing traction in new solutions that are being developed and continue to be optimistic about their long-term potential to contribute to customers and, ultimately, our financial performance. 
As we announced in June, I'm excited to have expanded the roles of several members of our senior leadership team. Mark Anquillare, who had been our CFO since before our 2009 IPO, is now Verisk's Chief Operating Officer, with responsibility for our insurance businesses and our technology and customer experience organizations. Eva Huston is now our Chief Financial Officer, responsible for financial strategy, including accounting, tax, treasury and Investor Relations. I'm also pleased to have appointed Nana Banerjee and Steve Halliday as group presidents. Nana leads Argus, Geomni and Verisk Retail. Steve leads Wood Mackenzie, 3E Company and Verisk Maplecroft. 
The strength of our platform and the clarity of our vision, combined with greater scope of responsibility for these 4 proven professionals, will support our growth agenda and global push into the near and long term. These are all natural evolutions from their previous roles and will help us continue to deliver value to our customers, employees and shareholders. 
During the quarter, we closed the sale of the health care business and used the proceeds to pay down our revolver, giving us plenty of capacity to support our long-stated capital allocation strategy for a balanced approach over time to acquisitions and repurchases. We had $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of June 30, 2016. 
We remain active in evaluating possible acquisitions, in particular as we make buy versus build decisions in pursuit of our international expansion. We also see M&A as a channel for expanding our solution footprint. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, you saw that we purchased Greentech Media, an industry-leading information services provider for next-generation electricity and renewable sectors. Greentech Media joins WoodMac, enhancing our research and other capabilities for subsectors including solar generation, energy storage and smart grids that react dynamically to changes in supply and demand. These are very exciting areas in the energy and power markets and an excellent complement to our outstanding oil and gas franchise. 
I remain encouraged by the opportunities we see for growth both near and long term. We're excited about a number of early-stage efforts where we are developing new and innovative solutions for our customers and where we are expanding existing solutions around the world. Near term, we continue to expect acceleration of our combined insurance businesses and double-digit growth at Argus. WoodMac is performing in line with the expectations we discussed with you last quarter. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Mark for some additional comments."

Across our businesses, which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we have seen several key industry themes, including vertical big data, industry automation and digital engagement. With these themes in mind, I'll briefly describe a number of positive recent developments in our businesses. 
Reflecting on all 3 themes, Verisk Insurance Solutions launched a new integration option for 360Value, our web-based replacement cost estimator for homeowners' insurance. 360Value is built on our unique industry-standard construction materials and labor cost data. This solution helps our customers estimate coverage limits for residential, commercial and agricultural properties. Our customers can now integrate 360Value directly into their online homeowners' quoting platforms. This helps the industry deploy more engaging solutions, which include prefilling an online insurance application with property-specific information when a homeowner enters an address. 
Another recent launch is Mozart, a new product development platform, increasing engagement in automation, which helps our clients to easily research, create and distribute coverage language, providing efficiencies in time to market for new products and critical coverage updates. Mozart will help our customers accelerate profitable growth, reduce expense ratios and enhance audit and compliance.
Leveraging big data methods, cutting-edge technology and pioneering automation, AIR released a hosted cloud solution for its catastrophe risk management platforms, Touchstone and CATRADER. More than a dozen companies are already up and running on the AIR cloud, which enables them to conduct all of their analyses remotely while minimizing capital expenditures. 
Finally, in addition to the new deployment option, AIR recently expanded its coverage model of Southeast Asia. These models combine 10 years of extensive scientific research by AIR's scientists, with findings from studies of local building codes, damage surveys, loss experience data and structural engineering research. 
With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results in more detail."

In the second quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth going forward. Revenue grew 16.3% and 5.4% organically. EBITDA grew 12.4% to $245 million. EBITDA margins were 49.2% in the quarter. 
Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 23.5% and 5.5% organically. Financial services was the fastest-growing organic revenue end market, while insurance-focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to grow. Decision Analytics' insurance revenue grew 6.2% in the second quarter. The increase was led by strong growth in loss quantification and claims analytics solutions. Underwriting solutions also grew in the quarter. Our catastrophe modeling solutions saw a modest decline versus the prior year as a result of lower cat bond issuance and consulting revenues. Customer retention remains very high, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. 
Financial services revenue returned to strong growth, up 15.9% in the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the contributions from the media effectiveness solutions, which grew very well in the quarter. Our international revenue continues to grow nicely here as well, which does mean that FX may influence the reported results throughout the rest of the year. As Scott noted, we remain comfortable with double-digit growth based on accelerating growth in the second half of the year.
Energy and specialized markets' revenue grew 70.4%, including WoodMac, which was acquired in May 2015. In this year's second quarter, WoodMac revenue was around flat on a constant-currency basis. The decline in the British pound late in Q2 will have a larger effect on reported results starting in Q3, as the average Q2 rate was $1.43 and is currently in the low $1.30s. 
Organic revenue, excluding WoodMac, PCI and Infield, declined $2.4 million in the quarter. Services revenue peaked in the prior year as customers met 2015 compliance deadlines. We are also transitioning to a subscription revenue model, which is better for Verisk and better for our customers over the long term. The dollar impact remains small in relation to Verisk as a whole. 
Finally, as a reminder, WoodMac is organic starting in Q3. 
Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.5% and 5.3% on an organic basis, continuing to demonstrate the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Additionally, contribution to the new solutions that are in early stages and the inclusion of Risk Intelligence Ireland, which we have rebranded as Verisk Insurance Solutions Ireland, added growth. Industry-standard insurance programs' revenue grew 6.0%, reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions, such as predictive models and electronic rating content. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 3.8% in the quarter. Growth was led by an increase in commercial underwriting solutions' subscription revenue. 
EBITDA increased 12.4% in the quarter to $245 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 49.2%. Decision Analytics' EBITDA increased 20.8% to $141 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions and growth in our existing businesses. EBITDA and Risk Assessment increased 2.9% to $105 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management, offset in part by talent realignment initiatives we have been discussing with you. This resulted in moderated margins versus Q1 as the hiring started to take effect, as well as the impact of our annual merit increases.
We are very excited about the additions we've made to the team, and we look forward to their contributions over time. 
Reported interest expense was $31 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at June 30, 2016, after our repayments facilitated cash flow generation and the proceeds from the sale of the health care business. Our leverage at the end of the second quarter was about 2.2x pro forma for the health care divestiture, and we're pleased to have reached our target ahead of plan. We appreciate the support and confidence of our debt holders, as we acquired WoodMac with a goal of returning to the 2.5x steady-state leverage. 
Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 33.5%. 
Adjusted net income in 2Q increased 3.7% to $124 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully-diluted basis was $0.73 in the quarter, an increase of 1.4%. Adjusted EPS increased because of solid operations, both organic and acquired, and lower interest expense. The increases were partially offset by a higher fixed asset depreciation and amortization, only a partial quarter of WoodMac ownership in the prior period and an increase in shares outstanding related to the 2015 acquisition of WoodMac. We expect that our adjusted EPS growth will normalize over time to reflect similar trends you see in our underlying business results. 
The average diluted share count was 171.2 million shares in the quarter, and on June 30, 2016, our diluted share count was 171.4 million shares. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter, as we continue to balance our appetite for share repurchase with our desire to maintain flexibility for M&A. At June 30, 2016, we had about $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. 
Free cash flow increased 21.1% for the 6-month period to $305 million, including WoodMac. This represented 61.9% of EBITDA. These numbers are all for continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by greater profitability of our businesses and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and, therefore, shareholder value. 
Capital expenditures increased 4.6% to $52 million for the 6-month period ended June 30, 2016, due to the inclusion of WoodMac's CapEx for the full quarter. CapEx was 5.2% of revenue. We expect CapEx for the full year to be $150 million to $155 million pro forma for the divestiture of the health care business. We continue to manage our capital intensity to enable free cash flow growth. 
As you think about your models for 2016 on a continuing operations basis, we expect that based on current FX rates, there's about a $25 million impact full year revenue relative to where rates were at the start of 2016. This is up from our estimate last quarter of a $10 million impact. FX is a new factor as you think about our future growth, and we will look to provide more insight going forward to help you include it in your forecasting.
As you think about Q3, keep in mind that last year, EBITDA included a $15.6 million warrant sale gain, which will not recur this year. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we expect to have a onetime P&L charge of $19 million related to the ESOP. This is a nonrecurring item related to adjustments made to the ESOP at the time of the IPO, which will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. This does not affect the underlying business profitability, and we just want it to be on your radar ahead of time. 
For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx of $150 million to $155 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $132 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. We know these are items that are hard to project, which is why we share them with you each quarter. 
Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense after paying down the revolver with the divestiture proceeds to be around $120 million. We estimate the tax rate will be in the range of 32% to 33%. For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% to reflect the tax rate applicable to our intangible assets. 
And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases. 
Overall, we're working hard to execute on our 2016 plan and remain excited about the go-forward financial profile of the company. We're well positioned for profitable growth in the future and have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for continued long-term growth. 
We continue to appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up. 
And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions."

We'll come back to that true-up question, but the way that we observe our business, Tim, it's always really going through pipelines and conversion rates on renewable opportunities or new business opportunities. So it's very much a bottoms-up view. If I look across -- if I look across the insurance vertical, it's pretty broadly based in terms of our expectations for the latter half of the year. I wouldn't say that any one theme really stands out. We called out that in this quarter, some of the transaction-based business around the cat modeling space were soft. But overall, as we look at the latter half of 2016, it's really pretty broadly based across claims, underwriting, industry-standard solutions and catastrophe modeling. One perspective I thought I might just add here is if you just think about the -- kind of the world in which Verisk sits at the moment and you think about really exogenous factors, there's really 3 things that are kind of out there that are just sort of bubbling at the moment probably in order of importance when you think about Verisk outcomes overall. One would be that our customers in the oil and gas industry are under a lot of pressure at the moment because of where the commodity stands. We think that that's a moment-in-time effect. We don't predict the oil price, but we expect a more normalized environment. The second is that there hasn't been a lot of extreme event activity over the last couple of years, and that really tends to have 2 effects. Now I'm in the insurance vertical. That tends to have 2 effects. One is the reinsurance world has softened, the pricing has softened and there has been some consolidation. And so that works its way in a little bit. And then cat bond issuance has actually responded to that as well, the lack of extreme events. And as Eva said, we continue to get the overwhelming share of the cat bond activity. It's just that the absolute volumes have turned down there. We get asked a lot, by the way, whether overall premium progression in the insurance industry tends to affect us. And the answer is basically no because of the way that we contract with our customers. But when there is a sustained period of less extreme event activity, it actually -- it shows up a little bit because the underlying markets respond to that. And also, a few of the things that we do like repair cost estimating, there is an element of it which responds to the absolute number of claims, and when you have extreme events, you have more claims. And then the third thing is, as Eva was pointing out, in 2015, a lot of our environmental health and safety customers needed to really scramble to make sure that they were compliant with regulations that required compliance by the end of 2015. So there was a bit of surge of work in that regard. So you have kind of a moment-in-time effect, which is -- that was kind of powering the business up to 2015. That is also a part of the business, where when you look at subscription-based revenues, we're actually happy with what's happening. So I just thought I would throw out that perspective overall in the sense that on the one hand, I don't really think our business is that affected by what's happening in the outside world, but it's not as if we're totally immune and probably all the dials are pointed in the wrong direction just at this moment, and yet, the performance of our company is good. I'm really happy with it. So then, Mark, did you want to just take on the...?"

And so the kind of talent that we brought in with respect to topics like -- and all of these relate to the insurance world: cyber, internet of things, the linkage between the energy ecosystem and the insurance world, et cetera.

And so when we don't have that come through, that can have some impact on the margin in the moment. I would also point out to you, I mentioned in my comments FX, and FX can have some impact on margin as well. Revenue and expense, we try to have those mostly aligned, but they're not always perfectly aligned."

The second point I would make is that we're very excited about Greentech Media because of the depth of the expertise there with respect to solar and smart grids and grid edge technologies, and storage technologies. And we -- what we're finding is that our existing hydrocarbon-based customers are increasingly interested in the alternatives. And so not only is it, in a sense, new business for us, the degree to which we're now looking specifically at the dynamics of what's going on in solar generation, specifically in terms of what's going on with respect to grid edge effects, not only is it new business, but it also actually makes us a more compelling partner for our existing customers in the hydrocarbon ecosystem. So there's -- we're really excited about it. We think that it's really going to be helpful. And then I think overall, you were just kind of looking for what's the broader profile. Well, I'd make a couple of comments. One is there have been some very large trades in the oil and gas space, and we didn't participate, as you saw. And we continue to ask questions about what strategically would advantage this business the most, but we're certainly not enamored of the thought of large deals. And a lot of it is we're going to make the business that we have run well. I think that, again, kind of around the edges, we will try to support that which we already do and there will be opportunities that are kind of thematic in the way that, say, Greentech is thematic."

I would say insurance and Decision Analytics looks fairly similar to the rest of Decision Analytics now, now that we don't have that highly transactional difference in health care in there anymore. There's more uniformity across that. So I think that we love where we sit. We've always thought it was natural to have some amount of nonsubscription revenue.

So let me just quickly highlight the fact that we continue to improve the suite of Xactware solutions. Our vision and our focus for this year and next is to bring out what I'll refer to as a more integrated solution, which brings together Xactimate that's used in probably about 85% of the property repair cost estimates across the United States, in combination with XactAnalysis, which is the BI tool and everything around it, so that you can work and use your back office in an efficient way. In addition, Contents, which represents all of the information about pricing materials inside the home to replace TV, couches, rugs and things. So our focus make it more integrated, easier to use, more focused on the claim as opposed to the assignment, which is who's doing the work, but more on the claim. All of that has been kind of a focus from a customer perspective and our perspective to achieve those things. Very much in our forward vision is to take that solution, that more simplified solution and bring it to global -- the global insurance market, customizing it in a way that it's fit for use in that market. And we've put a lot of time and resource and are making progress there. The final component to this is we are seeing a lot of activity in the U.S. market, where people are interested in trying to make access to the quote engine, you know, coming -- getting -- going online and getting quote for auto and home, more and more interactive with the customer and our ability to help our customers do that through the enhancement of 360Value. But you, as a homeowner, go online to make sure you have the proper coverage for your home. That's valuable. That's helpful, and it's easy. You have the policyholder or the person who is getting quote do it themselves, and that's the type of innovation we want to work with and help our customers with their customers. Last piece, as we think about this bringing it together, we are finding increased interest in basically the whole property suite of solutions as we go overseas. So we kind of led in with the claim side of things, but clearly, people are looking for information about large commercial buildings. So replicating some of the things we do here in the United States, using both remote sensing and aerial imageries, providing with insights into risk about a building and helping them understand what the insurance to value is, meaning, what's the replacement cost if there was a total loss. And all of those themes, I think, we're trying to be more comprehensive, more seamless, both internationally and that will obviously revert back with our U.S. customers as well. So I probably said a lot, but I want to make sure I responded to some of the questions."

Post the sale of health care, you have more subscription revenue, more visibility on cash flow. You indicated a preference for small, tuck-in, data-oriented acquisitions. I guess 2 questions.

I mean, all good -- all good topics. So maybe back to the top. If you look at our company over extended periods of time, the program of acquisition and the share repurchase program have both done very well for our shareholders, both have done very well. And there's really nothing in our situation that would cause us to think that anything fundamentally is going to be different in the future than in the past. You actually pointed out one of the features of our company, which is that the cash flow visibility is, if anything, even greater than it was. So we would continue to see both of those as real pillars inside of the way that we do what we do. And so at any given moment, this moment, for example, we're always taking stock of where we stand in the M&A pipeline and how imminent we think good opportunities are. And we remain very interested in deploying capital in terms of returning it to shareholders when we feel that the -- sort of that which is right at the head of the pipeline and the size is such that we still have capacity. And I would say that we do have -- we have capacity as we sit here. So we're very alert to the application of capital and will remain so. And that's a statement for the third quarter and the fourth quarter and really forever. I actually thought your second question, Dave, was going to be different, more about sort of a higher leverage target rather than a dividend. We're very interested in returning capital to shareholders I guess is the way that I would put it. Our analysis to date has not indicated that there's anything fundamentally superior about doing it in the form of a dividend versus the buyback program that we've had. So that's kind of where we sit with that thought at the moment. By the way, even David and I and Mark and all us that are out there talking to investors, we actually ask that question all the time: how do you feel about it? And so we remain open to the conversation, but I would say that we haven't drawn the conclusion that a dividend is a superior way of expressing our commitment to returning capital to shareholders."

I think if you take WoodMac, PCI and Infield out of specialized, so those are all inorganic in the quarter, you primarily have our environmental health and safety solutions and some of our weather solutions. We referenced in the press release and on the call, when you think about EH&S, there were some global standards that went into place in 2015, which gave us the opportunity to serve our customers and making those transitions. Those transitions are complete, and so you'll kind of see a normalization of that type of work this year, which is leading to the organic result of a decline there. I would say that that's probably the primary impact. And if you were to think about it, I think the headline growth decline as a percentage is larger than the actual dollar impact on Verisk. The other thing we mentioned is with regards to that area we are transitioning into more subscription-based revenues. And I think that's really great both for us and for our customers. So in a moment in time, if you're going from more transactional to more subscription, the great thing about subscription is it's recognized over time. But in the moment, transaction is not there and subscription is only the portion of what you're going to recognize, you're going to see a little impact."

In the second quarter, we delivered solid overall results, with total revenue growth of about 16%, adjusted EBITDA growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 1.4%, including the impact of the shares we issued last year for the WoodMac transaction. Year-to-date, free cash flow was up 21%. 
Organic revenue growth was 5.4% as we continue to grow faster than our underlying end markets. We've spoken of higher, longer-term organic growth, and the underlying trends remain encouraging. Profitability remains strong with total EBITDA margins over 49%. 
We're focused on leveraging our Verisk's distinctives, which are: one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into customer workflows and our core capabilities to add value for our customers and in turn for our shareholders. We're also seeing traction in new solutions that are being developed and continue to be optimistic about their long-term potential to contribute to customers and, ultimately, our financial performance. 
As we announced in June, I'm excited to have expanded the roles of several members of our senior leadership team. Mark Anquillare, who had been our CFO since before our 2009 IPO, is now Verisk's Chief Operating Officer, with responsibility for our insurance businesses and our technology and customer experience organizations. Eva Huston is now our Chief Financial Officer, responsible for financial strategy, including accounting, tax, treasury and Investor Relations. I'm also pleased to have appointed Nana Banerjee and Steve Halliday as group presidents. Nana leads Argus, Geomni and Verisk Retail. Steve leads Wood Mackenzie, 3E Company and Verisk Maplecroft. 
The strength of our platform and the clarity of our vision, combined with greater scope of responsibility for these 4 proven professionals, will support our growth agenda and global push into the near and long term. These are all natural evolutions from their previous roles and will help us continue to deliver value to our customers, employees and shareholders. 
During the quarter, we closed the sale of the health care business and used the proceeds to pay down our revolver, giving us plenty of capacity to support our long-stated capital allocation strategy for a balanced approach over time to acquisitions and repurchases. We had $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of June 30, 2016. 
We remain active in evaluating possible acquisitions, in particular as we make buy versus build decisions in pursuit of our international expansion. We also see M&A as a channel for expanding our solution footprint. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, you saw that we purchased Greentech Media, an industry-leading information services provider for next-generation electricity and renewable sectors. Greentech Media joins WoodMac, enhancing our research and other capabilities for subsectors including solar generation, energy storage and smart grids that react dynamically to changes in supply and demand. These are very exciting areas in the energy and power markets and an excellent complement to our outstanding oil and gas franchise. 
I remain encouraged by the opportunities we see for growth both near and long term. We're excited about a number of early-stage efforts where we are developing new and innovative solutions for our customers and where we are expanding existing solutions around the world. Near term, we continue to expect acceleration of our combined insurance businesses and double-digit growth at Argus. WoodMac is performing in line with the expectations we discussed with you last quarter. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Mark for some additional comments."

Across our businesses, which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we have seen several key industry themes, including vertical big data, industry automation and digital engagement. With these themes in mind, I'll briefly describe a number of positive recent developments in our businesses. 
Reflecting on all 3 themes, Verisk Insurance Solutions launched a new integration option for 360Value, our web-based replacement cost estimator for homeowners' insurance. 360Value is built on our unique industry-standard construction materials and labor cost data. This solution helps our customers estimate coverage limits for residential, commercial and agricultural properties. Our customers can now integrate 360Value directly into their online homeowners' quoting platforms. This helps the industry deploy more engaging solutions, which include prefilling an online insurance application with property-specific information when a homeowner enters an address. 
Another recent launch is Mozart, a new product development platform, increasing engagement in automation, which helps our clients to easily research, create and distribute coverage language, providing efficiencies in time to market for new products and critical coverage updates. Mozart will help our customers accelerate profitable growth, reduce expense ratios and enhance audit and compliance.
Leveraging big data methods, cutting-edge technology and pioneering automation, AIR released a hosted cloud solution for its catastrophe risk management platforms, Touchstone and CATRADER. More than a dozen companies are already up and running on the AIR cloud, which enables them to conduct all of their analyses remotely while minimizing capital expenditures. 
Finally, in addition to the new deployment option, AIR recently expanded its coverage model of Southeast Asia. These models combine 10 years of extensive scientific research by AIR's scientists, with findings from studies of local building codes, damage surveys, loss experience data and structural engineering research. 
With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results in more detail."

In the second quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth going forward. Revenue grew 16.3% and 5.4% organically. EBITDA grew 12.4% to $245 million. EBITDA margins were 49.2% in the quarter. 
Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 23.5% and 5.5% organically. Financial services was the fastest-growing organic revenue end market, while insurance-focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to grow. Decision Analytics' insurance revenue grew 6.2% in the second quarter. The increase was led by strong growth in loss quantification and claims analytics solutions. Underwriting solutions also grew in the quarter. Our catastrophe modeling solutions saw a modest decline versus the prior year as a result of lower cat bond issuance and consulting revenues. Customer retention remains very high, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. 
Financial services revenue returned to strong growth, up 15.9% in the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the contributions from the media effectiveness solutions, which grew very well in the quarter. Our international revenue continues to grow nicely here as well, which does mean that FX may influence the reported results throughout the rest of the year. As Scott noted, we remain comfortable with double-digit growth based on accelerating growth in the second half of the year.
Energy and specialized markets' revenue grew 70.4%, including WoodMac, which was acquired in May 2015. In this year's second quarter, WoodMac revenue was around flat on a constant currency basis. The decline in the British pound late in Q2 will have a larger effect on reported results starting in Q3, as the average Q2 rate was $1.43 and is currently in the low $1.30s. 
Organic revenue, excluding WoodMac, PCI and Infield, declined $2.4 million in the quarter. Services revenue peaked in the prior year as customers met 2015 compliance deadlines. We are also transitioning to a subscription revenue model, which is better for Verisk and better for our customers over the long term. The dollar impact remains small in relation to Verisk as a whole. 
Finally, as a reminder, WoodMac is organic starting in Q3. 
Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.5% and 5.3% on an organic basis, continuing to demonstrate the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Additionally, contribution to the new solutions that are in early stages and the inclusion of Risk Intelligence Ireland, which we have rebranded as Verisk Insurance Solutions Ireland, added growth. Industry-standard insurance programs' revenue grew 6.0%, reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions, such as predictive models and electronic rating content. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 3.8% in the quarter. Growth was led by an increase in commercial underwriting solutions' subscription revenue. 
EBITDA increased 12.4% in the quarter to $245 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 49.2%. Decision Analytics' EBITDA increased 20.8% to $141 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions and growth in our existing businesses. EBITDA and Risk Assessment increased 2.9% to $105 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management, offset in part by talent realignment initiatives we have been discussing with you. This resulted in moderated margins versus Q1 as the hiring started to take effect, as well as the impact of our annual merit increases.
We are very excited about the additions we've made to the team, and we look forward to their contributions over time. 
Reported interest expense was $31 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at June 30, 2016, after our repayments facilitated cash flow generation and the proceeds from the sale of the health care business. Our leverage at the end of the second quarter was about 2.2x pro forma for the health care divestiture, and we're pleased to have reached our target ahead of plan. We appreciate the support and confidence of our debt holders, as we acquired WoodMac with a goal of returning to the 2.5x steady-state leverage. 
Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 33.5%. 
Adjusted net income in 2Q increased 3.7% to $124 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.73 in the quarter, an increase of 1.4%. Adjusted EPS increased because of solid operations, both organic and acquired, and lower interest expense. The increases were partially offset by a higher fixed asset depreciation and amortization, only a partial quarter of WoodMac ownership in the prior period and an increase in shares outstanding related to the 2015 acquisition of WoodMac. We expect that our adjusted EPS growth will normalize over time to reflect similar trends you see in our underlying business results. 
The average diluted share count was 171.2 million shares in the quarter, and on June 30, 2016, our diluted share count was 171.4 million shares. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter, as we continue to balance our appetite for share repurchase with our desire to maintain flexibility for M&A. At June 30, 2016, we had about $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. 
Free cash flow increased 21.1% for the 6-month period to $305 million, including WoodMac. This represented 61.9% of EBITDA. These numbers are all for continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by greater profitability of our businesses and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and, therefore, shareholder value. 
Capital expenditures increased 4.6% to $52 million for the 6-month period ended June 30, 2016, due to the inclusion of WoodMac's CapEx for the full quarter. CapEx was 5.2% of revenue. We expect CapEx for the full year to be $150 million to $155 million pro forma for the divestiture of the health care business. We continue to manage our capital intensity to enable free cash flow growth. 
As you think about your models for 2016 on a continuing operations basis, we expect that based on current FX rates, there's about a $25 million impact full year revenue relative to where rates were at the start of 2016. This is up from our estimate last quarter of a $10 million impact. FX is a new factor as you think about our future growth, and we will look to provide more insight going forward to help you include it in your forecasting.
As you think about Q3, keep in mind that last year, EBITDA included a $15.6 million warrant sale gain, which will not recur this year. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we expect to have a onetime P&L charge of $19 million related to the ESOP. This is a nonrecurring item related to adjustments made to the ESOP at the time of the IPO, which will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. This does not affect the underlying business profitability, and we just want it to be on your radar ahead of time. 
For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx of $150 million to $155 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $132 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. We know these are items that are hard to project, which is why we share them with you each quarter. 
Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense after paying down the revolver with the divestiture proceeds to be around $120 million. We estimate the tax rate will be in the range of 32% to 33%. For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% to reflect the tax rate applicable to our intangible assets. 
And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases. 
Overall, we're working hard to execute on our 2016 plan and remain excited about the go-forward financial profile of the company. We're well positioned for profitable growth in the future and have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for continued long-term growth. 
We continue to appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up. 
And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions."

We'll come back to that true-up question, but the way that we observe our business, Tim, it's always really going through pipelines and conversion rates on renewable opportunities or new business opportunities. So it's very much a bottoms-up view. If I look across -- if I look across the insurance vertical, it's pretty broadly based in terms of our expectations for the latter half of the year. I wouldn't say that any one theme really stands out. We called out that in this quarter, some of the transaction-based business around the cat modeling space were soft. But overall, as we look at the latter half of 2016, it's really pretty broadly based across claims, underwriting, industry-standard solutions and catastrophe modeling. One perspective I thought I might just add here is if you just think about the -- kind of the world in which Verisk sits at the moment and you think about really exogenous factors, there's really 3 things that are kind of out there that are just sort of bubbling at the moment probably in order of importance when you think about Verisk outcomes overall. One would be that our customers in the oil and gas industry are under a lot of pressure at the moment because of where the commodity stands. We think that that's a moment-in-time effect. We don't predict the oil price, but we expect a more normalized environment. The second is that there hasn't been a lot of extreme event activity over the last couple of years, and that really tends to have 2 effects. Now I'm in the insurance vertical. That tends to have 2 effects. One is the reinsurance world has softened, the pricing has softened and there has been some consolidation. And so that works its way in a little bit. And then cat bond issuance has actually responded to that as well, the lack of extreme events. And as Eva said, we continue to get the overwhelming share of the cat bond activity. It's just that the absolute volumes have turned down there. We get asked a lot, by the way, whether overall premium progression in the insurance industry tends to affect us. And the answer is basically no because of the way that we contract with our customers. But when there is a sustained period of less extreme event activity, it actually -- it shows up a little bit because the underlying markets respond to that. And also, a few of the things that we do like repair cost estimating, there is an element of it which responds to the absolute number of claims, and when you have extreme events, you have more claims. And then the third thing is, as Eva was pointing out, in 2015, a lot of our environmental health and safety customers needed to really scramble to make sure that they were compliant with regulations that required compliance by the end of 2015. So there was a bit of surge of work in that regard. So you have kind of a moment-in-time effect, which is -- that was kind of powering the business up to 2015. That is also a part of the business, where when you look at subscription-based revenues, we're actually happy with what's happening. So I just thought I would throw out that perspective overall in the sense that on the one hand, I don't really think our business is that affected by what's happening in the outside world, but it's not as if we're totally immune and probably all the dials are pointed in the wrong direction just at this moment, and yet, the performance of our company is good. I'm really happy with it. So then, Mark, did you want to just take on the...?"

Are you going to continue to invest? And we're very confident in this business and so we have continued to invest knowing that at this moment in time, we have the kinds of just macro factors that I talked about before. Specifically, with respect to ISO Solutions, we are very interested in amplifying what it is that we do there. And so the kind of talent that we brought in with respect to topics like -- and all of these relate to the insurance world: cyber, internet of things, the linkage between the energy ecosystem and the insurance world, et cetera. We've really created a substantially new talent base that we just didn't have before. Also, resilience issues as they relate to extreme events and I could go on. We're excited to have -- we're excited to have this new talent inside of the organization.

I think if you look back historically, you would see that as well. With regards to Decision Analytics, one, I would just point out that the nonsubs revenue that we've been talking about a bit, actually unlike some of the historical transactional revenue that we used to have in businesses we no longer own, that's actually pretty high-margin business. And so when we don't have that come through, that can have some impact on the margin in the moment.

That mix, I would say, is working and has helped us to take all of the great image analytics technology that we've got and basically make that more active, particularly in the insurance vertical today. That's really where it's happening today. And we continue to ask questions about how we can be more in control of a larger set of images that are optimized for the use cases that we have in mind, and we're working actively on that right now. So the report, Jeff, would be that commercially, we're succeeding with what we're doing in the imaging space. And we continue to think deeply about additional things that would help us to be more in control of a larger set of images."

So part of what we've done on the M&A front has been what I would consider to be small and tuck-in and really about trying to give ourselves additional distinctive data assets. That, for example, was the Infield acquisition. So that's sort of point one. The second point I would make is that we're very excited about Greentech Media because of the depth of the expertise there with respect to solar and smart grids and grid edge technologies, and storage technologies. And we -- what we're finding is that our existing hydrocarbon-based customers are increasingly interested in the alternatives. And so not only is it, in a sense, new business for us, the degree to which we're now looking specifically at the dynamics of what's going on in solar generation, specifically in terms of what's going on with respect to grid edge effects, not only is it new business, but it also actually makes us a more compelling partner for our existing customers in the hydrocarbon ecosystem. So there's -- we're really excited about it. We think that it's really going to be helpful. And then I think overall, you were just kind of looking for what's the broader profile. Well, I'd make a couple of comments. One is there have been some very large trades in the oil and gas space, and we didn't participate, as you saw. And we continue to ask questions about what strategically would advantage this business the most, but we're certainly not enamored of the thought of large deals. And a lot of it is we're going to make the business that we have run well. I think that, again, kind of around the edges, we will try to support that which we already do and there will be opportunities that are kind of thematic in the way that, say, Greentech is thematic."

If you were to think about Decision Analytics overall, the mix between subscription and nonsubscription, it's about 77% subscription. I would say insurance and Decision Analytics looks fairly similar to the rest of Decision Analytics now, now that we don't have that highly transactional difference in health care in there anymore. There's more uniformity across that. So I think that we love where we sit. We've always thought it was natural to have some amount of nonsubscription revenue.

So let me just quickly highlight the fact that we continue to improve the suite of Xactware solutions. Our vision and our focus for this year and next is to bring out what I'll refer to as a more integrated solution, which brings together Xactimate that's used in probably about 85% of the property repair cost estimates across the United States, in combination with XactAnalysis, which is the BI tool and everything around it, so that you can work and use your back office in an efficient way. In addition, Contents, which represents all of the information about pricing materials inside the home to replace TV, couches, rugs and things. So our focus make it more integrated, easier to use, more focused on the claim as opposed to the assignment, which is who's doing the work, but more on the claim. All of that has been kind of a focus from a customer perspective and our perspective to achieve those things. Very much in our forward vision is to take that solution, that more simplified solution and bring it to global -- the global insurance market, customizing it in a way that it's fit for use in that market. And we've put a lot of time and resource and are making progress there. The final component to this is we are seeing a lot of activity in the U.S. market, where people are interested in trying to make access to the quote engine, you know, coming -- getting -- going online and getting quote for auto and home, more and more interactive with the customer and our ability to help our customers do that through the enhancement of 360Value. But you, as a homeowner, go online to make sure you have the proper coverage for your home. That's valuable. That's helpful, and it's easy. You have the policyholder or the person who is getting quote do it themselves, and that's the type of innovation we want to work with and help our customers with their customers. Last piece, as we think about this bringing it together, we are finding increased interest in basically the whole property suite of solutions as we go overseas. So we kind of led in with the claim side of things, but clearly, people are looking for information about large commercial buildings. So replicating some of the things we do here in the United States, using both remote sensing and aerial imageries, providing with insights into risk about a building and helping them understand what the insurance to value is, meaning, what's the replacement cost if there was a total loss. And all of those themes, I think, we're trying to be more comprehensive, more seamless, both internationally and that will obviously revert back with our U.S. customers as well. So I probably said a lot, but I want to make sure I responded to some of the questions."

Post the sale of health care, you have more subscription revenue, more visibility on cash flow. You indicated a preference for small, tuck-in, data-oriented acquisitions. I guess 2 questions. First, how do you think about opportunities in the acquisition pipeline versus share repurchase given the current price of your stock? And then secondly, with the higher subscription base revenue, more visible cash flow, higher margin profile, how do you think about the possibility of initiating a dividend?"

I mean, all good -- all good topics. So maybe back to the top. If you look at our company over extended periods of time, the program of acquisition and the share repurchase program have both done very well for our shareholders, both have done very well. And there's really nothing in our situation that would cause us to think that anything fundamentally is going to be different in the future than in the past. You actually pointed out one of the features of our company, which is that the cash flow visibility is, if anything, even greater than it was. So we would continue to see both of those as real pillars inside of the way that we do what we do. And so at any given moment, this moment, for example, we're always taking stock of where we stand in the M&A pipeline and how imminent we think good opportunities are. And we remain very interested in deploying capital in terms of returning it to shareholders when we feel that the -- sort of that which is right at the head of the pipeline and the size is such that we still have capacity. And I would say that we do have -- we have capacity as we sit here. So we're very alert to the application of capital and will remain so. And that's a statement for the third quarter and the fourth quarter and really forever. I actually thought your second question, Dave, was going to be different, more about sort of a higher leverage target rather than a dividend. We're very interested in returning capital to shareholders I guess is the way that I would put it. Our analysis to date has not indicated that there's anything fundamentally superior about doing it in the form of a dividend versus the buyback program that we've had. So that's kind of where we sit with that thought at the moment. By the way, even David and I and Mark and all us that are out there talking to investors, we actually ask that question all the time: how do you feel about it? And so we remain open to the conversation, but I would say that we haven't drawn the conclusion that a dividend is a superior way of expressing our commitment to returning capital to shareholders."

I think if you take WoodMac, PCI and Infield out of specialized, so those are all inorganic in the quarter, you primarily have our environmental health and safety solutions and some of our weather solutions. We referenced in the press release and on the call, when you think about EH&S, there were some global standards that went into place in 2015, which gave us the opportunity to serve our customers and making those transitions. Those transitions are complete, and so you'll kind of see a normalization of that type of work this year, which is leading to the organic result of a decline there. I would say that that's probably the primary impact. And if you were to think about it, I think the headline growth decline as a percentage is larger than the actual dollar impact on Verisk. The other thing we mentioned is with regards to that area we are transitioning into more subscription-based revenues. And I think that's really great both for us and for our customers. So in a moment in time, if you're going from more transactional to more subscription, the great thing about subscription is it's recognized over time. But in the moment, transaction is not there and subscription is only the portion of what you're going to recognize, you're going to see a little impact."

In the third quarter, we delivered solid overall results, with total and organic constant-currency revenue growth of around 6% as we continue to grow faster than our end markets. With almost 8% growth from our combined insurance and financial services businesses, the long-term underlying trends remain encouraging. 
Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins of around 51%. Adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding the prior year warrant sale gain, was around 6%. Diluted adjusted EPS grew about 8% and about 17%, excluding the warrant gain. Year-to-date free cash flow is up 13%, excluding the tax on the gain from the healthcare business sale. 
We were pleased to resume returning capital to our shareholders through our long-standing share repurchase program. We bought $73 million of stock in the quarter, and we had $280 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of September 30, 2016. 
With our leverage back below our 2.5x reference level, we have plenty of capacity for strategically relevant tuck-in acquisitions as well as additional repurchases. We remain active in evaluating possible acquisitions, in particular as we make buy-versus-build decisions in pursuit of our international expansion and vertical enhancement. Analyze Re is a great example, where we found a high-performance analytics capability that complements the Touchstone platform at AIR. While the deal only closed last week, the teams are already working on integration and go-to-market strategies. 
We continue to make progress enhancing the Verisk distinctives of: one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into customer workflows. Consistent with our efforts, Verisk was recently ranked in the top 20 on Forbes Magazine's 2016 list of The World's Most Innovative Companies. Our success is due to the outstanding efforts of our people, including those who have joined us relatively recently. And I'm very encouraged by the growing enthusiasm across the company to serve our customers with innovative data analytics solutions. We see a direct relationship between the excellence of our employees and our commitment to creating innovative solutions for our customers. 
We remain confident in our double-digit growth forecast for financial services this year, and we still continue to expect WoodMac to be around flat in constant currency. 
In pursuit of our goal of insurance growth above the 2015 run rate, we are pleased with new contract signings and the performance of several newer, more innovative solutions. As you know, there's been some softness in the reinsurance market, and 2016 has been an extremely quiet storm season. In addition, a handful of customers have signed contracts, as expected, but the related implementations are starting a bit later than originally planned. While timing is a factor as we cross the 2016 finish line, we continue to feel very good about the quality of our data assets. Our customers' regard for us is higher than ever, according to our NPS methodology, and the long-term outlook is for continued revenue growth. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark who will make some additional comments."
1027055,405244066,1069648,"Verisk Analytics, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott.

Across our businesses which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we have several key industry themes, including vertical big data, industry automation and digital engagement. With these themes in mind, I'll highlight a number of positive recent developments. 
In the vertical big data area, we launched a new energy insurance group focused on transforming risk assessment, rating and risk modeling for the oil and gas, petrochemicals, power generation and metals and mining industries. The group is drawing on deep domain expertise and proprietary data from our ISO, AIR and WoodMac businesses. The data analytics solutions will help global property and casualty insurance evaluate and select risk and manage portfolios based upon energy and insurance industrywide data rather than relying solely on their own experience, data sets and tools. We are uniquely positioned to be the first to market at innovating at the intersection of insurance and energy sectors. 
One of our industry automation solutions saw a win as [ph] the leading insurer expanded [ph] its use of A-PLUS, Verisk's loss history solution, conduct loss history evaluation at the beginning rather than after the core process. This change in workflow will enhance the experience of their customers while improving operational and sales efficiencies. Improving conversion rates through better customer experiences, while keeping expenses flat and maintaining underwriting integrity, is a forward-thinking, innovative approach to profitable growth. 
We continue to perform well in the cat modeling space. As an example, we were very pleased when a leading global player decided to select AIR's Touchstone platform as its primary modeling solution, along with the complete suite of AIR's global catastrophe models. Their decision was informed by, in their words, ""AIR's detailed loss modeling capabilities and superior service."" This follows the June 2016 release of Touchstone 4.0, which features a variety of enhancements designed to improve performance, workflow automation and efficiency and the overall user experience. 
Finally, we continue to improve digital engagement in the P&C industry through the availability of circular authority for insurance. This is a cloud-based analytics solution designed to help insurers better manage ISO content with tools to visualize, compare and analyze updates. The solution helps insurers plan, implement and track our filings with state regulators and stay informed on the latest insurance topics. This is a natural extension to the thousands of insurance program updates we issue each year, and we're confident that it will add value and functionality for our customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results."
1027055,405244066,1069648,"Verisk Analytics, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. In the third quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth in the future.

In the third quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth in the future. 
Revenue grew 5.9% and 6.2% on an organic constant currency basis. Our combined insurance and financial services businesses grew 7.7% in the quarter. EBITDA grew 5.9% to $253 million.  This growth excludes the prior period gain on sale of warrants. EBITDA margins were 50.9% in the quarter. 
Within Decision Analytics, revenue grew 6.2% and 6.9% on an organic constant currency basis. Again, this quarter, financial services was the fastest-growing vertical while insurance-focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to growth. 
Decision Analytics' insurance revenue grew 7.4% in the third quarter. We saw solid growth in underwriting, claims analytics and catastrophe modeling solutions. Loss quantification solutions also contributed to growth in the quarter. 
Customer retention remains very high, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. 
Financial services revenue increased 24.5% in the quarter, led by growth in analytical solutions and media effectiveness. We are seeing good interest in the solutions we are building with our partners and continue to believe that our differentiated data assets position us well to execute on our plans in this vertical. 
As reported, energy and specialized markets revenue was about flat. The continued weakness in the British pound remains a headwind to both revenue growth and Decision Analytics margins on a reported basis. Consistent with our long-standing approach, WoodMac became a part of organic growth starting in the third quarter. Organic revenue, which excludes PCI, Infield, Greentech and Quest, declined $5.3 million in the quarter but increased slightly, excluding the impact of FX. 
Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.3% and 5% on an organic basis, continuing to demonstrate the value of our long -- to our long-standing insurance customers. [ph], contributions in the [ph] solutions that are in early stages and the inclusion of Risk Intelligence Ireland, which we have rebranded as Verisk Insurance Solutions - Ireland. 
Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.4%, reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions, such as predictive model and electronic rating content. 
Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 4.8% in the quarter. Growth was led by an increase in commercial underwriting solutions subscription revenue. 
EBITDA decreased 0.6% in the quarter to $253 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.9%. EBITDA growth, adjusted for the 2015 gain on sale of warrants, was 5.9%. EBITDA excludes a third quarter 2016 severance charge as we combined administrative functions following the WoodMac integration. It also excludes the gain on an investment in a company which was acquired by a third party. 
Decision Analytics EBITDA, excluding the prior year gain, grew 7.3% to $147 million in the quarter. Decision Analytics EBITDA, as reported, decreased 3.7%. 
EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 4% to $106 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management, offset by increased staff levels following the previously announced talent realignment. 
Reported interest expense was $28 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at September 30, 2016. After using our proceeds from the healthcare divestiture to pay down debt, our pro forma leverage at the end of the third quarter was about 2.2x, below our 2.5x reference level. 
Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 26%. We saw a onetime benefit in the quarter from a change in the tax rates in the U.K. 
Adjusted net income in 3Q increased 8.1% to $144 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.84 in the quarter, an increase of 7.7%. Adjusted EPS increased because of solid operations, both organic and acquired, lower interest expense and lower taxes. The increases were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense and the 2015 warrant sale gain, which did not recur this year. Excluding the 2015 warrant gain, adjusted EPS grew 16.9%. 
The average diluted share count was 171.8 million shares in the quarter. On September 30, 2016, our diluted share count was 171 million shares. We repurchased 900,000 shares at an average price of $81.72 for a total cost of $73 million in the quarter. At September 30, we had about $280 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. 
Free cash flow increased 12.8% to $429 million for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2016, excluding the $75 million tax on the gain of the sale of the healthcare business. Free cash flow, excluding the tax, was 57.4% of EBITDA. These numbers are all [ph] continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by greater profitability of our businesses, the addition of WoodMac and lower CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and therefore shareholder value. 
Capital expenditures increased 0.8% to $88 million for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2016. And we continue to balance the capital intensity of the business with investing for future growth. CapEx was 5.9% of revenue year-to-date. We expect for the full year our CapEx will be about $10 million lower than we previously discussed as we manage efficiencies across our hardware and software spend, even while developing more software for solution delivery. 
As you think about your models for the remainder of 2016 on a continuing operations basis, please remember that in the fourth quarter, we expect to have a onetime P&L charge of $19 million [ph] related to the ESOP. This is a nonrecurring item related to adjustments made to the ESOP at the time of the IPO and will exclude -- be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. This does not affect the underlying business profitability, and we just want it to be on your radar ahead of time. This is really the final item that will be associated with ESOP adjustments. 
For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx from continuing operations of $140 million to $145 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $125 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. 
Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $120 million for the full year, and we estimate the tax rate to be around 31% for the full year. For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% to reflect the tax rates applicable to our intangible assets. 
And finally, we expect a full year diluted weighted average share count of about 171.6 million shares before incremental repurchases. 
We are executing on our 2016 plan despite larger-than-expected currency headwinds and are actively engaged in planning for the future. We're excited about the opportunities we see for profitable growth and remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investments for the long term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions]

And basically -- and actually, I mentioned 2 things that are in the environment right now. The other is it's a very quiet storm season, and in fact, it has been a quiet storm season for the last several years. And that does interact with the way that the reinsurance market behaves. And so there have been some combinations in the reinsurance world, including the brokers. And so you have that in the environment. So it's in there. It's a factor, but the business -- our insurance business overall is really good. And even yesterday, we had a visit from folks from an extremely prominent global, nondomestic insurance organization, and they were essentially asking how could they get closer to more of our solutions.

They would really like to, for the most part, not touch life [ph] claims, which would save them money and actually improve their own relationship with customers. So I'm not sure we've been able to quantify TAM for all of that, but let me just describe to you some of the bigger things that we think are important. One we highlighted here, if you underwrite a claim -- excuse me, generate a risk, you have a lot of information that is necessary to underwrite that risk. We want to take and move that to the front end. We want to do that upfront so the people can be quoting with all that information in mind. And I think that's a big opportunity. I think the other opportunity we highlighted here was energy. So bringing together the big data kind of [ph] world of what we do with WoodMac and the information we have with WoodMac and what when [ph] we do with [ph] insurance, we have found, or at least we think, that the energy market is a little bit more specialized, it's a little bit the expertise of players in it, and they really have never had looked at views [ph] into a pricing or a risk assessment approach that we would do in traditional limited insurance. So this is more of an E&S-type asset. It's excess and surplus. It's big players across the world, and we think this is a, I would say, probably tens of millions type of TAM, if not larger."

And as Scott highlighted, it's become very much a priority over the last couple of years. There's 2 things I think we're doing well. There's a couple of places, particularly on the claims side of things, where we have a customer, they're using us in a geography -- let's use the U.K. as an example. They like the results they've gotten. We're able to demonstrate strong ROI, and that large global insurer takes us from the U.K. to other geographies. And ultimately, I think what the plan would be to implement across all of their operations. Once we get into another geography and we customize for that geography, one of the things we always have to identify and understand is the insurance markets are very different. So we have to locally customize the software. And that's true of things we've been trying to do and put in place so that we can then extend out and beyond the one customer into many. There's other places -- kind of the second tack we've taken is we know markets that look and feel a lot like the U.S. market. It has maybe not the same regulation, but it has the same kind of nature of transfer risk. And we're good and knowledgeable that [ph] we can help them. And to the extent that is -- maybe U.S. speaking, it has a more mature market, we're starting there because we can probably be most helpful. I think we've seen some opportunities to do things with buildings as an example. Big commercial buildings, we're very good at. We're very knowledgeable of a building that sits in some form or [ph] location, has the same type of risk attributes, as long as we get understanding of the property characteristics. And we can relate a building in whatever form or region [ph] to something here in the United States, and we could build out with a lot of imagery. So we're following our customers, one. We're finding right markets, two. And we have a kind of a team that's really focused on trying to accelerate our growth internationally."

So those are the type of things that we are kind of referencing there when we talk about timing. So signed contracts, just looking to push implementation will be on this, [ph] so we have as much control as we like. I think the other comment or at least the other thing Scott referenced was, in our world, we have a lot of subscription, pretty high visibility. Storm, storm activity, affects some of our repair cost estimates. There's a variable aspect to that, and some of the contracts allow for additional charges when we have higher volumes. And just more broadly, if I'm answering your question right, storm, storm activity creates what is maybe some pricing opportunity for both reinsurers and primary insurers. And that helps the overall state of the market and really just the mindset of insurers who at this point are really focused on cutting costs as opposed to growing their book and growing their top line. So a little bit of the mindset as well as a little transactional. So hopefully, that provides a little color you're looking for."

So several things around that. First, customers generally have been under pressure, but I don't think it would be correct to draw the conclusion that -- if what you're picturing is a lot of industry consolidation and the exit of a lot of players, fewer belly buttons on the customer list are out of the market. That's actually not the case. And in fact, one of the reasons why we were interested to do the small tuck-ins that we did is, in some cases, they actually serve different segments of the market. For example, more pure-play E&P kinds of companies. So actually, the net effect of all the acquisitions is that the customer list, which used to be circa 1,000, is now closer to 3,000. And so we're obviously very excited about the cross-sell opportunities inside of that. Let me just also remind everybody that one of the largest segments that is served by Argus is the financial services world. There are a lot of folks who are interested in understanding what's happening in the hydrocarbon ecosystem that are not -- I'm sorry, did I say Argus? Within the WoodMac. Excuse me. I'm addressing WoodMac. One of the largest segments for WoodMac is the financial services segment. And because there are a lot of folks that are interested in the performance of the hydrocarbon ecosystem other than the oil and gas companies, and that segment has remained a very important part of what it is that we do. And then WoodMac is -- actually yesterday -- literally, yesterday, launched a new solution, and new solutions have always been a part of the WoodMac story, and I think always will be part of the WoodMac story. And yet another thing which is in the environment right now is, the oil and gas companies have really trimmed their work staff. And part of the effect of that is that, when the rebound comes, and it will come, I mean, you can just see it coming based upon lack of investment in CapEx, when it comes, the -- our customers will be a little bit shorthanded in terms of talent. And so we think that they'll want to make use of both of our sort of products as well as our services. And you can see little green shoots of some of that even today."

What we have seen is more and more people are using us, or at least we're winning what I'll refer to as the primary modeling spot. If you're embedded in the workflow, if you are part of that underwriting decision, the primary model is paid more. The secondary model is used as a reference point and to make sure things look right and just kind of pick things up on the information. So it's a checkpoint. Our goal continues to be is to displace the competitor and drive towards being that primary model in the biggest insurers, where the competitors had historically had a little bit more prominence. The other part of your question is, I would say to you that a large majority of [indiscernible] of the world uses models. In some cases, they own it themselves and kind of have their own internal staff. In other cases, they work through brokers, and we like our product through brokers. I think everyone has access to models. I think it becomes more prominent for larger insurers to own it and have it directly in-house for use by their internal staff. And they're using more and more models, too. So that's why Analyze Re provides an opportunity to kind of bring all those modeling outcomes together. You can pick a region. You can pick a model, and you can kind of look at it across the book and portfolio way to do that. I think the last part of your question is, yes, we model 100 countries. I think it's 104 countries, all major perils. We listen to our customers where they think there's economic loss to be covered, and we will attempt to build models where there's customer feedback and event.

So when we're thinking about making our proposals, it's a combination of when it's time to review the existing product or products, but also we're always presenting new solutions that they're not using today. And where we come out on a customer-by-customer basis is essentially the net of all of that.

I think we've had a very high subscription rate inside of the industry standard programs. As you know, it's in large part the pricing and the invoice that goes out at the beginning of the year, and it renews and prepaid a quarter in advance for a majority of that revenue, in some cases, a full year. So good visibility. The things that kind of caused some ups and downs, if you will. Clearly, we had the opportunity to sell more, whether customers looking to expand services or new insurer comes in. When 2 insurers become one inside a merger, obviously, that has some potentially some negative downward effect on the way we kind of price. You're correct. A large chunk of the contracts today are kind of multiyear subscriptions, and they have kind of the inflationary type of clause in there that is ongoing. Last piece of it is, inside the programs we continue to do a lot as it relates to products and services. So if you were to think about ways that people take our content and bring it into their own solutions, we call it electronic rating content. As it's been growing nicely. We did a lot of work analytics. We call it risk analyzer suite the type of things. But because of the way we contract, it's usually multiyear, and it's kind of spread evenly over the term. So you have seen a pretty constant approach to industry standard programs from year to year. I hope that's what you're looking for."

In the third quarter, we delivered solid overall results, with total and organic constant-currency revenue growth of around 6% as we continue to grow faster than our end markets. With almost 8% growth from our combined insurance and financial services businesses, the long-term underlying trends remain encouraging. 
Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins of around 51%. Adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding the prior year warrant sale gain, was around 6%. Diluted adjusted EPS grew about 8% and about 17%, excluding the warrant gain. Year-to-date free cash flow is up 13%, excluding the tax on the gain from the healthcare business sale. 
We were pleased to resume returning capital to our shareholders through our long-standing share repurchase program. We bought $73 million of stock in the quarter, and we had $280 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of September 30, 2016. 
With our leverage back below our 2.5x reference level, we have plenty of capacity for strategically relevant tuck-in acquisitions as well as additional repurchases. We remain active in evaluating possible acquisitions, in particular as we make buy-versus-build decisions in pursuit of our international expansion and vertical enhancement. Analyze Re is a great example, where we found a high-performance analytics capability that complements the Touchstone platform at AIR. While the deal only closed last week, the teams are already working on integration and go-to-market strategies. 
We continue to make progress enhancing the Verisk distinctives of: one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into customer workflows. Consistent with our efforts, Verisk was recently ranked in the top 20 on Forbes Magazine's 2016 list of The World's Most Innovative Companies. Our success is due to the outstanding efforts of our people, including those who have joined us relatively recently. And I'm very encouraged by the growing enthusiasm across the company to serve our customers with innovative data analytics solutions. We see a direct relationship between the excellence of our employees and our commitment to creating innovative solutions for our customers. 
We remain confident in our double-digit growth forecast for financial services this year, and we still continue to expect WoodMac to be around flat in constant currency. 
In pursuit of our goal of insurance growth above the 2015 run rate, we are pleased with new contract signings and the performance of several newer, more innovative solutions. As you know, there's been some softness in the reinsurance market, and 2016 has been an extremely quiet storm season. In addition, a handful of customers have signed contracts, as expected, but the related implementations are starting a bit later than originally planned. While timing is a factor as we cross the 2016 finish line, we continue to feel very good about the quality of our data assets. Our customers' regard for us is higher than ever, according to our NPS methodology, and the long-term outlook is for continued revenue growth. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark who will make some additional comments."

Across our businesses which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we have several key industry themes, including vertical big data, industry automation and digital engagement. With these themes in mind, I'll highlight a number of positive recent developments. 
In the vertical big data area, we launched a new energy insurance group focused on transforming risk assessment, rating and risk modeling for the oil and gas, petrochemicals, power generation and metals and mining industries. The group is drawing on deep domain expertise and proprietary data from our ISO, AIR and WoodMac businesses. The data analytics solutions will help global property and casualty insurance evaluate and select risk and manage portfolios based upon energy and insurance industrywide data rather than relying solely on their own experience, data sets and tools. We are uniquely positioned to be the first to market at innovating at the intersection of insurance and energy sectors. 
One of our industry automation solutions saw a win as the leading insurer extend its use of A-PLUS, Verisk's loss history solution, conduct loss history evaluations at the beginning rather than after the core process. This change in workflow will enhance the experience of their customers while improving operational and sales efficiencies. Improving conversion rates through better customer experiences, while keeping expenses flat and maintaining underwriting integrity, is a forward-thinking, innovative approach to profitable growth. 
We continue to perform well in the cat modeling space. As an example, we were very pleased when a leading global player decided to select AIR's Touchstone platform as its primary modeling solution, along with the complete suite of AIR's global catastrophe models. Their decision was informed by, in their words, ""AIR's detailed loss modeling capabilities and superior service."" This follows the June 2016 release of Touchstone 4.0, which features a variety of enhancements designed to improve performance, workflow automation and efficiency and the overall user experience. 
Finally, we continue to improve digital engagement in the P&C industry through the availability of circular authority for insurance. This is a cloud-based analytics solution designed to help insurers better manage ISO content with tools to visualize, compare and analyze updates. The solution helps insurers plan, implement and track our filings with state regulators and stay informed on the latest insurance topics. This is a natural extension to the thousands of insurance program updates we issue each year, and we're confident that it will add value and functionality for our customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results."

In the third quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth in the future. 
Revenue grew 5.9% and 6.2% on an organic constant currency basis. Our combined insurance and financial services businesses grew 7.7% in the quarter. EBITDA grew 5.9% to $253 million. This growth excludes the prior period gain on sale of warrants. EBITDA margins were 50.9% in the quarter. 
Within Decision Analytics, revenue grew 6.2% and 6.9% on an organic constant currency basis. Again, this quarter, financial services was the fastest-growing vertical while insurance-focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to growth. 
Decision Analytics' insurance revenue grew 7.4% in the third quarter. We saw solid growth in underwriting, claims analytics and catastrophe modeling solutions. Loss quantification solutions also contributed to growth in the quarter. 
Customer retention remains very high, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. 
Financial services revenue increased 24.5% in the quarter, led by growth in analytical solutions and media effectiveness. We are seeing good interest in the solutions we are building with our partners and continue to believe that our differentiated data assets position us well to execute on our plans in this vertical. 
As reported, energy and specialized markets revenue was about flat. The continued weakness in the British pound remains a headwind to both revenue growth and Decision Analytics margins on a reported basis. Consistent with our long-standing approach, WoodMac became a part of organic growth starting in the third quarter. Organic revenue, which excludes PCI, Infield, Greentech and Quest, declined $5.3 million in the quarter but increased slightly, excluding the impact of FX. 
Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.3% and 5% on an organic basis, continuing to demonstrate the value of our long -- to our long-standing insurance customers, contributions in these solutions that are in early stages and the inclusion of Risk Intelligence Ireland, which we have rebranded as Verisk Insurance Solutions - Ireland. 
Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.4%, reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions, such as predictive model and electronic rating content. 
Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 4.8% in the quarter. Growth was led by an increase in commercial underwriting solutions subscription revenue. 
EBITDA decreased 0.6% in the quarter to $253 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.9%. EBITDA growth, adjusted for the 2015 gain on sale of warrants, was 5.9%. EBITDA excludes a third quarter 2016 severance charge as we combined administrative functions following the WoodMac integration. It also excludes the gain on an investment in a company which was acquired by a third party. 
Decision Analytics EBITDA, excluding the prior year gain, grew 7.3% to $147 million in the quarter. Decision Analytics EBITDA, as reported, decreased 3.7%. 
EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 4% to $106 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management, offset by increased staff levels following the previously announced talent realignment. 
Reported interest expense was $28 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at September 30, 2016. After using our proceeds from the healthcare divestiture to pay down debt, our pro forma leverage at the end of the third quarter was about 2.2x, below our 2.5x reference level. 
Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 26%. We saw a onetime benefit in the quarter from a change in the tax rates in the U.K. 
Adjusted net income in 3Q increased 8.1% to $144 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.84 in the quarter, an increase of 7.7%. Adjusted EPS increased because of solid operations, both organic and acquired, lower interest expense and lower taxes. The increases were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense and the 2015 warrant sale gain, which did not recur this year. Excluding the 2015 warrant gain, adjusted EPS grew 16.9%. 
The average diluted share count was 171.8 million shares in the quarter. On September 30, 2016, our diluted share count was 171 million shares. We repurchased 900,000 shares at an average price of $81.72 for a total cost of $73 million in the quarter. At September 30, we had about $280 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. 
Free cash flow increased 12.8% to $429 million for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2016, excluding the $75 million tax on the gain of the sale of the healthcare business. Free cash flow, excluding the tax, was 57.4% of EBITDA. These numbers are all continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by greater profitability of our businesses, the addition of WoodMac and lower CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and therefore shareholder value. 
Capital expenditures increased 0.8% to $88 million for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2016. And we continue to balance the capital intensity of the business with investing for future growth. CapEx was 5.9% of revenue year-to-date. We expect for the full year our CapEx will be about $10 million lower than we previously discussed as we manage efficiencies across our hardware and software spend, even while developing more software for solution delivery. 
As you think about your models for the remainder of 2016 on a continuing operations basis, please remember that in the fourth quarter, we expect to have a onetime P&L charge of $19 million related to the ESOP. This is a nonrecurring item related to adjustments made to the ESOP at the time of the IPO and will exclude -- be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. This does not affect the underlying business profitability, and we just want it to be on your radar ahead of time. This is really the final item that will be associated with ESOP adjustments. 
For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx from continuing operations of $140 million to $145 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $125 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. 
Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $120 million for the full year, and we estimate the tax rate to be around 31% for the full year. For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% to reflect the tax rates applicable to our intangible assets. 
And finally, we expect a full year diluted weighted average share count of about 171.6 million shares before incremental repurchases. 
We are executing on our 2016 plan despite larger-than-expected currency headwinds and are actively engaged in planning for the future. We're excited about the opportunities we see for profitable growth and remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investments for the long term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions]

And basically -- and actually, I mentioned 2 things that are in the environment right now. The other is it's a very quiet storm season, and in fact, it has been a quiet storm season for the last several years. And that does interact with the way that the reinsurance market behaves. And so there have been some combinations in the reinsurance world, including the brokers. And so you have that in the environment. So it's in there. It's a factor, but the business -- our insurance business overall is really good. And even yesterday, we had a visit from folks from an extremely prominent global, nondomestic insurance organization, and they were essentially asking how could they get closer to more of our solutions. I think it's a conversation that we were probably not going to be able to have even just a couple of years ago. So that's kind of where we sit right now."

And the offset is the investment in new things, and we're actually just completing our annual refresh of our 5-year plans. And I think we have the most robust new solution pipeline that we've ever had actually. So we're excited to be investing in the business, and that is the one offsetting factor. But the business continues to demonstrate the same scale effects as it always has. So we've said we're constructive on margins in the intermediate and long term, and we're still in that place."

So there are elements that are transactional, and others are longer term.

They would really like to, for the most part, not touch life claims, which would save them money and actually improve their own relationship with customers. So I'm not sure we've been able to quantify TAM for all of that, but let me just describe to you some of the bigger things that we think are important. One we highlighted here, if you underwrite a claim -- excuse me, generate a risk, you have a lot of information that is necessary to underwrite that risk. We want to take and move that to the front end. We want to do that upfront so the people can be quoting with all that information in mind. And I think that's a big opportunity. I think the other opportunity we highlighted here was energy. So bringing together the big data kind of world of what we do with WoodMac and the information we have with WoodMac and what we do with insurance, we have found, or at least we think, that the energy market is a little bit more specialized, it's a little bit the expertise of players in it, and they really have never had looked at views into a pricing or a risk assessment approach that we would do in traditional limited insurance. So this is more of an E&S-type asset. It's excess and surplus. It's big players across the world, and we think this is a, I would say, probably tens of millions type of TAM, if not larger."

And as Scott highlighted, it's become very much a priority over the last couple of years. There's 2 things I think we're doing well. There's a couple of places, particularly on the claims side of things, where we have a customer, they're using us in a geography -- let's use the U.K. as an example. They like the results they've gotten. We're able to demonstrate strong ROI, and that large global insurer takes us from the U.K. to other geographies. And ultimately, I think what the plan would be to implement across all of their operations. Once we get into another geography and we customize for that geography, one of the things we always have to identify and understand is the insurance markets are very different. So we have to locally customize the software. And that's true of things we've been trying to do and put in place so that we can then extend out and beyond the one customer into many. There's other places -- kind of the second tack we've taken is we know markets that look and feel a lot like the U.S. market. It has maybe not the same regulation, but it has the same kind of nature of transfer risk. And we're good and knowledgeable, and we can help them. And to the extent that is -- maybe U.S. speaking, it has a more mature market, we're starting there because we can probably be most helpful. I think we've seen some opportunities to do things with buildings as an example. Big commercial buildings, we're very good at. We're very knowledgeable of a building that sits in some form or location, has the same type of risk attributes, as long as we get understanding of the property characteristics. And we can relate a building in whatever form or region to something here in the United States, and we could build out with a lot of imagery. So we're following our customers, one. We're finding right markets, two. And we have a kind of a team that's really focused on trying to accelerate our growth internationally."

Let me provide a little color. One of the great parts of Verisk is we're deeply embedded into our customer workflows, and that's true of a lot of the competitors in which we go after, so if you were to think about where we try to provide information to the point of underwriting. So transitioning a customer from another solution to our solution just takes time. It takes a lot of effort from internal IT departments, and we just can't always control the timing of those things. We also have contracts that we know it's going to happen, but the timing and where they want to roll out -- sometimes they want to roll out regionally as opposed to across the nation. So those are the type of things that we are kind of referencing there when we talk about timing. So signed contracts, just looking to push implementation will be on this, so we have as much control as we'd like. I think the other comment or at least the other thing Scott referenced was, in our world, we have a lot of subscription, pretty high visibility. Storm, storm activity, affects some of our repair cost estimates. There's a variable aspect to that, and some of the contracts allow for additional charges when we have higher volumes. And just more broadly, if I'm answering your question right, storm, storm activity creates what is maybe some pricing opportunity for both reinsurers and primary insurers. And that helps the overall state of the market and really just the mindset of insurers who at this point are really focused on cutting costs as opposed to growing their book and growing their top line. So a little bit of the mindset as well as a little transactional. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of color you're looking for."

So several things around that. First, customers generally have been under pressure, but I don't think it would be correct to draw the conclusion that -- if what you're picturing is a lot of industry consolidation and the exits of a lot of players, fewer belly buttons on the customer list are out in the market. That's actually not the case. And in fact, one of the reasons why we were interested to do the small tuck-ins that we did is, in some cases, they actually serve different segments of the market, for example, more pure-play E&P kinds of companies. So actually, the net effect of all the acquisitions is that the customer list, which used to be circa 1,000, is now closer to 3,000. And so we're obviously very excited about the cross-sell opportunities inside of that. Let me just also remind everybody that one of the largest segments that is served by Argus is the financial services world. There are a lot of folks who are interested in understanding what's happening in the hydrocarbon ecosystem that are not -- oh, I'm sorry, did I say Argus? In the WoodMac, excuse me. I'm addressing WoodMac. There are -- one of the largest segments for WoodMac is the financial services segment. And because there are a lot of folks that are interested in the performance of the hydrocarbon ecosystem other than the oil and gas companies, and that segment has remained a very important part of what it is that we do. And then WoodMac is -- actually yesterday -- literally, yesterday, launched a new solution. And new solutions have always been a part of the WoodMac story and, I think, always will be a part of the WoodMac story. And yet another thing which is in the environment right now is, the oil and gas companies have really trimmed their work staffs. And part of the effect of that is that, when the rebound comes, and it will come -- I mean, you can just see it coming based upon lack of investment in CapEx. When it comes, the -- our customers will be a little bit shorthanded in terms of talent. And so we think that they'll want to make use of both of our sort of products as well as our services. And you can see little green shoots of some of that even today."

I think if you were to look at the number of insurers, most of the larger insurers use multiple models. So they would use both AIR and the competitive model. What we have seen is more and more people are using us or at least we're winning what I'll refer to as the primary modeling spot. If you're embedded in the workflow, if you are part of that underwriting decision, the primary model is paid more. The secondary model is used as a reference point and to make sure things look right and kind of syncs up with a lot of information. So it's a checkpoint. Our goal continues to be is to displace the competitor and drive towards being that primary model in the biggest insurers, where the competitors historically had a little bit more prominence. The other part of your question is, I would say to you that a large majority of, I would say, premiums [ph] of the world uses models. In some cases, they own them themselves and kind of have their own internal staff. In other cases, they work through brokers, and we license our product through brokers. So I think everyone has access to models. I think it becomes more prominent for larger insurers to own it and have it directly in-house for use by their internal staff. And they're using more and more models, too. So that's why Analyze Re provides an opportunity to kind of bring all of those modeled outcomes together. You can pick a region, you can pick a model, and you can kind of look at across the book in a portfolio way to do that. I think the last part of your question is, we model 100 countries. I think it's 104 countries, all major perils. We will listen to our customers where they think there's economic loss to be covered, and we will attempt to build models where there's customer feedback and event. And we think we're pretty well covered, albeit we're always looking to improve and always looking to expand."

There are some segments whose current situations are sort of more leaning in and growth-oriented. And there are some where they've been more heavily impacted by some of the trends in the industry. So there's really no one answer which sort of covers all of that. The way that we manage inside of the energy vertical is the same way that we manage in the insurance vertical, actually everything we do, which is we take a comprehensive view of the relationship with the customer. So when we're thinking about making our proposals, it's a combination of when it's time to review the existing product or products, but also, we're always presenting new solutions that they're not using today. And where we come out on a customer-by-customer basis is essentially the net of all of that. So I would say that, in the current moment, we've had to be particularly thoughtful about the pricing on like-over-like when we come to those renewal points. Bear in mind, by the way, that there are multiyear -- a number of multiyear agreements here, so it's not as if that really predominates in what goes on. But really, the outcomes in these negotiations with customers have really been kind of what we expected.

You're correct, a large chunk of the contracts today are kind of multiyear subscriptions, and they have kind of a inflationary type of clause in there that is ongoing. Last piece of it is, inside the industry-standard programs, we continue to do a lot as it relates to new products and services.

So I think we always had approach where we want to work with our customers for any type of rollout. So we brought all of our teams together to see what we had and what capabilities and solutions we have to help energy insurers, including and featuring a lot of the WoodMac content. With that group together, kind of a cross-functional team, we built what we refer to as a minimal viable product. It's something that could be used for demos and used to provide a look into what really can happen. And what our intent is, is always to work with partners, development partners to build out and enhance that solution. So we are -- have gotten some very nice acceptance and interest from some of the largest players in that space. We have a couple of development partners, and we are anxiously looking to move forward and trying to move as quickly as we can on that front. I think it opens up some nice opportunities and really provides a little insight into what is a great opportunity to build across the 2 verticals of Verisk. You also had a comment or question about supply chain, and I think that offers another kind of opportunity where a lot of different parts."

We really like the supply chain theme because it lends itself to the kind of stochastic network kind of analytic that we're good at.

And so we're actually -- that's a place where we're trying to bring together the sort of the pattern and thought and the vertical market. The other thing that I think really ties our company together is large-scale data integration and data management, which is just -- and it's just the bread and butter of doing what we do. But bringing those methods across all parts of our organization and finding ways to make sure that we're commercializing those opportunities in all of the vertical markets, that's -- I think that's -- by degree, it's kind of new business for us, and it's exciting. So that, to me, is actually the most -- that's the greatest amount of connective tissue we have across the company."

I think the pipeline of internal opportunities has never been stronger. So insurance remains a world where you can really think of an insurance company as an information factory. And there are many, many insurance companies, and they are all in different places in terms of their journey towards data analytic proficiency. They are all, I think, in varying degrees, becoming even more comfortable with the thought of third parties, like ourselves, contributing to what it is that they're doing. So the environment in general is one that -- our approach, which is vertical big data analytics, is a meaningful one.

In the third quarter, we delivered solid overall results, with total and organic constant-currency revenue growth of around 6% as we continue to grow faster than our end markets. With almost 8% growth from our combined insurance and financial services businesses, the long-term underlying trends remain encouraging. 
Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins of around 51%. Adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding the prior-year warrant sale gain, was around 6%. Diluted adjusted EPS grew about 8% and about 17%, excluding the warrant gain. Year-to-date free cash flow is up 13%, excluding the tax on the gain from the healthcare business sale. 
We were pleased to resume returning capital to our shareholders through our long-standing share repurchase program. We bought $73 million of stock in the quarter and we had $280 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of September 30, 2016. 
With our leverage back below our 2.5x reference level, we have plenty of capacity for strategically relevant tuck-in acquisitions as well as additional repurchases. We remain active in evaluating possible acquisitions, in particular as we make buy-versus-build decisions in pursuit of our international expansion and vertical enhancement. Analyze Re is a great example, where we found a high-performance analytics capability that complements the Touchstone platform at AIR. While the deal only closed last week, the teams are already working on integration and go-to-market strategies. 
We continue to make progress enhancing the Verisk distinctives of: one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into customer workflows. Consistent with our efforts, Verisk was recently ranked in the top 20 on Forbes Magazine's 2016 list of The World's Most Innovative Companies. Our success is due to the outstanding efforts of our people, including those who have joined us relatively recently. And I'm very encouraged by the growing enthusiasm across the company to serve our customers with innovative data analytics solutions. We see a direct relationship between the excellence of our employees and our commitment to creating innovative solutions for our customers. 
We remain confident in our double-digit growth forecast for financial services this year, and we still continue to expect WoodMac to be around flat in constant currency. 
In pursuit of our goal of insurance growth above the 2015 run rate, we are pleased with new contract signings and the performance of several newer, more innovative solutions. As you know, there's been some softness in the reinsurance market, and 2016 has been an extremely quiet storm season. In addition, a handful of customers have signed contracts, as expected, but the related implementations are starting a bit later than originally planned. While timing is a factor as we cross the 2016 finish line, we continue to feel very good about the quality of our data assets. Our customers' regard for us is higher than ever, according to our NPS methodology, and the long-term outlook is for continued revenue growth. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark who will make some additional comments."

Across our businesses which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we have several key industry themes, including vertical big data, industry automation and digital engagement. With these themes in mind, I'll highlight a number of positive recent developments. 
In the vertical big data area, we launched a new energy insurance group focused on transforming risk assessment, rating and risk modeling for the oil and gas, petrochemicals, power generation and metals and mining industries. The group is drawing on deep domain expertise and proprietary data from our ISO, AIR and WoodMac businesses. The data analytics solutions will help global property and casualty insurance evaluate and select risk and manage portfolios based upon energy and insurance industrywide data rather than relying solely on their own experience, data sets and tools. We are uniquely positioned to be the first to market at innovating at the intersection of insurance and energy sectors. 
One of our industry automation solutions saw a win as the leading insurer extend its use of A-PLUS, Verisk's loss history solution, conduct loss history evaluations at the beginning rather than after the core process. This change in workflow will enhance the experience of their customers while improving operational and sales efficiencies. Improving conversion rates through better customer experiences, while keeping expenses flat and maintaining underwriting integrity, is a forward-thinking, innovative approach to profitable growth. 
We continue to perform well in the cat modeling space. As an example, we were very pleased when a leading global player decided to select AIR's Touchstone platform as its primary modeling solution, along with the complete suite of AIR's global catastrophe models. Their decision was informed by, in their words, ""AIR's detailed loss modeling capabilities and superior service."" This follows the June 2016 release of Touchstone 4.0, which features a variety of enhancements designed to improve performance, workflow automation and efficiency and the overall user experience. 
Finally, we continue to improve digital engagement in the P&C industry through the availability of circular authority for insurance. This is a cloud-based analytics solution designed to help insurers better manage ISO content with tools to visualize, compare and analyze updates. The solution helps insurers plan, implement and track our filings with state regulators and stay informed on the latest insurance topics. This is a natural extension to the thousands of insurance program updates we issue each year, and we're confident that it will add value and functionality for our customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results."

In the third quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth in the future. 
Revenue grew 5.9% and 6.2% on an organic constant-currency basis. Our combined insurance and financial services businesses grew 7.7% in the quarter. EBITDA grew 5.9% to $253 million. This growth excludes the prior-period gain on sale of warrants. EBITDA margins were 50.9% in the quarter. 
Within Decision Analytics, revenue grew 6.2% and 6.9% on an organic constant-currency basis. Again, this quarter, financial services was the fastest-growing vertical while insurance-focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to growth. 
Decision Analytics' insurance revenue grew 7.4% in the third quarter. We saw solid growth in underwriting, claims analytics and catastrophe modeling solutions. Loss quantification solutions also contributed to growth in the quarter. 
Customer retention remains very high, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. 
Financial services revenue increased 24.5% in the quarter, led by growth in analytical solutions and media effectiveness. We are seeing good interest in the solutions we are building with our partners and continue to believe that our differentiated data assets position us well to execute on our plans in this vertical. 
As reported, energy and specialized markets revenue was about flat. The continued weakness in the British pound remains a headwind to both revenue growth and Decision Analytics' margins on a reported basis. Consistent with our long-standing approach, WoodMac became a part of organic growth starting in the third quarter. Organic revenue, which excludes PCI, Infield, Greentech and Quest, declined $5.3 million in the quarter but increased slightly, excluding the impact of FX. 
Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.3% and 5% on an organic basis, continuing to demonstrate the value of our long -- to our long-standing insurance customers, contributions of new solutions that are in early stages and the inclusion of Risk Intelligence Ireland, which we have rebranded as Verisk Insurance Solutions - Ireland. 
Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.4%, reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions, such as predictive model and electronic rating content. 
Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 4.8% in the quarter. Growth was led by an increase in commercial underwriting solutions subscription revenue. 
EBITDA decreased 0.6% in the quarter to $253 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.9%. EBITDA growth, adjusted for the 2015 gain on sale of warrants, was 5.9%. EBITDA excludes a third quarter 2016 severance charge as we combined administrative functions following the WoodMac integration. It also excludes the gain on an investment in a company which was acquired by a third party. 
Decision Analytics EBITDA, excluding the prior-year gain, grew 7.3% to $147 million in the quarter. Decision Analytics EBITDA, as reported, decreased 3.7%. 
EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 4% to $106 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management, offset by increased staff levels following the previously announced talent realignment. 
Reported interest expense was $28 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at September 30, 2016. After using our proceeds from the healthcare divestiture to pay down debt, our pro forma leverage at the end of the third quarter was about 2.2x, below our 2.5x reference level. 
Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 26%. We saw a onetime benefit in the quarter from a change in the tax rates in the U.K. 
Adjusted net income in 3Q increased 8.1% to $144 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.84 in the quarter, an increase of 7.7%. Adjusted EPS increased because of solid operations, both organic and acquired, lower interest expense and lower taxes. The increases were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense and the 2015 warrant sale gain, which did not recur this year. Excluding the 2015 warrant gain, adjusted EPS grew 16.9%. 
The average diluted share count was 171.8 million shares in the quarter. On September 30, 2016, our diluted share count was 171 million shares. We repurchased 900,000 shares at an average price of $81.72 for a total cost of $73 million in the quarter. At September 30, we had about $280 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. 
Free cash flow increased 12.8% to $429 million for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2016, excluding the $75 million tax on the gain of the sale of the healthcare business. Free cash flow, excluding the tax, was 57.4% of EBITDA. These numbers are all continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by greater profitability of our businesses, the addition of WoodMac and lower CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and therefore shareholder value. 
Capital expenditures increased 0.8% to $88 million for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2016. And we continue to balance the capital intensity of the business with investing for future growth. CapEx was 5.9% of revenue year-to-date. We expect for the full year our CapEx will be about $10 million lower than we previously discussed as we manage efficiencies across our hardware and software spend, even while developing more software for solution delivery. 
As you think about your models for the remainder of 2016 on a continuing operations basis, please remember that in the fourth quarter, we expect to have a onetime P&L charge of $19 million related to the ESOP. This is a nonrecurring item related to adjustments made to the ESOP at the time of the IPO and will exclude -- be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. This does not affect the underlying business profitability, and we just want it to be on your radar ahead of time. This is really the final item that will be associated with ESOP adjustments. 
For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx from continuing operations of $140 million to $145 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $125 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. 
Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $120 million for the full year, and we estimate the tax rate to be around 31% for the full year. For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% to reflect the tax rates applicable to our intangible assets. 
And finally, we expect a full year diluted weighted average share count of about 171.6 million shares before incremental repurchases. 
We are executing on our 2016 plan despite larger-than-expected currency headwinds and are actively engaged in planning for the future. We're excited about the opportunities we see for profitable growth and remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investments for the long term. 
We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions]

We also provide some loss distribution content to the global reinsurers, but it's principally through catastrophe modeling. And basically -- and actually, I mentioned 2 things that are in the environment right now. The other is it's a very quiet storm season, and in fact, it has been a quiet storm season for the last several years. And that does interact with the way that the reinsurance market behaves. And so there have been some combinations in the reinsurance world, including the brokers. And so you have that in the environment. So it's in there. It's a factor, but the business -- our insurance business overall is really good. And even yesterday, we had a visit from folks from an extremely prominent global, nondomestic insurance organization, and they were essentially asking how could they get closer to more of our solutions. I think it's a conversation that we were probably not going to be able to have even just a couple of years ago. So that's kind of where we sit right now."

They would really like to, for the most part, not touch a lot of claims, which would save them money and actually improve their own relationship with customers. So I'm not sure we've been able to quantify TAM for all of that, but let me just describe to you some of the bigger things that we think are important. One we highlighted here is you underwrite a claim -- excuse me, if you underwrite a risk, you have a lot of information that is necessary to underwrite that risk. We want to take and move that to the front end. We want to do that upfront so the people can be quoting with all that information in mind. And I think that's a big opportunity. I think the other opportunity we highlighted here was energy. So bringing together the big data kind of world of what we do with WoodMac and the information we have with WoodMac and what we do with insurance, we have found, or at least we think, that the energy market is a little bit more specialized, it's a little bit the expertise of players in it, and they really have never had look-at views into a pricing or a risk assessment approach that we would do with traditional limited insurance. So this is more of an E&S-type asset. It's excess and surplus. It's big players across the world, and we think this is a, I would say, probably tens of millions type of TAM, if not larger."

And as Scott highlighted, it's become very much a priority over the last couple of years. There's 2 things I think we're doing well. There's a couple of places, particularly on the claims side of things, where we have a customer, they're using us in a geography -- let's use the U.K. as an example. They like the results they've gotten. We're able to demonstrate strong ROI, and that large global insurer takes us from the U.K. to other geographies. And ultimately, I think the plan would be to implement across all of their operations. Once we get into another geography and we customize for that geography, one of the things we always have to identify and understand is the insurance markets are very different. So we have to locally customize the software. And that's true of the things we've been trying to do and put in place so that we can then extend out beyond the one customer into many. There's other places -- kind of the second tack we've taken is we know markets that look and feel a lot like the U.S. market. It has maybe not the same regulation, but it has the same kind of nature of transfer risk. And we're good and knowledgeable, and we can help them. And to the extent that is maybe U.S. speaking, it has a more mature market, we're starting there because we can probably be most helpful. I think we've seen some opportunities to do things with buildings as an example. Big commercial buildings, we're very good at. We're very knowledgeable of a building that sits in some foreign location, has the same type of risk attributes, as long as we can get am understanding of the property characteristics and we can relate a building in whatever foreign region to something here in the United States, and we could build out with a lot of imagery. So we're following our customers, one. We're finding like markets, two. And we have a -- kind of a team that's really focused on trying to accelerate our growth internationally."

Let me provide a little color. One of the great parts of Verisk is we're deeply embedded into our customer workflows, and that's true of a lot of the competitors in which we go after, so if you were to think about where we try to provide information at the point of underwriting. So transitioning a customer from another solution to our solution just takes time. It takes a lot of effort from internal IT departments, and we just can't always control the timing of those things. We also have contracts that we know it's going to happen, but the timing and where they want to roll out. Sometimes they want to roll out regionally as opposed to across the nation. So those are the type of things that we are kind of referencing there when we talk about timing. So signed contracts, just looking to push implementation, where we own this, so we have as much control as we'd like. I think the other comment or at least the other thing Scott referenced was, in our world, we have a lot of subscription, pretty high visibility. Storms, storm activity affects some of our repair cost estimates. There's a variable aspect to that, and some of the contracts allow for additional charges when we have higher volumes. And just more broadly, if I'm answering your question right, storms, storm activity creates what is maybe some pricing opportunity for both reinsurers and primary insurers. And that helps the overall state of the market and really, just the mindset of insurers who, at this point, are really focused on cutting costs as opposed to growing their book and growing their top line, so a little bit of the mindset as well as a little transactional. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of color you're looking for."

So several things around that. First, customers generally have been under pressure, but I don't think it would be correct to draw the conclusion that -- if what you're picturing is a lot of industry consolidation and the exits of a lot of players, fewer belly buttons on the customer list or out in the market; that's actually not the case. And in fact, one of the reasons why we were interested to do the small tuck-ins that we did is, in some cases, they actually serve different segments of the market, for example, more pure-play E&P kinds of companies. And so actually, the net effect of all the acquisitions is that the customer list, which used to be circa 1,000, is now closer to 3,000. And so we're obviously very excited about the cross-sell opportunities inside of that. Let me just also remind everybody that one of the largest segments that is served by Argus is the financial services world. There are a lot of folks who are interested in understanding what's happening in the hydrocarbon ecosystem that are not -- oh, I'm sorry, did I say Argus? In the WoodMac, excuse me. I'm addressing WoodMac. There are -- one of the largest segments for WoodMac is the financial services segment. And because there are a lot of folks that are interested in the performance of the hydrocarbon ecosystem other than the oil and gas companies, and that segment has remained a very important part of what it is that we do. And then WoodMac is -- actually yesterday -- literally, yesterday, launched a new solution. And new solutions have always been a part of the WoodMac story and, I think, always will be a part of the WoodMac story. And yet another thing which is in the environment right now is the oil and gas companies have really trimmed their work staffs. And part of the effect of that is that when the rebound comes, and it will come -- I mean, you can just see it coming based upon lack of investment in CapEx. When it comes, the -- our customers will be a little bit shorthanded in terms of talent. And so we think that they'll want to make use of both of our sort of products as well as our services. And you can see little green shoots of some of that even today."

I think if you were to look at the number of insurers, most of the larger insurers use multiple models. So they would use both AIR and the competitive model. What we have seen is more and more people are using us or at least we're winning what I'll refer to as the primary modeling spot. If you're embedding this in the workflow, if you're part of that underwriting decision, the primary model is paid more. The secondary model is used as a reference point and to make sure things look right and kind of syncs up with a lot of different information. So it's a checkpoint. Our goal continues to be is to displace the competitor and drive towards being that primary model in the biggest insurers, where the competitors historically had a little bit more prominence. The other part of your question is, I would say to you that a large majority of, I would say, [ph] premiums of the world uses models. In some cases, they own them themselves and kind of have their own internal staff. In other cases, they work through brokers, and we license our product through brokers. So I think everyone has access to models. I think it becomes more prominent for larger insurers to own it and have it directly in-house for use by their internal staff. And they're using more and more models, too. So that's why Analyze Re provides an opportunity to kind of bring all of those modeled outcomes together. You can pick a region, you can pick a model, and you can kind of look at across the book in a portfolio way to do that. I think the last part of your question is we model 100 countries. I think it's 104 countries, all major perils. We will listen to our customers where they think there's economic loss to be covered, and we will attempt to build models where there's customer feedback and event. And we think we're pretty well covered, albeit we're always looking to improve and always looking to expand."

There are some segments whose current situations are sort of more leaning in and growth-oriented. And there are some where they've been more heavily impacted by some of the trends in the industry. So there's really no one answer which sort of covers all of that. The way that we manage inside of the energy vertical is the same way that we manage in the insurance vertical, actually everything we do, which is we take a comprehensive view of the relationship with the customer. So when we're thinking about making our proposals, it's a combination of when it's time to review the existing product or products, but also, we're always presenting new solutions that they're not using today. And where we come out on a customer-by-customer basis is essentially the net of all of that. So I would say that in the current moment, we've had to be particularly thoughtful about the pricing on like-over-like when we come to those renewal points. Bear in mind, by the way, that there are multiyear -- a number of multiyear agreements here, so it's not as if that really predominates in what goes on. But really, the outcomes in these negotiations with customers have really been kind of what we expected. And certainly, as we go forward and the environment normalizes, I think that -- I think there will be room there."

The things that kind of caused some ups and downs, if you will, clearly, we have the opportunity to sell more where there's a customer who's looking to expand services or a new insurer comes to be, when 2 insurers become one inside a merger, so obviously, that has some potentially some negative downward effect on the way we kind of price. You're correct, a large chunk of the contracts today are kind of multiyear subscriptions, and they have kind of an inflationary type of clause in there that is ongoing. Last piece of it is, inside the industry-standard programs, we continue to do a lot as it relates to new products and services. So if you were to think about ways that people take our content and bring it into their own solutions, we call it electronic rating content, that has been growing nicely. We've done a lot of work around analytics. We call it Risk Analyzer suite. Those are the type of things.

And just this fall, having gone through long-range, multiyear plans for all parts of the business, including all the parts of the insurance business, I think we have the most robust view of new forms of value that we can bring to the market that we've ever had. I think the pipeline of internal opportunities has never been stronger. So insurance remains a world where you can really think of an insurance company as an information factory. And there are many, many insurance companies, and they're all in different places in terms of their journey towards data analytic proficiency. They are all, I think, in varying degrees, becoming even more comfortable with the thought of third parties, like ourselves contributing to what it is that they're doing. So the environment in general is one that -- our approach, which is vertical big data analytics, is a meaningful one. And we're actually having a 2-day customer conference beginning tomorrow for our North American customers, and it's very exciting. The attendee list is very exciting, and what we're going to be talking about is really interesting future-oriented stuff."

So we are making good progress with other OEMs, meaning other car manufacturers as well as folks who do central alarm systems and connected home, things like that because we think it will be a key element in understanding, assessing and rating the insurance policy. We've made good progress both here, and it also kind of creates a nice beachhead for some international expansion opportunities.

In the third quarter, we delivered solid overall results, with total and organic constant-currency revenue growth of around 6% as we continue to grow faster than our end markets. With almost 8% growth from our combined insurance and financial services businesses, the long-term underlying trends remain encouraging. 
Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins of around 51%. Adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding the prior-year warrant sale gain, was around 6%. Diluted adjusted EPS grew about 8% and about 17%, excluding the warrant gain. Year-to-date free cash flow is up 13%, excluding the tax on the gain from the healthcare business sale. 
We were pleased to resume returning capital to our shareholders through our long-standing share repurchase program. We bought $73 million of stock in the quarter and we had $280 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of September 30, 2016. 
With our leverage back below our 2.5x reference level, we have plenty of capacity for strategically relevant tuck-in acquisitions as well as additional repurchases. We remain active in evaluating possible acquisitions, in particular as we make buy-versus-build decisions in pursuit of our international expansion and vertical enhancement. Analyze Re is a great example, where we found a high-performance analytics capability that complements the Touchstone platform at AIR. While the deal only closed last week, the teams are already working on integration and go-to-market strategies. 
We continue to make progress enhancing the Verisk distinctives of: one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into customer workflows. Consistent with our efforts, Verisk was recently ranked in the top 20 on Forbes Magazine's 2016 list of The World's Most Innovative Companies. Our success is due to the outstanding efforts of our people, including those who have joined us relatively recently. And I'm very encouraged by the growing enthusiasm across the company to serve our customers with innovative data analytics solutions. We see a direct relationship between the excellence of our employees and our commitment to creating innovative solutions for our customers. 
We remain confident in our double-digit growth forecast for financial services this year, and we still continue to expect WoodMac to be around flat in constant currency. 
In pursuit of our goal of insurance growth above the 2015 run rate, we are pleased with new contract signings and the performance of several newer, more innovative solutions. As you know, there's been some softness in the reinsurance market, and 2016 has been an extremely quiet storm season. In addition, a handful of customers have signed contracts, as expected, but the related implementations are starting a bit later than originally planned. While timing is a factor as we cross the 2016 finish line, we continue to feel very good about the quality of our data assets. Our customers' regard for us is higher than ever, according to our NPS methodology, and the long-term outlook is for continued revenue growth. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark who will make some additional comments."

Across our businesses which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we have several key industry themes, including vertical big data, industry automation and digital engagement. With these themes in mind, I'll highlight a number of positive recent developments. 
In the vertical big data area, we launched a new energy insurance group focused on transforming risk assessment, rating and risk modeling for the oil and gas, petrochemicals, power generation and metals and mining industries. The group is drawing on deep domain expertise and proprietary data from our ISO, AIR and WoodMac businesses. The data analytics solutions will help global property and casualty insurance evaluate and select risk and manage portfolios based upon energy and insurance industrywide data rather than relying solely on their own experience, data sets and tools. We are uniquely positioned to be the first to market at innovating at the intersection of insurance and energy sectors. 
One of our industry automation solutions saw a win as the leading insurer extend its use of A-PLUS, Verisk's loss history solution, conduct loss history evaluations at the beginning rather than after the core process. This change in workflow will enhance the experience of their customers while improving operational and sales efficiencies. Improving conversion rates through better customer experiences, while keeping expenses flat and maintaining underwriting integrity, is a forward-thinking, innovative approach to profitable growth. 
We continue to perform well in the cat modeling space. As an example, we were very pleased when a leading global player decided to select AIR's Touchstone platform as its primary modeling solution, along with the complete suite of AIR's global catastrophe models. Their decision was informed by, in their words, ""AIR's detailed loss modeling capabilities and superior service."" This follows the June 2016 release of Touchstone 4.0, which features a variety of enhancements designed to improve performance, workflow automation and efficiency and the overall user experience. 
Finally, we continue to improve digital engagement in the P&C industry through the availability of circular authority for insurance. This is a cloud-based analytics solution designed to help insurers better manage ISO content with tools to visualize, compare and analyze updates. The solution helps insurers plan, implement and track our filings with state regulators and stay informed on the latest insurance topics. This is a natural extension to the thousands of insurance program updates we issue each year, and we're confident that it will add value and functionality for our customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results."

In the third quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth in the future. 
Revenue grew 5.9% and 6.2% on an organic constant-currency basis. Our combined insurance and financial services businesses grew 7.7% in the quarter. EBITDA grew 5.9% to $253 million. This growth excludes the prior-period gain on sale of warrants. EBITDA margins were 50.9% in the quarter. 
Within Decision Analytics, revenue grew 6.2% and 6.9% on an organic constant-currency basis. Again, this quarter, financial services was the fastest-growing vertical while insurance-focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to growth. 
Decision Analytics' insurance revenue grew 7.4% in the third quarter. We saw solid growth in underwriting, claims analytics and catastrophe modeling solutions. Loss quantification solutions also contributed to growth in the quarter. 
Customer retention remains very high, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. 
Financial services revenue increased 24.5% in the quarter, led by growth in analytical solutions and media effectiveness. We are seeing good interest in the solutions we are building with our partners and continue to believe that our differentiated data assets position us well to execute on our plans in this vertical. 
As reported, energy and specialized markets revenue was about flat. The continued weakness in the British pound remains a headwind to both revenue growth and Decision Analytics' margins on a reported basis. Consistent with our long-standing approach, WoodMac became a part of organic growth starting in the third quarter. Organic revenue, which excludes PCI, Infield, Greentech and Quest, declined $5.3 million in the quarter but increased slightly, excluding the impact of FX. 
Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.3% and 5% on an organic basis, continuing to demonstrate the value of our long -- to our long-standing insurance customers, contributions of new solutions that are in early stages and the inclusion of Risk Intelligence Ireland, which we have rebranded as Verisk Insurance Solutions - Ireland. 
Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.4%, reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions, such as predictive model and electronic rating content. 
Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 4.8% in the quarter. Growth was led by an increase in commercial underwriting solutions subscription revenue. 
EBITDA decreased 0.6% in the quarter to $253 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.9%. EBITDA growth, adjusted for the 2015 gain on sale of warrants, was 5.9%. EBITDA excludes a third quarter 2016 severance charge as we combined administrative functions following the WoodMac integration. It also excludes the gain on an investment in a company which was acquired by a third party. 
Decision Analytics EBITDA, excluding the prior-year gain, grew 7.3% to $147 million in the quarter. Decision Analytics EBITDA, as reported, decreased 3.7%. 
EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 4% to $106 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management, offset by increased staff levels following the previously announced talent realignment. 
Reported interest expense was $28 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at September 30, 2016. After using our proceeds from the healthcare divestiture to pay down debt, our pro forma leverage at the end of the third quarter was about 2.2x, below our 2.5x reference level. 
Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 26%. We saw a onetime benefit in the quarter from a change in the tax rates in the U.K. 
Adjusted net income in 3Q increased 8.1% to $144 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.84 in the quarter, an increase of 7.7%. Adjusted EPS increased because of solid operations, both organic and acquired, lower interest expense and lower taxes. The increases were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense and the 2015 warrant sale gain, which did not recur this year. Excluding the 2015 warrant gain, adjusted EPS grew 16.9%. 
The average diluted share count was 171.8 million shares in the quarter. On September 30, 2016, our diluted share count was 171 million shares. We repurchased 900,000 shares at an average price of $81.72 for a total cost of $73 million in the quarter. At September 30, we had about $280 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. 
Free cash flow increased 12.8% to $429 million for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2016, excluding the $75 million tax on the gain of the sale of the healthcare business. Free cash flow, excluding the tax, was 57.4% of EBITDA. These numbers are all continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by greater profitability of our businesses, the addition of WoodMac and lower CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and therefore shareholder value. 
Capital expenditures increased 0.8% to $88 million for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2016. And we continue to balance the capital intensity of the business with investing for future growth. CapEx was 5.9% of revenue year-to-date. We expect for the full year our CapEx will be about $10 million lower than we previously discussed as we manage efficiencies across our hardware and software spend, even while developing more software for solution delivery. 
As you think about your models for the remainder of 2016 on a continuing operations basis, please remember that in the fourth quarter, we expect to have a onetime P&L charge of $19 million related to the ESOP. This is a nonrecurring item related to adjustments made to the ESOP at the time of the IPO and will exclude -- be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. This does not affect the underlying business profitability, and we just want it to be on your radar ahead of time. This is really the final item that will be associated with ESOP adjustments. 
For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx from continuing operations of $140 million to $145 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $125 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. 
Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $120 million for the full year, and we estimate the tax rate to be around 31% for the full year. For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% to reflect the tax rates applicable to our intangible assets. 
And finally, we expect a full year diluted weighted average share count of about 171.6 million shares before incremental repurchases. 
We are executing on our 2016 plan despite larger-than-expected currency headwinds and are actively engaged in planning for the future. We're excited about the opportunities we see for profitable growth and remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investments for the long term. 
We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions]

And basically -- and actually, I mentioned 2 things that are in the environment right now. The other is it's a very quiet storm season, and in fact, it has been a quiet storm season for the last several years. And that does interact with the way that the reinsurance market behaves. And so there have been some combinations in the reinsurance world, including the brokers. And so you have that in the environment. So it's in there.

And the offset is the investment in new things, and we're actually just completing our annual refresh of our 5-year plans.

Across Verisk Analytics, I would say that you see a reflection in the business similar to that. So there are elements that are transactional, and others are longer term. I think, as Scott observed, we have -- the storm season can have some impact, both in transactional and some of the other items. And as we think forward to the quarter, I think we're just pushing hard to do everything that we can to position the business well for the future.

They would really like to, for the most part, not touch a lot of claims, which would save them money and actually improve their own relationship with customers. So I'm not sure we've been able to quantify TAM for all of that, but let me just describe to you some of the bigger things that we think are important. One we highlighted here is you underwrite a claim -- excuse me, if you underwrite a risk, you have a lot of information that is necessary to underwrite that risk. We want to take and move that to the front end. We want to do that upfront so the people can be quoting with all that information in mind. And I think that's a big opportunity. I think the other opportunity we highlighted here was energy. So bringing together the big data kind of world of what we do with WoodMac and the information we have with WoodMac and what we do with insurance, we have found, or at least we think, that the energy market is a little bit more specialized, it's a little bit the expertise of players in it, and they really have never had look-at views into a pricing or a risk assessment approach that we would do with traditional limited insurance. So this is more of an E&S-type asset. It's excess and surplus. It's big players across the world, and we think this is a, I would say, probably tens of millions type of TAM, if not larger."

And as Scott highlighted, it's become very much a priority over the last couple of years. There's 2 things I think we're doing well. There's a couple of places, particularly on the claims side of things, where we have a customer, they're using us in a geography -- let's use the U.K. as an example. They like the results they've gotten. We're able to demonstrate strong ROI, and that large global insurer takes us from the U.K. to other geographies. And ultimately, I think the plan would be to implement across all of their operations. Once we get into another geography and we customize for that geography, one of the things we always have to identify and understand is the insurance markets are very different. So we have to locally customize the software. And that's true of the things we've been trying to do and put in place so that we can then extend out beyond the one customer into many. There's other places -- kind of the second tack we've taken is we know markets that look and feel a lot like the U.S. market. It has maybe not the same regulation, but it has the same kind of nature of transfer risk. And we're good and knowledgeable, and we can help them. And to the extent that is maybe U.S. speaking, it has a more mature market, we're starting there because we can probably be most helpful. I think we've seen some opportunities to do things with buildings as an example. Big commercial buildings, we're very good at. We're very knowledgeable of a building that sits in some foreign location, has the same type of risk attributes, as long as we can get an understanding of the property characteristics and we can relate a building in whatever foreign region to something here in the United States, and we could build out with a lot of imagery. So we're following our customers, one. We're finding like markets, two. And we have a -- kind of a team that's really focused on trying to accelerate our growth internationally."

Let me provide a little color. One of the great parts of Verisk is we're deeply embedded into our customer workflows, and that's true of a lot of the competitors in which we go after, so if you were to think about where we try to provide information at the point of underwriting. So transitioning a customer from another solution to our solution just takes time. It takes a lot of effort from internal IT departments, and we just can't always control the timing of those things. We also have contracts that we know it's going to happen, but the timing and where they want to roll out. Sometimes they want to roll out regionally as opposed to across the nation. So those are the type of things that we are kind of referencing there when we talk about timing. So signed contracts, just looking to push implementation, where we own this, so we have as much control as we'd like. I think the other comment or at least the other thing Scott referenced was, in our world, we have a lot of subscription, pretty high visibility. Storms, storm activity affects some of our repair cost estimates. There's a variable aspect to that, and some of the contracts allow for additional charges when we have higher volumes. And just more broadly, if I'm answering your question right, storms, storm activity creates what is maybe some pricing opportunity for both reinsurers and primary insurers. And that helps the overall state of the market and really, just the mindset of insurers who, at this point, are really focused on cutting costs as opposed to growing their book and growing their top line, so a little bit of the mindset as well as a little transactional. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of color you're looking for."

First, customers generally have been under pressure, but I don't think it would be correct to draw the conclusion that -- if what you're picturing is a lot of industry consolidation and the exits of a lot of players, fewer belly buttons on the customer list or out in the market; that's actually not the case. And in fact, one of the reasons why we were interested to do the small tuck-ins that we did is, in some cases, they actually serve different segments of the market, for example, more pure-play E&P kinds of companies. And so actually, the net effect of all the acquisitions is that the customer list, which used to be circa 1,000, is now closer to 3,000. And so we're obviously very excited about the cross-sell opportunities inside of that. Let me just also remind everybody that one of the largest segments that is served by Argus is the financial services world. There are a lot of folks who are interested in understanding what's happening in the hydrocarbon ecosystem that are not -- oh, I'm sorry, did I say Argus? In the WoodMac, excuse me. I'm addressing WoodMac. There are -- one of the largest segments for WoodMac is the financial services segment. And because there are a lot of folks that are interested in the performance of the hydrocarbon ecosystem other than the oil and gas companies, and that segment has remained a very important part of what it is that we do. And then WoodMac is -- actually yesterday -- literally, yesterday, launched a new solution. And new solutions have always been a part of the WoodMac story and, I think, always will be a part of the WoodMac story. And yet another thing which is in the environment right now is the oil and gas companies have really trimmed their work staffs. And part of the effect of that is that when the rebound comes, and it will come -- I mean, you can just see it coming based upon lack of investment in CapEx. When it comes, the -- our customers will be a little bit shorthanded in terms of talent. And so we think that they'll want to make use of both of our sort of products as well as our services.

I think if you were to look at the number of insurers, most of the larger insurers use multiple models. So they would use both AIR and the competitive model. What we have seen is more and more people are using us or at least we're winning what I'll refer to as the primary modeling spot. If you're embedding this in the workflow, if you're part of that underwriting decision, the primary model is paid more. The secondary model is used as a reference point and to make sure things look right and kind of syncs up with a lot of different information. So it's a checkpoint. Our goal continues to be is to displace the competitor and drive towards being that primary model in the biggest insurers, where the competitors historically had a little bit more prominence. The other part of your question is, I would say to you that a large majority of, I would say, [ph] premiums of the world uses models. In some cases, they own them themselves and kind of have their own internal staff. In other cases, they work through brokers, and we license our product through brokers. So I think everyone has access to models. I think it becomes more prominent for larger insurers to own it and have it directly in-house for use by their internal staff. And they're using more and more models, too. So that's why Analyze Re provides an opportunity to kind of bring all of those modeled outcomes together. You can pick a region, you can pick a model, and you can kind of look at across the book in a portfolio way to do that. I think the last part of your question is we model 100 countries. I think it's 104 countries, all major perils. We will listen to our customers where they think there's economic loss to be covered, and we will attempt to build models where there's customer feedback and event. And we think we're pretty well covered, albeit we're always looking to improve and always looking to expand."

It's actually considerably more dynamic than just earthquakes and hurricanes and weather phenomena."

There are some segments whose current situations are sort of more leaning in and growth-oriented. And there are some where they've been more heavily impacted by some of the trends in the industry. So there's really no one answer which sort of covers all of that. The way that we manage inside of the energy vertical is the same way that we manage in the insurance vertical, actually everything we do, which is we take a comprehensive view of the relationship with the customer. So when we're thinking about making our proposals, it's a combination of when it's time to review the existing product or products, but also, we're always presenting new solutions that they're not using today. And where we come out on a customer-by-customer basis is essentially the net of all of that. So I would say that in the current moment, we've had to be particularly thoughtful about the pricing on like-over-like when we come to those renewal points. Bear in mind, by the way, that there are multiyear -- a number of multiyear agreements here, so it's not as if that really predominates in what goes on. But really, the outcomes in these negotiations with customers have really been kind of what we expected. And certainly, as we go forward and the environment normalizes, I think that -- I think there will be room there."

The things that kind of caused some ups and downs, if you will, clearly, we have the opportunity to sell more where there's a customer who's looking to expand services or a new insurer comes to be, when 2 insurers become one inside a merger, so obviously, that has some potentially some negative downward effect on the way we kind of price. You're correct, a large chunk of the contracts today are kind of multiyear subscriptions, and they have kind of an inflationary type of clause in there that is ongoing. Last piece of it is, inside the industry-standard programs, we continue to do a lot as it relates to new products and services. So if you were to think about ways that people take our content and bring it into their own solutions, we call it electronic rating content, that has been growing nicely. We've done a lot of work around analytics. We call it Risk Analyzer suite. Those are the type of things. But because of the way we contract, it's usually multiyear, and it's kind of spread evenly over the term.

I think it's just a very difficult process to try to connect with all the numerous contributors, all the different OEMs, as an example, and the 300, 400 insurers that may be interested in it. So we are making good progress with other OEMs, meaning other car manufacturers as well as folks who do central alarm systems and connected home, things like that because we think it will be a key element in understanding, assessing and rating the insurance policy. We've made good progress both here, and it also kind of creates a nice beachhead for some international expansion opportunities. So I think we are a little ahead of the markets right now, but I think we are well positioned. And Scott earlier mentioned there's a industry conference we're holding later this week, and that'll be a featured part of the presentations. And we'll have some news and information about that as well."

I was wondering, one, is that agreement exclusive? Or could you partner with potentially some of the others in that space, which is growing rapidly? And similarly, are you thinking of any alternative areas where you could use Argus data outside of the traditional credit suite?"
