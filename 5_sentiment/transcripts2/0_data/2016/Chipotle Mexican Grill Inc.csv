The fourth quarter was without question, the most challenging in our history, but we have responded and have implemented an industry-leading food safety program that reduces our food safety risks to as low to  zero as possible. And yesterday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that its E. coli investigation is over. And as we emerge from this difficult time, we can focus on what will be our primary objective for 2016: making sure our food is the safest possible and welcoming customers back to our restaurants as our teams will deliver actually dining experience. 
We're grateful for the way our restaurants and support departments responded over the last few months. We have been asking a lot of our teams, and they effectively implemented substantial improvements to our food safety practices. These enhanced standards will establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety. While this has been an unfortunate set of events, I am confident that Chipotle will emerge as a stronger company than we were before our recent challenges. 
Since opening the first Chipotle restaurant 22 years ago, it has been our aim to serve our guests food that is safe, delicious and wholesome. But the events of the last few months have shown us that we need to do better. The issues we are dealing with throughout the quarter adversely impacted our performance. During the quarter, our revenue was $998 million, a decrease of 7% on comparable restaurant sales decline of 15%. For the full year, revenue increased 10% to $4.5 billion with comparable restaurant sales flat for the full year. This produced diluted earnings of $2.17 per share for the quarter, a decrease of 43%, and diluted earnings per share of $15.10 for the full year, an increase of 7%. 
The pace of new restaurant openings was not affected by recent events. And we opened 79 new restaurants during the quarter, bringing our total number of openings to 229 for the year. We finished the year with 2,010 restaurants in total. 
To achieve our goal of establishing Chipotle as a leader in food safety, we have completed a comprehensive assessment of our supply chain and restaurant practices, from the farms and ranches that supply our ingredients to the restaurants where we are serving customers, to evaluate each and every ingredient. The objective of this food safety system is that we will reduce the risk of something that is happening again in our restaurant to as near to 0 as possible. In developing this plan, we established test safety protocol that go well beyond industry standard to ensure the quality and safety of all of our ingredients. The plan is designed to prevent unsafe food from ever entering our restaurants through the use of extensive testing and for washing in kitchens. even in the unlikely event that some still finds its way in our restaurants, we have improved our restaurant procedures to provide additional protection to prevent contamination of our food. 
Among specific components of this enhanced food safety system and plan are high resolution DNA-based testing of fresh produce and meats to identify harmful bacteria in these ingredients before they enter our supply. Under this testing protocol, a batch of any ingredient that does not meet our testing standards would be rejected well before it reaches our restaurants. These testing programs will allow us to continually improve our supply chain. 
Second, we have also added important changes to food handling and food preparation procedures including preparing tomatoes, lettuce and bell peppers in central kitchens and blanching some produce items including avocados, onions, jalapenos and in our restaurants before they are used, and new procedure for marinating chicken and beef, which now happen and distinct after the preparation of the fresh items. We're also marinating chopped onions, jalapenos and cilantro and citrus juice when we make sauces in . This process brings up flavor from these ingredients and adds another measure for food safety. 
And third, we have enhanced crew training program to make sure all of our teams understand all of the facets of our new food safety programs. Through education about foodborne illness and explaining why we have made these changes, we can assure that we are empowering our employees to carry out all these new protocols. 
While individual elements of these food safety programs stand on their own as risk mitigation steps, it's the combination of multiple layers of mitigation that provide us a high level of confidence in our food safety enhancements. The comprehensive nature of these enhancements is designed not only to address our ingredients and preparation procedures, but also to offer redundancies that will improve food safety and help Chipotle become an industry standard in this area. Of course, none of the changes affect our commitment to Food with Integrity, and we'll continue in our quest to find more sustainably raised ingredients including responsibly raised meat, organically grown produce and raised dairy. And we also expect to continue our local produce program when the local growing season returns this spring. 
We have established Chipotle as an industry leader by focusing on doing a few things very well. starts by buying high quality raw ingredients, preparing them using classic cooking techniques and serving them by people in an interactive format so every customer gets exactly what they want. And by creating a new people culture for top performers are empowered to achieve high standards and can deliver an exceptional and compelling customer experience. And now with our enhanced food safety program, we're poised to emerge stronger than ever before. Ultimately, we believe that this is best -- this is what is best for our company and our employees and our shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

We remain grounded in the vision on what makes Chipotle great: our amazing food made with high quality ingredients and classic cooking techniques and our unique people culture consisting of top performers empowered to achieve high standards. In 2016, we will leverage both our food culture and people culture as we focus our 2 primary objectives for the year: ensuring the safest food as possible and providing a terrific customer service and excellent restaurant experience. 
Since these challenges began and we started moving quickly to address them, we have asked a lot of our restaurant teams and they have responded very well, implementing improved procedures and techniques that will help our food safe and delicious as possible. Not only have our teams been diligent in doing all of what we have asked of them, but they have been eager to adopt new techniques to further improve food safety in our restaurants.  Now that the CDC investigation is over, our crews are excited to welcome customers back into our restaurants. 
Maintaining teams of top performers who are empowered to achieve has been one of the key drivers of our business for many years now. Having such dedicated restaurant support teams enable us to very quickly implement our enhanced food safety systems and achieve our goal of establishing Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety.  
Our restaurant teams are already well versed on the new procedures they have implemented in their restaurants, but that represents just one part of our overall food safety plan.  To share the entire plan with our employees, we are holding a national team meeting on February 8. The meeting will be broadcast live via satellite to hundreds of offsite locations across the country. In order for our employees to attend the meeting, we'll be opening our restaurant at 3 p.m. that day. This meeting is an opportunity for us to describe in detail to our whole team all the steps we taken to make our food safer before it ever arrives at the restaurants as well as to highlight and explain the reasons behind some of the new procedures that have ready been implemented in our restaurants. We know that our hard-working employees will continue to play a critical role in establishing Chipotle as a leader in food safety. And this meeting will also provide us with an opportunity to thank them for their hard work and dedication. 
In addition to the testing preparation changes and training Steve's discussed, we're also expanding our in-restaurant auditing programs. Under a new plan, our field leaders have been formally auditing every single restaurants on a weekly basis. And each restaurant will also be subject to quarterly audits by a third-party vendor. We are taking this expanded auditing program very seriously and changing incentives for managers and field leaders accordingly. Beginning in 2016, scores from our third-party auditor will account for half of our managers' bonuses. We believe this compensation realignment will further underscore for our managers and teams just how important it is to properly execute our food safety procedures, and all of this will help us in establishing culture of food safety in all of our restaurants. 
The other half of this bonus structure is tied to welcoming customers back to the restaurants. So our entire incentive compensation structure is designed on food safety and customer service. 
We are also completing a comprehensive food tracing system that will allow us to locate each ingredient we use from its source, such as the individual farm where it was produced, through our distribution system and our individual restaurants in real time. This system uses bar codes on each package of each ingredient. Ingredients are scanned at source and later at each point in the supply chain. As of today, the system is largely in place, and it allows us to track ingredients from the source to the distribution center. There is value in this type of data as completion of the program give us the ability to follow the movement and get information on ingredients to our entire system, in much the same way a package will be tracked through overnight delivery service. 
Our people culture and top-performing leaders are more important than ever before, and they give us confidence that we will succeed in becoming an industry leader in food safety. Experience has shown us that our restaurants are at their very best when we establish restaurateur cultures. So we will continue to emphasize the development of these leaders, who will ensure that our restaurants consistently provide extraordinary restaurant experience. 
While food safety will be a primary focus in 2016, our expectations for e-commerce programs and our growth restaurants largely unchanged as we have dedicated teams focused on these growth initiatives. However, I would note that we're going to leverage the new improved techniques that we are instituting at Chipotle to make sure that our are also excelling in food safety.  Likewise, we also be applying the same approach to the enhanced ingredients testing that will take place outside the restaurants. 
Lastly, we're -- continuing to cooperate in the grand jury investigation in California. We had anticipated that the investigation might broaden into a more national investigation. last week, we received a new subpoena replacing the one that we had announced at early January. The new subpoena requires us to produce documents and information related to companywide food safety matters dating back as far as January 1, 2013. So we'll continue to cooperate in the investigation as it moves forward. 
As you know, yesterday, the CDC called the E. coli investigation over. This is a milestone that has generated a lot of excitement from both customers and employees alike. Our employees have implemented an industry-leading food safety program, and they are eagerly looking forward to doing what they do best: serving amazing food and empowering others to achieve a high standard. And now CDC has confirmed this incident is behind us and resolved, which helps to send an all-clear signal to customers may have been hesitant in the recent months. On our end, we'll make sure our teams are ready to deliver an exceptional value to each of our customers when they return. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

Based on an expectation the CDC would likely declare the E. coli outbreak's over during the first week of February, many of our marketing programs are teed up to begin next week. Our marketing activities include both proactive communications and traditional marketing programs designed to increase customer visits. 
Before I discuss marketing activities, I'll provide an overview of our current customer research. Starting November 1, we have been running both daily and weekly research studies in order to keep close track of customer awareness and perception. Not surprisingly, consumer awareness of issues we have been dealing with for the last few months is high. And current research indicates that 63% of Chipotle customers and 60% of fast casual diners in general are aware of the foodborne illness issues at Chipotle. Of those who are our customers and also aware of the issues, right around 60% have indicated that it would cause them to visit less. 
While this research data is obviously not good news, our weekly data for the last 2 weeks is encouraging as it indicates a leveling off of what was a downward trend that started in late October. We have seen a leveling off and in some cases, a slight increase in consideration, admiration, first-time visits and date last visited. This is good news as our customers are indicating willingness to return to the restaurants. We are confident that with the news yesterday from the CDC and our ongoing efforts to communicate what all of the -- communicate all of the changes we have implemented at Chipotle, that we will see steady improvement in customer sentiment. And our research also indicates that once consumers are aware that food safety issues have been resolved, that many of them will come back to our restaurants. 
Beginning next week, we are launching a variety of marketing programs designed to invite our customers back into our restaurants. This effort includes a large traditional advertising that covers all of our major markets with outdoor, radio, print and digital advertising. This campaign is the largest in company history and this current wave is scheduled to run from February to the end of June. The creative for this campaign, with one small exception, does not mention food safety or the recent incidents. Instead, it reinforces our commitment to high-quality ingredients and great-tasting food. 
In addition to traditional advertising, we are launching a large direct marketing using traditional direct mail, mobile and social marketing platforms. Again, this will be the largest direct marketing effort in the company's history. The direct marketing efforts begin on February 8 and will continue through May, with the last expiration date being May 15. Other promotions, including a big game catering promotion and a digital game called Black Hunter, would also be occurring during this time frame. While most of these activities are focused on Q1 and Q2, we will of course be marketing throughout the year. We will use the response from these initial efforts to determine the specific plans for the second half of the year. We will also continue with our Cultivate Food Music Festival series. This year, festivals will held in Phoenix, Kansas City and Miami. 
Our marketing spend for the first half of the year will be significantly higher than previous years. And as we develop plans for the second half of the year, we expect to increase marketing costs for the full year. 
In addition to our advertising and direct marketing efforts, we are continuing with proactive communications designed to ensure that our customers are confident that it's safe to eat at Chipotle. On February 8, we are launching a new food safety website, which outlines all the steps we have taken in order to make our food the safest as it possibly can be. The site also reaffirms our commitment food integrity. 
What is most important is we have implemented a comprehensive food safety plan. And now that the recent CDC investigation is behind us, we are confident that our rest of marketing communication will help welcome many lapsed and new customers in to Chipotle.

For those of you that have been following our company over the last 10 years, 2016 will be a very different year for Chipotle as we emerge from last year's events. We believe that we've outlined a thoughtful and effective strategy to restore confidence in our brand. And we will be laser-focused on 2 things: first, implementing industry-leading food safety protocols; and second, working relentlessly to welcome our customers back to Chipotle. There'll be costs to our new food safety program, so we expect to see lower operating margins this year until our sales trend begin to recover. But we are confident we can win our customers back, and as they return to our restaurants over time, our margins can return to industry-leading levels. 
Sales in the fourth quarter were extremely volatile. Although comps for the quarter decreased 14% -- 14.6% overall, adverse impact became more severe throughout the quarter as awareness remained high. After quoting a low single-digit positive comp in October, we have net a negative 16% comp in November and a negative 30% comp in December. While December comps started out at a similar level as in November, the comps worsened significantly following national attention surrounding the Boston virus incident around December 7. Excluding that first week of sales, December comps averaged down about 34%. For the month of January, sales comps were down about 36%, worse than the December run rate due to tougher January comparisons, in the northeast and continued negative publicity. Comparisons become easier in February, but more importantly, we're anxious to begin the process of welcoming our customers back, which will begin in February with the marketing and PR that Mark talked about. Our teams are excited. Staff are ready to provide a terrific experience our customers when they return. 
As we aggressively work welcome our customers back, labor management and controls in general will not be priority. Instead set our team will schedule labor assuming a steep recovery because we would much rather be overstaffed and offer great customer service including wonderful throughput than to risk being shorthanded as a result of trying to overmanage labor costs. 
Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $2.17. This was above our expected range listed our recent 8-K. And the main driver behind the higher EPS was revaluation of noncash stock comp expense related to our 3-year performance shares in consideration of our current forecasts for 2016. This added $15 million to pretax income or about $0.31 to diluted EPS. 
Our margins and EPS results continue to be negatively affected by 3 main forces during this recovery. Those 3 forces include one, deleverage from lower sales; two, increased discretionary costs such as marketing and promotional costs as well as higher labor as we staff to welcome customers back; and three, ongoing costs to support our newly designed food safety programs. The impact of lower sales levels is of the most significant impact on our margins and results overall, and the impact flows through the entire P&L. Our restaurant-level margin were 19.6% in the fourth quarter, which is down 700 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 even though food costs were down 120 basis points. So in essence, our margins are really down over 800 basis points considering the lower food costs. Of this 820 basis point drop, the vast majority or over 500 basis points of that change, came from sales deleverage flowing through the entire restaurant P&L. 
Margins declined an additional 160 basis points related to nonrecurring costs such as food waste for our testing. And we lost another 150 basis points due to inefficiencies along with the beginning of new recurring costs to support our new food safety protocols. 
So obviously, the highest priority is to do everything possible to bring customers back in and ensure they are treated with terrific experience. And if we are successful in doing so, we know that we can eventually recover margins lost due to the deleveraging of sales. And we're also confident that we can recover inefficiencies that have arisen as we navigate through these challenges. 
The nonrecurring costs in the fourth quarter included about 70 basis points in food costs related to the discarding of food and costs related to extensive testing to the investigation. We had about 60 basis points in other operating expenses including new food safety kitchen equipment, increased insurance expense and marketing costs to plan for 2016 promotions. Finally, there was a $3 million charge related to the upgrading of some of our equipment, which hit the loss and disposal of assets line. 
There will be a recurring cost of implementing these enhanced safety programs. And although there is still a preliminary estimate, we believe there will be net recurring cost of around 200 basis points. This covers changes in procedures performed in our central kitchens and additional testing at our supply chain, net of potential labor savings. Most of these higher costs will be captured on the food cost line, which will result in estimated food cost for the full year 2016 of about 35%. 
There will also be about 20 basis points of new ongoing costs tied to the new food safety programs within the other operating costs line as we incur higher costs tied to new food safety audits and equipment and materials associated with our new food safety programs. Over time, we expect then there will be some modest labor savings to offset our increase our food safety costs, but we're cautious about expecting these in the near term until we begin to recover sales and gain efficiencies in our food safety programs and also as we invest in increased labor to support higher promotional sales. 
Our main objective in the short term would be to invest in labor to be fully staffed, highly trained and ready to deliver an extraordinary customer experience as we invite our customers back to our restaurants. In addition to these ongoing structural costs related to food safety, 2016 will incur on additional 50 basis points of marketing expenses compared to prior years and an additional 70 basis points of promotional expenses as we accelerate our ability to recover customers. Much of this will be front loaded in the first quarter. And we expect marketing to be around 3.5% of sales and combined marketing and promotion costs to be around 6% of sales, which is over 4x the combined marketing and promo as percent of sales in the first quarter last year.  For the full year, I would caution that we may choose to continue higher marketing promotional investment level later in the year depending on customer reaction and the state of our business.  
We also expect total G&A costs would be around $65 million higher for the full year in 2016 compared to 2015. The higher G&A is driven by performance-related factors in 2015 such as reduced bonuses, which were $17 million in 2015 lower than 2014 and lower stock comp of around $18 million, primarily as a result of revaluing the 3-year performance shares in 2015. We will also have additional costs in 2015 related to our All Manager Conference in the third quarter of $11 million, along with normal growth in G&A to support our growing restaurant base. We will continue to invest in our future growth today, but once our sales are fully recovered, we would expect future G&A to grow at a slower rate than sales. 
Overall, 2016 will be a year of significant investment to ensure our food is safe and to encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. Margins and earnings will be significantly affected as we make these important investments, but I am still confident that as recover sales, over time, we can also fully recover our margins and our earnings capabilities. 
Given the continued volatility of our sales trends, it is impossible to provide any meaningful outlook for sales comps or margins for the full year 2016. If appropriate, we will provide interim updates and sales trends as we have done with our 2 previous filed 8-Ks. 
While we cannot predict the magnitude and timing of our sales recovery, we can provide some perspective on the impact on margins at various comp levels. For example, when comps are down 30%, the combined effect of deleveraging along with marketing and ongoing food costs, food safety costs I talked about earlier, would result in expected restaurant level margin in the low-double digit range. If comps were to recover to down 20%, we would expect restaurant margins in the mid- to high teens. When sales fully recover, we would expect restaurant margin to be in the mid-20% range as we would recapture the margin related to deleveraging but still be funding the higher cost of the food safety programs. Of course, our margin recovery will lag our comp recovery as we don't want to be highly efficient in managing labor and the rest of the P&L, while our primary focus is welcoming and delighting our customers. So this should give idea of how the recovery might unfold. 
Specific to the first quarter, which represent a significant  investment in our future, we had combined rough start comp so far in January, the higher marketing and promo investment, the higher expected investment in labor to wow our customers, the fully loaded ongoing costs for our food safety program, the cost of hosting our company meeting and higher SG&A, it is likely we would post an EPS of around breakeven for the quarter. Q1 is clearly a heavy investment quarter. And if these investments pay off with a steady recovery of customers, the second, third and fourth quarters would improve dramatically. 
Also, for the full year, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be around 39%, slightly higher than the 2015 tax rate of 38.2% due to slightly higher state taxes. 
We continue to be optimistic in repurchasing our stock. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $338 million of stock at an average share price of $556, with more than $200 million purchased in the month of December alone at an average price of $527. During January, we purchased an additional $238 million at an average weighted price of $440 per share even though January has 2 less trading days than December. 
As of January 1, we maintain slightly over $1 billion of cash and investments, which means we continue to be in a position to opportunistically repurchase stock. And today, we're announcing that our board has approved an additional $300 million of share repurchases, bring our total to date authorization to $1.9 billion. As of January 31 including the new $300 million authorization, we have $478 million remaining to repurchase stock. 
What's most important right now is we remain focused on executing in our food safety protocol and enticing customers to come back to Chipotle and enjoy terrific meals served by enthusiastic team. continue to believe in the strength of the Chipotle brand and the opportunity return to an industry-leading economic model, which we know has the potential to create significant  by the 4 our shareholders.

Are we taking execution risk by opening up stores while implementing these procedures? A lot of the procedures are not happening in the restaurant.

We're doing that by testing or doing that by doing some of the washing and some of the prep in central kitchens, so it's guaranteed that nothing will get into the restaurant. And then the procedures there in the restaurant, there are not settled in terms of what they have done or not. what Steve talked about with blanching, if blanch for a matter of couple of seconds in boiling water it's an instant kill step. So it is not like you're relying on some kind of complex procedure or new process in the restaurant. It's a very clear step that went out. It is going to make each ingredient absolutely safe.

The fourth quarter was, without question, the most challenging in our history, but we have responded and have implemented an industry-leading food safety program that reduces our food safety risks to as low to  zero as possible. And yesterday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that its E. coli investigation is over. And as we emerge from this difficult time, we can focus on what will be our primary objective for 2016: making sure our food is the safest possible, and welcoming customers back to our restaurants as our teams deliver an extraordinary dining experience. 
We're grateful for the way our restaurants and support departments have responded over the last few months. We have been asking a lot of our teams, and they effectively implemented substantial improvements to our food safety practices. These new enhanced standards will establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety. While this has been an unfortunate set of events, I am confident that Chipotle will emerge as a stronger company than we were before our recent challenges. 
Since opening the first Chipotle restaurant 22 years ago, it has been our aim to serve our guests food that is safe, delicious and wholesome. But the events of the last few months have shown us that we need to do better. 
The issues we are dealing with throughout the quarter adversely impacted our performance. During the quarter, our revenue was $998 million, a decrease of 7% on comparable restaurant sales decline of 15%. For the full year, revenue increased 10% to $4.5 billion, with comparable restaurant sales flat for the full year. This produced diluted earnings of $2.17 per share for the quarter, a decrease of 43%; and diluted earnings per share of $15.10 for the full year, an increase of 7%. 
The pace of new restaurant openings was not affected by recent events. And we opened 79 new restaurants during the quarter, bringing our total number of openings to 229 for the year. We finished the year with 2,010 restaurants in total. 
To achieve our goal of establishing Chipotle as a leader in food safety, we have completed a comprehensive reassessment of our supply chain and restaurant practices, from the farms and ranches that supply our ingredients to the restaurants where we are serving customers, to evaluate each and every ingredient. The objective of this food safety system is that we will reduce the risk of something like this happening again in our restaurant to as near to zero as possible. 
In developing this plan, we established testing and safety protocols that go well beyond industry standard to ensure the quality and safety of all of our ingredients. The plan is designed to prevent unsafe food from ever entering our restaurants through the use of extensive testing and through washing in central kitchens. And even in the unlikely event that some pathogens still find its way into our restaurant, we have improved our restaurant procedures to provide additional protection to prevent contamination of our food. 
Among the specific components of this enhanced food safety system and plan are: High resolution DNA-based testing of fresh produce and meats to identify harmful bacteria in these ingredients before they enter our supply. Under this testing protocol, a batch of any ingredient that does not meet our testing standards would be rejected well before it reaches our restaurants. These testing programs will allow us to continually improve our supply chain. 
Second, we have also added important changes to food handling and food preparation procedures, including preparing tomatoes, lettuce and bell peppers in central kitchens; and blanching certain produce items, including avocados, onions, jalapenos and citrus in our restaurants before they are used; and a new procedure for marinating chicken and steak, which now happens distinct from and after the preparation of other fresh items. We're also marinating chopped onions, jalapenos and cilantro and citrus juice when we make these -- when we make sauces and guacamole. This process brings out more flavor from these ingredients and adds another measure of food safety. 
And third, we have an enhanced crew training program to make sure all of our teams understand all of the facets of our new food safety programs. Through education about foodborne illness and explaining why we have made these changes, we can assure that we are empowering our employees to carry out all these new protocols. 
While individual elements of these food safety programs stand on their own as risk mitigation steps, it's the combination of multiple layers of mitigation that provide us a high level of confidence in our food safety enhancements. The comprehensive nature of these enhancements is designed not only to address our ingredients and preparation procedures, but also to offer redundancies that will improve food safety and help Chipotle become an industry standard in this area. Of course, none of the changes affect our commitment to Food with Integrity, and we'll continue on our quest to find more sustainably raised ingredients, including responsibly raised meat, organically grown produce and pasture-raised dairy. And we'll also expect to continue our local produce program when the local growing season returns this spring. 
We have established Chipotle as an industry leader by focusing on doing a few things very well. It starts by buying high-quality raw ingredients, preparing them using classic cooking techniques and serving them by friendly people in an interactive format so every customer gets exactly what they want. And by creating a unique people culture where top performers are empowered to achieve high standards and can deliver an exceptional and compelling customer experience. 
And now with our enhanced food safety program, we are poised to emerge stronger than ever before. Ultimately, we believe that this is best -- this is what is best for our company and our employees and our shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

We remain grounded in the vision of what makes Chipotle great: our amazing food made with high-quality ingredients and classic cooking techniques, and our unique people culture consisting of top performers empowered to achieve high standards. In 2016, we will leverage both our food culture and people culture as we focus on our 2 primary objectives for the year: ensuring the safest food possible and providing a terrific customer service and excellent restaurant experience. 
Since these challenges began and we started moving very quickly to address them, we have asked a lot of our restaurant teams and they have responded very well, implementing improved procedures and techniques that will help make our food safe and delicious as possible. Not only have our teams been diligent in doing all that we've asked of them, but they have been eager to adopt new techniques to further improve food safety in our restaurants.  Now that the CDC investigation is over, our crews are excited to welcome customers back into our restaurants. 
Maintaining teams of top performers who are empowered to achieve high standard has been one of the key drivers of our business for many years now. Having such dedicated restaurant support teams enabled us to very quickly implement our enhanced food safety systems and achieve our goal of establishing Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety.  
Our restaurant teams are already well versed on the new procedures they have implemented in their restaurants, but that represents just one part of our overall food safety plan.  To share the entire plan with our employees, we are holding a national team meeting on February 8. The meeting will be broadcast live via satellite to hundreds of offsite locations across the country. In order for our employees to attend the meeting, we'll be opening our restaurant at 3 p.m. that day. This meeting is an opportunity for us to describe in detail to our whole team all the steps that we have taken to make our food safer before it ever arrives at the restaurants as well as to highlight and explain the reasons behind some of the new procedures that have ready been implemented in our restaurants. We know that our hard-working employees will continue to play a critical role in establishing Chipotle as a leader in food safety. And this meeting will also provide us with an opportunity to thank them for their hard work and dedication. 
In addition to the testing, preparation changes and training Steve discussed, we are also expanding our in-restaurant auditing programs. Under our new plan, our field leaders have been formally auditing every single restaurant on a weekly basis. And each restaurant will also be subject to quarterly audits by a third-party vendor. We are taking this expanded auditing program very seriously and changing incentives for managers and field leaders accordingly. Beginning in 2016, scores from our third-party auditor will account for half of our managers' bonuses. We believe this compensation realignment will further underscore for our managers and teams just how important it is to properly execute our food safety procedures. And all of this will help us in establishing a heightened culture of food safety in all of our restaurants. 
The other half of this bonus structure is tied to welcoming customers back to the restaurants. So our entire incentive compensation structure is designed around food safety and customer service. 
We are also completing a comprehensive food tracing system that will allow us to locate each ingredient we use from its source, such as the individual farm where it was produced, through our distribution system and our individual restaurants in real time. This system uses bar codes on each package of each ingredient. Ingredients are scanned at the source and subsequently, [indiscernible] point to the supply chain. As of today, this system is largely in place and allows us to track ingredients from the source to the distribution center. There is value in this type of data as completion of the program will give us the ability to follow the movement and get information on ingredients through our entire system, in much the same way a package will be tracked through an overnight delivery service. 
Our extraordinary people culture and top-performing leaders are more important than ever before, and they give us confidence that we will succeed in our mission of becoming an industry leader in food safety. Experience has shown us that our restaurants are at their very best when we establish restaurateur cultures. So we will continue to emphasize the development of these excellent leaders, who will ensure that our restaurants consistently provide extraordinary restaurant experience.
While food safety will be a primary focus in 2016, our expectations for e-commerce programs and our growth seed restaurants remain largely unchanged as we have dedicated teams focused on these growth initiatives. However, I would note that we are going to leverage the new improved techniques that we are instituting at Chipotle to make sure that our growth seeds are also excelling in food safety.  Likewise, we will also be applying the same approach to the enhanced ingredient testing that will take place outside the restaurants. 
Lastly, we're continuing to cooperate in the grand jury investigation in California. We had anticipated that the investigation might broaden into a more national investigation. And last week, we received a new subpoena replacing the one that we had announced in early January. The new subpoena requires us to produce documents and information related to a company-wide food safety matters, dating back as far as January 1, 2013. So we'll continue to cooperate in the investigation as it moves forward. 
As you know, yesterday, the CDC called the E. coli investigation over. This is a milestone that has generated a lot of excitement from both customers and employees alike. Our employees have implemented an industry-leading food safety program, and they are eagerly looking forward to doing what they do best: serving amazing food and empowering others to achieve high standards. And now CDC has confirmed that this incident is behind us and resolved, which helps us -- which helps to server as an all-clear signal to our customers that may have been hesitant in the recent months. On our end, we will make sure our teams are ready to deliver an exceptional dining experience to each and every one of our customers when they return. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

Based on an expectation that the CDC would likely declare the E. coli outbreak's over during the first week of February, many of our marketing programs are teed up to begin next week. Our marketing activities will include both proactive PR communications and traditional marketing programs designed to increase customer visits. 
Before I discuss the marketing activities, I'll provide an overview of our current customer research. Starting November 1, we have been running both daily and weekly research studies in order to keep close track of customer awareness and perception. Not surprisingly, consumer awareness of the issues we have been dealing with for the last few months is high. Our most current research indicates that 63% of Chipotle customers and 60% of fast casual diners in general are aware of the foodborne illness issues at Chipotle. Of those who are our customers and who are also aware of the issues, right around 60% have indicated that it would cause them to visit less. 
While this research data is obviously not good news, our weekly data for the last 2 weeks is encouraging as it indicates a leveling off of what was a downward trend that started in late October. We have seen a leveling off and, in some cases, a slight increase in consideration, admiration, first-time visits and date last visited. This is good news as our customers are indicating willingness to return to the restaurants. We are confident that with the news yesterday from the CDC and our ongoing efforts to communicate what all of the -- to communicate all of the changes we have implemented at Chipotle, that we will see steady improvement in customer sentiment. And our research also indicates that once consumers are aware that food safety issues have been resolved, then many of them will come back into our restaurants. 
Beginning next week, we are launching a variety of marketing programs designed to invite our customers back into our restaurants. This effort includes a large traditional advertising campaign that covers all of our major markets with outdoor, radio, print and digital advertising. This campaign is the largest in company history, and this current wave is scheduled to run from February to the end of June. The creative for this campaign, with one small exception, does not mention food safety or the recent incidents. Instead, it reinforces our commitment to high-quality ingredients and great-tasting food. 
In addition to traditional advertising, we are launching a large direct marketing campaign using traditional direct mail, mobile and social marketing platforms. Again, this will be the largest direct marketing effort in the company's history. The direct marketing efforts begin on February 8 and will continue through May, with the last expiration date being May 15. Other promotions, including a big game catering promotion and a digital game, called Block [ph] Hunter, will also be occurring during this time frame. 
While most of these activities are focused on Q1 and Q2, we will, of course, be marketing throughout the year. We will use the response from these initial efforts to determine specific plans for the second half of the year. We will also continue with our Cultivate food and music festival series. This year, the festivals will be held in Phoenix, Kansas City and Miami. 
Our marketing spend for the first half of the year will be significantly higher than previous years. And as we develop plans for the second half of the year, we also expect to increase marketing costs for the full year. 
In addition to our advertising and direct marketing efforts, we are continuing with proactive communications designed to ensure that our customers are confident that it's safe to eat at Chipotle. On February 8, we are launching a new food safety website, which outlines all the steps we have taken in order to make our food the safest as it possibly can be. The site also reaffirms our commitment to food integrity. 
What is most important is that we have implemented a comprehensive food safety plan. And now that the recent CDC investigation is behind us, we are confident that our restaurant marketing communication will help welcome many lapsed and new customers into Chipotle. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jack."

For those of you that have been following our company over the last 10 years, 2016 will be a very different year for Chipotle as we emerge from last year's events. We believe that we've outlined a thoughtful and effective strategy to restor",1896,"Thanks, Mark.  For those of you that have been following our company over the last 10 years, 2016 will be a very different year for Chipotle as we emerge from last year's events. We believe that we've outlined a thoughtful and effective strategy to restore confidence in our brand. And we will be laser-focused on 2 things: first, implementing industry-leading food safety protocols; and second, working relentlessly to welcome our customers back to Chipotle. 
There will be costs to our new food safety program, so we expect to see lower operating margins this year until our sales trends begin to recover. But we're confident that we can win our customers back. And as they return to our restaurants over time, our margins can return to industry-leading levels. 
Sales in the fourth quarter were extremely volatile. Although comps for the quarter decreased 14% -- 14.6% overall, the adverse impact became more severe throughout the quarter as awareness remained high. After quoting a low single-digit positive comp in October, we had net a negative 16% comp in November and a negative 30% comp in December. While December comps started out at a similar level as in November, the comp worsened significantly following the national attention surrounding the Boston norovirus incident around December 7. 
Excluding that first week of sales, December comps averaged down about 34%. For the month of January, sales comps were down about 36%, worse than the December run rate due to tougher January comparisons, weather in the northeast and continued negative publicity. Comparisons become easier in February, but more importantly, we're anxious to begin the process of welcoming our customers back, which will begin in February with the marketing and PR that Mark talked about. Our teams are excited, staffed and ready to provide a terrific experience to our customers when they return. 
As we aggressively work to welcome our customers back, labor management and P&L controls in general will not be a priority. Instead, our teams will schedule labor assuming a steep recovery, because we would much rather be overstaffed and offer great customer service, including wonderful throughput, than to risk being shorthanded as a result of trying to overmanage labor costs. 
Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $2.17. This was above our expected range listed in our recent 8-K. And the main driver behind the higher EPS was the revaluation of noncash stock comp expense related to our 3-year performance shares in consideration of our current forecasts for 2016. This added $15 million to pretax income or about $0.31 to diluted EPS. 
Our margins and EPS results continue to be negatively affected by 3 main forces during this recovery. Those 3 forces include: one, deleverage from lower sales; two, increased discretionary costs, such as marketing and promotional costs as well as higher labor as we staff to welcome customers back; and three, ongoing costs to support our newly designed food safety programs. 
The impact of lower sales levels is the most significant impact on our margins and results overall, and the impact flows through the entire P&L. Our restaurant-level margins were 19.6% in the fourth quarter, which is down 700 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, even though food costs were down 120 basis points. So in essence, our margins are really down over 800 basis points considering the lower food costs. Of this 820-basis-point drop, the vast majority or over 500 basis points of that change came from sales deleverage flowing through the entire restaurant P&L. 
Margins declined an additional 160 basis points related to nonrecurring costs, such as food waste of our related testing. And lost another 150 basis points due to inefficiencies, along with the beginning of new recurring costs to support our new food safety protocols. 
So obviously, the highest priority is to do everything possible to bring customers back in and ensure that they are treated with perfect experience. And if we're successful in doing so, we know that we can eventually recover margins lost due to the deleveraging of sales. And we're also confident that we can recover inefficiencies that have arisen as we navigate through this challenge.
The nonrecurring costs in the fourth quarter included about 70 basis points in food costs related to the discarding of food and costs related to extensive testing related to the investigation. We also had about 60 basis points in other operating expenses, including new food safety kitchen equipment, increased insurance expense and marketing costs to help plan for 2016 promotions. 
Finally, there was a $3 million charge related to the upgrading of some of our equipment, which hit the loss and disposal of assets line. 
There will be a recurring cost of implementing these enhanced and safety programs. And although this is still a preliminary estimate, we believe there will be a net recurring cost of around 200 basis points. This covers changes in procedures performed in our central kitchens and additional testing in our supply chain, net of potential labor savings. Most of these higher costs will be captured on the food cost line, which will result in estimated food cost for the full year 2016 of about 35%. 
There will also be about 20 basis points of new ongoing costs tied to the new food safety programs within the other operating costs line as we incur higher costs tied to new food safety audits and equipment and materials associated with our new food safety programs. 
Over time, we expect that there will be some modest labor savings to offset our increased food safety costs, but we're cautious about expecting these in the near term until we begin to recover sales and gain efficiencies in our food safety programs and also as we invest in increased labor to support higher promotional sales. Our main objective in the short term will be to invest in labor to be fully staffed, highly trained and ready to deliver an extraordinary customer experience as we invite our customers back into our restaurants. 
In addition to these ongoing structural costs related to food safety, 2016 will also incur an additional 50 basis points of marketing expenses compared to prior years and an additional 70 basis points of promotional expenses as we accelerate our ability to recover customers. Much of this will be front-loaded in the first quarter. And we expect marketing to be around 3.5% of sales and combined marketing and promotion costs to be around 6% of sales, which is over 4x the combined marketing and promo as a percent of sales in the first quarter of last year. For the full year, I would caution that we may choose to continue a higher marketing and promotional investment level later in the year, depending on customer reaction and the state of our business.  
We also expect total G&A costs will be around $65 million higher for the full year in 2016 compared to 2015. The higher G&A is driven by performance-related factors in 2015, such as reduced bonuses, which were $17 million in 2015 lower than 2014, and lower stock comp of around $18 million, primarily as a result of revaluing the 3-year performance shares [indiscernible] in 2015. We will also have additional costs in 2016 related to our All Manager Conference in the third quarter of $11 million, along with normal growth in G&A to support our growing restaurant base. We will continue to invest in our future growth today, but once our sales are fully recovered, we would expect future G&A to grow at a slower rate than sales. 
Overall, 2016 will be a year of significant investment to ensure our food is safe and to encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. Margins and earnings will be significantly affected as we make these important investments. But I'm still confident that as we recover sales, over time, we can also fully recover our margins and our earnings capabilities. 
Given the continued volatility of our sales trends, it's impossible to provide any meaningful outlook for sales comps or margins for the full year 2016. If appropriate, we will provide interim updates and sales trends as we have done with our 2 previously filed 8-Ks. 
While we cannot predict the magnitude and timing of our sales recovery, we can provide some perspective on the impact on margins at various comp levels. For example, when comps are down 30%, the combined impact of deleveraging, along with the added marketing and ongoing food costs -- food safety costs I talked about earlier, would result in expected restaurant level margins in the low-double digit range. If comps were to recover to down 20%, we would expect restaurant margins in the mid- to high teens. When sales fully recover, we would expect restaurant margin to be in the mid-20% range as we would recapture the margin related to deleveraging, but still be funding the higher cost of the food safety programs. Of course, our margin recovery will lag our comp recovery as we don't plan to be highly efficient in managing labor and the rest of the P&L, while our primary focus is welcoming and delighting our customers. So this should give you a general idea of how the recovery might unfold. 
Specific to the first quarter, which represent a significant  investment in our future, when you combine the rough start in comp so far in January, the higher marketing and promo investment, the higher expected investment in labor to wow our customers, the fully loaded ongoing costs for our food safety program, the cost of hosting our all-company meeting and the higher G&A, it is likely we will post an EPS that is around breakeven for the quarter. Q1 is clearly a heavy investment quarter. And if these investments pay off with a steady recovery of customers, the second, third and fourth quarters will improve dramatically. 
Also, for the full year, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be around 39%, slightly higher than the 2015 tax rate of 38.2% due to slightly higher state taxes. 
We continue to be optimistic in repurchasing our stock. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $338 million of stock at an average share price of $556, with more than $200 million purchased in the month of December alone at an average price of $527. During January, we purchased an additional $238 million at an average-weighted price of $440 per share, even though January had 2 less trading days than December. 
As of January 1, we maintain slightly over $1 billion of cash and investments, which means we continue to be in a position to opportunistically repurchase stock. And today, we're announcing that our board has approved an additional $300 million of share repurchases, bringing our total to life-to-date authorization to $1.9 billion. As of January 31, including the new $300 million authorization, we have $478 million remaining to repurchase stock. 
What's most important right now is that we remain focused on executing our food safety protocol and enticing customers to come back to Chipotle, enjoy terrific meals served by enthusiastic teams. We continue to believe in the strength of the Chipotle brand and the opportunity to return to an industry-leading economic model, which we know has the potential to create significant value for our shareholders. 
Thanks for your time today, and we'd be happy to open the lines for questions you may have."

They're not as familiar with the brand. But we saw a small drop-off in that top loyal, so it is definitely one of the targets that we're going after with our proactive communications.

In terms of Q1, just to give you a rough idea on dollar terms, Sharon, we'll spend probably around $50 million in combined marketing and promo.

When we look at other events, other companies that have gone through something like this, the recovery typically takes 4 or 5 quarters or so. We know that there are things that are different than what happened in previous cases. For one, we've had a couple instances here, so that kept us in the news a lot longer. Secondly, there's a lot more -- the news travel faster. There's a lot more chatter on social media. And so the word really travels fast, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately. And so we know that there are differences that might make this a little tougher. Our main objective was to -- once we have an event that signals that this is over, and we now have that in hand, to be very aggressive to invite customers in. And we're doing that. Mark talked about that. We're spending a lot more money on marketing and promotion than we've ever had before in dollar terms and in percentage of sales terms than we ever had before. We're telling our teams to staff their restaurants as if the steep recovery is coming for sure. So that when the recovery comes, if it comes a little slower, we'll still be ready. And so our main objective is to be aggressive with bringing customers in, being ready for when they come in. And we're hoping that, that will accelerate the recovery. If it took 4 or 5 quarters, as it has in other instances like this, I think that would be a fair way to think about it. But we won't know until the recovery starts. And then we'll share with you the cadence as it happens."

He's very familiar with these types of cases, and he's putting in an extraordinary testing procedure. So we test a lot of our high-risk items. Those items that can't be tested, like whole avocados, whole onions, things that we bring into our restaurant, we put in place a blanching procedure, which it's actually boiling these items in water for a brief period of time, 5 seconds, which destroys any microbe that might be on the surface. So even though we haven't identified the specific item, all of our items now that are high risk go through either this testing or this blanching kill step.

Hey, David, this is Jack, just to add something to that. What you're talking about here is execution risk. Are we taking additional execution risk by opening up stores while implementing these procedures? A lot of the procedures are not happening in the restaurant. Meaning, the testing is happening outside the restaurant. So a lot of this food safety program is designed to prevent anything unwanted from ever getting into the restaurant. We're doing that by testing or we're doing that by doing some of the washing and some of the prep in central kitchens, so it's guaranteed that nothing will get into the restaurant. And then the procedures that are in the restaurant, they're not subtle in terms of whether they're done or not. What Steve talked about with blanching, if you blanch for just a matter of couple of seconds in boiling water, it's an instant kill step. So it's not like you're relying on some kind of complex procedure or a new process in the restaurant, it's a very clear step that went out. It is going to make each ingredient absolutely safe. And so the execution risk in terms of opening up new restaurants is very, very low. If there was execution risk, we absolutely would do something to make sure we would reduce that execution risk.

The fourth quarter was, without question, the most challenging in our history, but we have responded and have implemented an industry-leading food safety program that reduces our food safety risks to as low to",984,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everybody. The fourth quarter was, without question, the most challenging in our history, but we have responded and have implemented an industry-leading food safety program that reduces our food safety risks to as low to  zero as possible. And yesterday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that its E. coli investigation is over. And as we emerge from this difficult time, we can focus on what will be our primary objective for 2016: making sure our food is the safest possible, and welcoming customers back to our restaurants as our teams deliver an extraordinary dining experience. 
We're grateful for the way our restaurants and support departments have responded over the last few months. We have been asking a lot of our teams, and they effectively implemented substantial improvements to our food safety practices. These new enhanced standards will establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety. While this has been an unfortunate set of events, I am confident that Chipotle will emerge as a stronger company than we were before our recent challenges. 
Since opening the first Chipotle restaurant 22 years ago, it has been our aim to serve our guests food that is safe, delicious and wholesome. But the events of the last few months have shown us that we need to do better. 
The issues we are dealing with throughout the quarter adversely impacted our performance. During the quarter, our revenue was $998 million, a decrease of 7% on comparable restaurant sales decline of 15%. For the full year, revenue increased 10% to $4.5 billion, with comparable restaurant sales flat for the full year. This produced diluted earnings of $2.17 per share for the quarter, a decrease of 43%; and diluted earnings per share of $15.10 for the full year, an increase of 7%. 
The pace of new restaurant openings was not affected by recent events. And we opened 79 new restaurants during the quarter, bringing our total number of openings to 229 for the year. We finished the year with 2,010 restaurants in total. 
To achieve our goal of establishing Chipotle as a leader in food safety, we have completed a comprehensive reassessment of our supply chain and restaurant practices, from the farms and ranches that supply our ingredients to the restaurants where we are serving customers, to evaluate each and every ingredient. The objective of this food safety system is that we will reduce the risk of something like this happening again in our restaurants to as near to zero as possible. 
In developing this plan, we established testing and safety protocols that go well beyond industry standards to ensure the quality and safety of all of our ingredients. The plan is designed to prevent unsafe food from ever entering our restaurants through the use of extensive testing and through washing in central kitchens. And even in the unlikely event that some pathogens still find its way into our restaurant, we have improved our restaurant procedures to provide additional protection to prevent contamination of our food. 
Among the specific components of this enhanced food safety system and plan are: High resolution DNA-based testing of fresh produce and meats to identify harmful bacteria in these ingredients before they enter our supply. Under this testing protocol, a batch of any ingredient that does not meet our testing standards would be rejected well before it reaches our restaurants. These testing programs will allow us to continually improve our supply chain. 
Second, we have also added important changes to food handling and food preparation procedures, including preparing tomatoes, lettuce and bell peppers in central kitchens; and blanching certain produce items, including avocados, onions, jalapenos and citrus in our restaurants before they are used; and a new procedure for marinating chicken and steak, which now happens distinct from and after the preparation of other fresh items. We're also marinating chopped onions, jalapenos and cilantro and citrus juice when we make these -- when we make sauces and guacamole. This process brings out more flavor from these ingredients and adds another measure of food safety. 
And third, we have an enhanced crew training program to make sure all of our teams understand all of the facets of our new food safety programs. Through education about foodborne illness and explaining why we have made these changes, we can assure that we are empowering our employees to carry out all these new protocols. 
While individual elements of these food safety programs stand on their own as risk mitigation steps, it's the combination of multiple layers of mitigation that provide us a high level of confidence in our food safety enhancements. The comprehensive nature of these enhancements is designed not only to address our ingredients and preparation procedures, but also to offer redundancies that will improve food safety and help Chipotle become an industry standard in this area. Of course, none of the changes affect our commitment to Food with Integrity, and we'll continue on our quest to find more sustainably raised ingredients, including responsibly raised meat, organically grown produce and pasture-raised dairy. And we'll also expect to continue our local produce program when the local growing season returns this spring. 
We have established Chipotle as an industry leader by focusing on doing a few things very well. It starts by buying high-quality raw ingredients, preparing them using classic cooking techniques and serving them by friendly people in an interactive format so every customer gets exactly what they want. And by creating a unique people culture where top performers are empowered to achieve high standards and can deliver an exceptional and compelling customer experience. 
And now with our enhanced food safety program, we are poised to emerge stronger than ever before. Ultimately, we believe that this is best -- this is what is best for our company and our employees and our shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

We remain grounded in the vision of what makes Chipotle great: our amazing food made with high-quality ingredients and classic cooking techniques, and our unique people culture consisting of top performers empowered to achieve high standards. In 2016, we will leverage both our food culture and people culture as we focus on our 2 primary objectives for the year: ensuring the safest food possible and providing a terrific customer service and excellent restaurant experience. 
Since these challenges began and we started moving very quickly to address them, we have asked a lot of our restaurant teams and they have responded very well, implementing improved procedures and techniques that will help make our food safe and delicious as possible. Not only have our teams been diligent in doing all that we've asked of them, but they have been eager to adopt new techniques to further improve food safety in our restaurants.  Now that the CDC investigation is over, our crews are excited to welcome customers back into our restaurants. 
Maintaining teams of top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards has been one of the key drivers of our business for many years now. Having such dedicated restaurant support teams enabled us to very quickly implement our enhanced food safety systems and achieve our goal of establishing Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety.  
Our restaurant teams are already well versed on the new procedures they have implemented in their restaurants, but that represents just one part of our overall food safety plan.  To share the entire plan with our employees, we are holding a national team meeting on February 8. The meeting will be broadcast live via satellite to hundreds of offsite locations across the country. In order for our employees to attend the meeting, we'll be opening our restaurant at 3 p.m. that day. This meeting is an opportunity for us to describe in detail to our whole team all the steps that we have taken to make our food safer before it ever arrives at the restaurants as well as to highlight and explain the reasons behind some of the new procedures that have ready been implemented in our restaurants. We know that our hard-working employees will continue to play a critical role in establishing Chipotle as a leader in food safety. And this meeting will also provide us with an opportunity to thank them for their hard work and dedication. 
In addition to the testing, preparation changes and training Steve discussed, we are also expanding our in-restaurant auditing programs. Under our new plan, our field leaders have been formally auditing every single restaurant on a weekly basis. And each restaurant will also be subject to quarterly audits by a third-party vendor. We are taking this expanded auditing program very seriously and changing incentives for managers and field leaders accordingly. Beginning in 2016, scores from our third-party auditor will account for half of our managers' bonuses. We believe this compensation realignment will further underscore for our managers and teams just how important it is to properly execute our food safety procedures. And all of this will help us in establishing a heightened culture of food safety in all of our restaurants. 
The other half of this bonus structure is tied to welcoming customers back to the restaurants. So our entire incentive compensation structure is designed around food safety and customer service. 
We are also completing a comprehensive food tracing system that will allow us to locate each ingredient we use from its source, such as the individual farm where it was produced, through our distribution system and our individual restaurants in real time. This system uses bar codes on each package of -- each ingredient. Ingredients are scanned at the source and subsequently at each point to the supply chain. As of today, this system is largely in place and allows us to track ingredients from the source to the distribution center. There is value in this type of data as completion of the program will give us the ability to follow the movement and get information on ingredients through our entire system, in much the same way a package will be tracked through an overnight delivery service. 
Our extraordinary people culture and top-performing leaders are more important than ever before, and they give us confidence that we will succeed in our mission of becoming an industry leader in food safety. Experience has shown us that our restaurants are at their very best when we establish restaurateur cultures. So we will continue to emphasize the development of these excellent leaders, who will ensure that our restaurants consistently provide extraordinary restaurant experiences.
While food safety will be a primary focus in 2016, our expectations for e-commerce programs and our growth seed restaurants remain largely unchanged as we have dedicated teams focused on these growth initiatives. However, I would note that we are going to leverage the new improved techniques that we are instituting at Chipotle to make sure that our growth seeds are also excelling in food safety.  Likewise, we will also be applying the same approach to the enhanced ingredient testing that will take place outside the restaurants. 
Lastly, we're continuing to cooperate in the grand jury investigation in California. We had anticipated that the investigation might broaden into a more national investigation. And last week, we received a new subpoena replacing the one that we had announced in early January. The new subpoena requires us to produce documents and information related to a company-wide food safety matters, dating back as far as January 1, 2013. So we'll continue to cooperate in the investigation as it moves forward. 
As you know, yesterday, the CDC called the E. coli investigation over. This is a milestone that has generated a lot of excitement from both customers and employees alike. Our employees have implemented an industry-leading food safety program, and they are eagerly looking forward to doing what they do best: serving amazing food and empowering others to achieve high standards. And now CDC has confirmed that this incident is behind us and resolved, which helps us -- which helps to serve as an all-clear signal to our customers that may have been hesitant in the recent months. On our end, we will make sure our teams are ready to deliver an exceptional dining experience to each and every one of our customers when they return. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

Based on an expectation that the CDC would likely declare the E. coli outbreak's over during the first week of February, many of our marketing programs are teed up to begin next week. Our marketing activities will include both proactive PR communications and traditional marketing programs designed to increase customer visits. 
Before I discuss the marketing activities, I'll provide an overview of our current customer research. Starting November 1, we have been running both daily and weekly research studies in order to keep close track of customer awareness and perception. Not surprisingly, consumer awareness of the issues we have been dealing with for the last few months is high. Our most current research indicates that 63% of Chipotle customers and 60% of fast casual diners in general are aware of the foodborne illness issues at Chipotle. Of those who are our customers and who are also aware of the issues, right around 60% have indicated that it would cause them to visit less. 
While this research data is obviously not good news, our weekly data for the last 2 weeks is encouraging as it indicates a leveling off of what was a downward trend that started in late October. We have seen a leveling off and, in some cases, a slight increase in consideration, admiration, first-time visits and date last visited. This is good news as our customers are indicating willingness to return to the restaurants. We are confident that with the news yesterday from the CDC and our ongoing efforts to communicate what all of the -- to communicate all of the changes we have implemented at Chipotle, that we will see steady improvement in customer sentiment. And our research also indicates that once consumers are aware that food safety issues have been resolved, then many of them will come back into our restaurants. 
Beginning next week, we are launching a variety of marketing programs designed to invite our customers back into our restaurants. This effort includes a large traditional advertising campaign that covers all of our major markets with outdoor, radio, print and digital advertising. This campaign is the largest in company history, and this current wave is scheduled to run from February to the end of June. The creative for this campaign, with one small exception, does not mention food safety or the recent incidents. Instead, it reinforces our commitment to high-quality ingredients and great-tasting food. 
In addition to traditional advertising, we are launching a large direct marketing campaign using traditional direct mail, mobile and social marketing platforms. Again, this will be the largest direct marketing effort in the company's history. The direct marketing efforts begin on February 8 and will continue through May, with the last expiration date being May 15. Other promotions, including a big game catering promotion and a digital game, called Block [ph] Hunter, will also be occurring during this time frame. 
While most of these activities are focused on Q1 and Q2, we will, of course, be marketing throughout the year. We will use the response from these initial efforts to determine specific plans for the second half of the year. We will also continue with our Cultivate food and music festival series. This year, the festivals will be held in Phoenix, Kansas City and Miami. 
Our marketing spend for the first half of the year will be significantly higher than previous years. And as we develop plans for the second half of the year, we also expect to increase marketing costs for the full year. 
In addition to our advertising and direct marketing efforts, we are continuing with proactive communications designed to ensure that our customers are confident that it's safe to eat at Chipotle. On February 8, we are launching a new food safety website, which outlines all the steps we have taken in order to make our food the safest as it possibly can be. The site also reaffirms our commitment to food integrity. 
What is most important is that we have implemented a comprehensive food safety plan. And now that the recent CDC investigation is behind us, we are confident that our restaurant marketing communication will help welcome many lapsed and new customers into Chipotle.

There will be costs to our new food safety program, so we expect to see lower operating margins this year until our sales trends begin to recover. But we're confident that we can win our customers back. And as they return to our restaurants over time, our margins can return to industry-leading levels. 
Sales during the fourth quarter were extremely volatile. Although comps for the quarter decreased 14% -- 14.6% overall, the adverse impact became more severe throughout the quarter as awareness remained high. After posting a low single-digit positive comp in October, we had net a negative 16% comp in November and a negative 30% comp in December. While December comps started out at a similar level as in November, the comp worsened significantly following the national attention surrounding the Boston norovirus incident around December 7. 
Excluding that first week of sales, December comps averaged down about 34%. For the month of January, sales comps were down about 36%, worse than the December run rate due to tougher January comparisons, weather in the northeast and continued negative publicity. Comparisons become easier in February, but more importantly, we're anxious to begin the process of welcoming our customers back, which will begin in February with the marketing and PR that Mark talked about. Our teams are excited, staffed and ready to provide a terrific experience to our customers when they return. 
As we aggressively work to welcome our customers back, labor management and P&L controls in general will not be a priority. Instead, our teams will schedule labor assuming a steep recovery, because we would much rather be overstaffed and offer great customer service, including wonderful throughput, than to risk being shorthanded as a result of trying to overmanage labor costs. 
Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $2.17. This was above our expected range listed in our recent 8-K. And the main driver behind the higher EPS was the revaluation of noncash stock comp expense related to our 3-year performance shares in consideration of our current forecasts for 2016. This added $15 million to pretax income or about $0.31 to diluted EPS. 
Our margins and EPS results continue to be negatively affected by 3 main forces during this recovery. Those 3 forces include: one, deleverage from lower sales; two, increased discretionary costs, such as marketing and promotional costs as well as higher labor as we staff to welcome customers back; and three, ongoing costs to support our newly designed food safety programs. 
The impact of lower sales levels is the most significant impact on our margins and results overall, and the impact flows through the entire P&L. Our restaurant-level margins were 19.6% in the fourth quarter, which is down 700 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, even though food costs were down 120 basis points. So in essence, our margins are really down over 800 basis points considering the lower food costs. Of this 820-basis-point drop, the vast majority or over 500 basis points of that change came from sales deleverage flowing through the entire restaurant P&L. 
Margins declined an additional 160 basis points related to nonrecurring costs, such as food waste of our related testing. And lost another 150 basis points due to inefficiencies, along with the beginning of new recurring costs to support our new food safety protocols. 
So obviously, the highest priority is to do everything possible to bring customers back in and ensure that they are treated with perfect experience. And if we're successful in doing so, we know that we can eventually recover margins lost due to the deleveraging of sales. And we're also confident that we can recover inefficiencies that have arisen as we navigate through this challenge.
The nonrecurring costs in the fourth quarter included about 70 basis points in food costs related to the discarding of food and costs related to extensive testing related to the investigation. We also had about 60 basis points in other operating expenses, including new food safety kitchen equipment, increased insurance expense and marketing costs to help plan for 2016 promotions. 
Finally, there was a $3 million charge related to the upgrading of some of our equipment, which hit the loss and disposal of assets line. 
There will be a recurring cost of implementing these enhanced and safety programs. And although this is still a preliminary estimate, we believe there will be a net recurring cost of around 200 basis points. This covers changes in procedures performed in our central kitchens and additional testing in our supply chain, net of potential labor savings. Most of these higher costs will be captured on the food cost line, which will result in estimated food costs for the full year 2016 of about 35%. 
There will also be about 20 basis points of new ongoing costs tied to the new food safety programs within the other operating costs line as we incur higher costs tied to new food safety audits and equipment and materials associated with our new food safety programs. 
Over time, we expect that there will be some modest labor savings to offset our increased food safety costs, but we're cautious about expecting these in the near term until we begin to recover sales and gain efficiencies in our food safety programs and also as we invest in increased labor to support higher promotional sales. Our main objective in the short term will be to invest in labor to be fully staffed, highly trained and ready to deliver an extraordinary customer experience as we invite our customers back into our restaurants. 
In addition to these ongoing structural costs related to food safety, 2016 will also incur an additional 50 basis points of marketing expenses compared to prior years and an additional 70 basis points of promotional expenses as we accelerate our ability to recover customers. Much of this will be front-loaded in the first quarter. And we expect marketing to be around 3.5% of sales and combined marketing and promotion costs to be around 6% of sales, which is over 4x the combined marketing and promo as a percent of sales in the first quarter of last year. For the full year, I would caution that we may choose to continue a higher marketing and promotional investment level later in the year, depending on customer reaction and the state of our business.  
We also expect total G&A costs will be around $65 million higher for the full year in 2016 compared to 2015. The higher G&A is driven by performance-related factors in 2015, such as reduced bonuses, which were $17 million in 2015 lower than 2014, and lower stock comp of around $18 million, primarily as a result of revaluing the 3-year performance shares granted [indiscernible] in 2015. We will also have additional costs in 2016 related to our All Manager Conference in the third quarter of $11 million, along with normal growth in G&A to support our growing restaurant base. We will continue to invest in our future growth today, but once our sales are fully recovered, we would expect future G&A to grow at a slower rate than sales. 
Overall, 2016 will be a year of significant investment to ensure our food is safe and to encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. Margins and earnings will be significantly affected as we make these important investments. But I'm still confident that as we recover sales, over time, we can also fully recover our margins and our earnings capabilities. 
Given the continued volatility of our sales trends, it's impossible to provide any meaningful outlook for sales comps or margins for the full year 2016. If appropriate, we will provide interim updates on sales trends as we have done with our 2 previously filed 8-Ks. 
While we cannot predict the magnitude and timing of our sales recovery, we can provide some perspective on the impact on margins at various comp levels. For example, when comps are down 30%, the combined impact of deleveraging, along with the added marketing and ongoing food costs -- food safety costs I talked about earlier, would result in expected restaurant level margins in the low-double digit range. If comps were to recover to down 20%, we would expect restaurant margins in the mid- to high teens. When sales fully recover, we would expect restaurant margin to be in the mid-20% range as we would recapture the margin related to deleveraging, but still be funding the higher cost of the food safety programs. Of course, our margin recovery will lag our comp recovery as we don't plan to be highly efficient in managing labor and the rest of the P&L, while our primary focus is welcoming and delighting our customers. So this should give you a general idea of how the recovery might unfold. 
Specific to the first quarter, which will represent a significant  investment in our future, when you combine the rough start in comp so far in January, the higher marketing and promo investment, the higher expected investment in labor to wow our customers, the fully loaded ongoing costs for our food safety program, the costs of hosting our all-company meeting and the higher G&A, it is likely we will post an EPS that is around breakeven for the quarter. Q1 is clearly a heavy investment quarter. And if these investments pay off with a steady recovery of customers, the second, third and fourth quarters will improve dramatically. 
Also, for the full year, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be around 39%, slightly higher than the 2015 tax rate of 38.2% due to slightly higher state taxes. 
We continue to be optimistic in repurchasing our stock. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $338 million of stock at an average share price of $556, with more than $200 million purchased in the month of December alone at an average price of $527. During January, we purchased an additional $238 million at an average-weighted price of $440 per share, even though January had 2 less trading days than December. 
As of January 1, we maintain slightly over $1 billion of cash and investments, which means we continue to be in a position to opportunistically repurchase stock. And today, we're announcing that our board has approved an additional $300 million of share repurchases, bringing our total to life-to-date authorization to $1.9 billion. As of January 31, including the new $300 million authorization, we have $478 million remaining to repurchase stock. 
What's most important right now is that we remain focused on executing our food safety protocol and enticing customers to come back to Chipotle, enjoy terrific meals served by enthusiastic teams. We continue to believe in the strength of the Chipotle brand and the opportunity to return to an industry-leading economic model, which we know has the potential to create significant value for our shareholders. 
Thanks for your time today, and we'd be happy to open the lines for questions you may have."

They're not as familiar with the brand. But we saw a small drop-off in that top loyal, so it is definitely one of the targets that we're going after with our proactive communications.

I tried to take into account some sloppiness, either inefficiencies or some kind of onetime costs, even though it's hard to pinpoint exactly what those onetime costs are now. The biggest single impact that we're going to have on our margins is going to be sales recovery. And so if we recover to 20%, for example, we can have margins in the high teens. In terms of the single biggest thing that's going to hit the first quarter is going to be promotion and marketing. That's going to be 6%, so 6% of sales. And that will be a lot, lot, lot higher than we spent in the past by 4x in terms of percentage of sales and 3.5x in terms of the dollars that we spent last year. That's going to be the single biggest nonrecurring. Other than that, it's going to be little nonrecurring things here and there that it's hard to get a handle on right now.

In terms of Q1, just to give you a rough idea on dollar terms, Sharon, we'll spend probably around $50 million in combined marketing and promo.

I hope to be able to come back and tell you that, that cost is a lot higher, because a lot more people redeemed their offer.

We're telling our teams to staff their restaurants as if the steep recovery is coming for sure. So that when the recovery comes, if it comes a little slower, we'll still be ready.

He's very familiar with these types of cases, and he's putting in an extraordinary testing procedure. So we test a lot of our high-risk items. Those items that can't be tested, like whole avocados, whole onions, things that we bring into our restaurant, we put in place a blanching procedure, which it's actually boiling these items in water for a brief period of time, 5 seconds, which destroys any microbe that might be on the surface. So even though we haven't identified the specific item, all of our items now that are high risk go through either this testing or this blanching kill step.

And then the procedures that are in the restaurant, they're not subtle in terms of whether they're done or not. What Steve talked about with blanching, if you blanch for just a matter of couple of seconds in boiling water, it's an instant kill step. So it's not like you're relying on some kind of complex procedure or a new process in the restaurant, it's a very clear step that when followed, it is going to make each ingredient absolutely safe.

The fourth quarter was, without question, the most challenging in our history, but we have responded and have implemented an industry-leading food safety program that reduces our food safety risks to as low to",985,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everybody. The fourth quarter was, without question, the most challenging in our history, but we have responded and have implemented an industry-leading food safety program that reduces our food safety risks to as low to  zero as possible. And yesterday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that its E. coli investigation is over. And as we emerge from this difficult time, we can focus on what will be our primary objective for 2016: making sure our food is as safe as possible, and welcoming customers back to our restaurants as our teams deliver an extraordinary dining experience. 
We're grateful for the way our restaurants and support departments have responded over the last few months. We have been asking a lot of our teams, and they effectively implemented substantial improvements to our food safety practices. These new enhanced standards will establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety. While this has been an unfortunate set of events, I am confident that Chipotle will emerge as a stronger company than we were before our recent challenges. 
Since opening the first Chipotle restaurant 22 years ago, it has been our aim to serve our guests food that is safe, delicious and wholesome. But the events of the last few months have shown us that we need to do better. 
The issues we are dealing with throughout the quarter adversely impacted our performance. During the quarter, our revenue was $998 million, a decrease of 7% on comparable restaurant sales decline of 15%. For the full year, revenue increased 10% to $4.5 billion, with comparable restaurant sales flat for the full year. This produced diluted earnings of $2.17 per share for the quarter, a decrease of 43%; and diluted earnings per share of $15.10 for the full year, an increase of 7%. 
The pace of new restaurant openings was not affected by recent events. And we opened 79 new restaurants during the quarter, bringing our total number of openings to 229 for the year. We finished the year with 2,010 restaurants in total. 
To achieve our goal of establishing Chipotle as a leader in food safety, we have completed a comprehensive reassessment of our supply chain and restaurant practices, from the farms and ranches that supply our ingredients to the restaurants where we are serving customers, to evaluate each and every ingredient. The objective of this food safety system is that we will reduce the risk of something like this happening again in our restaurants to as near to zero as possible. 
In developing this plan, we established testing and safety protocols that go well beyond industry standards to ensure the quality and safety of all of our ingredients. The plan is designed to prevent unsafe food from ever entering our restaurants through the use of extensive testing and through washing in central kitchens. And even in the unlikely event that some pathogens still find its way into our restaurant, we have improved our restaurant procedures to provide additional protection to prevent contamination of our food. 
Among the specific components of this enhanced food safety system and plan are: High resolution DNA-based testing of fresh produce and meats to identify harmful bacteria in these ingredients before they enter our supply. Under this testing protocol, a batch of any ingredient that does not meet our testing standards would be rejected well before it reaches our restaurants. These testing programs will allow us to continually improve our supply chain. 
Second, we have also added important changes to food handling and food preparation procedures, including preparing tomatoes, lettuce and bell peppers in central kitchens; and blanching certain produce items, including avocados, onions, jalapenos and citrus in our restaurants before they are used; and a new procedure for marinating chicken and steak, which now happens distinct from and after the preparation of other fresh items. We're also marinating chopped onions, jalapenos and cilantro and citrus juice when we make these -- when we make salsas and guacamole. This process brings out more flavor from these ingredients and adds another measure of food safety. 
And third, we have an enhanced crew training program to make sure all of our teams understand all of the facets of our new food safety programs. Through education about foodborne illness and explaining why we have made these changes, we can assure that we are empowering our employees to carry out all these new protocols. 
While individual elements of these food safety programs stand on their own as risk mitigation steps, it's the combination of multiple layers of mitigation that provide us a high level of confidence in our food safety enhancements. The comprehensive nature of these enhancements is designed not only to address our ingredients and preparation procedures, but also to offer redundancies that will improve food safety and help Chipotle become an industry standard in this area. Of course, none of the changes affect our commitment to Food with Integrity, and we'll continue on our quest to find more sustainably raised ingredients, including responsibly raised meat, organically grown produce and pasture-raised dairy. And we'll also expect to continue our local produce program when the local growing season returns this spring. 
We have established Chipotle as an industry leader by focusing on doing a few things very well. It starts by buying high-quality raw ingredients, preparing them using classic cooking techniques and serving them by friendly people in an interactive format so every customer gets exactly what they want. And by creating a unique people culture where top performers are empowered to achieve high standards and can deliver an exceptional and compelling customer experience. 
And now with our enhanced food safety program, we are poised to emerge stronger than ever before. Ultimately, we believe that this is best -- this is what is best for our company and our employees and our shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

We remain grounded in the vision of what makes Chipotle great: our amazing food made with high-quality ingredients and classic cooking techniques, and our unique people culture consisting of top performers empowered to achieve high standards. In 2016, we will leverage both our food culture and people culture as we focus on our 2 primary objectives for the year: ensuring the safest food possible and providing a terrific customer service and excellent restaurant experience. 
Since these challenges began and we started moving very quickly to address them, we have asked a lot of our restaurant teams and they have responded very well, implementing improved procedures and techniques that will help make our food safe and delicious as possible. Not only have our teams been diligent in doing all that we've asked of them, but they have been eager to adopt new techniques to further improve food safety in our restaurants.  Now that the CDC investigation is over, our crews are excited to welcome customers back into our restaurants. 
Maintaining teams of top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards has been one of the key drivers of our business for many years now. Having such dedicated restaurant support teams enabled us to very quickly implement our enhanced food safety systems and achieve our goal of establishing Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety.  
Our restaurant teams are already well versed on the new procedures they have implemented in their restaurants, but that represents just one part of our overall food safety plan.  To share the entire plan with our employees, we are holding a national team meeting on February 8. The meeting will be broadcast live via satellite to hundreds of offsite locations across the country. In order for our employees to attend the meeting, we'll be opening our restaurant at 3 p.m. that day. This meeting is an opportunity for us to describe in detail to our whole team all the steps that we have taken to make our food safer before it ever arrives at the restaurants as well as to highlight and explain the reasons behind some of the new procedures that have already been implemented in our restaurants. We know that our hard-working employees will continue to play a critical role in establishing Chipotle as a leader in food safety. And this meeting will also provide us with an opportunity to thank them for their hard work and dedication. 
In addition to the testing, preparation changes and training Steve discussed, we are also expanding our in-restaurant auditing programs. Under our new plan, our field leaders have been formally auditing every single restaurant on a weekly basis. And each restaurant will also be subject to quarterly audits by a third-party vendor. We are taking this expanded auditing program very seriously and changing incentives for managers and field leaders accordingly. Beginning in 2016, scores from our third-party auditor will account for half of our managers' bonuses. We believe this compensation realignment will further underscore for our managers and teams just how important it is to properly execute our food safety procedures. And all of this will help us in establishing a heightened culture of food safety in all of our restaurants. 
The other half of this bonus structure is tied to welcoming customers back to the restaurants. So our entire incentive compensation structure is designed around food safety and customer service. 
We are also completing a comprehensive food tracing system that will allow us to locate each ingredient we use from its source, such as the individual farm where it was produced, through our distribution system and our individual restaurants in real time. This system uses bar codes on each package of -- each ingredient. Ingredients are scanned at the source and subsequently at each point to the supply chain. As of today, this system is largely in place and allows us to track ingredients from the source to the distribution center. There is value in this type of data as completion of the program will give us the ability to follow the movement and get information on ingredients through our entire system, in much the same way a package will be tracked through an overnight delivery service. 
Our extraordinary people culture and top-performing leaders are more important than ever before, and they give us confidence that we will succeed in our mission of becoming an industry leader in food safety. Experience has shown us that our restaurants are at their very best when we establish restaurateur cultures. So we will continue to emphasize the development of these excellent leaders, who will ensure that our restaurants consistently provide extraordinary restaurant experiences.
 
While food safety will be a primary focus in 2016, our expectations for e-commerce programs and our growth seed restaurants remain largely unchanged as we have dedicated teams focused on these growth initiatives. However, I would note that we are going to leverage the new improved techniques that we are instituting at Chipotle to make sure that our growth seeds are also excelling in food safety.  Likewise, we will also be applying the same approach to the enhanced ingredient testing that will take place outside the restaurants. 
Lastly, we're considering -- continuing to cooperate in the grand jury investigation in California. We had anticipated that the investigation might broaden into a more national investigation. And last week, we received a new subpoena replacing the one that we had announced in early January. The new subpoena requires us to produce documents and information related to a company-wide food safety matters, dating back as far as January 1, 2013. So we'll continue to cooperate in the investigation as it moves forward. 
As you know, yesterday, the CDC called the E. coli investigation over. This is a milestone that has generated a lot of excitement for both customers and employees alike. Our employees have implemented an industry-leading food safety program, and they are eagerly looking forward to doing what they do best: serving amazing food and empowering others to achieve high standards. And now CDC has confirmed that this incident is behind us and resolved, which helps us to serve as an all-clear signal to our customers that may have been hesitant in the recent months. On our end, we will make sure our teams are ready to deliver an exceptional dining experience to each and every one of our customers when they return. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

Based on an expectation that the CDC would likely declare the E. coli outbreak's over during the first week of February, many of our marketing programs are teed up to begin next week. Our marketing activities will include both proactive PR communications and traditional marketing programs designed to increase customer visits. 
Before I discuss the marketing activities, I'll provide an overview of our current customer research. Starting November 1, we have been running both daily and weekly research studies in order to keep close track of customer awareness and perception. Not surprisingly, consumer awareness of the issues we have been dealing with for the last few months is high. Our most current research indicates that 63% of Chipotle customers and 60% of fast casual diners in general are aware of the foodborne illness issues at Chipotle. Of those who are our customers and who are also aware of the issues, right around 60% have indicated that it would cause them to visit less. 
While this research data is obviously not good news, our weekly data for the last 2 weeks is encouraging as it indicates a leveling off of what was a downward trend that started in late October. We have seen a leveling off and, in some cases, a slight increase in consideration, admiration, first-time visits and date last visited. This is good news as our customers are indicating willingness to return to the restaurants. We are confident that with the news yesterday from the CDC and our ongoing efforts to communicate what all of the -- to communicate all of the changes we have implemented at Chipotle, that we will see steady improvement in customer sentiment. And our research also indicates that once consumers are aware that food safety issues have been resolved, that many of them will come back into our restaurants. 
Beginning next week, we are launching a variety of marketing programs designed to invite our customers back into our restaurants. This effort includes a large traditional advertising campaign that covers all of our major markets with outdoor, radio, print and digital advertising. This campaign is the largest in company history, and this current wave is scheduled to run from February to the end of June. The creative for this campaign, with one small exception, does not mention food safety or the recent incidents. Instead, it reinforces our commitment to high-quality ingredients and great-tasting food. 
In addition to traditional advertising, we are launching a large direct marketing campaign using traditional direct mail, mobile and social marketing platforms. Again, this will be the largest direct marketing effort in the company's history. The direct marketing efforts begin on February 8 and will continue through May, with the last expiration date being May 15. Other promotions, including a big game catering promotion and a digital game called Guac Hunter, will also be occurring during this time frame. 
While most of these activities are focused on Q1 and Q2, we will, of course, be marketing throughout the year. We will use the response from these initial efforts to determine specific plans for the second half of the year. We will also continue with our Cultivate food and music festival series. This year, the festivals will be held in Phoenix, Kansas City and Miami. 
Our marketing spend for the first half of the year will be significantly higher than previous years. And as we develop plans for the second half of the year, we also expect to increase marketing costs for the full year. 
In addition to our advertising and direct marketing efforts, we are continuing with proactive communications designed to ensure that our customers are confident that it's safe to eat at Chipotle. On February 8, we are launching a new food safety website, which outlines all the steps we have taken in order to make our food the safest as it possibly can be. The site also reaffirms our commitment to Food With Integrity. 
What is most important is that we have implemented a comprehensive food safety plan. And now that the recent CDC investigation is behind us, we are confident that our aggressive marketing communication will help welcome many lapsed and new customers into Chipotle.

We believe that we've outlined a thoughtful and effective strategy to restor",1899,"Thanks, Mark.  For those of you that have been following our company over the last 10 years, 2016 will be a very different year for Chipotle as we emerge from last year's events. We believe that we've outlined a thoughtful and effective strategy to restore confidence in our brand. And we will be laser-focused on 2 things: first, implementing industry-leading food safety protocols; and second, working relentlessly to welcome our customers back to Chipotle. 
There will be costs to our new food safety program, so we expect to see lower operating margins this year until our sales trends begin to recover. But we're confident that we can win our customers back. And as they return to our restaurants over time, our margins can return to industry-leading levels. 
Sales during the fourth quarter were extremely volatile. Although comps for the quarter decreased 14% -- 14.6% overall, the adverse impact became more severe throughout the quarter as awareness remained high. After posting a low single-digit positive comp in October, we had net a negative 16% comp in November and a negative 30% comp in December. While December comps started out at a similar level as in November, the comp worsened significantly following the national attention surrounding the Boston norovirus incident around December 7. 
Excluding that first week of sales, December comps averaged down about 34%. For the month of January, sales comps were down about 36%, worse than the December run rate due to tougher January comparisons, weather in the Northeast and continued negative publicity. Comparisons become easier in February, but more importantly, we're anxious to begin the process of welcoming our customers back, which will begin in February with the marketing and PR that Mark talked about. Our teams are excited, staffed and ready to provide a terrific experience to our customers when they return. 
As we aggressively work to welcome our customers back, labor management and P&L controls in general will not be a priority. Instead, our teams will schedule labor assuming a steep recovery, because we would much rather be overstaffed and offer great customer service, including wonderful throughput, than to risk being shorthanded as a result of trying to overmanage labor costs. 
Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $2.17. This was above our expected range listed in our recent 8-K. And the main driver behind the higher EPS was the revaluation of noncash stock comp expense related to our 3-year performance shares in consideration of our current forecasts for 2016. This added $16 million to pretax income or about $0.31 to diluted EPS. 
Our margins and EPS results continue to be negatively affected by 3 main forces during this recovery. Those 3 forces include: one, deleverage from lower sales; two, increased discretionary costs, such as marketing and promotional costs as well as higher labor as we staff to welcome customers back; and three, ongoing costs to support our newly designed food safety programs. 
The impact of lower sales levels is the most significant impact on our margins and results overall, and the impact flows through the entire P&L. Our restaurant-level margins were 19.6% in the fourth quarter, which is down 700 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, even though food costs were down 120 basis points. So in essence, our margins are really down over 800 basis points considering the lower food costs. Of this 820-basis-point drop, the vast majority or over 500 basis points of that change came from sales deleverage flowing through the entire restaurant P&L. 
Margins declined an additional 160 basis points related to nonrecurring costs, such as food waste or related testing, and we lost another 150 basis points due to inefficiencies, along with the beginning of new recurring costs to support our new food safety protocols. 
So obviously, the highest priority is to do everything possible to bring customers back in and ensure that they are treated with perfect experience. And if we're successful in doing so, we know that we can eventually recover margins lost due to the deleveraging of sales. And we're also confident that we can recover inefficiencies that have arisen as we navigate through this challenge.
The nonrecurring costs in the fourth quarter included about 70 basis points in food costs related to the discarding of food and costs related to extensive testing related to the investigation. We also had about 60 basis points in other operating expenses, including new food safety kitchen equipment, increased insurance expense and marketing costs to help plan for 2016 promotions. 
Finally, there was a $3 million charge related to the upgrading of some of our equipment, which hit the loss on disposal of assets line. 
There will be a recurring cost of implementing these enhanced and safety programs. And although this is still a preliminary estimate, we believe there will be a net recurring cost of around 200 basis points. This covers changes in procedures performed in our central kitchens and additional testing in our supply chain, net of potential labor savings. Most of these higher costs will be captured on the food cost line, which will result in estimated food costs for the full year 2016 of about 35%. 
There will also be about 20 basis points of new ongoing costs tied to the new food safety programs within the other operating costs line as we incur higher costs tied to new food safety audits and equipment and materials associated with our new food safety programs. 
Over time, we expect that there will be some modest labor savings to offset our increased food safety costs, but we're cautious about expecting these in the near term until we begin to recover sales and gain efficiencies in our food safety programs and also as we invest in increased labor to support higher promotional sales. Our main objective in the short term will be to invest in labor to be fully staffed, highly trained and ready to deliver an extraordinary customer experience as we invite our customers back into our restaurants. 
In addition to these ongoing structural costs related to food safety, 2016 will also incur an additional 50 basis points of marketing expenses compared to prior years and an additional 70 basis points of promotional expenses as we accelerate our ability to recover customers. Much of this will be front-loaded in the first quarter. And we expect marketing to be around 3.5% of sales and combined marketing and promotion costs to be around 6% of sales, which is over 4x the combined marketing and promo as a percent of sales in the first quarter of last year. For the full year, I would caution that we may choose to continue a higher marketing and promotional investment level later in the year, depending on customer reaction and the state of our business.  
We also expect total G&A costs will be around $65 million higher for the full year in 2016 compared to 2015. The higher G&A is driven by performance-related factors in 2015, such as reduced bonuses, which were $17 million in 2015 lower than 2014, and lower stock comp of around $18 million, primarily as a result of revaluing the 3-year performance shares granted to executives in 2015. We will also have additional costs in 2016 related to our All Manager Conference in the third quarter of $11 million, along with normal growth in G&A to support our growing restaurant base. We will continue to invest in our future growth today, but once our sales are fully recovered, we would expect future G&A to grow at a slower rate than sales. 
Overall, 2016 will be a year of significant investment to ensure our food is safe and to encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. Margins and earnings will be significantly affected as we make these important investments. But I'm still confident that as we recover sales, over time, we can also fully recover our margins and our earnings capabilities. 
Given the continued volatility of our sales trends, it's impossible to provide any meaningful outlook for sales comps or margins for the full year 2016. If appropriate, we will provide interim updates on sales trends as we have done with our 2 previously filed 8-Ks. 
While we cannot predict the magnitude and timing of our sales recovery, we can provide some perspective on the impact on margins at various comp levels. For example, when comps are down 30%, the combined impact of deleveraging, along with the added marketing and ongoing food costs -- food safety costs I talked about earlier, would result in expected restaurant level margins in the low-double digit range. If comps were to recover to down 20%, we would expect restaurant margins in the mid- to high teens. When sales fully recover, we would expect restaurant margin to be in the mid-20% range as we would recapture the margin related to deleveraging, but still be funding the higher cost of the food safety programs. Of course, our margin recovery will lag our comp recovery as we don't plan to be highly efficient in managing labor and the rest of the P&L, while our primary focus is welcoming and delighting our customers. So this should give you a general idea of how the recovery might unfold. 
Specific to the first quarter, which will represent a significant  investment in our future, when you combine the rough start in comp so far in January, the higher marketing and promo investment, the higher expected investment in labor to wow our customers, the fully loaded ongoing costs for our food safety program, the costs of hosting our all-company meeting and the higher G&A, it is likely we will post an EPS that is around breakeven for the quarter. Q1 is clearly a heavy investment quarter. And if these investments pay off with a steady recovery of customers, the second, third and fourth quarters will improve dramatically. 
Also, for the full year, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be around 39%, slightly higher than the 2015 tax rate of 38.2% due to slightly higher state taxes. 
We continue to be optimistic in repurchasing our stock. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $338 million of stock at an average share price of $556, with more than $200 million purchased in the month of December alone at an average price of $527. During January, we purchased an additional $238 million at an average-weighted price of $440 per share, even though January had 2 less trading days than December. 
As of January 1, we maintain slightly over $1 billion of cash and investments, which means we continue to be in a position to opportunistically repurchase stock. And today, we're announcing that our board has approved an additional $300 million of share repurchases, bringing our total to life-to-date authorization to $1.9 billion. As of January 31, including the new $300 million authorization, we have $478 million remaining to repurchase stock. 
What's most important right now is that we remain focused on executing our food safety protocol and enticing customers to come back to Chipotle, enjoy terrific meals served by enthusiastic teams. We continue to believe in the strength of the Chipotle brand and the opportunity to return to an industry-leading economic model, which we know has the potential to create significant value for our shareholders.

We call them new or lapsed customers, light, medium, heavy and what we call our top loyal customer. Our top loyal customers are the ones who come 25x or more a year. When we look at the research, we actually saw a falloff in both the top loyal and the new customers, which isn't to be -- or isn't unexpected with regard to the new customers. They're not as familiar with the brand. But we saw a small drop-off in that top loyal, so it is definitely one of the targets that we're going after with our proactive communications. They tend to be people that we can communicate with relatively easily via social media, and many of them are part of our mobile and email marketing databases. So we're definitely be targeting them.

So there's nothing during the quarter that I would say there was a progression. I would say that we kind of held in that kind of mid-30% negative range throughout most of the month, if you are able to exclude the weather, because were in the press a lot. There was a high awareness a lot. And that's why we were so anxious for the CDC to call this over, so we can put it behind us and we can start talking about what we've done in a productive way, so we can invite customers in and put it all behind us.

And we saw, actually, after the initial reopening of those restaurants that you mentioned and the subsequent publishing of that letter, a nice recovery of our customers. Unfortunately, the nature of the E. coli outbreak was different than we expected. And we saw additional cases creep in over the following weeks and subsequent 8 additional announcements by the CDC of additional cases here and there. And so that, combined with the norovirus outbreak in Boston, was sufficient to cause people to have general sort of lingering doubt. And that's really where we stand now, and we're beginning to see it return -- we're seeing that subside a little bit. But a lot of our customers took a wait-and-see approach. And so to the extent we learned anything from those is that being transparent and honest with our customers works. What you need -- what we need to do, though, is make sure that they're completely confident that it's safe to eat at Chipotle, which it is. And so that's the primary effort that we're making with regard to communications right now. Just for those customers who don't yet know it's safe, we're trying to make sure that they do."

In terms of the single biggest thing that's going to hit the first quarter is going to be promotion and marketing. That's going to be 6%, so 6% of sales. And that will be a lot, lot, lot higher than we spent in the past by 4x in terms of percentage of sales and 3.5x in terms of the dollars that we spent last year.

The rest of the country was down more in kind of the low double digits. So there wasn't anybody that was down like double company average and somebody was down half. It was relatively tight range. But there was definitely, throughout the quarter into January, more of an impact in the West Coast and in the Northeast. In terms of Q1, just to give you a rough idea on dollar terms, Sharon, we'll spend probably around $50 million in combined marketing and promo. Now that's an estimate on the promo side, because we're guessing as to what the redemptions will be. So that number will vary, depending on how many people come in and want to redeem their offer. I hope to be able to come back and tell you that, that cost is a lot higher, because a lot more people redeemed their offer.

Our main objective was to -- once we have an event that signals that this is over, and we now have that in hand, to be very aggressive to invite customers in. And we're doing that. Mark talked about that. We're spending a lot more money on marketing and promotion than we've ever had before in dollar terms and in percentage of sales terms than we ever had before. We're telling our teams to staff their restaurants as if the steep recovery is coming for sure. So that when the recovery comes, if it comes a little slower, we'll still be ready. And so our main objective is to be aggressive with bringing customers in, being ready for when they come in. And we're hoping that, that will accelerate the recovery.

He's very familiar with these types of cases, and he's putting in an extraordinary testing procedure. So we test a lot of our high-risk items. Those items that can't be tested, like whole avocados, whole onions, things that we bring into our restaurant, we've put in place a blanching procedure, which is actually boiling these items in water for a brief period of time, 5 seconds, which destroys any microbe that might be on the surface. So even though we haven't identified the specific item, all of our items now that are high risk go through either this testing or this blanching kill step.

Hey, David, this is Jack, just to add something to that. What you're talking about here is execution risk. Are we taking additional execution risk by opening up stores while implementing these procedures? A lot of the procedures are not happening in the restaurant. Meaning, the testing is happening outside the restaurant. So a lot of this food safety program is designed to prevent anything unwanted from ever getting into the restaurant. We're doing that by testing or we're doing that by doing some of the washing and some of the prep in central kitchens, so it's guaranteed that nothing will get into the restaurant. And then the procedures that are in the restaurant, they're not subtle in terms of whether they're done or not. What Steve talked about with blanching, if you blanch for just a matter of couple of seconds in boiling water, it's an instant kill step. So it's not like you're relying on some kind of complex procedure or a new process in the restaurant, it's a very clear step that when followed, it is going to make each ingredient absolutely safe. And so the execution risk in terms of opening up new restaurants is very, very low. If there was execution risk, we absolutely would do something to make sure we would reduce that execution risk.

Never has it been more important for us to delight our customers on each and every visit. And we have great confidence in our managers and crews to remain focused and to provide its ordinary customer experience our customers expect from us. 
We're also encouraged by the long-term opportunity that still exists for Chipotle, both in terms of adding new restaurants and attracting customers who have never tried our restaurants. In each of these ways, there are still so much untapped growth potential for Chipotle and as we continue our efforts to restore lost sales tied to last year's food safety issues, there are significant opportunity for us to continue to grow our business by attracting new customers and opening new restaurants. 
We begin to see sales recover in the second half of the first quarter as our transaction trends reversed course from the lows we saw in January. Just the beginning of February, we have seen an 18 point improvement in comp transactions compared to the full month of January. We have worked to invite our customers back by reminding them of the things they love about Chipotle, such as our delicious food, our high-quality ingredients and being treated to a friendly fast experience inside the restaurants. While we have used promotional programs to entice many of our customers to return, we are encouraged to see signs that the promotional traffic has translated into repeat gained customers. Return of customers to our restaurants improved our same-store sales comps by 11% from January to recent levels. Of course, we would like to see our sales recover more quickly but we remain confident in our long-term strategy to welcome customers back into our restaurants. 
Right after the food safety issues we encountered last year, we took several full steps to ensure our food is as safe as it could possibly be. That included a system -- a systematic evaluation of each ingredient and the implementation of interventions to make them safer. Some changes were made at the suppliers and others were made in our restaurants. Since all of the initial changes were implemented, we have continued to evaluate and refine each procedure. Some of the procedures, like blanching many of our produce items in the restaurant, have proven to be very effective and our crews are doing a great job at executing these new procedures. 
In fact, we were able to add bell peppers to the blanching program, which meant that we are once again, able to slice the bell peppers in our restaurants, rather than at a central kitchen. We have also refined the way we are washing lettuce, which will once again allow us to cut the lettuce in our restaurants while still ensuring that it's safe. We're also continuing to refine many of the other procedures in ways that maximize safety while simultaneously making our food taste better. 
During the quarter, we hired Dr. Jim Brosnan [ph], as our Executive Director or Executive Director of Food Safety. Jim has been a tremendous asset as we continue to evaluate all of our safety protocols. Jim was previously a member of the faculty at Kansas State University in their animal science and industry department. He's working with a number of experts that have advised us in the past and is also worked closely with the U.S. CDC and FDA and other food safety authorities as we continue to implement our industry-leading protocols. Jim's expertise and viewpoint has had a significant impact in a short period of time, and we continue to look forward to his leadership in furthering our food safety program. 
We recognize that it will take us some time to rebuild trust with our customers and to fully recover from the issues we faced late last year. And while we are encouraged that the recovery is underway, we know that there's still a lot more work to be done. We will continue to make it our top priority to entice customers to return to Chipotle through a effective promotions and marketing. And when they do that return, we're committed to providing the very best experience that we can to help ensure that they will keep coming back. We know that the very best marketing we can do is to provide an exceptional restaurant experience and our managers and crews are working hard to make sure they're doing just that. I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

On November 1, we begin conducting additional daily consumer research to help us measure and track consumer perceptions of our brand in the wake of the issues we saw last year. Key measures including admiration, consideration, first-time visits and food quality are all continuing to improve. In some cases, consumer perception in these key areas has return to levels close to what it was prior to Q4 of last year. For others, we still need to see additional improvements, but the trends continue to be promising. 
In early February, we launched an aggressive marketing campaign designed to drive customers back into our restaurants. This campaign consistent of mobile and direct mail promotions and nationwide advertising campaign and a variety of social, mobile and local marketing activities. The campaign began with the rain check mobile promotion distributed on the day of our company-wide meeting on February 8. As you may recall, this was the day we closed all of our restaurants for our national all-company meeting and when we provided the opportunity for customers to get a free meal through a mobile offer. we issued well over 5 million free offers and saw an extraordinary redemption rate of 67%. We follow the mobile offer with a direct mail promotion to about 20 million households and we currently have a 17.5% average redemption rate, which we expect to approach 20% as the redemption window closes. To those customers that have previously responded to direct mail, we're seeing a redemption rate of an impressive 44% and growing. 
We are currently in the midst of our nationwide advertising campaign that runs through the end of June. This advertising campaign is the largest media spend in our history and is targeting all of our U.S. and Canadian locations. The creative features of delicious food and reinforces our commitment to responsibly raised ingredients cooked using classic cooking techniques without the use of artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners. Our research shows that this campaign is performing particularly well with new customers. 
In the coming months, we also plan to return to using nontraditional marketing that differentiates the Chipotle brand. This will include a short film add promotional game, as well as other content-driven marketing programs. These upcoming marketing efforts will combine different shading messages about Chipotle with traffic-driving components. Throughout the year, we will continue to be more aggressive than usual with our marketing, and we are considering 2 programs aimed to driving traffic among our loyal customers and last customers -- for our customer -- our last customer's -- that is customers who have not been to Chipotle in 3 months or more. 
For example, we are exploring a limited time frequency incentive designed to reward our most loyal customers for eating frequently at Chipotle this summer. Additionally, we are considering adding menu items that will appeal to our loyal or lapsed customers. Over the years, we have tested additional to the menu that is proven to be very popular with our most recent customers. While we didn't make these menu items per minute additions to the menu at the time, we do see an opportunity to introduce these or other items as a way of inviting our loyal customers back into our restaurants. 
I'd also like to discuss the progress we're making in strengthening our digital ordering capabilities. We have completed the integration between Postmates, our largest delivery partner and our back-of-house ordering system. This allows Postmates to send orders directly to our back-of-house make line instead of sending line to order. We've completed this initial integration with Postmates, and we are currently using this new system restaurants in San Francisco and Atlanta and we'll be rolling it out in all of our markets in the coming months. We're also in the process of creating the same capability with our other delivery partners. 
Next, we are testing a system that allows for smarter pickup times for customers who place online and mobile orders. This system is designed to reduce the time between order placements and pickup. The system dynamically monitors the flow of orders into our restaurants and gives our customers the shortest possible order completion time while simultaneously ensuring that the restaurant-ed will complete orders on time. The system is currently being tested in our markets prior to being rolled out nationwide. 
Finally, we issued updated versions of our iOS and Android ordering apps to make easier for customers to pay using their credit or debit card, to speed up the payment process and then streamlined reordering for our frequent customers. While it is early in our sales recovery process, we are encouraged by improving trends in customer sentiment and by customer response to our marketing and promotional efforts. We expect that we will see continued progress in these areas going forward as customers regain confidence in us and remember what it is that they always loved about Chipotle. I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

At the heart of our efforts to ensure the very best experience we can for each and every customer, our teams of top-performing restaurant employees, managers and field leaders. The strength of our team has always been an advantage for us,",1139,"Thank you, Mark. At the heart of our efforts to ensure the very best experience we can for each and every customer, our teams of top-performing restaurant employees, managers and field leaders. The strength of our team has always been an advantage for us, because these teams truly believe in our mission and treat our guests to a unique and genuine customer experience. As we continue to rebuild trust with our customers by serving safe and delicious food and as we continue to invite them back into our restaurants with our marketing and promotional programs, our restaurant teams are ready to provide a type of experience that will keep our customers coming back. I'm proud of our teams are responding this challenging recovery effort, be it quickly and efficiently implement that many changes in our restaurants over the last few months and simultaneously continue to provide a terrific experience. I'm incredibly warm by the level of commitment and pride team has demonstrated during a difficult time and I'm more confident than ever that they are the ones who will ensure that we fulfill our mission. Additionally, we are seeing the impact of stronger mid-level leadership through our improved rate of restaurant true promotions this year compared with last year. 
Through the first quarter of 2016, we promoted 61 restaurant tours, an increase of 45% over the same time last year despite having even higher standards for the attainment of this elite position. We continue to refine their Restaurateur program and while our Restaurateur candidates have always been required to show demonstrable success in building Restaurateur cultures, delivering excellent hospitality and ensuring a strong business model, we now have even more strict standards in all of those categories. 
Today, before restaurateur can be selected, they must have excellent scores on our internal and external third-party audit related to food safety, and we continue to require more accountability for maintaining a disciplined business culture including assessments of sales projections, throughput, scheduling and labor management, food orders and other management of key expenses. This business calls to review is in addition to developing an amazing people culture, perhaps the most challenging aspect of becoming a Restaurateur. Though with better tools and established field leaders, our pipeline of general managers continues to grow. 
To continue to emphasize the development of our Restaurateur culture during difficult times is critical. They are the ones who can most skillfully create excellent, safe and delicious restaurant experiences while still developing future leaders we need to grow our business effectively. As we entice customers to return to our restaurant's with more aggressive marketing and promotions, it is doubly important that we remind them what makes a meal fully special by greeting them enthusiastically, having friendly and efficient service, great throughput and by making them a delicious meal. And the teams that are most able to do all these things while are our Restaurateur teams who provide these great operations while ensuring a strong business model as well. 
And as more Restaurateur are stepping up, our best field leaders is been able to spend more time in our newer restaurant or restaurants that have the opportunity to perform much, much better. With more field leaders in our system than in recent years, our restaurants are getting more one-on-one attention on leadership than before, and that will help to build more of these elite Restaurateur cultures. 
In addition to the accelerated pace of these promotions during the quarter, we also promoted 63 existing restaurateurs into multi-unit positions and strengthened our ranks by promoting 24 additional field leaders. This continued investment in our Restaurateur and field leadership is paying off in a better customer experience. One example is the impact of had an our throughput initiatives. Our field leaders are working how to set each restaurant for success, and that starts by effectively implementing the 4 pillars of throughput. When we have the 4 pillars in place, our restaurants are poised to engage with our customers and show our gratitude by serving them quickly in each and every visit. Our restaurants are prepared, organized and ready for the day with the proper meals on plus. All hands are on deck with the aces in their places and with a dedicated line backer that is constant communication with the back of the house. And we can pull customers through line faster with a dedicated expedited at the cashier. 
Incorporating the 4 pillars impact nearly every aspect of the guest experience. Of course, building great teams and great cultures in our restaurant starts with the people we hire and with our ability to retain and develop our top performers. That's always the case. But more so in a tightening labor market. We know that if our employees cared for in proper training such that they feel confident in their ability and encouraged by the circumstances, we have a much better chance of having them stay with us and develop careers at Chipotle. We are emphasizing this more with our restaurant managers and teams, starting with the need to hire only crew members who have the 13 characteristics. The qualities course we believe make it more likely that the newly-hired employee will become a top performer at Chipotle. 
We are also reiterating to our restaurants the need to involve crew in the interview process and hiring decisions for new crew. This also ensures that people that we are hiring restaurants are a good fit and it demonstrates the importance of each and every employee we ask our team. Developing future teams and promoting from within is extremely important to us, particularly as we can continue to bring Chipotle to more locations across the United States. During the quarter, we opened 58 new restaurants and for 2016, we plan to open 220 to 235 new restaurants. Looking beyond this year, there's still significant opportunity for us to continue to open new restaurants at a healthy pace. We will continue to balance the opportunity for further growth of further disciplined approach to development to ensure that we are opening up new restaurants and great locations with a strong economics and staff with top-performing teams. 
As many of you have experienced first hand, our restaurants are feeling busy again. Relative to December and January, they have more energy, more customers and enthusiastic teams ready to greet them. Our food taste is great and we're continuing to emphasize customer service and hospitality as we make headway in increasing our sales. That said, it's more critical now than ever that every restaurant delivers on the high standards that we have set for Chipotle. We have the utmost confidence in our crews, managers and restaurateurs, as well as our field leadership to continue to improve upon these qualities that make Chipotle great. I'll now turn the call over to Jack."
26446,329534474,963511,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thinks, Monty.

Our customers redeemed over 6 million free burritos or bowls during February and March. We also gave away nearly 1 million free orders of chips and salsa or chips in Black. The goal is to invite our customers back to Chipotle with a compelling offer, treat them to a delicious meal and an energetic environment with the hope that they will begin to return to their normal frequency of eating in Chipotle. The response the office was strong, especially right after our all-company meeting on February 8, which redemptions reaching a high of nearly $500,000 in a single day just a few days after the offer began. Comp transactions improved from down 34% for the full month of January to a high point of down only 9% during the third week of February. Of course, it's not surprising that the fre offers for weekly immediate by our customers more importantly, as the number of redemptions level off, we saw our paying customers steadily increase. And by the first week of March when redemptions were down to under $100,000 per day, our comp transactions were down only 14% and comp sales were down 22%. We felt the recovery was off to a respectable start just 3 or 4 weeks into our marketing campaign. 
As Steve mentioned, we implemented a number of new procedures and protocols to established Chipotle as industry leader in food safety. Some of these protocols were put to the test in Boston last month. We had 4 employees who were at home sick and fully followed our protocol by not coming to work. We temporarily closed the restaurant and local health officials commended us for the successful design and execution of our protocols, which resulted in our restaurant remaining safe for our customers. Unfortunately, some stories refer to this as another outbreak, and those headlines interrupted our sales recovery. This was a disappointing setback, which caused our nationwide comp sales to worsen to run negative 27% for a few weeks before recovering to the low- to mid-negative 20s in late March. 
For all of March, comp seats were down 15.6% and comp sales were down 26.4%, with Eastern negatively impacting both by about 2.5% as we lost 1 trading day in the month. The impact the headlines concerning Boston taught us recovery can be fragile and if we need to rebuild trust with our customers, every single customer, every single day and every single restaurant. 
Average daily sales increased sequentially in April versus late March by about 3% to 4%, but comps sales run rate, excluding the benefit of Easter, was right around negative 26% in April so far because seasonality typically has resulted in about a 6% to 7% increase in April sales over March. Including the benefit of the Easter comp sales, we're around negative 22% for the first 3 weeks in April and comp transactions are around negative 16%. [ph] These are added about 4% to both the sales and transaction comp so far. 
Now some of these lags in April sales are due to cold weather in some areas of the country early in the month and we did see the comp for a few days improved to the low negative 20s during the past week, so we're hoping we will still get that seasonality step up we normally see this time of year which is just a few weeks later. The sales recovery has been uneven throughout the country. For the first 3 weeks of April, our traffic comps, excluding the Easter benefit, were negative 15% in the middle of the country, the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic. Whereas they were down 20% company-wide again, excluding the benefit of Easter. That's about a 16-point recovery as compared to January, which means we recovered about half the last visit in these areas. But on the West Coast and the Northeast, the 2 areas closest to the outbreaks of late 2015, our traffic comps have recently been trending at negative 24%. Again, excluding the Easter benefit compared to negative 37% in January. So we've only recovered about 1/3 of customer visits in these areas. 
For the first quarter, sales were $834.5 million and the restaurant level operating margins were 6.8% for the quarter. As expected, the largest driver of the year-over-year decrease in margin was sales deleverage which accounted for more than half of our drop of margin compared to 2015. Results also impacted nearly 600 basis points to what we would consider to be nonrecurring expenses, including an elevated promotional and marketing investment that totaled 660 basis points, which is over 500 basis points higher than last year. 
Food cost is higher than Q4 of 2015 by 150 basis points and we expect that food costs will remain at about this level for the rest of the year. 
While it's difficult to provide meaningful projection for the sales comps or margins in the coming quarter, especially given the sales volatility i just described, I can't tell you that the approximate margin to expect at various with sales levels. For example, comp level average unit restaurant volumes are about $1.9 million on an annual basis and a restaurant level margins should improve to the low double-digits in the next few quarters as the nonrecurring costs begin to level off. If the comps are around negative 20%, AUVs would be about $2 million and margins would be around the mid to high-teens. It comps recovered around negative 10%, AUVs would be about $2.2 million and our margins should be in the low 20s. And if we fully recover our sales with AUVs in the $2.4 million to $2.5 million range, we would expect margins in the mid-20% range, which accounts for the recurring cost of new procedures and protocols that relate to food safety. 
Labor cost for the quarter were 30.9% of sales, an increase of 850 basis points compared to last year. More than 650 basis points of the change was driven sales leverage. While we also have nearly 100 basis points tied to nonrecurring expenses, as we incurred additional labor in early February, March, this support our promotional strategy and also our national team meeting on February 8 when about 50,000 employees attended. 
We also continue to occur higher labor costs related to our merit increases taken in mid-2015 for restaurant crew and managers, which averaged about 7%, along with increased benefits and putting increased date, paid sick leave and tuition reimbursement, all of which added about 160 basis points to labor. 
Our promotional and marketing expenses during the quarter totaled $55 million or about 6.6% of sales and has included $4 million or about 50 basis points related to promo offers that were issued in the first quarter, but is expected to be retained in the second quarter. We'll continue to invest in recovering our customers and promos will be an important part of the strategy, but we expect combined marketing and promo to level off to about 3% to 4% as a percentage of sales over the next few quarters. While this is lower than Q1, it's nearly double what we spend as a percent of sales in Q2 and Q3 of last year. When does traditional brand advertising and returned talking about our delicious food made from high-quality ingredients. G&A for the first quarter was $62 million or 7.4% of sales, down $1 million from last year. Total stock-based comp included in G&A was $7.5 million, which is down about $7.6 million from last year. Offsetting that reduction were higher legal cost and the cost of the all-company meeting, which combined added $4 million of G&A. For the full year 2016, we anticipate total stock-based compensation and G&A to be about $60 million. And for the full year 2016, SG&A was just over $300 million or about $50 million higher than the last year as we have support for our new restaurant opening and as we will hold our biannual manager conference in September. 
Our effective tax rate benefit for the quarter was 40.6% and was impacted by nonrecurring adjustments related to stated income taxes for prior year. Our effective tax for the full year is expected to be 38.4%. During the first quarter, we reported a loss of $26.4 million or diluted loss per share of $0.88. Our cash and investments totaled $706 million as of March 31, and we continue to be very aggressive with our balance sheet to repurchase stock. We've repurchased a total of $645 million from January 1 through yesterday at an average price of a $453 [ph] per share. Since November 1, 2015, we've repurchased a total of $956 million of our stock representing a reduction of nearly 2 million shares outstanding and we have $71.4 million left in our current authorization to purchase stock. As we work through this sales recovery, we will remain disciplined in restoring our unit economics to deliver attractive margins and returns and restore our ability significant shareholder value over the long term.

That was 49% before, and now that's at 57% so that one's probably that's the biggest delta there. But for example, on another attribute, which is we serve healthy fresh and processed food, that's recovered to exactly the same levels as it was before. So it's a mixed bag. I don't know that any of them are problematic such that I don't think we're going to be able to recover them. So we're seeing just nice trends all across the board on those. In terms of your question about frequency, we break our customers into 5 groups by frequency. We call our most frequent customers top loyal they come 25 times more than a year. The next group are heavy customers. They come 13 to 24 times, then medium, which was 6 to 12, light is to 2 to 5 and our new or lapsed customers is 1 time. And you're correct in that we saw larger declines in both new in the 2 -- the top and bottom categories. So these are single-digit drops but in new and lapsed and in top loyal. And so a lot of what we're looking at from a marketing perspective is bringing in those top loyal single digit drop in top loyal customers that we saw. And I'm not suggesting that these customers left altogether, but their frequency may have declined. So some of what I mentioned in my prepared remarks are aimed at either giving them a reason to come back in and that might be a new menu item or some sort of a frequency incentive, which I also mentioned, which would be coming in a certain number of times over a period of time and we'll give you something. So those are both efforts designed to target that group of customers."

So that's part of it, but as I mentioned also in my prepared comments, we're getting back into the type of advertising or marketing that has been so successful for us in the past, which is some of these brand marketing, which are based on short films and other types of content, which really delivered messages about the brand and continue to differentiate Chipotle from the competition. One of the really good pieces of news in our research is that the differentiation of Chipotle from our competitors really has not suffered or is the extend that it did it recovered fully. And so we're going to continue to push the messages about our 65 ingredients and how simple they are and our simple classic cooking techniques and how different that is from the competition whose food is tends to be heavily processed and include hundreds and hundreds of ingredients, many of which are process. So we're definitely getting back on that in July is when we'll really be in full swing with that type of marketing again. So we're transitioning back, but as I say that, there's going to be always a promotional element with those until we really fully recover our sales."

So it has nice spice and really good texture and as Mark said, very, very popular with the customers that had it in a couple of our test markets. When we think about adding something to Chipotle, we're very, very mindful of our overall efficiencies, efficiencies in the kitchen, efficiencies in cook time, efficiencies in throughput and ease of ordering for the customer. Chorizo fits into this system really, really well in that we have space for it on the mainline and it doesn't detract from throughput. It sets -- it's also very easy to rotate onto the launcher to grill between chicken and steak. The cook time and the method of grilling isn't much different from the chicken and steak already on the word. Operationally, I'd say it's quite easy to execute that I think it's a very exciting in that it does add a new flavor and texture to the meat offerings. And it pairs well with our existing offerings, our solstice, and guacamole and cheese and what have you. So again, very popular and I'm excited to see how this works."

I wouldn't say all of them have been met with immediate approval. An example of that is we went over to a lettuce that was pre-shredded at a central kitchen in order to be able to be absolutely certain of that all the interventions were in place to make sure that, that was food safe and that letters I think people found to be a degradation in quality of the stuff that was cut in restaurants by our teams who -- when our restaurant teams do it, they're able to cut it to the exact size they want. They're able to really make sure that the presentation is exactly what they want and that they can assure the quality of the lettuce. This was a product which was really just completely  prepared in the central kitchen. So what we've been able to do and what we will be rolling out soon, will be able to find a way to have this made completely safe by interventions in a central kitchen, but yet still have the entire Head of Lettuce brought to the restaurant and yet, and give our crews in the restaurant that the latitude to be able to cut that properly and assure of the quality of that again. So we've just been teaching that the last few days and a few of our restaurants here in Denver and it's delicious. It's wonderful. And so we're going to be moving back to a lettuce that I think everyone else is very satisfied with. The rest of the changes have been met very positively. The bidding and steak I'd as delicious. We've actually had a reduction in the number of customer complaints. With steak, there's always been over time some complaints because steak contains naturally some chili bits and whatnot because we use real steak. And with the it, it's the technique has allowed us to break down some of those aspects of the steak through a kind about long breathing process in the be process, which is makes the steak juicier and more tender and more delicious. So actually, we're very, very pleased with how that's going and our customers seem to be very pleased as well. The blanching of the ingredients has had essentially has, had no effect whatsoever on the eating quality ingredients, but it's a wonderful step to ensure again food safety and the elimination of potential harmful pathogens or what have you. So our crews in the restaurants have done awesome job implementing that, that new procedure and I found it quite easy and they're very proud of it because it makes them --  it gives them an even higher level of confidence in the food we're serving. And again, no degradation whatsoever in what our customers are receiving. So we are feeling really, really good about the quality of our food in our restaurants. I think it is actually better than ever. I think subject to that one change in lettuce, we thought that the bell peppers we were bringing in pre-slice from the central kitchen were good, but maybe not quite as good as the ones cut in our restaurants. So what we've been able to do is go back to blanching, the bell peppers such as they can be cut by a knife, by a skilled hands of our folks in the restaurant. And again, i brought that back to the level of quality it was before, but again, with the blanching to ensure food safety, that ingredient. So we're very proud of it we've done. We think that the intent, focus on our food has been caused by looking at every single ingredient. It's cost our teams in the restaurant to also look at every single ingredient, very, very critically and make certain that everything is as good as it can be. So I think our food is more delicious than ever with that 1 sort of asterisk that the lettuce was I think not as good for the time, but we're returning that to what it was, and I think that we're very, very proud of our food stands now."

I think that the short answer is no. We're not preparing for slowdown of our development and I think you'll find that we will be able to achieve very easily the guidance that we've given an in terms of the number of our restaurant openings. But we do have a very strong pipeline coming in from our real estate teams who have been doing an excellent job of finding a lot of terrific sites. But the reason for my comments was that as they've had a slowdown of sales overall, that you're all aware of, and the numbers that Jack spoke about was the slowdown of nationwide sales as a result of what happened in late 2015, so 2 has that slowdown affected our new store openings. But it's not -- it's affected them disproportionately. What I mean is that most of our new restaurant openings has still held the same percentage that they historically has held versus our trailing 12-month sales of our existing stores. But the exception is that in the new markets and developing markets, in those markets, there's been I think even more softening of their sales than there has been nationally, say. So the delta between a new store opening in the developing or new market has been slightly greater than when compared to the rest of our restaurant average daily sales. So the delta of new and developing market is a little bit bigger than the delta between proven and established markets. And so that percentage of all of our new store opening though is quite low, it's about 13% of our new store openings are a new markets are developing markets. And because those sales have been correspondingly a little more soft than the rest of openings, we're going to be taking just so much closer look at those and be more nitpicking as to which ones we do deals on. So it's going to be very slight effect in terms of number of openings. And we have such a strong pipeline that we don't think it's going to affect overall numbers that we've shared we you that we plan to open, but it's going to give us, I think the ability to be a little bit more discerning on a few of our locations and just make sure that anyone's for which the developer cost is perhaps a little bit high or the rent structure isn't quite advantageous, we might walk away from some of those deals that we might have pursued a year ago today, that's for example. Just to be responsible with our investments."

Another 100 basis points is due to the very heavy promo that we they did in the first quarter. So we had a lot of people visiting, a lot of people dining at Chipotle, but they didn't pay for all or part of their meals. Yes, we had stuff restaurant so there's about 100 basis points of that and there's another, I think, it's another 150 to 200 basis points or so of what I'll call inflation. It's stuff that we did last year. We had merit increases for our managers and crew. We rolled out or introduced a education program, college education, or education or usually college education. We started to pay for 6 pay and we enhanced our certification be. So those are all inflationary things kind of 150 to 200 basis points range. So those are the big pieces. Underneath all that is there some inefficiencies? Sure. But maybe that's 100 basis points or so. We don't want to go out and squeeze labor right now and drive this efficiencies that are times what's most important for us is to have a fully staffed team, that have the 4 pillars in place, heavy team that feels ready to greet customers when they come in and hopefully at an accelerated rate. So I wouldn't want to go after 100 basis points at labor line with what's most important is to have a great experience, and that's encouraging the sales to properly happen."

Chipotle has always been a company that is focused on a long-term vision to change the way people think about any fast food. As we move forward, we believe it is critical that we continue to focus on the things that have driven our success for so many years, our unique food culture and our unique people culture. It's been our focus on these key drivers of our business that has differentiated Chipotle in a crowded and competitive field, and that has allowed us to develop a strong loyalty among our customers. These key attributes are what has served us -- what has allowed us to serve delicious food and to provide outstanding customer service. Never has it been more important for us to delight our customers on each and every visit. And we have great confidence in our managers and crews to remain focused and to provide the extraordinary customer experience our customers expect from us.
We're also encouraged by the long-term opportunity that still exists for Chipotle, both in terms of adding new restaurants and attracting customers who have never tried our restaurants. In each of these ways, there is still so much untapped growth potential for Chipotle, and as we continue our efforts to restore lost sales tied to last year's food safety issues, there is significant opportunity for us to continue to grow our business by attracting new customers and opening new restaurants.
We begin to see sales recover in the second half of the first quarter as our transaction trends reverse of course from the lows we saw in January. Just the beginning of February, we have seen an 18-point improvement in comp transactions compared to the full month of January. We have worked to invite our customers back by reminding them of the things they love about Chipotle, such as our delicious food, our high-quality ingredients and being treated to a friendly, fast experience inside of our restaurants. While we have used promotional programs to entice many of our customers to return, we are encouraged to see signs that the promotional traffic has translated into repeat paying customers. Return of customers to our restaurants improved our same-store sales comps by 11% from January to recent levels. Of course, we would like to see our sales recover more quickly, but we remain confident in our long-term strategy to welcome customers back into our restaurants.
Right after the food safety issues we encountered last year, we took several bold steps to ensure our food was as safe as it could possibly be. That included a system -- a systematic evaluation of each ingredient and the implementation of interventions to make them safer. Some changes were made at the suppliers and others were made in our restaurants. Since all of the initial changes were implemented, we have continued to evaluate and refine each procedure. Some of the procedures, like blanching many of our produce items in the restaurant, have proven to be very effective and our crews are doing a great job at executing these new procedures.
In fact, we were able to add bell peppers to the blanching program, which meant that we are once again, able to slice the bell peppers in our restaurants, rather than at a central kitchen. We have also refined the way we are washing lettuce, which will once again allow us to cut the lettuce in our restaurants while still ensuring that it's safe. We're also continuing to refine many of the other procedures in ways that maximize safety while simultaneously making our food taste better.
During the quarter, we hired Dr. Jim Marsden as our Executive Food Director or Executive Director of Food Safety. Jim has been a tremendous asset as we continue to evaluate all of our safety protocols. Jim was previously a member of the faculty at Kansas State University in their animal science and industry department. He's working with a number of experts that have advised us in the past, and has also worked closely with the U.S. CDC and FDA and other food safety authorities as we continue to implement our industry-leading protocols. Jim's expertise and viewpoint has had a significant impact in a short period of time, and we continue to look forward to his leadership in furthering our food safety program.
We recognize that it will take us some time to rebuild trust with our customers, and to fully recover from the issues we faced late last year. And while we are encouraged that the recovery is underway, we know that there's still a lot more work to be done. We will continue to make it our top priority to entice customers to return to Chipotle through effective promotions and marketing. And when they do return, we're committed to providing the very best experience that we can, to help ensure that they will keep coming back. We know that the very best marketing we can do is to provide an exceptional restaurant experience and our managers and crews are working hard to make sure they're doing just that. I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

On November 1, we began conducting additional daily consumer research to help us measure and track consumer perceptions of our brand in the wake of the issues we saw last year. Key measures, including admiration, consideration, first-time visits and food quality are all continuing to improve. In some cases, consumer perception in these key areas has returned to levels close to what it was prior to Q4 of last year. For others, we still need to see additional improvements, but the trends continue to be promising.
In early February, we launched an aggressive marketing campaign designed to drive customers back into our restaurants. This campaign consisted of mobile and direct mail promotions, and nationwide advertising campaign and a variety of social, mobile and local marketing activities. The campaign began with the rain check mobile promotion distributed on the day of our company-wide meeting on February 8. As you may recall, this was the day we closed all of our restaurants for our national all-company meeting, and when we provided the opportunity for customers to get a free meal through a mobile offer. In all, we issued well over 5 million free burrito offers and saw an extraordinary redemption rate of 67%. We follow the mobile offer with a direct mail promotion to about 20 million households, and we currently have a 17.5% average redemption rate, which we expect to approach 20% as the redemption window closes. For those customers that had previously responded to direct mail, we're seeing a redemption rate of an impressive 44% and growing.
We are currently in the midst of our nationwide advertising campaign that runs through the end of June. This advertising campaign is the largest media spend in our history and is targeting all of our U.S. and Canadian locations. The creative features delicious food and reinforces our commitment to responsibly raised ingredients, cooked using classic cooking techniques and without the use of artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners. Our research shows that this campaign is performing particularly well with new customers.
In the coming months, we also plan to return to using nontraditional marketing that differentiates the Chipotle brand. This will include a short film and promotional game as well as other content-driven marketing programs. These upcoming marketing efforts will combine different shading messages about Chipotle with traffic-driving components. Throughout the year, we will continue to be more aggressive than usual with our marketing, and we are considering 2 programs aimed at driving traffic among our loyal customers and last customers -- for our customer -- our last customers or -- that is customers who have not been to Chipotle in 3 months or more.
For example, we are exploring a limited time frequency incentive designed to reward our most loyal customers for eating frequently at Chipotle this summer. Additionally, we are considering adding menu items that will appeal to our loyal or lapsed customers. Over the years, we have tested additions to the menu that are proven to be very popular with our most frequent customers. While we didn't make these menu items per minute additions to the menu at the time, we do see an opportunity to introduce these or other items as a way of inviting our loyal customers back into our restaurants.
I'd also like to discuss the progress we're making in strengthening our digital ordering capabilities. We have completed the integration between Postmates, our largest delivery partner and our back-of-house ordering system. This allows Postmates to send orders directly to our back-of-house make line instead of sending line to order. We have completed this initial integration with Postmates, and we are currently using this new system at restaurants in San Francisco and Atlanta, and we'll be rolling it out in all of our markets in the coming months. We're also in the process of creating the same capability with our other delivery partners.
Next, we are testing a system that allows for smarter pickup times for customers who place online and mobile orders. This system is designed to reduce the time between order placements and pickup. The system dynamically monitors the flow of orders into our restaurants and gives our customers the shortest possible order completion time while simultaneously ensuring that the restaurants will complete the orders on time. This system is currently being tested in one our markets prior to being rolled out nationwide.
Finally, we issued updated versions of our iOS and Android ordering apps to make it easier for customers to pay using their credit or debit card, to speed up the payment process and then streamline reordering for our frequent customers. While it is early in our sales recovery process, we are encouraged by improving trends in customer sentiment and by customer response to our marketing and promotional efforts. We expect that we will see continued progress in these areas going forward as customers regain confidence in us, and remember what it is that they always loved about Chipotle. I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

At the heart of our efforts to ensure the very best experience we can for each and every customer, our teams of top-performing restaurant employees, managers and field leaders. The strength of our team has always been an advantage for us,",1146,"Thank you, Mark. At the heart of our efforts to ensure the very best experience we can for each and every customer, our teams of top-performing restaurant employees, managers and field leaders. The strength of our team has always been an advantage for us, because these teams truly believe in our mission, and treat our guests to unique and genuine customer experience. As we continue to rebuild trust with our customers by serving safe and delicious food, and as we continue to invite them back into our restaurants with our marketing and promotional programs, our restaurant teams are ready to provide the type of experience that will keep our customers coming back. I'm proud as our teams are responding this challenging recovery effort. They had quickly and efficiently implemented many changes in our restaurants over the last few months and simultaneously continued to provide a terrific experience. I'm incredibly warmed by the level of commitment and pride our teams have demonstrated during a difficult time, and I'm more confident than ever that they are the ones who will ensure that we fulfill our mission. Additionally, we are seeing the impact of stronger mid-level leadership through our improved rate of restaurant true promotions this year compared with last year.
Through the first quarter of 2016, we promoted 61 restaurant tours, an increase of 45% over the same time last year despite having even higher standards for the attainment of this elite position. We continue to refine the Restaurateur programs and while our Restaurateur candidates have always been required to show a demonstrable success in building Restaurateur cultures, delivering excellent hospitality and ensuring a strong business model, we now have even more strict standards in all of those categories.
Today, before Restaurateur can be selected, they must have excellent scores on our internal and external third-party audits related to food safety, and we continue to require more accountability for maintaining a disciplined business culture, including assessments of sales projections, throughput, scheduling and labor management, food orders and other management of key expenses. This business calls to review, is in addition to developing an amazing people culture, perhaps the most challenging aspect of becoming a Restaurateur. Though with better tools and established field leaders, our pipeline of general managers continues to grow.
To continue to emphasize the development of our Restaurateur culture during difficult times is critical. They are the ones who can most skillfully create excellent, safe and delicious restaurant experiences while developing future leaders we needed to grow our business effectively. As we entice customers to return to our restaurants with more aggressive marketing and promotions, it is doubly important that we remind them what makes a meal at Chipotle so special by greeting them enthusiastically, having friendly and efficient service, great throughput and by making them a delicious meal. And the teams that are most able to do all these things well are our Restaurateur teams, who provide these great operations while ensuring a strong business model as well.
And as more Restaurateurs are stepping up, our best field leaders have been able to spend more time in our newer restaurants or restaurants that have the opportunity to perform much, much better. With more field leaders in our system than in recent years, our restaurants are getting more one-on-one attention on leadership than before, and that will help to build more of these elite Restaurateur cultures. 
In addition to the accelerated pace of these promotions during the quarter, we also promoted 63 existing restaurateurs into multi-unit positions, and strengthened our ranks by promoting 24 additional field leaders. This continued investment in our Restaurateur and field leadership is paying off in a better customer experience. One example is the impact we've had on our throughput initiative. Our field leaders are working hard to set each restaurant for success, and that starts by effectively implementing the 4 pillars of throughput. When we have the 4 pillars in place, our restaurants are poised to engage with our customers and show our gratitude by serving them quickly on each and every visit. Our restaurants are prepared, organized and ready for the day with proper mise en place. All hands are on deck with aces in their places and with a dedicated linebacker that is in constant communication with the back of the house. And we can pull customers through the line faster with a dedicated expedited at the cashier position.
Incorporating the 4 pillars effects nearly every aspect of the guest experience. Of course, building great teams and great cultures in our restaurant starts with the people we hire, and with our ability to retain and develop our top performers. That's always the case. But more so in a tightening labor market. We know that if our employee is still cared for, and are given proper training such that they feel confident in their ability and encouraged by the circumstances, we have a much better chance of having them stay with us and develop careers at Chipotle. We are emphasizing this more with our restaurant managers and teams, starting with the need to hire only crew members who have the 13 characteristics. The qualities, we believe, make it more likely that a newly-hired employee will become a top performer at Chipotle. 
We are also reiterating to our restaurants, the need to involve crew in the interview process and hiring decisions for new crew. This also ensure that the people we are hiring in or restaurants are a good fit, and it demonstrates the importance of each and every employee we add to our team. Developing future teams and promoting from within is extremely important to us, particularly as we can continue to bring Chipotle to more locations across the United States. During the quarter, we opened 58 new restaurants and for 2016, we plan to open 220 to 235 new restaurants. Looking beyond this year, there's still significant opportunity for us to continue to open new restaurants at a healthy pace. We will continue to balance the opportunity for further growth with a disciplined approach to development to ensure that we are opening up new restaurants in great locations with a strong economics and staff with top-performing teams.
As many of you have experienced first hand, our restaurants are feeling busy again. Relative to December and January, they have more energy, more customers and enthusiastic teams ready to greet them. Our food taste is great and we're continuing to emphasize customer service and hospitality as we make headway in increasing our sales. That said, it's more critical now than ever that every restaurant delivers on the high standards that we have set for Chipotle. We have the utmost confidence in our crews, managers and restaurateurs as well as our field leadership to continue to improve upon these qualities that make Chipotle great. I'll now turn the call over to Jack."
26446,329534474,963661,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thinks, Monty.

Our customers redeemed over 6 million free burritos or bowls during February-March. And we also gave away nearly 1 million free orders of chips and salsa or chips and guac. The goal is to invite our customers back into Chipotle with a compelling offer, treat them to a delicious meal and an energetic environment with the hope that they will begin to return to their normal frequency of visiting Chipotle. The response to the offer was strong, especially right after our all-company meeting on February 8, with redemptions reaching a high of nearly $500,000 in a single day just a few days after the offer began. Comp transactions improved from down 34% for the full month of January, to a high point of down only 9% during the third week of February. Of course, it's not surprising that free offers were immediate action by our customers, but more importantly, as the number of redemptions level off, we saw our paying customers steadily increase. And by the first week of March when redemptions were down to under $100,000 per day, our comp transactions were down only 14% and comp sales were down 22%. We felt the recovery was off to a respectable start just 3 or 4 weeks into our marketing campaign.
As Steve mentioned, we implemented a number of new procedures and protocols to establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety. Some of these protocols were put to the test in Boston last month. We had 4 employees, who were at homesick and fully followed our protocols by not coming to work. We temporarily closed the restaurant and local health officials commended us for the successful design and execution of our protocols, which resulted in our restaurant remaining safe for our customers. Unfortunately, some stories referred to this as another outbreak, and those headlines interrupted our sales recovery. This was a disappointing setback, which caused our nationwide comp sales to worsen, to run negative 27% for a few weeks before recovering to the low to mid-negative 20s in late March. 
For all of March, comp TCs were down 15.6% and comp sales were down 26.4% with Easter negatively impacting both by about 2.5% as we lost 1 trading day in the month. The impact, the headlines concerning Boston taught us that the recovery can be fragile and if we need to rebuild trust with our customers, every single customer, every single day and every single restaurant.
Average daily sales increased sequentially in April versus late March by about 3% to 4%, but comps sales run rate, excluding the benefit of Easter, was right around negative 26% in April so far because seasonality typically has resulted in about a 6% to 7% increase in April sales over March. Including the benefit of Easter comp sales, we're around negative 22% for the first 3 weeks in April and comp transactions are around negative 16%  Easter added about 4% to both the sales and transaction comp so far. 
Now some of these lag in April sales are due to cold weather in some areas of the country early in the month, and we did see the comp for a few days improve to the low negative 20s during the past week. So we're hoping, we will still get that seasonality step up, we normally see this time of year, which is a few weeks later. The sales recovery has been uneven throughout the country. For the first 3 weeks of April, our traffic comps, excluding the Easter benefit, were negative 15% in the middle of the country, the Southeast and the Mid-Atlanta. Whereas they were down 20% company-wide again, excluding the benefit of Easter. That's about a 16-point recovery as compared to January, which means we recovered about half the last visit in these areas. But on the West Coast and the Northeast, the 2 areas closest to the outbreaks of late 2015, our traffic comps have recently been trending at negative 24%. Again, excluding the Easter benefit compared to negative 37% in January. So we've only recovered about 1/3 of customer visits in these areas.
For the first quarter, our sales were $834.5 million and our restaurant level operating margins were 6.8% for the quarter. As expected, the largest driver of the year-over-year decrease in margin was sales deleverage, which accounted for more than half of our drop in margin compared to 2015. There was also an impact of nearly 600 basis points of what we would consider to be nonrecurring expenses, including an elevated promotional and marketing investment that totaled 660 basis points, which is over 500 basis points higher than last year.
Food cost is higher than Q4 of 2015 by 150 basis points and we expect that food costs will remain at about this level for the rest of the year. 
While it's difficult to provide meaningful projection for either sales comps or margins in the coming quarters, especially given the sales volatility I just described, I can't tell you that the approximate margin level to expect at various sales levels. For example, with comps at the current average level, our average unit restaurant volumes are about $1.9 million on an annual basis and our restaurant level margins should improve to the low double digits in the next few quarters as the nonrecurring costs begin to level off. If comps are around negative 20%, AUVs would be about $2 million and margins would be around the mid-to-high teens. If comps recovered around negative 10%, AUVs would have been about $2.2 million and our margins should be in the low 20s. And if we fully recover our sales with AUVs in the $2.4 million to $2.5 million range, we would expect margins in the mid-20% range, which accounts for the recurring costs of new procedures and protocols that relate to food safety. 
Labor costs for the quarter were 30.9% of sales, an increase of 850 basis points compared to last year. More than 650 basis points of the change was triggered by sales deleverage. While we also had nearly 100 basis points tied to nonrecurring expenses, as we incurred additional labor in early February, March, this support our promotional strategy and also our national team meeting on February 8 when about 50,000 employees attended. 
We also continue to incur higher labor costs related to our merit increases taken in mid-2015 for restaurant crew and managers, which averaged about 7%, along with increased benefits and putting increased vacation date, paid sick leave and tuition reimbursement, all of which added about 160 basis points to labor. 
Our promotional and marketing expenses during the quarter totaled $55 million or about 6.6% of sales and has included $4 million or about 50 basis points related to promo offers that were issued in the first quarter, but they're expected to be redeemed in the second quarter. We'll continue to invest in recovering our customers, and promos will be an important part of the strategy, but we expect combined marketing and promo to level off to about 3% to 4% as a percentage of sales over the next few quarters. While this is lower than Q1, it's nearly double what we spend as a percent of sales in Q2 and Q3 of last year. When that's a more traditional brand advertising and returned talking about our delicious food made from high-quality ingredients. G&A for the first quarter was $62 million or 7.4% of sales down, $1 million from last year. Total stock-based comp included in G&A was $7.5 million, which is down about $7.6 million from last year. Offsetting that reduction were higher legal costs and the cost of the all-company meeting, which combined added $4 million of G&A. For the full year 2016, we anticipate total stock-based compensation and G&A to be about $60 million. And for the full year 2016, G&A will total just over $300 million or about $50 million higher than the last year as we have support for our new restaurant opening and as we will hold our biannual all-manager conference in September. 
Our effective tax rate benefit for the quarter was 40.6% and was impacted by nonrecurring adjustments related to state income taxes for prior year. Our effective tax for the full year is expected to be 38.4%. During the first quarter, we reported a loss of $26.4 million or diluted loss per share of $0.88. Our cash and investments totaled $706 million as of March 31, and we continue to be very aggressive with our balance sheet to repurchase stock. We've repurchased a total of $645 million from January 1 through yesterday at an average price of $463 per share. Since November 1, 2015, we've repurchased a total of $956 million of our stock, representing a reduction of nearly 2 million shares outstanding and we have $71.4 million left in our current authorization to purchase stock. As we work through this sales recovery, we will remain disciplined in restoring our unit economics to deliver attractive margins and returns and restore our ability to create significant shareholder value over the long term. Thank you for your time today and would be happy to open the lines for any questions you may have."

With regard to the brand attributes, they're all actually looking pretty good, but I'll give you a few examples. Aided consideration so obviously, when we gave give people a list of restaurants including our brand and ask them, how likely they are to visit. Before the food safety issues, that hovered around 50%. Right now that's recovered to 43%. So we're down 7 on that , one but it's picking up on a consistent rate. Admiration before these incidents was 70%, now it's at 61%. So again, recovering down into the 50% area. So a lot of that stuff has come back up nicely. The way we measure new customers, of course are the people who visited for the first time within the last 3 months, that's actually recovered almost -- it's just 2 points below what it was before that. This so that's really good news. On the customers who are last, we look at people who haven't been in 3 months or more, and that was you want a lower number there. That was 49% before, and now that's at 57%. So that one's probably got -- that's the biggest delta there. But for example, on another attribute, which is we serve healthy fresh and processed food, that's recovered to exactly the same levels as it was before. So it's a mixed bag. I don't know that any of them are problematic such that I don't think we're going to be able to recover them. Because we're seeing just nice trends all across the board on those. In terms of your question about frequency, we break our customers into 5 groups by frequency. We call our most frequent customers, top loyal they come 25 times and more a year. The next group are heavy customers. They come 13 to 24 times, then medium, which is 6 to 12, light is to 2 to 5 and our new or lapsed customers is 1 time. And you're correct in that we saw larger declines in both new in the 2 -- the top and bottom categories. So these are single-digit drops, but in new and lapsed and in top loyal. And so a lot of what we're looking at from a marketing perspective is bringing in those top loyal of that single digit drop in top loyal customers that we saw. And I'm not suggesting that these customers left altogether, but their frequency may have declined. So some of what I mentioned in my prepared remarks are aimed at either giving them a reason to come back in and that might be a new menu item or some sort of a frequency incentive, which I also mentioned, which would be coming in a certain number of times over a period of time and it'll give you something. So those are both efforts designed to target that group of customers."

One of the really good pieces of news in our research is that the differentiation of Chipotle from our competitors really has not suffered or is the extend that it did, it recovered fully. And so we're going to continue to push the messages about our 65 ingredients and how simple they are and our simple classic cooking techniques and how different that is from the competition whose food is, tends to be heavily processed and include hundreds and hundreds of ingredients, many of which are processed. So we're definitely getting back on that in July is when we'll really be in full swing with that type of marketing again. So we're transitioning back, but as I say that, there's going to be always a promotional element with those until we really fully recover our sales."

But we did find that, that was very, very popular with our loyal customers. In fact, for a lot of people we tried it, it quickly became their most favorite protein. And so it'll be very helpful for us from a marketing perspective to bring those customers back in and make our loyal customers come more often. So I think it's yet to be seen whether that means it'll become a permanent, but we'll try it out and see how it goes.

We cook this on our blancher. It has a lots of little crispy bits. So it has nice spice and really good texture and as Mark said, very, very popular with the customers that had it in a couple of our test markets. When we think about adding something to Chipotle, we're very, very mindful of our overall efficiencies, efficiencies in the kitchen, efficiencies in cook time, efficiencies in throughput and ease of ordering for the customer. Chorizo fits into this system really, really well in that we have space for it on the mainline and it doesn't detract from throughput. It sets -- it's also very easy to rotate onto the blancher to grill between chicken and steak. The cook time and the method of grilling isn't much different from the chicken and steak already on the blancher. So operationally, I would say it's quite easy to execute, but I think it's very exciting in that it does add a new flavor and texture to the meat offerings. And it pairs well with our existing offerings, our salsas and guacamole and cheese and what have you. So again, very popular and I'm excited to see how this works."

I wouldn't say all of them have been met with immediate approval. An example of that is we went over to a lettuce that was pre-shredded at a central kitchen in order to be able to be absolutely certain of that all the interventions were in place to make sure that, that was food safe, and that lettuce, I think people found to be a degradation in quality of the stuff that was cut in the restaurants by our teams who -- when our restaurant teams do it, they're able to cut it to the exact size they want. And so they're able to really make sure that the presentation is exactly what they want and that they can assure the quality of the lettuce. This was a product which was really just completely prepared in the central kitchen. So what we've been able to do and what we will be rolling out soon, we have been able to find a way to have this made completely safe by interventions in a central kitchen, but yet still have the entire head of lettuce brought to the restaurant and yet, and give our crews in the restaurant that the latitude to be able to cut that properly and assure the quality of that again. So we've just been tasting that the last few days in a few of our restaurants here in Denver and it's delicious. It's wonderful. And so we're going to be moving back to a lettuce that I think everyone else is very satisfied with. The rest of the changes have been met very positively. sous viding of the steak is delicious. We've actually had a reduction in the number of customer complaints. With steak, there's always been, over time, some complaints because steak contains naturally some chewy bits and whatnot because we use real steak. And with the sous vide, it's -- the technique has allowed us to break down some of those aspects of the steak through a kind about long raising process and the sous vide process, which makes the steak juicier and more tender and more delicious. So actually, we're very, very pleased with how that's going and our customers seemed to be very pleased as well. The blanching of the ingredients has had essentially has had no effect whatsoever on the eating quality of ingredients, but it's a wonderful step to ensure again food safety and the elimination of potential harmful pathogens or what have you. So our crews in the restaurants have done awesome job implementing that, that new procedure and they found it quite easy and they're very proud of it because it makes them --  it gives them even higher level of confidence in the food we're serving. And again, no degradation whatsoever in what our customers are receiving. So we are feeling really, really good about the quality of our food in our restaurants. I think it is actually better than ever. I think subject to that one change in lettuce, we thought that the bell peppers we were bringing in pre-slice from the central kitchen were good, but maybe not quite as good as the ones cut in our restaurants. So what we've been able to do is go back to blanching, now the bell peppers such that they can be cut by a knife, by the skilled hands of our folks in the restaurant. And again, brought that back to the level of quality it was before, but again, with the blanching to ensure food safety of that ingredient. So we're very proud of everything we've done. We think that the intent focus on our food, it's been caused by looking at every single ingredient. It's cost our teams in the restaurant to also look at every single ingredient, very, very critically and make certain that everything is as good as it can be. So I think our food is more delicious than ever with that one sort of asterisk that the lettuce was, I think not as good for the time, but we're returning that to where it was, and I think that we're very, very proud of where our food stands now."

I think that the short answer is no. We're not preparing for a slowdown of our development and I think you'll find that we will be able to achieve very easily the guidance that we've given in terms of the number of our restaurant openings. But we do have a very strong pipeline coming in from our real estate teams who have been doing an excellent job, finding a lot of terrific sites. But the reason for my comments was that as we've had a slowdown of sales overall, that you're all aware of, and the numbers that Jack spoke about with the slowdown of nationwide sales as a result of the -- of what happened in late 2015. So 2 has that slowdown affected our new store openings. But it's not -- it's affected them disproportionately. And what I mean is that most of our new restaurant openings has still held the same percentage that they historically has held versus our trailing 12-month sales of our existing stores. But the exception is that in the new markets and developing markets, in those markets, there's been I think even more softening of their sales than there has been nationally, say. So the delta between a new store opening in the developing or new market has been slightly greater than when you compare it to the rest of our restaurant average daily sales. So the delta of new and developing markets is a little bit bigger than the delta between proven and established markets. And so that percentage of all of our new store openings though is quite low, it's about 13% of our new store openings are in new markets or developing markets. And because those sales have been correspondingly a little more soft than the rest of openings, we're going to be taking just a much closer look at those and be more nitpicking as to which ones we do deals on. So it's going to be a very slight effect in terms of number of openings. And we have such a strong pipeline that we don't think it's going to affect the overall numbers that we've shared with you that we plan to open, but it's going to give us, I think the ability to be a little bit more discerning on a few of our locations and just make sure that anyone's for which the development cost is perhaps a little bit high or the rent structure isn't quite advantageous, we might walk away from some of those deals that we might have pursued a year ago today, that's for example. Just to be responsible with our investments."

But we're starting to see recovery back into that kind of low- to mid- 20% range at the end of March. Our sales dollars, when we move from the end of March to April, got better. They improved by in that 3% to 4% range, but we're comparing to seasonal fails that in the past and last year kind of follow the pattern of increasing more like 6% to 7% range. So our dollars moved up just from March to April from late March, which is in that low- to mid- 20% range. Our dollars from that range moved up in April. But because of the tougher comparison, our comps did retrench a little bit and then moved back to 26%. Now in the last week, we've seen a number of days in a row. It's not a pattern yet, but we've seen a number of days in a row that have gotten back into that mid to low 20% range. And so we're hoping that maybe seasonality just is showing up a little bit late, where we're going to get that bump. We do know that there was some cold and some wet weather throughout parts of the country early in April. And so we'll see whether we're going to get a step-up or not.

When you look at labor, for example, labor is worth by, I think, 850 basis points. Of that 600 of that is deleveraged because of sales. And so the most important thing we can do is get our sales back. Another 100 basis points is due to the very heavy promo that we did in the first quarter. So we had a lot of people visiting, a lot of people dining at Chipotle, but they didn't pay for all or part of their meal. Yes, we had to staff the restaurant. So there's about 100 basis points of that. And then there's another, I think, it's another 150 to 200 basis points or so of what I'll call inflation. It's stuff that we did last year. We had merit increases for our managers and crew. We rolled out or introduced a education program, college education, or education but usually college education. We started to pay for sick pay, and then we enhanced our sick pay. So those are all inflationary things that were in that kind of 150 to 200 basis points range. So those are the big pieces. Underneath all that, is there some inefficiencies? Sure, but maybe that's 100 basis points or so. We don't want to go out and squeeze labor right now and drive those efficiencies at a time when what's most important is for us to have a fully staffed team, to have the 4 pillars in place, have a team that feels ready to greet customers when they come in and hopefully at an accelerated rate. And so I wouldn't want to go after 100 basis points at labor line when what's most important is to have a great experience, and let's encouraging the sales probably to happen."

Chipotle has always been a company that is focused on a long-term vision to change the way people think about any fast food. As we move forward, we believe it is critical that we continue to focus on the things that have driven our success for so many years, our unique food culture and our unique people culture. It's been our focus on these key drivers of our business that has differentiated Chipotle in a crowded and competitive field, and that has allowed us to develop a strong loyalty among our customers. These key attributes are what has served us -- what has allowed us to serve delicious food and to provide outstanding customer service. Never has it been more important for us to delight our customers on each and every visit. And we have great confidence in our managers and crews to remain focused and to provide the extraordinary customer experience our customers expect from us.
We're also encouraged by the long-term opportunity that still exists for Chipotle, both in terms of adding new restaurants and attracting customers who have never tried our restaurants. In each of these ways, there is still so much untapped growth potential for Chipotle, and as we continue our efforts to restore lost sales tied to last year's food safety issues, there is significant opportunity for us to continue to grow our business by attracting new customers and opening new restaurants.
We began to see sales recover in the second half of the first quarter as our transaction trends reversed course from the lows we saw in January. Just the beginning of February, we have seen an 18-point improvement in comp transactions compared to the full month of January. We have worked to invite our customers back by reminding them of the things they love about Chipotle, such as our delicious food, our high-quality ingredients and being treated to a friendly, fast experience inside of our restaurants. While we have used promotional programs to entice many of our customers to return, we are encouraged to see signs that the promotional traffic has translated into repeat paying customers. Return of customers to our restaurants improved our same-store sales comps by 11% from January to recent levels. Of course, we would like to see our sales recover more quickly, but we remain confident in our long-term strategy to welcome customers back into our restaurants.
Right after the food safety issues we encountered last year, we took several bold steps to ensure our food was as safe as it could possibly be. That included a system -- a systematic evaluation of each ingredient and the implementation of interventions to make them safer. Some changes were made at the suppliers and others were made in our restaurants. Since all of the initial changes were implemented, we have continued to evaluate and refine each procedure. Some of the procedures, like blanching many of our produce items in the restaurant, have proven to be very effective and our crews are doing a great job at executing these new procedures.
In fact, we were able to add bell peppers to the blanching program, which meant that we are once again, able to slice the bell peppers in our restaurants, rather than at a central kitchen. We have also refined the way we are washing lettuce, which will once again allow us to cut the lettuce in our restaurants while still ensuring that it's safe. We're also continuing to refine many of the other procedures in ways that maximize safety while simultaneously making our food taste better.
During the quarter, we hired Dr. Jim Marsden as our Executive Food Director or Executive Director of Food Safety. Jim has been a tremendous asset as we continue to evaluate all of our safety protocols. Jim was previously a member of the faculty at Kansas State University in their animal science and industry department. He's working with a number of experts that have advised us in the past, and has also worked closely with the U.S. CDC and FDA and other food safety authorities as we continue to implement our industry-leading protocols. Jim's expertise and viewpoint has had a significant impact in a short period of time, and we continue to look forward to his leadership in furthering our food safety program.
We recognize that it will take us some time to rebuild trust with our customers, and to fully recover from the issues we faced late last year. And while we are encouraged that the recovery is underway, we know that there's still a lot more work to be done. We will continue to make it our top priority to entice customers to return to Chipotle through effective promotions and marketing. And when they do return, we're committed to providing the very best experience that we can, to help ensure that they will keep coming back. We know that the very best marketing we can do is to provide an exceptional restaurant experience and our managers and crews are working hard to make sure they're doing just that. I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

On November 1, we began conducting additional daily consumer research to help us measure and track consumer perceptions of our brand in the wake of the issues we saw last year. Key measures, including admiration, consideration, first-time visits and food quality are all continuing to improve. In some cases, consumer perception in these key areas has returned to levels close to what it was prior to Q4 of last year. For others, we still need to see additional improvements, but the trends continue to be promising.
In early February, we launched an aggressive marketing campaign designed to drive customers back into our restaurants. This campaign consisted of mobile and direct mail promotions, and nationwide advertising campaign and a variety of social, mobile and local marketing activities. The campaign began with the Rain Check mobile promotion distributed on the day of our company-wide meeting on February 8. As you may recall, this was the day we closed all of our restaurants for our national all-company meeting, and when we provided the opportunity for customers to get a free meal through a mobile offer. In all, we issued well over 5 million free burrito offers and saw an extraordinary redemption rate of 67%. We follow the mobile offer with a direct mail promotion to about 20 million households, and we currently have a 17.5% average redemption rate, which we expect to approach 20% as the redemption window closes. For those customers that had previously responded to direct mail, we're seeing a redemption rate of an impressive 44% and growing.
We are currently in the midst of our nationwide advertising campaign that runs through the end of June. This advertising campaign is the largest media spend in our history and is targeting all of our U.S. and Canadian locations. The creative features delicious food and reinforces our commitment to responsibly raised ingredients, cooked using classic cooking techniques and without the use of artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners. Our research showed that this campaign is performing particularly well with new customers.
In the coming months, we also plan to return to using nontraditional marketing that differentiates the Chipotle brand. This will include a short film and promotional game as well as other content-driven marketing programs. These upcoming marketing efforts will combine differentiating messages about Chipotle with traffic-driving components. Throughout the year, we will continue to be more aggressive than usual with our marketing, and we are considering 2 programs aimed at driving traffic among our loyal customers and last customers -- for our customer -- our last customers or -- that is customers who have not been to Chipotle in 3 months or more.
For example, we are exploring a limited time frequency incentive designed to reward our most loyal customers for eating frequently at Chipotle this summer. Additionally, we are considering adding menu items that will appeal to our loyal or lapsed customers. Over the years, we have tested additions to the menu that are proven to be very popular with our most frequent customers. While we didn't make these menu items permanent additions to the menu at the time, we do see an opportunity to introduce these or other items as a way of inviting our loyal customers back into our restaurants.
I'd also like to discuss the progress we're making in strengthening our digital ordering capabilities. We have completed the integration between Postmates, our largest delivery partner and our back-of-house ordering system. This allows Postmates to send orders directly to our back-of-house make line instead of standing-line [ph] order. We have completed this initial integration with Postmates, and we are currently using this new system at restaurants in San Francisco and Atlanta, and we'll be rolling it out in all of our markets in the coming months. We're also in the process of creating the same capability with our other delivery partners.
Next, we are testing a system that allows for smarter pickup times for customers who place online and mobile orders. This system is designed to reduce the time between order placements and pickup. The system dynamically monitors the flow of orders in our restaurants and gives our customers the shortest possible order completion time while simultaneously ensuring that the restaurants will complete the orders on time. This system is currently being tested in one our markets prior to being rolled out nationwide.
Finally, we issued updated versions of our iOS and Android ordering apps to make it easier for customers to pay using their credit or debit card, to speed up the payment process and then streamline reordering for our frequent customers. While it is early in our sales recovery process, we are encouraged by improving trends in customer sentiment and by customer response to our marketing and promotional efforts. We expect that we will see continued progress in these areas going forward as customers regain confidence in us, and remember what it is that they always loved about Chipotle. I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

At the heart of our efforts to ensure the very best experience we can for each and every customer, our teams of top-performing restaurant employees, managers and field leaders. The strength of our team has always been an advantage for us, because these teams truly believe in our mission, and treat our guests to unique and genuine customer experience. As we continue to rebuild trust with our customers by serving safe and delicious food, and as we continue to invite them back into our restaurants with our marketing and promotional programs, our restaurant teams are ready to provide the type of experience that will keep our customers coming back. 
I'm proud of how our teams are responding in this challenging recovery effort. They had quickly and efficiently implemented many changes in our restaurants over the last few months and simultaneously continued to provide a terrific experience. I'm incredibly warmed by the level of commitment and pride our teams have demonstrated during a difficult time, and I'm more confident than ever that they are the ones who will ensure that we fulfill our mission. Additionally, we are seeing the impact of stronger mid-level leadership through our improved Rate a Restaurateur promotions this year compared with last year.
Through the first quarter of 2016, we promoted 61 Restaurateur, an increase of 45% over the same time last year despite having even higher standards for the attainment of this elite position. We continue to refine the Restaurateur program and while our Restaurateur candidates have always been required to show a demonstrable success in building Restaurateur cultures, delivering excellent hospitality and ensuring a strong business model, we now have even more strict standards in all of those categories.
Today, before a Restaurateur can be selected, they must have excellent scores on our internal and external third-party audits related to food safety, and we continue to require more accountability for maintaining a disciplined business culture, including assessments of sales projections, throughput, scheduling and labor management, food orders and other management of key expenses. This business culture review, is in addition to developing an amazing people culture, perhaps the most challenging aspect of becoming a Restaurateur. So with better tools and established field leaders, our pipeline of general managers continues to grow.
To continue to emphasize the development of our Restaurateur culture during difficult times is critical. They are the ones who can most skillfully create excellent, safe and delicious restaurant experiences while developing future leaders we need to grow our business effectively. As we entice customers to return to our restaurants with more aggressive marketing and promotions, it is doubly important that we remind them what makes a meal at Chipotle so special by greeting them enthusiastically, having friendly and efficient service, great throughput and by making them a delicious meal. And the teams that are most able to do all these things well are our Restaurateur teams, who provide these great operations while ensuring a strong business model as well.
And as more Restaurateurs are stepping up, our best field leaders have been able to spend more time in our newer restaurants or restaurants that have the opportunity to perform much, much better. With more field leaders in our system than in recent years, our restaurants are getting more one-on-one attention on leadership than before, and that will help to build more of these elite Restaurateur cultures. 
In addition to the accelerated pace of these promotions during the quarter, we also promoted 63 existing Restaurateurs into multi-unit positions, and strengthened our ranks by promoting 24 additional field leaders. This continued investment in our Restaurateur and field leadership is paying off in a better customer experience. One example is the impact we've had on our throughput initiative. Our field leaders are working hard to set each restaurant up for success, and that starts by effectively implementing the 4 pillars of throughput.
When we have the 4 pillars in place, our restaurants are poised to engage with our customers and show our gratitude by serving them quickly on each and every visit. Our restaurants are prepared, organized and ready for the day with proper mise en place. All hands are on deck with aces in their places and with a dedicated linebacker that is in constant communication with the back of the house. And we can pull customers through the line faster with a dedicated expedited at the cashier position.
Incorporating the 4 pillars affects nearly every aspect of the guest experience. Of course, building great teams and great cultures in our restaurant starts with the people we hire, and with our ability to retain and develop our top performers. That's always the case. But more so in a tightening labor market. We know that if our employees feel cared for, and are given proper training such that they feel confident in their ability and encouraged by the circumstances, we have a much better chance of having them stay with us and develop careers at Chipotle. We are emphasizing this more with our restaurant managers and teams, starting with the need to hire only crew members who have the 13 characteristics. The qualities, we believe, make it more likely that a newly-hired employee will become a top performer at Chipotle. 
We are also reiterating to our restaurants, the need to involve crew in the interview process and hiring decisions for new crew. This also ensure that the people we are hiring in or restaurants are a good fit, and it demonstrates the importance of each and every employee we add to our team. Developing future teams and promoting from within is extremely important to us, particularly as we can continue to bring Chipotle to more locations across the United States. During the quarter, we opened 58 new restaurants and for 2016, we plan to open 220 to 235 new restaurants. Looking beyond this year, there's still significant opportunity for us to continue to open new restaurants at a healthy pace. We will continue to balance the opportunity for further growth with a disciplined approach to development to ensure that we are opening up new restaurants in great locations with a strong economics and staffed with top-performing teams.
As many of you have experienced firsthand, our restaurants are feeling busy again. Relative to December and January, they have more energy, more customers and enthusiastic teams ready to greet them. Our food taste is great and we're continuing to emphasize customer service and hospitality as we make headway in increasing our sales. That said, it's more critical now than ever that every restaurant delivers on the high standards that we have set for Chipotle. We have the utmost confidence in our crews, managers and Restaurateurs as well as our field leadership to continue to improve upon these qualities that make Chipotle great. I'll now turn the call over to Jack."
26446,329534474,963716,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thinks, Monty. We invested aggressively during the first quarter to encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. Our customers redeemed over 6 million free burritos or bowls during February-March. And we also gave away nearly 1 million free orders of ch",1554,"Thinks, Monty. We invested aggressively during the first quarter to encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. Our customers redeemed over 6 million free burritos or bowls during February-March. And we also gave away nearly 1 million free orders of chips and salsa or chips and guac. The goal is to invite our customers back into Chipotle with a compelling offer, treat them to a delicious meal and an energetic environment with the hope that they will begin to return to their normal frequency of visiting Chipotle. The response to the offers was strong, especially right after our all-company meeting on February 8, with redemptions reaching a high of nearly $500,000 in a single day just a few days after the offer began. Comp transactions improved from down 34% for the full month of January, to a high point of down only 9% during the third week of February. 
Of course, it's not surprising that free offers were immediate actioned by our customers, but more importantly, as the number of redemptions level off, we saw our paying customers steadily increase. And by the first week of March when redemptions were down to under $100,000 per day, our comp transactions were down only 14% and comp sales were down 22%. We felt the recovery was off to a respectable start just 3 or 4 weeks into our marketing campaign.
As Steve mentioned, we implemented a number of new procedures and protocols to establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety. Some of these protocols were put to the test in Boston last month when we had 4 employees, who were at home, sick and fully followed our protocols by not coming to work. We temporarily closed the restaurant and local health officials commended us for the successful design and execution of our protocols, which resulted in our restaurant remaining safe for our customers. Unfortunately, some stories referred to this as another outbreak, and those headlines interrupted our sales recovery. This was a disappointing setback, which caused our nationwide comp sales to worsen, to run negative 27% for a few weeks before recovering to the low to mid-negative 20s in late March. 
For all of March, comp TCs were down 15.6% and comp sales were down 26.4% with Easter negatively impacting both by about 2.5% as we lost 1 trading day in the month. The impact of the headlines concerning Boston taught us that the recovery can be fragile and that we need to rebuild trust with our customers, every single customer, every single day and every single restaurant.
Average daily sales increased sequentially in April versus late March by about 3% to 4%, but comps sales run rate, excluding the benefit of Easter, was right around negative 26% in April so far because seasonality typically has resulted in about a 6% to 7% increase in April sales over March. Including the benefit of Easter comp sales, we're around negative 22% for the first 3 weeks in April and comp transactions are around negative 16% Easter added about 4% to both the sales and transaction comp so far. 
Now some of this lag in April sales are due to cold weather in some areas of the country early in the month, and we did see the comp for a few days improve to the low negative 20s during the past week, so we're hoping, we will still get that seasonality step up, we normally see this time of year, but just a few weeks later. 
The sales recovery has been uneven throughout the country. For the first 3 weeks of April, our traffic comps, excluding the Easter benefit, were negative 15% in the middle of the country, the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic; whereas they were down 20% company-wide again, excluding the benefit of Easter. That's about a 16-point recovery as compared to January, which means we recovered about half the lost visits in these areas. But on the West Coast and the Northeast, the 2 areas closest to the outbreaks of late 2015, our traffic comps have recently been trending at negative 24%, again, excluding the Easter benefit compared to negative 37% in January. So we've only recovered about 1/3 of customer visits in these areas.
For the first quarter, our sales were $834.5 million and our restaurant level operating margins were 6.8% for the quarter. As expected, the largest driver of the year-over-year decrease in margin was sales deleverage, which accounted for more than half of our drop in margin compared to 2015. There was also an impact of nearly 600 basis points of what we would consider to be nonrecurring expenses, including an elevated promotional and marketing investment that totaled 660 basis points, which is over 500 basis points higher than last year.
Food cost was higher than Q4 of 2015 by 150 basis points and we expect that food costs will remain at about this level for the rest of the year. 
While it's difficult to provide meaningful projection for either sales comps or margins in the coming quarters, especially given the sales volatility I just described, I can tell you that the approximate margin level to expect at various sales levels. For example, with comps at the current average level, our average unit restaurant volumes are about $1.9 million on an annual basis and our restaurant level margins should improve to the low double digits in the next few quarters as the nonrecurring costs begin to level off. If comps are around negative 20%, AUVs would be about $2 million and margins would be around the mid-to-high teens. If comps recovered around negative 10%, AUVs would be about $2.2 million and our margins should be in the low 20s. And if we fully recover our sales with AUVs in the $2.4 million to $2.5 million range, we would expect margins in the mid-20% range, which accounts for the recurring costs of new procedures and protocols that relate to food safety. 
Labor costs for the quarter were 30.9% of sales, or an increase of 850 basis points compared to last year. More than 600 basis points of the change was triggered by sales deleverage. While we also had nearly 100 basis points tied to nonrecurring expenses, as we incurred additional labor in early February, March to support our promotional strategy and also our national team meeting on February 8 when about 50,000 employees attended. 
We also continue to incur higher labor costs related to our merit increases taken in mid-2015 for restaurant crew and managers, which averaged about 7%, along with increased benefits including increased vacation days, paid sick leave and tuition reimbursement, all of which added about 160 basis points to labor. 
Our promotional and marketing expenses during the quarter totaled $55 million or about 6.6% of sales and this included $4 million or about 50 basis points related to promo offers that were issued in the first quarter, but they're expected to be redeemed in the second quarter. We'll continue to invest in recovering our customers, and promos will be an important part of the strategy, but we expect combined marketing and promos to level off to about 3% to 4% as a percentage of sales over the next few quarters. While this is lower than Q1, it's nearly double what we spent as a percent of sales in Q2 and Q3 of last year. 
We'll invest in more traditional brand advertising and return to talking about our delicious food made from high-quality ingredients. G&A for the first quarter was $62 million or 7.4% of sales down, $1 million from last year. Total stock-based comp included in G&A was $7.5 million, which is down about $7.6 million from last year. Offsetting that reduction were higher legal costs and the cost of the all-company meeting, which combined added $4 million to G&A. For the full year 2016, we anticipate total stock-based compensation and G&A to be about $60 million. And for the full year 2016, G&A will total just over $300 million or about $50 million higher than the last year as we have support for our new restaurant opening and as we will hold our biennial all-manager conference in September. 
Our effective tax rate benefit for the quarter was 40.6% and was impacted by nonrecurring adjustments related to state income taxes for prior year. Our effective tax for the full year is expected to be 38.4%. During the first quarter, we reported a loss of $26.4 million or diluted loss per share of $0.88. Our cash and investments totaled $706 million as of March 31, and we continue to be very aggressive with our balance sheet to repurchase stock. We've repurchased a total of $645 million from January 1 through yesterday at an average price of $463 per share. Since November 1, 2015, we've repurchased a total of $956 million of our stock, representing a reduction of nearly 2 million shares outstanding and we have $71.4 million left in our current authorization to purchase stock. As we work through this sales recovery, we will remain disciplined in restoring our unit economics to deliver attractive margins and returns and restore our ability to create significant shareholder value over the long term. Thank you for your time today and would be happy to open the lines for any questions you may have."

With regard to the brand attributes, they're all actually looking pretty good, but I'll give you a few examples. Aided consideration so obviously, when we gave give people a list of restaurants including our brand and ask them, how likely they are to visit. Before the food safety issues, that hovered around 50%. Right now that's recovered to 43%. So we're down 7% on that one but it's picking up on a consistent rate. Admiration before these incidents was 70%, now it's at 61%. So again, recovering down into the 50% area. So a lot of that stuff has come back up nicely. The way we measure new customers, of course are the people who visited for the first time within the last 3 months, that's actually recovered almost -- it's just 2 points below what it was before that. This so that's really good news. On the customers who are lapsed, we look at people who haven't been in 3 months or more, and that was -- you want a lower number there, that was 49% before, and now that's at 57%. So that one's probably got -- that's the biggest delta there. But for example, on another attribute, which is we serve healthy, fresh unprocessed food, that's recovered to exactly the same levels as it was before. So it's a mixed bag. I don't know that any of them are problematic such that I don't think we're going to be able to recover them. Because we're seeing just nice trends all across the board on those. In terms of your question about frequency, we break our customers into 5 groups by frequency. We call our most frequent customers, top loyal they come 25 times and more a year. The next group are heavy customers. They come 13 to 24 times, then medium, which is 6 to 12, light is to 2 to 5 and our new or lapsed customers is 1 time. And you're correct in that we saw larger declines in both new in the 2 -- the top and bottom categories. So these are single-digit drops, but in new and lapsed and in top loyal. And so a lot of what we're looking at from a marketing perspective is bringing in those top loyal of that single digit drop in top loyal customers that we saw. And I'm not suggesting that these customers left altogether, but their frequency may have declined. So some of what I mentioned in my prepared remarks are aimed at either giving them a reason to come back in and that might be a new menu item or some sort of a frequency incentive, which I also mentioned, which would be coming in a certain number of times over a period of time and it'll give you something. So those are both efforts designed to target that group of customers."

One of the really good pieces of news in our research is that the differentiation of Chipotle from our competitors really has not suffered or is the extend that it did, it recovered fully. And so we're going to continue to push the messages about our 65 ingredients and how simple they are and our simple classic cooking techniques and how different that is from the competition whose food is -- tends to be heavily processed and include hundreds and hundreds of ingredients, many of which are processed. So we're definitely getting back on that in July is when we'll really be in full swing with that type of marketing again.

But we did find that, that was very, very popular with our loyal customers. In fact, for a lot of people we tried it, it quickly became their most favorite protein. And so it'll be very helpful for us from a marketing perspective to bring those customers back in and make our loyal customers come more often. So I think it's yet to be seen whether that means it'll become a permanent, but we'll try it out and see how it goes.

We cook this on our Plancha. It has a lots of little crispy bits. So it has nice spice and really good texture and as Mark said, very, very popular with the customers that had it in a couple of our test markets. When we think about adding something to Chipotle, we're very, very mindful of our overall efficiencies, efficiencies in the kitchen, efficiencies in cook time, efficiencies in throughput and ease of ordering for the customer. Chorizo fits into this system really, really well in that we have space for it on the main line and it doesn't detract from throughput. It sets -- it's also very easy to rotate onto the Plancha to grill between chicken and steak. The cook time and the method of grilling isn't much different from the chicken and steak already on the Plancha. So operationally, I would say it's quite easy to execute, but I think it's very exciting in that it does add a new flavor and texture to the meat offerings. And it pairs well with our existing offerings, our salsas and guacamole and cheese and what have you. So again, very popular and I'm excited to see how this works."

An example of that is we went over to a lettuce that was pre-shredded at a central kitchen in order to be able to be absolutely certain of that all the interventions were in place to make sure that, that was food safe, and that lettuce, I think people found to be a degradation in quality of the stuff that was cut in the restaurants by our teams who -- when our restaurant teams do it, they're able to cut it to the exact size they want. And so they're able to really make sure that the presentation is exactly what they want and that they can assure the quality of the lettuce. This was a product which was really just completely prepared in the central kitchen. So what we've been able to do and what we will be rolling out soon, we have been able to find a way to have this made completely safe by interventions in a central kitchen, but yet still have the entire head of lettuce brought to the restaurant and yet, and give our crews in the restaurant that the latitude to be able to cut that properly and assure the quality of that again. So we've just been tasting that the last few days in a few of our restaurants here in Denver and it's delicious. It's wonderful. And so we're going to be moving back to a lettuce that I think everyone else is very satisfied with. The rest of the changes have been met very positively. sous viding of the steak is delicious. We've actually had a reduction in the number of customer complaints. With steak, there's always been, over time, some complaints because steak contains naturally some chewy bits and whatnot because we use real steak. And with the sous vide, it's -- the technique has allowed us to break down some of those aspects of the steak through a kind about long breathing process and the sous vide process, which makes the steak juicier and more tender and more delicious. So actually, we're very, very pleased with how that's going and our customers seemed to be very pleased as well. The blanching of the ingredients has had essentially has had no effect whatsoever on the eating quality of ingredients, but it's a wonderful step to ensure again food safety and the elimination of potential harmful pathogens or what have you. So our crews in the restaurants have done awesome job implementing that, that new procedure and they found it quite easy and they're very proud of it because it makes them -- it gives them even higher level of confidence in the food we're serving. And again, no degradation whatsoever in what our customers are receiving. So we are feeling really, really good about the quality of our food in our restaurants. I think it is actually better than ever. I think subject to that one change in lettuce, we thought that the bell peppers we were bringing in pre-sliced from the central kitchen were good, but maybe not quite as good as the ones cut in our restaurants. So what we've been able to do is go back to blanching, now the bell peppers such that they can be cut by a knife, by the skilled hands of our folks in the restaurant. And again, brought that back to the level of quality it was before, but again, with the blanching to ensure food safety of that ingredient. So we're very proud of everything we've done. We think that the intent focus on our food that's been caused by looking at every single ingredient. It's caused our teams in the restaurant to also look at every single ingredient, very, very critically and make certain that everything is as good as it can be. So I think our food is more delicious than ever with that one sort of asterisk that the lettuce was, I think not as good for a time, but we're returning that to where it was, and I think that we're very, very proud of where our food stands now."

I think that the short answer is no. We're not preparing for a slowdown of our development and I think you'll find that we will be able to achieve very easily the guidance that we've given in terms of the number of our restaurant openings. But we do have a very strong pipeline coming in from our real estate teams who have been doing an excellent job, finding a lot of terrific sites. But the reason for my comments was that as we've had a slowdown of sales overall, that you're all aware of, in the numbers that Jack spoke about with the slowdown of nationwide sales as a result of the -- of what happened in late 2015, so too has that slowdown affected our new store openings. But it's not -- it's affected them disproportionately. And what I mean is that most of our new restaurant openings has still held the same percentage that they historically has held versus our trailing 12-month sales of our existing stores. But the exception is that in the new markets and developing markets, in those markets, there's been I think even more softening of their sales than there has been nationally, say. So the delta between a new store opening in the developing or new market has been slightly greater than when you compare it to the rest of our restaurant average daily sales. So the delta of new and developing markets is a little bit bigger than the delta between proven and established markets. And so that percentage of all of our new store openings though is quite low, it's about 13% of our new store openings are in new markets or developing markets. And because those sales have been correspondingly a little more soft than the rest of openings, we're going to be taking just a much closer look at those and be more nitpicking as to which ones we do deals on. So it's going to be a very slight effect in terms of number of openings. And we have such a strong pipeline that we don't think it's going to affect the overall numbers that we've shared with you that we plan to open, but it's going to give us, I think the ability to be a little bit more discerning on a few of our locations and just make sure that anyone for which the development cost is perhaps a little bit high or the rent structure isn't quite advantageous, we might walk away from some of those deals that we might have pursued a year ago today, that's for example. Just to be responsible with our investments."

So you're talking about a 3% to 4% figure on top of higher sales. So it'll be meaningfully reduced. And what you'll see is that reduction is going to be in the promo. We hit promo, as you know, very, very heavy. We gave away about 6 million entrées during the first quarter, and we did that intentionally. We wanted to hit that really hard. We wanted to signal that the event was over. We signaled that within a week or 2 after the CDC called their investigation over. And so we did that individually. Going forward, as Mark mentioned, we're going to be transitioning to more BOGOs, which have a lesser impact on our promo line. Offsetting that, we're actually going to spend more in advertising during the second and -- second quarter for sure, probably third quarter so. But overall, we expect that to be in the 3% to 4% range. Now that's still higher than historical because if you look at second quarter and third quarter of last year, I think that's right around double or a little more the double what we did as a percentage of sales last year."

Near the end of the month and you've got a lot of choppiness with Easter this year at the end of March, and then you compare it to Easter last year in early April. But we're starting to see recovery back into that kind of low- to mid- 20% range at the end of March. Our sales dollars, when we move from the end of March to April, got better. They improved by in that 3% to 4% range, but we're comparing to seasonal fails that in the past and last year kind of follow the pattern of increasing more like 6% to 7% range. So our dollars moved up just from March to April from late March, which is in that low- to mid- 20% range. Our dollars from that range moved up in April. But because of the tougher comparison, our comps did retrench a little bit and then moved back to 26%. Now in the last week, we've seen a number of days in a row. It's not a pattern yet, but we've seen a number of days in a row that have gotten back into that mid to low 20% range. And so we're hoping that maybe seasonality just is showing up a little bit late, where we're going to get that bump. We do know that there was some cold and some wet weather throughout parts of the country early in April. And so we'll see whether we're going to get a step-up or not.

When you look at labor, for example, labor is worth by, I think, 850 basis points. Of that 600 of that is deleveraged because of sales. And so the most important thing we can do is get our sales back. Another 100 basis points is due to the very heavy promo that we did in the first quarter. So we had a lot of people visiting, a lot of people dining at Chipotle, but they didn't pay for all or part of their meal, yet we had to staff the restaurant. So there's about 100 basis points of that. And then there's another, I think, it's another 150 to 200 basis points or so of what I'll call inflation. It's stuff that we did last year. We had merit increases for our managers and crew. We rolled out or introduced a education program, college education, or education but usually college education. We started to pay for sick pay, and then we enhanced our vacation pay. So those are all inflationary things that were in that kind of 150 to 200 basis points range. So those are the big pieces. Underneath all that, is there some inefficiencies? Sure, but maybe that's 100 basis points or so. We don't want to go out and squeeze labor right now and drive those efficiencies at a time when what's most important is for us to have a fully staffed team, to have the 4 pillars in place, have a team that feels ready to greet customers when they come in and hopefully at an accelerated rate.

And we have great confidence in our managers and crews to remain focused and to provide the extraordinary customer experience our customers expect from us.
We're also encouraged by the long-term opportunity that still exists for Chipotle, both in terms of adding new restaurants and attracting customers who have never tried our restaurants. In each of these ways, there is still so much untapped growth potential for Chipotle, and as we continue our efforts to restore lost sales tied to last year's food safety issues, there is significant opportunity for us to continue to grow our business by attracting new customers and opening new restaurants.
We began to see sales recover in the second half of the first quarter as our transaction trends reversed course from the lows we saw in January. Just the beginning of February, we have seen an 18-point improvement in comp transactions compared to the full month of January. We have worked to invite our customers back by reminding them of the things they love about Chipotle, such as our delicious food, our high-quality ingredients and being treated to a friendly, fast experience inside of our restaurants. While we have used promotional programs to entice many of our customers to return, we are encouraged to see signs that the promotional traffic has translated into repeat paying customers. Return of customers to our restaurants improved our same-store sales comps by 11% from January to recent levels. Of course, we would like to see our sales recover more quickly, but we remain confident in our long-term strategy to welcome customers back into our restaurants.
Right after the food safety issues we encountered last year, we took several bold steps to ensure our food was as safe as it could possibly be. That included a system -- a systematic evaluation of each ingredient and the implementation of interventions to make them safer. Some changes were made at the suppliers and others were made in our restaurants. Since all of the initial changes were implemented, we have continued to evaluate and refine each procedure. Some of the procedures, like blanching many of our produce items in the restaurant, have proven to be very effective and our crews are doing a great job at executing these new procedures.
In fact, we were able to add bell peppers to the blanching program, which meant that we are once again, able to slice the bell peppers in our restaurants, rather than at a central kitchen. We have also refined the way we are washing lettuce, which will once again allow us to cut the lettuce in our restaurants while still ensuring that it's safe. We're also continuing to refine many of the other procedures in ways that maximize safety while simultaneously making our food taste better.
During the quarter, we hired Dr. Jim Marsden as our Executive Food Director or Executive Director of Food Safety. Jim has been a tremendous asset as we continue to evaluate all of our safety protocols. Jim was previously a member of the faculty at Kansas State University in their animal science and industry department. He's working with a number of experts that have advised us in the past, and has also worked closely with the U.S. CDC and FDA and other food safety authorities as we continue to implement our industry-leading protocols. Jim's expertise and viewpoint has had a significant impact in a short period of time, and we continue to look forward to his leadership in furthering our food safety program.
We recognize that it will take us some time to rebuild trust with our customers, and to fully recover from the issues we faced late last year. And while we are encouraged that the recovery is underway, we know that there's still a lot more work to be done. We will continue to make it our top priority to entice customers to return to Chipotle through effective promotions and marketing. And when they do return, we're committed to providing the very best experience that we can, to help ensure that they will keep coming back. We know that the very best marketing we can do is to provide an exceptional restaurant experience and our managers and crews are working hard to make sure they're doing just that.

On November 1, we began conducting additional daily consumer research to help us measure and track consumer perceptions of our brand in the wake of the issues we saw last year. Key measures, including admiration, consideration, first-time visits and food quality are all continuing to improve. In some cases, consumer perception in these key areas has returned to levels close to what it was prior to Q4 of last year. For others, we still need to see additional improvements, but the trends continue to be promising.
In early February, we launched an aggressive marketing campaign designed to drive customers back into our restaurants. This campaign consisted of mobile and direct mail promotions, and nationwide advertising campaign and a variety of social, mobile and local marketing activities. The campaign began with the Rain Check mobile promotion distributed on the day of our company-wide meeting on February 8. As you may recall, this was the day we closed all of our restaurants for our national all-company meeting, and when we provided the opportunity for customers to get a free meal through a mobile offer. In all, we issued well over 5 million free burrito offers and saw an extraordinary redemption rate of 67%. We follow the mobile offer with a direct mail promotion to about 20 million households, and we currently have a 17.5% average redemption rate, which we expect to approach 20% as the redemption window closes. For those customers that had previously responded to direct mail, we're seeing a redemption rate of an impressive 44% and growing.
We are currently in the midst of our nationwide advertising campaign that runs through the end of June. This advertising campaign is the largest media spend in our history and is targeting all of our U.S. and Canadian locations. The creative features delicious food and reinforces our commitment to responsibly raised ingredients, cooked using classic cooking techniques and without the use of artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners. Our research showed that this campaign is performing particularly well with new customers.
In the coming months, we also plan to return to using nontraditional marketing that differentiates the Chipotle brand. This will include a short film and promotional game as well as other content-driven marketing programs. These upcoming marketing efforts will combine differentiating messages about Chipotle with traffic-driving components. Throughout the year, we will continue to be more aggressive than usual with our marketing, and we are considering 2 programs aimed at driving traffic among our loyal customers and last customers -- for our customer -- our last customers or -- that is customers who have not been to Chipotle in 3 months or more.
For example, we are exploring a limited time frequency incentive designed to reward our most loyal customers for eating frequently at Chipotle this summer. Additionally, we are considering adding menu items that will appeal to our loyal or lapsed customers. Over the years, we have tested additions to the menu that are proven to be very popular with our most frequent customers. While we didn't make these menu items permanent additions to the menu at the time, we do see an opportunity to introduce these or other items as a way of inviting our loyal customers back into our restaurants.
I'd also like to discuss the progress we're making in strengthening our digital ordering capabilities. We have completed the integration between Postmates, our largest delivery partner and our back-of-house ordering system. This allows Postmates to send orders directly to our back-of-house make line instead of standing in line order. We have completed this initial integration with Postmates, and we are currently using this new system at restaurants in San Francisco and Atlanta, and we'll be rolling it out in all of our markets in the coming months. We're also in the process of creating the same capability with our other delivery partners.
Next, we are testing a system that allows for smarter pickup times for customers who place online and mobile orders. This system is designed to reduce the time between order placements and pickup. The system dynamically monitors the flow of orders in our restaurants and gives our customers the shortest possible order completion time while simultaneously ensuring that the restaurants will complete the orders on time. This system is currently being tested in one our markets prior to being rolled out nationwide.
Finally, we issued updated versions of our iOS and Android ordering apps to make it easier for customers to pay using their credit or debit card, to speed up the payment process and then streamline reordering for our frequent customers. While it is early in our sales recovery process, we are encouraged by improving trends in customer sentiment and by customer response to our marketing and promotional efforts. We expect that we will see continued progress in these areas going forward as customers regain confidence in us, and remember what it is that they always loved about Chipotle.

At the heart of our efforts to ensure the very best experience we can for each and every customer, our teams of top-performing restaurant employees, managers and field leaders. The strength of our team has always been an advantage for us,",1145,"Thank you, Mark. At the heart of our efforts to ensure the very best experience we can for each and every customer, our teams of top-performing restaurant employees, managers and field leaders. The strength of our team has always been an advantage for us, because these teams truly believe in our mission, and treat our guests to unique and genuine customer experience. As we continue to rebuild trust with our customers by serving safe and delicious food, and as we continue to invite them back into our restaurants with our marketing and promotional programs, our restaurant teams are ready to provide the type of experience that will keep our customers coming back. 
I'm proud of how our teams are responding in this challenging recovery effort. They had quickly and efficiently implemented many changes in our restaurants over the last few months and simultaneously continued to provide a terrific experience. I'm incredibly warmed by the level of commitment and pride our teams have demonstrated during a difficult time, and I'm more confident than ever that they are the ones who will ensure that we fulfill our mission. Additionally, we are seeing the impact of stronger mid-level leadership through our improved Rate a Restaurateur promotions this year compared with last year.
Through the first quarter of 2016, we promoted 61 Restaurateur, an increase of 45% over the same time last year despite having even higher standards for the attainment of this elite position. We continue to refine the Restaurateur program and while our Restaurateur candidates have always been required to show a demonstrable success in building Restaurateur cultures, delivering excellent hospitality and ensuring a strong business model, we now have even more strict standards in all of those categories.
Today, before a Restaurateur can be selected, they must have excellent scores on our internal and external third-party audits related to food safety, and we continue to require more accountability for maintaining a disciplined business culture, including assessments of sales projections, throughput, scheduling and labor management, food orders and other management of key expenses. This business culture review, is in addition to developing an amazing people culture, perhaps the most challenging aspect of becoming a Restaurateur. So with better tools and established field leaders, our pipeline of general managers continues to grow.
To continue to emphasize the development of our Restaurateur culture during difficult times is critical. They are the ones who can most skillfully create excellent, safe and delicious restaurant experiences while developing future leaders we need to grow our business effectively. As we entice customers to return to our restaurants with more aggressive marketing and promotions, it is doubly important that we remind them what makes a meal at Chipotle so special by greeting them enthusiastically, having friendly and efficient service, great throughput and by making them a delicious meal. And the teams that are most able to do all these things well are our Restaurateur teams, who provide these great operations while ensuring a strong business model as well.
And as more Restaurateurs are stepping up, our best field leaders have been able to spend more time in our newer restaurants or restaurants that have the opportunity to perform much, much better. With more field leaders in our system than in recent years, our restaurants are getting more one-on-one attention on leadership than before, and that will help to build more of these elite Restaurateur cultures. 
In addition to the accelerated pace of these promotions during the quarter, we also promoted 63 existing Restaurateurs into multi-unit positions, and strengthened our ranks by promoting 24 additional field leaders. This continued investment in our Restaurateur and field leadership is paying off in a better customer experience. One example is the impact we've had on our throughput initiative. Our field leaders are working hard to set each restaurant up for success, and that starts by effectively implementing the 4 pillars of throughput.
When we have the 4 pillars in place, our restaurants are poised to engage with our customers and show our gratitude by serving them quickly on each and every visit. Our restaurants are prepared, organized and ready for the day with proper mise en place. All hands are on deck with aces in their places and with a dedicated linebacker that is in constant communication with the back of the house. And we can pull customers through the line faster with a dedicated expedited at the cashier position.
Incorporating the 4 pillars affects nearly every aspect of the guest experience. Of course, building great teams and great cultures in our restaurant starts with the people we hire, and with our ability to retain and develop our top performers. That's always the case. But more so in a tightening labor market. We know that if our employees feel cared for, and are given proper training such that they feel confident in their ability and encouraged by the circumstances, we have a much better chance of having them stay with us and develop careers at Chipotle. We are emphasizing this more with our restaurant managers and teams, starting with the need to hire only crew members who have the 13 characteristics. The qualities, we believe, make it more likely that a newly-hired employee will become a top performer at Chipotle. 
We are also reiterating to our restaurants, the need to involve crew in the interview process and hiring decisions for new crew. This also ensure that the people we are hiring in or restaurants are a good fit, and it demonstrates the importance of each and every employee we add to our team. Developing future teams and promoting from within is extremely important to us, particularly as we can continue to bring Chipotle to more locations across the United States. During the quarter, we opened 58 new restaurants and for 2016, we plan to open 220 to 235 new restaurants. Looking beyond this year, there's still significant opportunity for us to continue to open new restaurants at a healthy pace. We will continue to balance the opportunity for further growth with a disciplined approach to development to ensure that we are opening up new restaurants in great locations with a strong economics and staffed with top-performing teams.
As many of you have experienced firsthand, our restaurants are feeling busy again. Relative to December and January, they have more energy, more customers and enthusiastic teams ready to greet them. Our food taste is great and we're continuing to emphasize customer service and hospitality as we make headway in increasing our sales. That said, it's more critical now than ever that every restaurant delivers on the high standards that we have set for Chipotle. We have the utmost confidence in our crews, managers and Restaurateurs as well as our field leadership to continue to improve upon these qualities that make Chipotle great.

26446,329534474,963928,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thinks, Monty.

Our customers redeemed over 6 million free burritos or bowls during February-March. And we also gave away nearly 1 million free orders of chips and salsa or chips and guac. The goal is to invite our customers back into Chipotle with a compelling offer, treat them to a delicious meal and an energetic environment with the hope that they will begin to return to their normal frequency of visiting Chipotle. The response to the offers was strong, especially right after our all-company meeting on February 8, with redemptions reaching a high of nearly $500,000 in a single day just a few days after the offer began. Comp transactions improved from down 34% for the full month of January, to a high point of down only 9% during the third week of February. 
Of course, it's not surprising that free offers were immediate actioned by our customers, but more importantly, as the number of redemptions level off, we saw our paying customers steadily increase. And by the first week of March when redemptions were down to under $100,000 per day, our comp transactions were down only 14% and comp sales were down 22%. We felt the recovery was off to a respectable start just 3 or 4 weeks into our marketing campaign.
As Steve mentioned, we implemented a number of new procedures and protocols to establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety. Some of these protocols were put to the test in Boston last month when we had 4 employees, who were at home, sick and fully followed our protocols by not coming to work. We temporarily closed the restaurant and local health officials commended us for the successful design and execution of our protocols, which resulted in our restaurant remaining safe for our customers. Unfortunately, some stories referred to this as another outbreak, and those headlines interrupted our sales recovery. This was a disappointing setback, which caused our nationwide comp sales to worsen, to run negative 27% for a few weeks before recovering to the low to mid-negative 20s in late March. 
For all of March, comp TCs were down 15.6% and comp sales were down 26.4% with Easter negatively impacting both by about 2.5% as we lost 1 trading day in the month. The impact of the headlines concerning Boston taught us that the recovery can be fragile and that we need to rebuild trust with our customers, every single customer, every single day and every single restaurant.
Average daily sales increased sequentially in April versus late March by about 3% to 4%, but comps sales run rate, excluding the benefit of Easter, was right around negative 26% in April so far because seasonality typically has resulted in about a 6% to 7% increase in April sales over March. Including the benefit of Easter comp sales, we're around negative 22% for the first 3 weeks in April and comp transactions are around negative 16% Easter added about 4% to both the sales and transaction comp so far. 
Now some of this lag in April sales are due to cold weather in some areas of the country early in the month, and we did see the comp for a few days improve to the low negative 20s during the past week, so we're hoping, we will still get that seasonality step up, we normally see this time of year, but just a few weeks later. 
The sales recovery has been uneven throughout the country. For the first 3 weeks of April, our traffic comps, excluding the Easter benefit, were negative 15% in the middle of the country, the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic; whereas they were down 20% company-wide again, excluding the benefit of Easter. That's about a 16-point recovery as compared to January, which means we recovered about half the lost visits in these areas. But on the West Coast and the Northeast, the 2 areas closest to the outbreaks of late 2015, our traffic comps have recently been trending at negative 24%, again, excluding the Easter benefit compared to negative 37% in January. So we've only recovered about 1/3 of customer visits in these areas.
For the first quarter, our sales were $834.5 million and our restaurant level operating margins were 6.8% for the quarter. As expected, the largest driver of the year-over-year decrease in margin was sales deleverage, which accounted for more than half of our drop in margin compared to 2015. There was also an impact of nearly 600 basis points of what we would consider to be nonrecurring expenses, including an elevated promotional and marketing investment that totaled 660 basis points, which is over 500 basis points higher than last year.
Food cost was higher than Q4 of 2015 by 150 basis points and we expect that food costs will remain at about this level for the rest of the year. 
While it's difficult to provide meaningful projection for either sales comps or margins in the coming quarters, especially given the sales volatility I just described, I can tell you that the approximate margin level to expect at various sales levels. For example, with comps at the current average level, our average unit restaurant volumes are about $1.9 million on an annual basis and our restaurant level margins should improve to the low double digits in the next few quarters as the nonrecurring costs begin to level off. If comps are around negative 20%, AUVs would be about $2 million and margins would be around the mid-to-high teens. If comps recovered around negative 10%, AUVs would be about $2.2 million and our margins should be in the low 20s. And if we fully recover our sales with AUVs in the $2.4 million to $2.5 million range, we would expect margins in the mid-20% range, which accounts for the recurring costs of new procedures and protocols that relate to food safety. 
Labor costs for the quarter were 30.9% of sales, or an increase of 850 basis points compared to last year. More than 600 basis points of the change was triggered by sales deleverage. While we also had nearly 100 basis points tied to nonrecurring expenses, as we incurred additional labor in early February, March to support our promotional strategy and also our national team meeting on February 8 when about 50,000 employees attended. 
We also continue to incur higher labor costs related to our merit increases taken in mid-2015 for restaurant crew and managers, which averaged about 7%, along with increased benefits including increased vacation days, paid sick leave and tuition reimbursement, all of which added about 160 basis points to labor. 
Our promotional and marketing expenses during the quarter totaled $55 million or about 6.6% of sales and this included $4 million or about 50 basis points related to promo offers that were issued in the first quarter, but they're expected to be redeemed in the second quarter. We'll continue to invest in recovering our customers, and promos will be an important part of the strategy, but we expect combined marketing and promos to level off to about 3% to 4% as a percentage of sales over the next few quarters. While this is lower than Q1, it's nearly double what we spent as a percent of sales in Q2 and Q3 of last year. 
We'll invest in more traditional brand advertising and return to talking about our delicious food made from high-quality ingredients. G&A for the first quarter was $62 million or 7.4% of sales down, $1 million from last year. Total stock-based comp included in G&A was $7.5 million, which is down about $7.6 million from last year. Offsetting that reduction were higher legal costs and the cost of the all-company meeting, which combined added $4 million to G&A. For the full year 2016, we anticipate total stock-based compensation and G&A to be about $60 million. And for the full year 2016, G&A will total just over $300 million or about $50 million higher than the last year as we have support for our new restaurant opening and as we will hold our biennial all-manager conference in September. 
Our effective tax rate benefit for the quarter was 40.6% and was impacted by nonrecurring adjustments related to state income taxes for prior year. Our effective tax for the full year is expected to be 38.4%. During the first quarter, we reported a loss of $26.4 million or diluted loss per share of $0.88. Our cash and investments totaled $706 million as of March 31, and we continue to be very aggressive with our balance sheet to repurchase stock. We've repurchased a total of $645 million from January 1 through yesterday at an average price of $463 per share. Since November 1, 2015, we've repurchased a total of $956 million of our stock, representing a reduction of nearly 2 million shares outstanding and we have $71.4 million left in our current authorization to purchase stock. As we work through this sales recovery, we will remain disciplined in restoring our unit economics to deliver attractive margins and returns and restore our ability to create significant shareholder value over the long term. Thank you for your time today and would be happy to open the lines for any questions you may have."

This so that's really good news. On the customers who are lapsed, we look at people who haven't been in 3 months or more, and that was -- you want a lower number there, that was 49% before, and now that's at 57%. So that one's probably got -- that's the biggest delta there. But for example, on another attribute, which is we serve healthy, fresh unprocessed food, that's recovered to exactly the same levels as it was before. So it's a mixed bag. I don't know that any of them are problematic such that I don't think we're going to be able to recover them. Because we're seeing just nice trends all across the board on those. In terms of your question about frequency, we break our customers into 5 groups by frequency. We call our most frequent customers, top loyal they come 25 times and more a year. The next group are heavy customers. They come 13 to 24 times, then medium, which is 6 to 12, light is to 2 to 5 and our new or lapsed customers is 1 time. And you're correct in that we saw larger declines in both new in the 2 -- the top and bottom categories. So these are single-digit drops, but in new and lapsed and in top loyal. And so a lot of what we're looking at from a marketing perspective is bringing in those top loyal of that single digit drop in top loyal customers that we saw. And I'm not suggesting that these customers left altogether, but their frequency may have declined. So some of what I mentioned in my prepared remarks are aimed at either giving them a reason to come back in and that might be a new menu item or some sort of a frequency incentive, which I also mentioned, which would be coming in a certain number of times over a period of time and it'll give you something. So those are both efforts designed to target that group of customers."

So that's part of it, but as I mentioned also in my prepared comments, we're getting back into the type of advertising or marketing that has been so successful for us in the past, which is some of this brand marketing, which is based on short films and other types of content, which really deliver messages about the brand and continue to differentiate Chipotle from the competition. One of the really good pieces of news in our research is that the differentiation of Chipotle from our competitors really has not suffered or is the extend that it did, it recovered fully. And so we're going to continue to push the messages about our 65 ingredients and how simple they are and our simple classic cooking techniques and how different that is from the competition whose food is -- tends to be heavily processed and include hundreds and hundreds of ingredients, many of which are processed. So we're definitely getting back on that in July is when we'll really be in full swing with that type of marketing again. So we're transitioning back, but as I say that, there's going to be always a promotional element with those until we really fully recover our sales."

The item that we're considering -- introducing first is chorizo, which is something we've done before, we did it in Kansas City last year and we were prepared to expand that to a second market right as we came into this foodborne illness situation and we tabled it so that we could put all of our focus on correcting a problem. But we did find that, that was very, very popular with our loyal customers. In fact, for a lot of people we tried it, it quickly became their most favorite protein. And so it'll be very helpful for us from a marketing perspective to bring those customers back in and make our loyal customers come more often. So I think it's yet to be seen whether that means it'll become a permanent, but we'll try it out and see how it goes.

We cook this on our Plancha. It has a lots of little crispy bits. So it has nice spice and really good texture and as Mark said, very, very popular with the customers that had it in a couple of our test markets. When we think about adding something to Chipotle, we're very, very mindful of our overall efficiencies, efficiencies in the kitchen, efficiencies in cook time, efficiencies in throughput and ease of ordering for the customer. Chorizo fits into this system really, really well in that we have space for it on the main line and it doesn't detract from throughput. It sets -- it's also very easy to rotate onto the Plancha to grill between chicken and steak. The cook time and the method of grilling isn't much different from the chicken and steak already on the Plancha. So operationally, I would say it's quite easy to execute, but I think it's very exciting in that it does add a new flavor and texture to the meat offerings. And it pairs well with our existing offerings, our salsas and guacamole and cheese and what have you. So again, very popular and I'm excited to see how this works."

I wouldn't say all of them have been met with immediate approval. An example of that is we went over to a lettuce that was pre-shredded at a central kitchen in order to be able to be absolutely certain of that all the interventions were in place to make sure that, that was food safe, and that lettuce, I think people found to be a degradation in quality of the stuff that was cut in the restaurants by our teams who -- when our restaurant teams do it, they're able to cut it to the exact size they want. And so they're able to really make sure that the presentation is exactly what they want and that they can assure the quality of the lettuce. This was a product which was really just completely prepared in the central kitchen. So what we've been able to do and what we will be rolling out soon, we have been able to find a way to have this made completely safe by interventions in a central kitchen, but yet still have the entire head of lettuce brought to the restaurant and yet, and give our crews in the restaurant that the latitude to be able to cut that properly and assure the quality of that again. So we've just been tasting that the last few days in a few of our restaurants here in Denver and it's delicious. It's wonderful. And so we're going to be moving back to a lettuce that I think everyone else is very satisfied with. The rest of the changes have been met very positively. The sous vide of the steak is delicious. We've actually had a reduction in the number of customer complaints. With steak, there's always been, over time, some complaints because steak contains naturally some chewy bits and whatnot because we use real steak. And with the sous vide, it's -- the technique has allowed us to break down some of those aspects of the steak through a kind about long breathing process and the sous vide process, which makes the steak juicier and more tender and more delicious. So actually, we're very, very pleased with how that's going and our customers seemed to be very pleased as well. The blanching of the ingredients has had essentially has had no effect whatsoever on the eating quality of ingredients, but it's a wonderful step to ensure again food safety and the elimination of potential harmful pathogens or what have you. So our crews in the restaurants have done awesome job implementing that, that new procedure and they found it quite easy and they're very proud of it because it makes them -- it gives them even higher level of confidence in the food we're serving. And again, no degradation whatsoever in what our customers are receiving. So we are feeling really, really good about the quality of our food in our restaurants. I think it is actually better than ever. I think subject to that one change in lettuce, we thought that the bell peppers we were bringing in pre-sliced from the central kitchen were good, but maybe not quite as good as the ones cut in our restaurants. So what we've been able to do is go back to blanching, now the bell peppers such that they can be cut by a knife, by the skilled hands of our folks in the restaurant. And again, brought that back to the level of quality it was before, but again, with the blanching to ensure food safety of that ingredient. So we're very proud of everything we've done. We think that the intent focus on our food that's been caused by looking at every single ingredient. It's caused our teams in the restaurant to also look at every single ingredient, very, very critically and make certain that everything is as good as it can be. So I think our food is more delicious than ever with that one sort of asterisk that the lettuce was, I think not as good for a time, but we're returning that to where it was, and I think that we're very, very proud of where our food stands now."

I think that the short answer is no. We're not preparing for a slowdown of our development and I think you'll find that we will be able to achieve very easily the guidance that we've given in terms of the number of our restaurant openings. But we do have a very strong pipeline coming in from our real estate teams who have been doing an excellent job, finding a lot of terrific sites. But the reason for my comments was that as we've had a slowdown of sales overall, that you're all aware of, in the numbers that Jack spoke about with the slowdown of nationwide sales as a result of the -- of what happened in late 2015, so too has that slowdown affected our new store openings. But it's not -- it's affected them disproportionately. And what I mean is that most of our new restaurant openings has still held the same percentage that they historically has held versus our trailing 12-month sales of our existing stores. But the exception is that in the new markets and developing markets, in those markets, there's been I think even more softening of their sales than there has been nationally, say. So the delta between a new store opening in the developing or new market has been slightly greater than when you compare it to the rest of our restaurant average daily sales. So the delta of new and developing markets is a little bit bigger than the delta between proven and established markets. And so that percentage of all of our new store openings though is quite low, it's about 13% of our new store openings are in new markets or developing markets. And because those sales have been correspondingly a little more soft than the rest of openings, we're going to be taking just a much closer look at those and be more nitpicking as to which ones we do deals on. So it's going to be a very slight effect in terms of number of openings. And we have such a strong pipeline that we don't think it's going to affect the overall numbers that we've shared with you that we plan to open, but it's going to give us, I think the ability to be a little bit more discerning on a few of our locations and just make sure that anyone for which the development cost is perhaps a little bit high or the rent structure isn't quite advantageous, we might walk away from some of those deals that we might have pursued a year ago today, that's for example. Just to be responsible with our investments."

We wanted to signal that the event was over. We signaled that within a week or 2 after the CDC called their investigation over. And so we did that individually. Going forward, as Mark mentioned, we're going to be transitioning to more BOGOs, which have a lesser impact on our promo line. Offsetting that, we're actually going to spend more in advertising during the second and -- second quarter for sure, probably third quarter so. But overall, we expect that to be in the 3% to 4% range.

They improved by in that 3% to 4% range, but we're comparing to seasonal fails that in the past and last year kind of follow the pattern of increasing more like 6% to 7% range. So our dollars moved up just from March to April from late March, which is in that low- to mid- 20% range. Our dollars from that range moved up in April.

So with all that volatility, it's hard to predict, but I would not expect a loss in the second quarter.

When you look at labor, for example, labor is worth by, I think, 850 basis points. Of that 600 of that is deleveraged because of sales. And so the most important thing we can do is get our sales back. Another 100 basis points is due to the very heavy promo that we did in the first quarter. So we had a lot of people visiting, a lot of people dining at Chipotle, but they didn't pay for all or part of their meal, yet we had to staff the restaurant. So there's about 100 basis points of that. And then there's another, I think, it's another 150 to 200 basis points or so of what I'll call inflation. It's stuff that we did last year. We had merit increases for our managers and crew. We rolled out or introduced a education program, college education, or education but usually college education. We started to pay for sick pay, and then we enhanced our vacation pay. So those are all inflationary things that were in that kind of 150 to 200 basis points range. So those are the big pieces. Underneath all that, is there some inefficiencies? Sure, but maybe that's 100 basis points or so. We don't want to go out and squeeze labor right now and drive those efficiencies at a time when what's most important is for us to have a fully staffed team, to have the 4 pillars in place, have a team that feels ready to greet customers when they come in and hopefully at an accelerated rate. And so I wouldn't want to go after 100 basis points at labor line when what's most important is to have a great experience, and let's encouraging the sales probably [ph] to happen."

During th",1592,"Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everybody. Our sales recovery that began midway through the first quarter continued at a modest pace in the second quarter, and we saw a return to profitability along with the opening of 58 new restaurants. 
During the second quarter, we generated total revenue of $998 million. Our sales comp improved by 6% from [ph] the first quarter to a negative 23.6% for the quarter. As a result of promotional activities, we have seen slightly better improvements in comparable traffic with customer traffic down 20% for the quarter. What we would like to see a sales recovery occurring more quickly optimistic that our Chiptopia summer rewards program, which launched on July 1, will encourage more guests to visit our restaurants, and this will help lead to a sustained to higher sales recovery. Though the program is just a few weeks old, we're already seeing approximately 30% of all transactions participating in Chiptopia. We have seen further improvement in both comparable restaurant sales and transactions with comp sales down about 21% in July and traffic improving so that it is now down to a negative mid-teens for July so far. 
Diluted earnings per share was $0.87 for the quarter, down from $4.45 earned in the second quarter of last year. While our unit economic model has been significantly affected by the sales hit, it continues to fully fund our current level of new restaurant growth. 
Last week, Chipotle celebrated its 23rd anniversary. Throughout our history, we've been working hard to change the way people think about and eat fast food. And as we have grown into a national brand, we have cultivated and been supported by a very loyal customer base. As customers have fallen in love with Chipotle also plays an extraordinary level of trust in us and have come to know that we will do the right thing when it comes to our food, our employees and our approach to running our business. Through the fruit safety events last year, we lost some of that trust. Our customers have come to expect a lot from us to prepare, cook and serve fresh, delicious food while pushing the envelope to encourage farming and ranching practices that respect animals and the environment and the people who raise the ingredients we used. We're committed to exceeding our customers' expectations and restoring their confidence that we will deliver up on our promises.
While there are no quick solutions to restoring trust and bringing our sales back to previous levels, we're focused on a number of activities, which will continue to emphasize driving traffic in the near term and increasing customer frequency. We will also focus on longer-term brand messaging and on advancing our Food with Integrity efforts, which have been key to building trust and loyalty with customers over the years. But the best thing that we can do in the near term is to encourage customers to come back to our restaurants and to ensure that our restaurant teams are delivering an extraordinary dining experience on each and every customer visit.
In the first half of the year, we've invested more heavily than ever in marketing and promotional activity, and those investments are beginning to pay off. Since the CDC's investigation in Chipotle concluded in February, we have done a number of things. First, we launched our largest ever mobile offer into our largest ever direct mail program. Second, we introduced a new menu item, chorizo, and we expect to have it in all of our restaurants by the end of the year. Third, we created our first ever customer rewards program, Chiptopia. And fourth, we launched a new animated short film in an effort to help customers appreciate what is unique about Chipotle. Collectively, these efforts along with excellent operations are bringing customers back into our restaurants, and our teams are working hard to provide an extraordinary experience in all of our restaurants every day. 
The introduction of a new menu items such as chorizo is unusual for us. As you know, we have always maintained a very focused menu and rarely change it. Instead, we focus on doing just a few things in the restaurant, so that we can do them better than anybody else, but we have never ruled out the additions to our changes in the menu, and chorizo is one of the few changes that we have made to the menu for 23 years. Our chorizo is made with a blend of Responsibly Raised pork and chicken seasoned with paprika, toasted cumin and Chipotle peppers. We chorizo in the restaurant to give it a perfect and we believe it's a great addition to our menu. It gives customers another option and one that has been well received, accounting for approximately 6% to 7% of entrée sales in the restaurants where it's available. 
During the quarter, we also resumed serving locally grown produce in all of our restaurants. Typically, our local program for produce runs this summer and early ball months during the time that makes up the local growing season for much of the country. As we look to establish Chipotle as a leader in food safety, it's also important to us that we remain true to our commitment to serving Food with Integrity, including locally grown produce. Through a partnership with private labs funded by Chipotle, we are working with local growers to make certain that they can achieve our high standards for food safety, and we're auditing farms that we work with to be sure that they are compliant with all of our rigorous safety standards. Initially, as we layer in new local produce suppliers that has met our new food safety standards our local produce program will have fewer farm partners than it did in the past year. But as we scale the program in the coming years, we'll have more local forms participated in the program than ever before. 
We're also working hard to achieve our goals of eliminating the very large artificial additives for our tortillas. Tortillas are the only food item on Chipotle's menu to contain any additives, which include a minimal number of preservatives and dope initiatives. While we have made significant strides in reducing the number of additives in our tortillas today, the goal is to achieve a simple recipe with only a few ingredients, much like tortillas made in the more traditional way that includes wheat flour, vegetable oil, water, salt and starter for the flour tortillas. 
Finally, I'd like to address recent headlines around but Mark Crumpacker, our Chief Creative and Development Officer. We were surprised to learn his personal issues and placed Mark on a leave of absence. We believe this will allow us to remain focused on our work and our efforts to serve great tasting food, to provide an extraordinary restaurant experience and to continue winning back our customers. 
One of the cornerstones of our people culture is to build top-performing teams. Mark certainly had accomplished that in our development and marketing teams, and we have the upmost confidence in those teams and the people who lead them, and we know they will do an excellent job running those departments. In Mark's absence, we have asked Mark our Director of Brand Marketing to lead our marketing team and Caroline Anderson, Executive Director of Facilities, Construction and Design, to lead our development efforts. And we have asked Kurt who joined us as CIO late last year to lead our e-commerce team. Mark joined our marketing team in 2013, but his experience with Chipotle goes back further than that. Mark led our team at CAA marketing from 2009 to 2011 working on some of the first innovative branded content programs, including the animated short, Back to the Start, and also worked on the development of our cultivate food music and ideas festivals. In his role as brand director of marketing, Mark already has been overseeing several critical marketing functions, including all brand planning, content programs, digital, which includes web, mobile and social and promotions and events. Carolyn Anderson began working with Chipotle 20 years ago as an outside vendor in charge of facilities management. She joined us as national facilities manager in 2005 and was promoted to facilities director in 2008, which she was able to streamline our reinvest efforts to create programs to empower our restaurant managers to be better stewards of the restaurants, leading to substantially lower maintenance and repair costs. Carolyn's leadership and the exceptional work she and her team were doing led to her promotion to director of facilities and construction in 2012 and again in 2014 to a promotion to executive director of facilities, construction and design. She is proven in building top-performing teams that have paved the way to redefine developments roles and responsibilities, and she has been critical to developing and executing our strategy surrounding sustainability food safety and increasing our cash on cash returns for new restaurants. 
Curt Garner has been involved with our e-commerce team since he came on board last November and has been extremely valuable as a member of the management team over just the past 9 months. Kurt oversees all of our information technology infrastructure and its impact on future sales channels shifting our entire pipeline out of sales projects Kurt's guidance has been very natural fit. We are confident in the current strategic direction of these teams and have full faith and confidence in Mark, Carolyn and Kurt's abilities to deliver results.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

As to bring the customer back to our restaurants and to reinforce fully as an industry leader in food safety, it's never been more important to have top-performing teams in our restaurants and among our field leadership. It's the strength of our people culture and our teams that has allowed us to quickly implement many new programs in food safety as well as marketing. To be sure that our restaurant teams are aligned around our current priorities and that their efforts are directed at the right things, we have realigned some of the success measures for us top management teams and tying incentives increasingly for our most urgent priorities of having an exceptional guest experience as well as effective local store marketing. We've also changed the prerequisites to becoming a Restaurateur, placing greater emphasis on measuring the guest experience, business fundamentals and food safety compliance. Historically, these measures have always been important, but we are emphasizing them even more in providing additional tools and training to be sure our restaurants are exceptional in achieving these high standards. We've also changed how to calculate manager bonuses to award excellence in these metrics with the greatest emphasis on food safety.
This renewed focus on excellent guest experience, local store marketing, food safety and business fundamentals will be the main restaurant managers are eligible to be interviewed for Restaurateur. Once they meet these green fees as we called them, they're interviewed as before to the team at all top performers empowered to achieve high standards. Historically, these fundamentals Restaurateur our audits for them become more specific and rigorous and expectations for the achievement more stringent. The added focus we applied to that part of the process is already paying off in terms of generating sound business fundamentals and the restaurant and the improved food safety audits that we're seeing. 
During the quarter, we made significant progress including the implementation of an industry-leading traceability system, which will be fully implemented in all of our restaurants by the end of this month. Already, the traceability program has been rolled out in more than 1900 restaurants. This has been a significant undertaking to put in place, and we're very pleased to be so close to completion of this industry-leading food safety enhancement. 
Prior to this year, we had traceability in place within our suppliers and our distribution centers. And from the distribution centers, we can trace increase to our restaurants using ordering an distributional data. But the significance of this traceability system is that we will have the ability to know exactly which supplier we got any particular food item from as well as the lot number of all produce, meats, beans and tortillas we receive in the restaurant. The system uses barcodes on every package to allow to be traced from the supply of the restaurant the same way overnight delivery services trace packet shipments all over the world. The system is another significant way to Chipotle is becoming an industry-leading food safety because it gives us the ability to quickly investigate food quality and our supply chain or embedded in your move food from our supply chain that we may find not up to our high standards. This September, we will host our biannual All Managers' Conference. This year's conference will include restaurant managers, field leaders, operations leadership and select individuals from support departments. The content for this year's conference will be focused on helping our restaurant teams to create excellent guest experience and teach them to more effectively market to individual restaurants. This conference is an excellent form to reinvigorate our restaurant teams and totally focus on the things that most powerfully allow Chipotle to achieve its goals. On the development front, our opening continues to be on pace with our guidance for 2016. We have opened 116 restaurants so far this year, which is about half of our total planned openings of 220 to 235 [ph] We are pleased to have a strong pipeline of real estate locations under consideration. But as I explained last quarter, we will continue to be judicious in evaluating those locations in light of the current operating environment and with an eye towards delivering strong returns. We refocused our real estate team in assessing future with more conservative lens based on current economic model, particularly given recent changes to our average unit volumes. We've also temporarily shifted some of our markets into our developing markets category in order to direct our new store investments towards markets with the strongest track record of opening sales. This may slightly temper the number of openings in these markets in the near term as we look to rebuild our sales momentum and strong new store productivity.
The impact from this is primarily on where we open these stores with a minimal impact on the total opening. Because the real estate pipeline is inherently long term in nature, some of our efforts to reprioritize our market mix will not be realized until late in 2017.  Of course, we will update you in the coming months as to how many restaurants we do expect to open in 2017 [ph]. 
We're also working to strengthen the returns in our new restaurants by optimizing our average investment cost. This year, we are realized cost savings through a collaborative effort between our design and procurement function. In addition, our real estate team is been able to find an increasing number of great sites with strong rendered provide landlords to invest more in our buildup costs. The benefit of these efforts translate to an average investment cost that is shaping up to be around $800,000 for 2016 in spite of increased market pressures on materials and labor. 
The strength of our teams continue to be our key advantage. Top-performing teams allow us to take on new tasks more rapidly than others might be able to integrate the great restaurant expenses that drive more traffic to our restaurants and delight our customers. We are confident that our teams will lead a recovery from this difficult time in our history such that we will emerge a stronger brand as a result of these challenging times and allow us to provide excellent value for shareholders as well as additional stakeholders benefit from our successful achievements over mission.
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

Throughout the quarter, we continue to heighten our marketing initiatives to drive sale and increase positive perceptions of our brand. The quantitative and qualitative research we've undertaken regarding purchasing habit, we have a better understanding of our customers, the motivation and visitation patterns than we ever have before. We continue to increase promotional efforts more than we generally would because we think it's critical to reestablish contact and frequency among our guests so that they can recall how much they enjoyed Chipotle. In the last few months, we executed an integrator approach, which included a number of different marketing activities, our largest ever mobile and direct mail promotion. We introduced chorizo as a new menu item and will have all of our restaurants before the end of the year. We developed and launched our first ever customer rewards program Chiptopia and will be spending the initial 3 month program to help us develop more lasting rewards program. We maintained a larger ongoing advertising presence than usual, and we launched a new animated short firm, A Love Story, to support Chiptopia, which are reminding and inspiring our fans and attracting new customers. It's already been viewed in totality more than 17 [ph] million times with support from PR, pay digital and social media buy along with placements in more than 10,000 movie screens. These marketing activities are an important part of our strategy job to help drive our sales recovery and see encouraging results in the consumer research. In the June survey, for example, consumer perceptions of Chipotle turned positive for the first time since November. While sentiment is not back to where it was prior to these issues, we chose movement in the right direction. This improving sentiment is also supported by our own ongoing brand health tracking study, which shows consistent upward trend since mid-January's all-time lows. During the second quarter, we saw a modest improvements and consideration and admiration across key customer segments. And with millennials 18 to 34, a key customer group for us, we continue to see that they have the most favorable opinion of Chipotle. During the first quarter, new customer acquisition was down from the previous quarter, but we saw improvement in this area in the second quarter and a trend in new customer acquisition, which we can directly attribute to our aggressive promotional offers. While we still have work to do to increase key brand metrics and traffic volumes with a very full slate of marketing programs planned throughout the remainder of the year that we believe will continue to support our recovery. The first phase of our recovery plan, which began in February, and which we are just coming out of focus on winning back customers. Based on the data we have we believe that the majority of our most loyal customers have returned, but many of them are not coming as frequently as they used to. The second phase of our recovery plan, which we are in the early stages of now continues our win back strategy that has a focus on increasing frequency and attracting new customers programs such as Chiptopia summer rewards and Love Story are aimed at helping us achieve these objectives. Just 3 weeks after launching the Chiptopia program, we have more than 3.6 million participants and are seeing approximately 30% of all transactions participating in Chiptopia. This is a significant start of the program, and we anticipate our participant levels to continue to increase over the coming weeks. Most importantly, we are seeing growth in the number of Chipotle at a run rate of more than 24 visits per year, our most frequent customer tier. These increased visits have helped the top line and have grown our traffic comp by about 5 points from June. It's still very early to draw conclusions on the long-term sustainability of these trends, but every incremental visit from a customer provides an opportunity for us to further restore trust. All of these programs are hoping to change the conversation about Chipotle. Q2 social sentiment is at 93% of the level it was precrisis, and the -- and the response our Love Story film has been extremely well received. 80% of consumer conversation is positive. Overall, our marketing awareness is at its highest since Q1 2015. 
Lastly, according to a survey by 8 metrics A Love Story is the highest scoring QSR ad they ever tested delivering strong results in breakthrough, which means high attention and likability relevant other measures as well as change, meaning viewers will feel strongly that the brand is moving in a new direction. The survey indicates that the film delivered strongly not only with our brand but also with customers and brand considerers. With the remainder of the year, our marketing programs will continue at a robust pace. Among the programs you can expect to see in the coming months are ongoing emphasis on advertising and digital content to highlight our commitment to using high-quality ingredients and preparing food -- and preparing food using classic cooking techniques just as we have always done without cutting corners and new content demonstrating how Chipotle has become a leader in food safety. Targeted promotions and inviting groups like students and national rollout of chorizo by the end of the year, our annual burrito Halloween promotion which will have a charitable component with our Cultivate Foundation, a holiday promotion and a gift card incentive program continued improvements through mobile and e-commerce program and continued emphasis on restaurant level marketing which allows our restaurant managers to delight customers on a very local and individual basis. We are encouraged by the progress we are making to improve sentiment about our brand and drive traffic to our restaurants. While we recognizes that there's a lot more work to be done to restore confidence, we believe that we have the right programs and the right teams in place to improve in these areas.

The sales comp in the second quarter showed modest improvement from the trends we reported in April when we reported that comps were running at a negative 26% range. We'd like to see the sales recovery happen more quickly, but we are as committed as ever to do all we can to reengage with our customers, to restore their trust in Chipotle and reestablish customer frequency. The first half of 2016 has been focused on establishing and executing industry-leading food safety practices along with aggressive offers to invite our customers to return to Chipotle. As we begin the second half of 2016, we are optimistic about engaging our customers at a deeper level, going beyond basic broad-based free food offers with things like Chiptopia with branding efforts uniquely Chipotle such as the Love Story video. Rolling out chorizo and continuing to show leadership food quality by removing a few remain artificial ingredients from our food. Though it's very early, we're optimistic about customer engagement with Chiptopia so far. Over 3.6 million [indiscernible] have been issued and as Steve mentioned, nearly 30% of all transactions are engaged in Chiptopia. Sales comps of the past 2 [ph] weeks have improved to down 20% to 21% in that range. But importantly transactions, have improved from down 20% in June to down 15% during the first half of July, an improvement of 500 basis points. 
Our main objective with Chiptopia is to award and incentivize our loyal customers with decreased frequency last year and to restart or visit frequency back to their previous levels. Our research has shown that most of our oil customers have returned to Chipotle but not at the same frequency. So Chiptopia is targeted to those customers, and the early frequency results are very encouraging. In fact, since Chiptopia began July 1, we've seen a 90% increase in the number of customers who visit 2.5x or more each week compared to June. We've seen a 200% increase by the number of customers coming in from 2x to 2.5x per week compared to June. And we've seen a 140% increase in number of customers who visit between 1 and 2x each week compared to June's. So off to a great start with Chiptopia so far. We'll continue to engage and encourage our customers to visit often during the entire 3-month program while the restaurant teams delight them with that delicious food and great service to the great shot and maintaining improving this reestablish higher frequency levels. The average check has declined slightly during July by merely 3% versus June as many customers have already redeemed their free chips and guac for registering in Chiptopia or they redeemed free burritos for early frequency some customers are spending a little less. There's only a $6 minimum purchase price in Chiptopia, and we're also seeing a slightly smaller group size. One important note on the accounting for Chiptopia, although the program is intended to last for 3 months, ending September 30, there will be reward available to be redeemed in the fourth quarter or beyond. Therefore, at the end of the third quarter, GAAP accounting requires that we defer a portion of the revenue from the third quarter into the fourth quarter or later when rewards are ultimately redeemed or the awards expire. It's not possible to project what that deferral might look like right now, but we'll fully expand the impact during our third quarter earnings call. Our entire company is eager to see the sales recover even faster in all restaurants and our markets throughout the country. Many of you on the call today probably feel the same way. While we certainly like to be further along, there are signs that the recovery is one of its way and continues to march along. The company-wide July sales comp is down approximately 20% along with the July TC comp   of down about 15% has come a long way from the low point in January when sales were down 36% [ph] and TCs were down 34%. July so far represents a recovery versus the low point in January of 42% of all sales, meaning that we recovered 42% of the lost sales in January, and we recovered 53% [ph] of the transaction that we lost in January. But most of our markets across country are further along than this in their recovery. For example, in Middle America, the mid-Atlantic, the southeast and the southwest which combined accounts for nearly 2/3 of our comp restaurants. The comp sales are down about 18%, and the comp TCs are down 13% in July. This represent a recovery rate versus January of 46% on sales and nearly 60% of Our best market in the country is in Ohio where comp sales are down just 12% and TCs are down just 6% in July. We're still a way to go but we're making progress.
Unfortunately, the recovery is not far along the Northeast and on the West Coast where comp sales are still down around 26%, and comp TCs are down around 21% in July.  Of course, these are the areas closest to the events of last year, and so the recovery is just not as far along as it does in the rest of the country. In fact, sales recovery for the Northeast and the West Coast combined is only 35% and TC recovery is about 45% compared to July for the January lows.
We returned to profitability in the quarter with EPS at [ph] $0.87 per share. Of course, fully restoring earnings power is highly dependent on the pace and the magnitude of our sales recovery, which remains a top priority for us. 
Running through the P&L for the quarter, we recorded $998 million in sales, a decrease of 17% versus the second quarter 2015. We generated restaurant level operating margin of 15.5% in the quarter, which is down from the second quarter of 2015 but up sequentially on the first quarter of 2016. During the second quarter, sales deleverage contributed about 800 basis points of pressure compared with Q2 of 2015.
[indiscernible] 34.2% [ph] in the quarter, up 110 basis points from the prior year. Underlying inflation was minimal during the quarter as increased supply our cost for a new preparation of tomatoes, lettuce and steak, along with food waste, more than offset last year's small increased menu prices and lower stock pricing for paper and beef. Food waste added about 70 basis points as we're still inefficient with some of the new procedures, we're still navigating through ordering and prepping the right amount of food at the right time, especially surrounding promotions. Looking at the rest of this year, we anticipate food costs will remain at right about the same level as inefficiencies we achieved likely to be offset by higher avocado pricing in Q3.
Labor during the quarter were 27.7% of sales compared to 22.6% during the second quarter of 2015. Nearly all of this drop of [ph] about 450 basis points is due to sales deleverage. The remaining increase is due to labor inflation offset by better labor scheduling this year versus Q2 of last year. In Q2 last year, we had a system recording issue, which led to elevated labor scheduling. Our underlying labor inflation is running at about 6%, while hourly wage inflation is closer to 9%. 
[indiscernible] costs were 7.2% [ph] of sales, higher as a percent of sales by 180 basis points, all of it related to sales deleverage. Other operating costs were 15.2%, up from 10.9% during the second quarter of 2015, driven by deleverage and higher marketing and promo activity. Marketing cost during the quarter were 2.7% of sales, and promo activity added 1.6% of sales for a total of 4.3% combined compared to 2.3% last year. Our investment in marketing and promo will remain at elevated levels as we continue to aggressively engage with our customers to regain their trust and loyalty. 
G&A expenses were $70.8 million in the quarter, which is virtually identical to last year's expenses of $70.2 million. A few months ago, we made a decision to temporarily hold off on hiring any new G&A headcount in an effort to manage our support cost during these challenging times. Instead, we narrowed the focus of all of our support teams to only those efforts which will lead to safer food, a better restaurant experience for our guests or increased sales. Our teams stepped up to the challenge, and I support a greater number of restaurants without adding resources and are focusing the vast majority of their efforts on those 3 things: food safety, the guest experience and sales building. Of course, we continue to hire at the restaurant level to support new restaurants and every restaurant is fully staffed and ready to delight our customers when they visit. As a percentage of sales, G&A expenses increased 120 [ph] basis points to 7.1% of sales, entirely to sales deleverage. Underlying G&A for the next 2 quarters will remain at about this level, but the third quarter will include incremental cost management conference, which is expected to be around $10 million. Our pretax income was $41.7 million, and our tax rate during the quarter was 38.6%. For the full year 2016, we also estimate our effective tax rate will be about 38.6% compared to 38.2% in 2015. So a higher tax rate as a result of higher state taxes. 
During the second quarter until yesterday, we repurchased 170 million of CMG shares at an average price of $438. We generated cash from operations of $118 million during the quarter, and we continue to maintain more than $600 million in cash and investments. As we work to restore our customer trust and restore our earnings capability, we still have the ability to fund our growth and buy back our stock optimistically. As of today, we have $123 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. These are challenging times, the most challenging we've ever faced. Our company is committed to restoring customer trust recover in customer visits and restoring our economic model to its full potential, which we believe will position us to add significant shareholder value for a very long time. Thank you for your time today, and we'll be happy to open the lines for the questions you might have."

Since then, we've seen a very regular engagement. We've seen a very regular ramp-up of people that participate in the program. We have significant -- every single day, we have over 100,000 people that are added to the program. The majority of them are registered in the program, and we've seen significant repeat visits. We've seen like 28% of the people enrolled, they're engaged in Chiptopia have come back a second time. So we're seeing exactly the results we had hoped that our already are loyal customer who have reduced their visits are coming in more often. We are hopeful that we'll happen as get into the end of this month and by the way, there's an incentive for people to come back more often as the months close because each month earning the big end of month program awards and so achieving a level in July as a starting point that it starts over basically now you achieve that same level in August in September. So it's very, very early and so we're optimistic that we got a 500 basis point impact and effectively less than 3 weeks. In terms of what's going forward after this, we're going to watch this very closely. We're going to learn from it. We're going to find what works, what doesn't work for our customers and for our teams and the restaurants, and we anticipate you will have another program, we just don't know yet whether it will be another temporary program or will it be a kind of permanent program but it's very, very likely that we'll have something to follow on when Chiptopia ends at the end of September."

The first question was about the comparison. The comparison is not easier in July. In fact, if anything, the comparison is tougher in July, so we feel good about the 500 basis points of improvement so far. In terms of the average check, it's only down less than 3% in July. We had a gap even before July started Joe and that was -- a lot of that was due to lower group side. It's also due to the fact we had lot the promos throughout the few months as we tried turn customers back. With the less than 3% that we're seeing in July so far, right about 1/2 of that is due to the redemption of rewards. It was part of the program. We were prepared to offer compelling incentives to get people signed up so we get come in, get a card you get free chips and guac. A lot of those have been redeemed already. The fact that there's a lot of redemption of burritos already means that our customers are marching through the levels. They're already earning status. A bunch of them have earned mediums and believe it or not, within the first 12 or 13 days, we have thousands of people that had earned the status, which means they came 11 times already, and you can't come more than twice in a day, so you have to come basically 11 days, and people have already been part of the program within the first 12 or 13 days that we're open. So the redemption of rewards, we totally expected. The other thing we did on purpose, we had a pretty low threshold where if you came in and spent $6, which basically means come in and get a burrito, you'll be part of the program. Again, our objective was to get as many visits as possible. The idea there being once we get in the restaurants a terrific experience we have a shot at keeping them. So we didn't want to set the high threshold, and so that has contributed to folks participating without all the add-ons, without the drinks and things like that. So the average check, we are ready for that, and we think gaining the customer visit is most important and we'll work on the average check later. And then in terms of technology, I don't know if Kurt is on the phone, I think the question, Joe was have we learned something about technology and do we have to make significant investments in technology going forward with our customers."

So during the time of the incident last fall, we didn't know the cause, and so we looked at every single ingredient that we were bringing to our restaurants. And working with a number of food safety experts try to understand what the risk of those items were, the individual items coming in. I'll just give you an example that I think illustrates sort of how things happen. So take bell peppers, for instance. So one of our experts said that it would be helpful if we could test the bell peppers before you bring them into the restaurant. The way to test them though is to slice them up in a kitchen and then wash them, test them and then package them. That turned out to degrade the flavor. It does not taste as good as when our crews would expertly chop using our cutting board and knife right in there in front of the customer and then sauté. But in order to make sure that we had the highest food safety, we went right to the central kitchen, and we did it for the couple of other items also. And I fear that we probably did negatively impact the flavor, and I think maybe some customers notice that also. We have reversed that though with bell peppers and other items because we have developed with our in-house food safety expert, Jim Marston, a number of interventions that we put in place from the farm all the way through the distribution system and into the restaurants. And so with peppers for instance, we now have our crews blanch the peppers in boiling water, which would completely eliminate any passage that might be on the surface. blanching doesn't actually cook the pepper because it's for such a short time but it's plenty of time to kill any passage that may be on the surface. Our crew then goes with the old process the knife and a cutting board chopping right in front of the customer and sautéing as usual. We did the same thing would lettuce. We put a number of interventions in place so we brought chopping lettuce back into the restaurant. And so we've returned, I think, our food to taste levels that where we were before the crisis. But going beyond that, we're going beyond that in the elimination of preservative and conditioners in our tortillas. If you look at the ingredient that Chipotle overall, it's a really, really clean ingredient list. And what do I mean by that? It doesn't have the current things that are very hard to pronounce of preservatives and fillers and artificial flavors and artificial colors, all these kinds of things. And so once our -- in the fall, our tortillas are rid of the preservatives, we will be in an extraordinary position to tell people, our customers, about our very, very clean ingredient label and be proud to display them. I think that that's not something typical fast food could do. So again, we're not only bringing the great taste that we have precrisis, but we're continuing to push Food with Integrity in ways that are going to set industry standards."

There's about 350 basis points or so in 25 [ph] 350 basis points of what I would call nonrecurring expenses. 200 of that is in our marketing and promo. We're intentionally overspending on that line item, and it's way above historical norms. There's another probably 125, 150 basis points or so of inefficiencies. We're wasting a lot of food. We're not very efficient with labor, and part of it is because we're taking on a lot of new procedures, and that's been inefficient. We're being inefficient in terms of dealing with promotions, and we're tending to overstaff rather than understaff, so that's in that 3 in the quarter of 350 basis points. In food cost, I believe that was probably in the 31% range or so, maybe even below that. There was a time when our food cost was in the 30% range. And so without the details in front of me, I'm guessing that was probably 300 basis points or so difference than food cost, and what's happened there to just haven't raised prices very much over the year. Our model a year ago could handle a 34% food cost. With the deleveraging effects and all inefficiencies, a 34% food cost is a lot more painful today. We also have labor inflation that has since then, and I'm guessing that's at least about 200 to 300 basis points the labor inflation been significant. We have intended to pass on the wage rates that we were seeing because of local pressures because of raised in minimum wage some of them very significant in $10, $12, $13, and we had it really passed on the cost of those higher wages. Probably a couple hundred basis points there. We do have recurring food safety cost that you heard me talk about. We talked about that being in the maybe 200 basis point range. I think it's going to better than that. I would say that's probably going to end up in the 100 to 150 basis points. Right now, we've got about 150 in there, and so that's the only thing that's really what I said is an absolute permanent. So if you add all these things up, together, you're probably in that 1,000, 1,100 basis points or so. So those are the items. We're very aware of the items. We believe the most important thing we can do, we lost [ph] 800 basis points because of deleverage, that's why most of our focus this year, of course, food safety first. Now secondly is to recover our customers. We're doing that through offers, through Chiptopia, through branding. And then our focus, as Monty mentioned, is making sure that our customers have a wonderful expense when they come back with us when they get our sales back, we get 800 basis points of margin. These other items though, we think we can chip away these other items as well but we don't want to go after them aggressively until we've recovered as many or all of our customers. And once we've done that, then we know that we can make a lot of progress on these other margin items as well."

Our sales recovery that began midway through the first quarter continued at a modest pace in the second quarter, and we saw a return to profitability along with the opening of 58 new restaurants.During the",1607,"Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everybody. Our sales recovery that began midway through the first quarter continued at a modest pace in the second quarter, and we saw a return to profitability along with the opening of 58 new restaurants.
During the second quarter, we generated total revenue of $998 million. Our sales comp improved by 6% from the first quarter to a negative 23.6% for the quarter. As a result of promotional activities, we are seeing slightly better improvements in comparable traffic with customer traffic down 20% for the quarter. While we would like to see a sales recovery occurring more quickly, we're optimistic that our Chiptopia Summer Rewards program, which launched on July 1, will encourage more guests to visit our restaurants and that this will help lead to a sustained to higher sales recovery.
Though the program is just a few weeks old, we're already seeing approximately 30% of all transactions participating in Chiptopia. We have seen further improvement in both comparable restaurant sales and transactions with comp sales down about 21% in July and traffic improving so that it is now down to a negative mid-teens for July so far.
Diluted earnings per share was $0.87 for the quarter, down from $4.45 earned in the second quarter of last year. While our unit economic model has been significantly affected by the sales hit, it continues to fully fund our current level of new restaurant growth.
Last week, Chipotle celebrated its 23rd anniversary. Throughout our history, we've been working hard to change the way people think about and eat fast food. And as we have grown into a national brand, we have cultivated and been supported by a very loyal customer base. As customers have fallen in love with Chipotle, they have also placed an extraordinary level of trust in us and have come to know that we will do the right thing when it comes to our food, our employees and our approach to running our business. Through the food safety events we faced last year, we lost some of that trust. Our customers have come to expect a lot from us to prepare, cook and serve fresh, delicious food while pushing the envelope to encourage farming and ranching practices that respect animals and the environment and the people who raise the ingredients we use. We're committed to exceeding our customers' expectations and restoring their confidence that we will deliver upon our promises.
While there are no quick solutions to restoring trust and bringing our sales back to previous levels, we're focused on a number of activities, which will continue to emphasize driving traffic in the near term and increasing customer frequency. We will also focus on longer-term brand messaging and on advancing our Food with Integrity efforts, which have been key to building trust and loyalty with customers over the years. But the best thing that we can do in the near term is to encourage customers to come back into our restaurants and to ensure that our restaurant teams are delivering an extraordinary dining experience on each and every customer visit.
In the first half of the year, we have invested more heavily than ever in marketing and promotional activity, and those investments are beginning to pay off. Since the CDC's investigation in Chipotle concluded in February, we have done a number of things: First, we launched our largest ever mobile offer into our largest ever direct mail program; Second, we introduced a new menu item, chorizo, and we expect to have it in all of our restaurants by the end of the year; Third, we created our first ever customer rewards program, Chiptopia; and fourth, we launched a new animated short film in an effort to help customers appreciate what is unique about Chipotle. Collectively, these efforts along with excellent operations are bringing customers back into our restaurants, and our teams are working hard to provide an extraordinary experience in all of our restaurants every day.
The introduction of a new menu item such as chorizo is unusual for us. As you know, we have always maintained a very focused menu and rarely changed it. Instead, we focused on doing just a few things in our restaurants so that we can do them better than anybody else. But we have never ruled out additions or changes to the menu, and chorizo is 1 of the few changes that we have made to the menu in 23 years. Our chorizo is made with a blend of Responsibly Raised pork and chicken seasoned with paprika, toasted cumin and Chipotle peppers. We sear the chorizo in our restaurants to give it a perfect char, and we believe it's a great addition to our menu. It gives customers another option and 1 that has been well received, accounting for approximately 6% to 7% of entrée sales in the restaurants where it's available.
During the quarter, we also resumed serving locally grown produce in all of our restaurants. Typically, our local program for produce runs this summer and early fall months during the time that makes up the local growing season for much of the country. As we look to establish Chipotle as a leader in food safety, it's also important to us that we remain true to our commitment to serving Food with Integrity, including locally grown produce. Through a partnership with PrimusLabs funded by Chipotle, we are working with local growers to make certain that they can achieve our high standards for food safety, and we're auditing any farms that we work with to be sure they are compliant with all of our rigorous safety standards. Initially, as we layer in new local produce suppliers that has met our new food safety standards, our local produce program will have fewer farm partners than it did in the past year. But as we scale the program in the coming years, we'll have more local farms participated in the program than ever before.
We're also working hard to achieve our goal of eliminating the very last artificial additives from our tortillas. Tortillas are the only food item on Chipotle's menu that contain any additives, which include a minimal number of preservatives and dough conditioners. While we have made significant strides in reducing the number of additives in our tortillas today, the goal is to achieve a simple recipe with only a few ingredients, much like tortillas made in a more traditional way that includes wheat flour, vegetable oil, water, salt and starter for the flour tortillas.
Finally, I'd like to address recent headlines around surrounding Mark Crumpacker, our Chief Creative and Development Officer. We were surprised to learn of his personal issues and placed Mark on a leave of absence. We believe this will allow us to remain focused on our work and our efforts to serve great tasting food to provide an extraordinary restaurant experience and to continue winning back our customers.
One of the cornerstones of our people culture is to build top performing teams. Mark certainly had accomplished that in our development and marketing teams, and we have the utmost confidence in those teams and the people who lead them. And we know that they will do an excellent job running those departments. In Mark's absence, we have asked Mark Shambura, our Director of Brand Marketing, to lead our marketing team; and Carolyn Anderson, Executive Director of Facilities, Construction and Design, to lead our development efforts. And we have asked Curt Garner, who joined us as CIO late last year, to lead our e-commerce team.
Mark Shambura joined our marketing team in 2013, but his experience with Chipotle goes back further than that. Mark led our team at CAA Marketing from 2009 to 2011, working on some of the first innovative branded content programs, including the animated short, Back to the Start, and also worked on the development of our Cultivate food, music and ideas festivals. In his role as Brand Director of Marketing, Mark already has been overseeing several critical marketing functions, including all brand planning; content programs; digital, which includes web, mobile and social; and promotions and events.
Carolyn Anderson began working with Chipotle 20 years ago as an outside vendor in charge of facilities management. She joined us as National Facilities Manager in 2005 and was promoted to Facilities Director in 2008, where she was able to streamline our reinvest efforts to create programs to empower our restaurant managers to be better stewards of their restaurants, leading to substantially lower maintenance and repair costs. Carolyn's leadership and the exceptional work she and her team were doing led to her promotion to Director of Facilities and Construction in 2012 and again, in 2014, to a promotion to Executive Director of Facilities, Construction and Design. She is proven in building top performing teams that have paved the way to redefine development's roles and responsibilities, and she has been critical to developing and executing our strategy surrounding sustainability, food safety and increasing our cash on cash returns for new restaurants.
Curt Garner has been involved with our e-commerce team since he came onboard last November and has been extremely valuable as a member of the management team over just the past 9 months. Curt oversees all of our information technology infrastructure and its impact on future sales channels, so shifting our entire pipeline out of store sales projects to Curt's guidance has been very natural fit. We are confident in the current strategic direction of these teams and have full faith and confidence in Mark, Carolyn and Curt's abilities to deliver great results.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

As we work to bring our customers back to our restaurants and to reinforce fully as an industry leader in food safety, it's never been more important to have top performing teams in our restaurants and among our field leadership. It's th",1110,"Thank you, Steve. As we work to bring our customers back to our restaurants and to reinforce fully as an industry leader in food safety, it's never been more important to have top performing teams in our restaurants and among our field leadership. It's the strength of our people culture and our teams that has allowed us to quickly implement many new programs in food safety as well as marketing.
To be sure that our restaurant teams are aligned around our current priorities and that their efforts are directed at the right things, we have realigned some of the success measures for restaurant managers and teams, and we're tying incentives increasingly for our most urgent priorities of having an exceptional guest experience as well as effective local store marketing. We've also changed the prerequisites of becoming a Restaurateur, placing greater emphasis on measuring the guest experience, business fundamentals and food safety compliance. Historically, these measures have always been important, but we are emphasizing them even more and providing additional tools and training to be sure our restaurants are exceptional in achieving these high standards. We've also changed how we calculate our manager bonuses to reward excellence in these metrics with the greatest emphasis on food safety.
This renewed focus on an excellent guest experience, local store marketing, food safety and business fundamentals will be the means by which restaurant managers are eligible to be interviewed for Restaurateur. Once they meet these green fees, as we call them, they're interviewed as before to determine if they have a team of all top performers empowered to achieve high standards. Historically, these fundamentals were always important to becoming a Restaurateur, but our audits for them have become more specific and rigorous and our expectations for their achievement more stringent. The added focus we applied to that part of the process is already paying off in terms of generating sound business fundamentals in our restaurant and the improved food safety audits that we're seeing.
During the quarter, we made significant progress completing the implementation of an industry-leading traceability system, which will be fully implemented in all of our restaurants by the end of this month. Already, the traceability program has been rolled out in more than 1,900 restaurants. This has been a significant undertaking to put in place, and we're very pleased to be so close to completion of this industry-leading food safety enhancement.
Prior to this year, we had traceability in place between our suppliers and our distribution centers. And from the distribution centers, we could trace ingredients to our restaurants using ordering and distribution data. But the significance of this state-of-the-art traceability system is that we will have the ability to know exactly which supplier we got any particular food item from as well as the lot number of all produce, meats, sofritas, beans, salsas, dairy and tortillas, that are received in our restaurant. The system uses barcodes on every package to allow to be traced from the supplier of the restaurant the same way that overnight delivery services trace package shipments all over the world. This system is another significant way that Chipotle is becoming an industry leader in food safety because it gives us the ability to quickly investigate food quality issues in our supply chain or immediately remove food from our supply chain that we may find not up to our high standards.
This September, we will host our biannual All Managers' Conference. This year's conference will include restaurant managers, field leaders, operations leadership and select individuals from support departments. The content for this year's conference will be focused on helping our restaurant teams to create an excellent guest experience and teach them to more effectively market their individual restaurants. This conference is an excellent form to reinvigorate our restaurant teams and ensure that they're totally focused on the things that will most powerfully allow Chipotle to achieve its goals.
On the development front, our openings continue to be on pace with our guidance for 2016. We have opened 116 restaurants so far this year, which is about half of our total planned openings of 220 to 235. We are pleased that we have a strong pipeline of real estate locations under consideration. But as I explained last quarter, we will continue to be judicious in evaluating those locations in light of the current operating environment and with an eye towards delivering strong returns.
We've refocused our real estate team on assessing future openings with a more conservative lens that takes into account our current economic model, particularly given recent changes to our average unit volumes. We've also temporarily shifted some of our markets into our developing markets category in order to direct our new store investments towards markets with the strongest track record of opening sales. This may slightly temper the number of openings in these markets in the near term as we look to rebuild our sales momentum and will help us ensure strong new store productivity.
The impact from this is primarily on where we open new stores with a minimal impact on the total opening. Because the real estate pipeline is inherently long term in nature, some of our efforts to reprioritize our market mix will not be realized until late in 2017. Of course, we will update you in the coming months as to how many restaurants we do expect to open in 2017.
We're also working to strengthen the returns in our new restaurants by optimizing our average investment cost. This year, we will realize some cost savings through a collaborative effort between our design and procurement functions. In addition, our real estate team has been able to find an increasing number of great sites with strong landlord work letters, providing for landlords to invest more in our build-out costs. The benefit of these efforts translate to an average investment cost that is shaping up to be around $800,000 for 2016 in spite of increased market pressures on materials and labor.
The strength of our teams continues to be our key advantage. Top performing teams allow us to take on new tasks more rapidly than others might be able to and to create the great restaurant experiences that drive more traffic to our restaurants and delight our customers. We are confident that our teams will lead our recovery from this difficult time in our history such that we will emerge a stronger brand as a result of these challenging times and allow us to provide excellent value to our shareholders as well the many additional stakeholders who benefit from our successful achievements of our vision.
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

Throughout the quarter, we continue to heighten our marketing initiatives to drive sales and increase positive perceptions of our brand. Through quantitative and qualitative research we've undertaken regarding purchasing habit, we have a better understanding of our customers, their motivations and visitation patterns than we ever have before. We continue to increase promotional efforts more than we generally would because we think it's critical to reestablish contact and frequency among our guests so that they can recall how much they enjoy Chipotle.
In the last few months, we executed an integrator approach, which included a number of different marketing activities. We launched our largest ever mobile and direct mail promotions. We introduced chorizo as a new menu item and we will have in all of our restaurants before the end of the year. We developed and launched our first ever customer rewards program, Chiptopia, and will be spending the initial 3-month program to help us develop more lasting rewards program. We maintained a larger ongoing advertising presence than usual, and we launched a new animated short firm, A Love Story, to support Chiptopia, which would aim at reminding and inspiring our fans and attracting new customers. It has already been viewed in totality more than 17 million times with support from PR, paid digital and social media buy along with placement on more than 10,000 movie screens. These marketing activities are an important part of our strategy to help drive our sales recovery and we are seeing encouraging results in the consumer research.
In a June 2 survey by YouGov, for example, consumer perceptions of Chipotle turned positive for the first time since November. While sentiment is not back to where it was prior to these issues, it shows movement in the right direction. This improving sentiment is also supported by our own ongoing brand health tracking study, which shows consistent upward trends since mid-January's all-time lows. During the second quarter, we saw modest improvements in consideration and admiration across key customer segments. And with millennials, 18 to 34, a key customer group for us, we continue to see that they have the most favorable opinion of Chipotle.
During the first quarter, new customer acquisition was down from the previous quarter, but we saw improvement in this area in the second quarter and a trend in new customer acquisition, which we can directly attribute to our aggressive promotional offers. While we still have work to do to increase key brand metrics and traffic volumes, we have a very full slate of marketing programs planned for the remainder of the year that we believe will continue to support our recovery.
The first phase of our recovery plan, which began in February and which we are just coming out of, focused on winning back our customers. Based on the data we have, we believe that a majority of our most loyal customers have returned, but many of them are not coming as frequently as they used to.
The second phase of our recovery plan, which we are in the early stages of now continues our win-back strategy that adds a focus on increasing frequency and attracting new customers. Programs such as Chiptopia Summer Rewards and Love Story are aimed at helping us achieve these objectives.
Just 3 weeks after launching the Chiptopia program, we have more than 3.6 million participants and are seeing approximately 30% of all transactions participating in Chiptopia. This is a significant start to the program, and we anticipate our participant levels to continue to increase over the coming weeks. Most importantly, we are seeing growth in the number of guests that are visiting Chipotle at a run rate of more than 24 visits per year, our most frequent customer tier. These increased visits have helped the top line and have grown our traffic comp by about 5 points from June. It's still very early to draw conclusions on the long-term sustainability of these trends, but every incremental visit from a customer provides an opportunity for us to further restore trust.
All of these programs are helping to change the conversation about Chipotle. Q2 social sentiment is at 93% of the level it was precrisis, and the response to our Love Story film has been extremely well received. 80% of consumer conversation is positive. Overall, our marketing awareness is at its highest since Q1 2015.
Lastly, according to a survey by Ace Metrix, A Love Story is the highest scoring QSR ad they've ever tested, delivering strong results on breakthrough, which means high attention and likability relevant to other measures as well as change, meaning viewers feel strongly that the brand is moving in a new direction. The survey indicates that the film delivered strongly not only with our brand loyalists but also with lapsed customers and brand considerers.
For the remainder of the year, our marketing programs will continue at a robust pace. Among the programs you can expect to see in the coming months are ongoing emphasis on advertising and digital content to highlight our commitment to using high-quality ingredients and preparing food using classic cooking techniques just as we have always done without cutting corners and new content demonstrating how Chipotle has become a leader in food safety, targeted promotions aimed at inviting groups like students and families; the national rollout of chorizo by the end of the year; our annual Boorito Halloween promotion, which will have a charitable component with our Cultivate Foundation; a holiday promotion and a gift card incentive program; continued improvements to our mobile and e-commerce program; and continued emphasis on restaurant level marketing, which allows our restaurant managers to delight customers on a very local and individual basis. We are encouraged by the progress we are making to improve sentiment about our brand and drive traffic to our restaurants. While we recognize that there's a lot more work to be done to restore confidence, we believe that we have the right programs and the right teams in place to improve in these areas.
I will now turn the call over to Jack."

The sales comp in the second quarter showed modest improvement from the trends we reported in April when we reported that comps were running in the negative 26% range. We'd like to see the sales recovery happen more quickly, but we are as committed as ever to do all we can to reengage with our customers to restore their trust in Chipotle and reestablish customer frequency.
The first half of 2016 has been focused on establishing and executing industry leading food safety practices along with aggressive offers to invite our customers to return to Chipotle. As we begin the second half of 2016, we are optimistic about engaging our customers at a deeper level, going beyond basic broad-based free food offers with things like Chiptopia with branding efforts that are uniquely Chipotle such as the Love Story video, rolling out chorizo and continuing to show leadership in food quality by removing the few remaining artificial ingredients from our food.
Though it's very early, we're optimistic about the customer engagement with Chiptopia so far. Over 3.6 million actual or digital cards have been issued, and as Steve mentioned, nearly 30% of all transactions are engaged in Chiptopia. Sales comps for the past 2 weeks have improved to down 20% to 21% in that range, but importantly transactions have improved from down 20% in June to down 15% during the first half of July, an improvement of 500 basis points.
Our main objective with Chiptopia is to reward and incentivize our loyal customers who have decreased their frequency since late last year and to restore their visit frequency back to their previous levels. Our research has shown that most of our loyal customers have returned to Chipotle but not at the same frequency, so Chiptopia is targeted at those customers. And the early frequency results are very encouraging. In fact, since Chiptopia began July 1, we've seen a 90% increase in the number of customers who visit 2.5 times or more each week compared to June. We've seen a 200% increase in the number of customers coming in from 2 times to 2.5 times per week compared to June. And we've seen a 140% increase in the number of customers who visit between 1 and 2 times each week compared to June.
So we're off to a great start with Chiptopia so far. We'll continue to engage and encourage our customers to visit often during the entire 3-month program. And when our restaurant teams delight them with delicious food and great service, we have a great shot in maintaining or even improving these reestablished higher frequency levels. 
The average check has declined slightly during July by merely 3% versus June as many customers have already redeemed their free chips and guac for registering in Chiptopia or they have redeemed their free burritos for earning frequency status. Some customers are spending a little less on extras. There's only a $6 minimum purchase price in Chiptopia, and we're also seeing a slightly smaller group size. One important note on the accounting for Chiptopia, although the program is intended to last for 3 months, ending September 30, there will be rewards available to be redeemed in the fourth quarter or beyond. Therefore, at the end of the third quarter, GAAP accounting requires that we defer a portion of the revenue from the third quarter into the fourth quarter or later when awards are ultimately redeemed or the awards expire. It's not possible to project what that deferral might look like right now but we'll fully explain the impact during our third quarter earnings call.
Our entire company is eager to see the sales recover happen even faster in all restaurants and all markets throughout the country. Many of you on the call today probably feel the same way. While we certainly like to be further along, there are signs that the recovery is well on its way and continues to march along.
The company-wide July sales comp of down approximately 20% along with the July TC comp of down about 15% has come a long way from the low point in January when sales were down 36% and TCs were down 34%. July so far represents a recovery versus the low point in January of 42% on lost sales, meaning that we recovered 42% of the lost sales from January. And we've recovered 53% of the transactions that we lost in January.
But most of our market across country are further along than this in their recovery. For example, in Middle America, the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and the Southwest, which combined account for nearly 2/3 of our comp restaurants, the comp sales were down about 18%, and the comp TCs are down 13% in July. This represents a recovery rate versus January of 46% on sales and nearly 60% on TCs. Our best market in the country is in Ohio, where comp sales are down just 12% and TCs are down just 6% in July. We still have a ways to go, but we're making progress.
Unfortunately, the recovery is not as far along in the Northeast and on the West Coast, where comp sales are still down around 26% and comp TCs are down around 21% in July. Of course, these are the areas closest to the events of last year, and so the recovery is just not as far along as it is in the rest of the country. In fact, sales recovery for the Northeast and the West Coast combined is only 35% and TC recovery is about 45% when comparing July to the January lows.
We returned to profitability during the quarter with EPS at $0.87 per share. Of course, fully restoring our earnings power is highly dependent on the pace and the magnitude of our sales recovery, which remains a top priority for us.
Running through the P&L for the quarter. We reported $998 million in sales, a decrease of 17% versus the second quarter of 2015. We generated restaurant level operating margin of 15.5% in the quarter, which is down from the second quarter of 2015 but up sequentially from the first quarter of 2016. During the second quarter, sales deleverage contributed about 800 basis points of pressure compared with Q2 of 2015.
Food costs were 34.2% in the quarter, up 110 basis points from the prior year. Underlying inflation was minimal during the quarter as increased supplier costs for our new preparation of tomatoes, lettuce and steak, along with food waste, more than offset last year's small increased menu prices and lower stock pricing for paper and beef. Food waste added about 70 basis points as we're still inefficient with some of the new procedures, are still navigating through ordering and prepping the right amount of food at the right time, especially surrounding promotions. Looking at the rest of this year, we anticipate food costs will remain at right about the same level, as inefficiencies we achieve are likely to be offset by higher avocado pricing in Q3.
Labor expenses during the quarter were 27.7% of sales compared to 22.6% during the second quarter of 2015. Nearly all of this drop or about 450 basis points is due to sales deleverage. Remaining increase is due to labor inflation offset by better labor scheduling this year versus Q2 of last year. In Q2 of last year, we had a system recording issue, which led to elevated labor scheduling. Our underlying labor inflation is running at about 6%, while hourly wage inflation is closer to 9%.
Occupancy costs were 7.2% of sales, higher as a percent of sales by 180 basis points, all of it related to sales deleverage. Other operating costs were 15.2%, up from 10.9% during the second quarter of 2015 driven by deleverage and higher marketing and promo activity. Marketing costs during the quarter were 2.7% of sales, and promo activity added 1.6% of sales for a total of 4.3% combined compared to 2.3% last year. Our investment in marketing and promo will remain at elevated levels as we continue to aggressively engage with our customers to regain their trust and loyalty.
G&A expenses were $70.8 million in the quarter, which is virtually identical to last year's expenses of $70.2 million. A few months ago, we made the decision to temporarily hold off on hiring any new G&A headcount in an effort to manage our support cost during these challenging times. Instead, we narrowed the focus of all of our support teams to only those efforts which will lead to safer food, a better restaurant experience for our guests or increased sales. Our teams have stepped up to the challenge and are supporting a greater number of restaurants without adding resources and are focusing the vast majority of their efforts on those 3 things: food safety, the guest experience and sales building. Of course, we continue to hire at the restaurant level to support our new restaurants and ensure every restaurant is fully staffed and ready to delight our customers when they visit. As a percentage of sales, G&A expenses increased 120 basis points to 7.1% of sales, due entirely to sales deleverage. Underlying G&A for the next 2 quarters will remain at about this level, but the third quarter will include the incremental cost of the All Managers' Conference, which is expected to be around $10 million.
Our pretax income was $41.7 million, and our tax rate during the quarter was 38.6%. For the full year 2016, we also estimate our effective tax rate will be about 38.6% compared to 38.2% in 2015, so the higher tax rate is a result of higher state taxes.
During the second quarter and through yesterday, we repurchased 170 million of CMG shares at an average price of $438. We generated cash from operations of $118 million during the quarter, and we continue to maintain more than $600 million in cash and investments. As we work to restore customer trust and restore our earnings capability, we still have the ability to fund our growth and buy back our stock opportunistically. As of today, we have $123 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.
These are challenging times, the most challenging we've ever faced. Our company is committed to restoring customer trust, recovering customer visits and restoring our economic model to its full potential, which we believe will position us to add significant shareholder value for a very long time.
Thank you for your time today, and we'll be happy to open the lines for the questions you might have."

The program has only been around for less than 3 weeks and the first week at a holiday weekend, which we saw some pretty choppy enrollment during that time with the 4th of July being closed and the buildup to the 4th of July, which is it's not a regular transaction or sales builder for. Since then, we've seen a very regular engagement. We've seen a very regular ramp-up of people that are participating in the program. We have significant -- every single day, we have over 100,000 people that are added to the program. The majority of them are registered in the program. And we've seen significant repeat visits. We've seen like 28% of the people that are enrolled, they're engaged in Chiptopia, have come back a second time. So we're seeing exactly the results we had hoped that our already loyal customers who have reduced their visits after the results are -- after the events of last year are coming in more often. We're hopeful that will happen as we get into the end of this month. And by the way, there's an incentive for people to come back more often as the months close because each month accounts toward earning the big end-of-program awards, and so achieving a level in July is a starting point. Then, it starts over. Basically, now you need to achieve that same level in August and then September. So it's very, very early, and so we're optimistic that we got a 500 basis point impact in effectively less than 3 weeks. In terms of what's going forward after this, we're going to watch this very closely. We're going to learn from it. We're going to find out what works, what doesn't work both for our customers and for our teams in the restaurants. And we anticipate we will have another program. We just don't know yet whether it will be another temporary program, will it be a kind of permanent program, but it's very, very likely that we will have something to follow on when Chiptopia ends in -- at the end of September."

The first question was about the comparison. The comparison is not easier in July. In fact, if anything, the comparison is tougher in July, so we feel good about the 500 basis points of improvement so far. In terms of the average check, it's only down less than 3% in July. We had a gap even before July started, Joe, and that was -- a lot of that was due to lower group size. It's also due to the fact that we've had lot of promos throughout the last few months as we tried to earn customers back. With the less than 3% that we're seeing in July so far, right about half of that is due to the redemption of awards. That was part of the program. We were prepared to offer compelling incentives to get people signed up, and so all you have to do is come in, get a card. Don't even have to register yet, and you'll get free chips and guac. A lot of those have been redeemed already. The fact that there's a lot of redemption of burritos already means that our customers are marching through the levels. They're already earning Mild status. A bunch of them have earned Medium status. And believe it or not, within the first 12 or 13 days, we have thousands of people that ever -- that had earned the Hot status, which means they came 11 times already. And you can't come more than twice in a day, so you have to come basically 11 days. And people had already been part of the program within the first 12 or 13 days that we were open. So the redemption of awards, we totally expected that. The other thing we did in -- on purpose, we had a pretty low threshold where if you came in and spent $6, which basically means come in and get a burrito, you'll be part of the program. Again, Joe, our objective was to get as many visits as possible, the idea there being once we get them in the restaurants, if we delight them with a terrific experience, we have a shot at keeping them. And so we didn't want to set a high threshold, and so that has contributed to folks participating without all the add-ons, without the drinks and things like that. So the average check, we were ready for that. And we think gaining the customer visit is most important, and we'll work on the average check later. And then in terms of technology, I don't know if Curt is on the phone. I think the question, Joe, was have we learned something about technology and do we have to make significant investments in technology going forward with our customers."

No customers got sick, and yet, that turned into a news story. So it's been frustrating that there have been things beyond our control, where things have worked perfectly well, and we followed all our protocols.

A lot of the research has told us that customers are looking for more information. They're looking for a longer time period where nothing happens. And so so far so good in that. Mark had mentioned this. I don't know if you picked up on it that he and his team are starting to put together a strategy where we will communicate what we've done in a compelling way.

The social media coverage varies on what people are saying. So I wanted to see if you had a view on that, whether that's played any role, a change in taste or perception on customers' traffic. So that's one. And then the second question I had was for Jack about margins. I'm trying to reconcile what we're seeing in your margin structure now versus historically, which is to say I think you suggested that the current run rate at roughly $2 million AUV. Restaurant margins are kind of where they are in the mid-teens. If I go back to 2011 when your volumes were around $2 million, your restaurant margins were 26%. So I understand that there's been inflation, and you clearly have some food costs associated with it. But I'm just trying to understand where that -- if there's any way to bridge that roughly 1,000 basis point gap between what your margins have looked like at these volumes in the past and what you're guiding to now."

Well, I'll start with the food and the taste of the food. So during the time of the incident last fall, we didn't know the cause, and so we looked at every single ingredient that we were bringing into our restaurants and working with a number of food safety experts, tried to understand what the risk of those items were, the individual items coming in. And I'll just give you the example that I think illustrates sort of how things happen. So take bell peppers for instance. So our -- one of our experts said that it would be helpful if we could test the bell peppers before you bring them into the -- before we bring them into the restaurant. Well, the way to test them though is to slice them up in a central kitchen and then wash them, test them and then package them. That turned out to degrade the flavor. It does not taste as good as when our crews would expertly chop using a cutting board and a knife right in there in front of the customer and then sauteing. So -- but in order to make sure that we had the highest food safety, we went right to the central kitchen. And we did this with a couple of other items also. And I fear that we probably did negatively impact the flavor, and I think maybe some customers noticed that also. We have reversed that though with bell peppers and other items because we have developed with our in-house food safety expert, Jim Marsden, a number of interventions that we've put in place from the farm all the way through the distribution system and into the restaurants. And so with peppers, for instance, we now have our crews blanch the peppers in boiling water, which would completely eliminate any pathogen that might be on the surface because blanching doesn't actually cook the pepper because it's for such a short period of time, but it's plenty of time to kill any pathogen that may be on the surface. Our crew then goes with the old process of with a knife and a cutting board chopping right in front of the customer and sauteing as usual. We did the same thing with lettuce. We've put a number of interventions in place, so we brought chopping lettuce back into the restaurant. And so we've returned, I think, our food to taste levels that were -- where we were before the crisis. But we're going beyond that. We're going beyond that in the elimination of preservatives and dough conditioners in our tortillas. If you look at the ingredients at Chipotle overall, it's a really, really clean ingredient list. And what do I mean by that? It doesn't have the kinds of things that are very hard to pronounce, preservatives and fillers and artificial flavors and artificial colors, all these kinds of things. And so once our -- and if all our tortillas are rid of the preservatives, we will be in an extraordinary position to tell people, our customers, about our very, very clean ingredient label and be proud to display them. And I think that's not something typical fast food could do. So again, we're not only bringing our -- the great taste that we had precrisis, but we're continuing to push Food with Integrity in ways that are going to set industry standards."

We're intentionally overspending on that line item, and it's way above historical norms. There's another probably 125, 150 basis points or so of inefficiencies. We're wasting a lot of food. We're not very efficient with labor, and part of it is because we are taking on a lot of new procedures, and that's been inefficient. We're being inefficient in terms of dealing with promotions, and we're tending to overstaff rather than understaff. So that's in that 325 to 350 basis points.

And so without the details in front of me, I'm guessing that was probably 300 basis points or so difference in food cost. And what's happened there is we just haven't raised prices very much over the year. Our model a year ago could handle a 34% food cost. With the deleveraging effects and all the inefficiencies, the 34% food cost is a lot more painful today. We also have labor inflation that had crept in since then, and I'm just guessing that's probably at least another 200 to 300 basis points. The labor inflation, especially in the last year, has been significant. We had -- intend to do a pass on the wage rates that we were seeing because of local pressures because of raised minimum wages, some of them very significant in $10, $12, $13, and we haven't really raised -- we haven't passed on the cost of those higher wages. We have probably a couple hundred basis points there. We do have recurring food safety costs that you heard me talk about. We talked about that being in the maybe 200 basis point range. I think it's going to better than that. I would say that's probably going to end up in the 100 to 150 basis points. Right now we've got about 150 in there. And so that's the only thing that's really, what I said, is an absolute permanent. So if you add all these things up together, you're probably in that 1,000, 1,100 basis points or so. So those are the items. We're very aware of the items we believe the most important thing we can do. We lost 800 basis points because of deleverage. That's why most of our focus this year, of course, food safety first. Now secondly is to recover our customers. We're doing that through offers, through Chiptopia, through branding. And then our focus, as Monty mentioned, is making sure that our customers have a wonderful experience when they come back because if we get our sales back, we get 800 basis points of margin. These other items, though, we think we can ship away these other items as well, but we don't want to go after them aggressively until we've recovered as many or all of our customers. And once we've done that, then we know that we can make a lot of progress on these other margin items as well."

And so we anticipate that we continue to work on that. We'll get a better understanding as to why some of the turnover's happening and continue to work on reducing turnover."

Our sales recovery that began midway through the first quarter continued at a modest pace in the second quarter, and we saw a return to profitability along with the opening of 58 new restaurants.
During the second quarter, we generated total revenue of $998 million. Our sales comp improved by 6% from the first quarter to a negative 23.6% for the quarter. As a result of promotional activities, we are seeing slightly better improvements in comparable traffic, with customer traffic down 20% for the quarter. While we would like to see a sales recovery occurring more quickly, we're optimistic that our Chiptopia Summer Rewards program, which launched on July 1, will encourage more guests to visit our restaurants and that this will help lead to a sustained higher sales recovery.
Though the program is just a few weeks old, we're already seeing approximately 30% of all transactions participating in Chiptopia. We have seen further improvement in both comparable restaurant sales and transactions, with comp sales down about 21% in July and traffic improving so that it is now down to a negative mid-teens for July so far.
Diluted earnings per share was $0.87 for the quarter, down from $4.45 earned in the second quarter of last year. While our unit economic model has been significantly affected by the sales hit, it continues to fully fund our current level of new restaurant growth.
Last week, Chipotle celebrated its 23rd anniversary. Throughout our history, we've been working hard to change the way people think about and eat fast food. And as we have grown into a national brand, we have cultivated and been supported by a very loyal customer base. As customers have fallen in love with Chipotle, they have also placed an extraordinary level of trust in us and have come to know that we will do the right thing when it comes to our food, our employees and our approach to running our business. 
Through the food safety events we faced last year, we lost some of that trust. Our customers have come to expect a lot from us to prepare, cook and serve fresh, delicious food while pushing the envelope to encourage farming and ranching practices that respect animals and the environment and the people who raise the ingredients we use. We're committed to exceeding our customers' expectations and restoring their confidence that we will deliver upon our promises.
While there are no quick solutions to restoring trust and bringing our sales back to previous levels, we're focused on a number of activities, which will continue to emphasize driving traffic in the near term and increasing customer frequency. We will also focus on longer-term brand messaging and on advancing our Food with Integrity efforts, which have been key to building trust and loyalty with customers over the years. But the best thing that we can do in the near term is to encourage customers to come back into our restaurants and to ensure that our restaurant teams are delivering an extraordinary dining experience on each and every customer visit.
In the first half of the year, we have invested more heavily than ever in marketing and promotional activity, and those investments are beginning to pay off. Since the CDC's investigation in Chipotle concluded in February, we have done a number of things: First, we launched our largest ever mobile offer into our largest ever direct mail program; second, we introduced a new menu item, chorizo, and we expect to have it in all of our restaurants by the end of the year; third, we created our first ever customer rewards program, Chiptopia; and fourth, we launched a new animated short film in an effort to help customers appreciate what is unique about Chipotle. Collectively, these efforts, along with excellent operations, are bringing customers back into our restaurants, and our teams are working hard to provide an extraordinary experience in all of our restaurants every day.
The introduction of a new menu item such as chorizo is unusual for us. As you know, we have always maintained a very focused menu and rarely changed it. Instead, we focused on doing just a few things in our restaurants so that we can do them better than anybody else. But we have never ruled out additions or changes to the menu, and chorizo is one of the few changes that we have made to the menu in 23 years. Our chorizo is made with a blend of Responsibly Raised pork and chicken seasoned with paprika, toasted cumin and Chipotle peppers. We sear the chorizo in our restaurants to give it a perfect char, and we believe it's a great addition to our menu. It gives customers another option and one that has been well received, accounting for approximately 6% to 7% of entrée sales in the restaurants where it's available.
During the quarter, we also resumed serving locally grown produce in all of our restaurants. Typically, our local program for produce runs this summer and early fall months, during the time that makes up the local growing season for much of the country. As we look to establish Chipotle as a leader in food safety, it's also important to us that we remain true to our commitment to serving Food with Integrity, including locally grown produce. 
Through a partnership with PrimusLabs funded by Chipotle, we are working with local growers to make certain that they can achieve our high standards for food safety, and we're auditing any farms that we work with to be sure they are compliant with all of our rigorous safety standards. 
Initially, as we layer in new local produce suppliers that have met our new food safety standards, our local produce program will have fewer farm partners than it did in the past year. But as we scale the program in the coming years, we'll have more local farms participated in the program than ever before.
We're also working hard to achieve our goal of eliminating the very last artificial additives from our tortillas. Tortillas are the only food item on Chipotle's menu that contain any additives, which include a minimal number of preservatives and dough conditioners. While we have made significant strides in reducing the number of additives in our tortillas today, the goal is to achieve a simple recipe with only a few ingredients, much like tortillas made in a more traditional way that includes wheat flour, vegetable oil, water, salt and starter for the flour tortillas.
Finally, I'd like to address recent headlines around surrounding Mark Crumpacker, our Chief Creative and Development Officer. We were surprised to learn of these personal issues and placed Mark on a leave of absence. We believe this will allow us to remain focused on our work and our efforts to serve great tasting food to provide an extraordinary restaurant experience and to continue winning back our customers.
One of the cornerstones of our people culture is to build top-performing teams. Mark certainly had accomplished that in our development and marketing teams, and we have the utmost confidence in those teams and the people who lead them. And we know that they will do an excellent job running those departments. In Mark's absence, we have asked Mark Shambura, our Director of Brand Marketing, to lead our marketing team; and Carolyn Anderson, Executive Director of Facilities, Construction and Design, to lead our development efforts. And we have asked Curt Garner, who joined us as CIO late last year, to lead our e-commerce team.
Mark Shambura joined our marketing team in 2013, but his experience with Chipotle goes back further than that. Mark led our team at CAA Marketing from 2009 to 2011, working on some of the first innovative branded content programs, including the animated short, Back to the Start, and also worked on the development of our Cultivate food, music and ideas festivals. In his role as Brand Director of Marketing, Mark already has been overseeing several critical marketing functions, including all brand planning; content programs; digital, which includes web, mobile and social; and promotions and events.
Carolyn Anderson began working with Chipotle 20 years ago as an outside vendor in charge of facilities management. She joined us as National Facilities Manager in 2005 and was promoted to Facilities Director in 2008, where she was able to streamline our reinvest efforts to create programs to empower our restaurant managers to be better stewards of their restaurants, leading to substantially lower maintenance and repair costs. Carolyn's leadership and the exceptional work she and her team were doing led to her promotion to Director of Facilities and Construction in 2012 and again, in 2014, to a promotion to Executive Director of Facilities, Construction and Design. She is proven in building top-performing teams that have paved the way to redefine development's roles and responsibilities, and she has been critical to developing and executing our strategy surrounding sustainability, food safety and increasing our cash-on-cash returns for new restaurants.
Curt Garner has been involved with our e-commerce team since he came onboard last November and has been extremely valuable as a member of the management team over just the past 9 months. Curt oversees all of our information technology infrastructure and its impact on future sales channels, so shifting our entire pipeline out of store sales projects to Curt's guidance has been very natural fit. We are confident in the current strategic direction of these teams and have full faith and confidence in Mark, Carolyn and Curt's abilities to deliver great results.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

As we work to bring our customers back to our restaurants and to reinforce Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety, it's never been more important to have top-performing teams in our restaurants and among our field leadership. It's",1107,"Thank you, Steve. As we work to bring our customers back to our restaurants and to reinforce Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety, it's never been more important to have top-performing teams in our restaurants and among our field leadership. It's the strength of our people culture and our teams that has allowed us to quickly implement many new programs in food safety as well as marketing.
To be sure that our restaurant teams are aligned around our current priorities and that their efforts are directed at the right things, we have realigned some of the success measures for restaurant managers and teams, and we're tying incentives increasingly to our most urgent priorities of having an exceptional guest experience, as well as effective local store marketing. 
We've also changed the prerequisites of becoming a Restaurateur, placing greater emphasis on measuring the guest experience, business fundamentals and food safety compliance. Historically, these measures have always been important, but we are emphasizing them even more and providing additional tools and training to be sure our restaurants are exceptional in achieving these high standards. We've also changed how we calculate our manager bonuses to reward excellence in these metrics, with the greatest emphasis on food safety.
This renewed focus on an excellent guest experience, local store marketing, food safety and business fundamentals will be the means by which restaurant managers are eligible to be interviewed for Restaurateur. Once they meet these green fees, as we call them, they're interviewed, as before, to determine if they have a team of all top-performers empowered to achieve high standards. 
Historically, these fundamentals were always important to becoming a Restaurateur, but our audits for them have become more specific and rigorous and our expectations for their achievement more stringent. The added focus we applied to that part of the process is already paying off in terms of generating sound business fundamentals in our restaurant and the improved food safety audits that we're seeing.
During the quarter, we made significant progress completing the implementation of an industry-leading traceability system, which will be fully implemented in all of our restaurants by the end of this month. Already, the traceability program has been rolled out in more than 1,900 restaurants. This has been a significant undertaking to put in place, and we're very pleased to be so close to completion of this industry-leading food safety enhancement.
Prior to this year, we had traceability in place between our suppliers and our distribution centers. And from the distribution centers, we could trace ingredients to our restaurants using ordering and distribution data. But the significance of this state-of-the-art traceability system is that we will have the ability to know exactly which supplier we got any particular food item from, as well as the lot number of all produce, meats, sofritas, beans, salsas, dairy and tortillas, that are received in our restaurant. 
The system uses barcodes on every package to allow to be traced from the supplier of the restaurant the same way that overnight delivery services trace package shipments all over the world. This system is another significant way that Chipotle is becoming an industry leader in food safety because it gives us the ability to quickly investigate food quality issues in our supply chain or immediately remove food from our supply chain that we may find not up to our high standards.
This September, we will host our biannual All Managers' Conference. This year's conference will include restaurant managers, field leaders, operations leadership and select individuals from support departments. The content for this year's conference will be focused on helping our restaurant teams to create an excellent guest experience and teach them to more effectively market their individual restaurants. This conference is an excellent forum to reinvigorate our restaurant teams and ensure that they're totally focused on the things that will most powerfully allow Chipotle to achieve its goals.
On the development front, our openings continue to be on pace with our guidance for 2016. We have opened 116 restaurants so far this year, which is about half of our total planned openings of 220 to 235. We are pleased that we have a strong pipeline of real estate locations under consideration. But as I explained last quarter, we will continue to be judicious in evaluating those locations in light of the current operating environment and with an eye towards delivering strong returns.
We've refocused our real estate team on assessing future openings with a more conservative lens that takes into account our current economic model, particularly given recent changes to our average unit volumes. We've also temporarily shifted some of our markets into our developing markets category in order to direct our new store investments towards markets with the strongest track record of opening sales. This may slightly temper the number of openings in these markets in the near term as we look to rebuild our sales momentum and will help us ensure strong new store productivity.
The impact from this is primarily on where we open new stores with a minimal impact on the total opening. Because the real estate pipeline is inherently long term in nature, some of our efforts to reprioritize our market mix will not be realized until late in 2017. Of course, we will update you in the coming months as to how many restaurants we do expect to open in 2017.
We're also working to strengthen the returns in our new restaurants by optimizing our average investment cost. This year, we will realize some cost savings through a collaborative effort between our design and procurement functions. In addition, our real estate team has been able to find an increasing number of great sites with strong landlord work letters, providing for landlords to invest more in our build-out costs. The benefit of these efforts translate to an average investment cost that is shaping up to be around $800,000 for 2016 in spite of increased market pressures on materials and labor.
The strength of our teams continues to be our key advantage. Top-performing teams allow us to take on new tasks more rapidly than others might be able to and to create the great restaurant experiences that drive more traffic to our restaurants and delight our customers. We are confident that our teams will lead our recovery from this difficult time in our history such that we will emerge a stronger brand as a result of these challenging times and allow us to provide excellent value to our shareholders, as well the many additional stakeholders who benefit from our successful achievements of our vision.
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

Throughout the quarter, we continue to heighten our marketing initiatives to drive sales and increase positive perceptions of our brand. Through quantitative and qualitative research we've undertaken regarding purchasing habit, we have a better understanding of our customers, their motivations and visitation patterns than we ever have before. We continue to increase promotional efforts more than we generally would because we think it's critical to reestablish contact and frequency among our guests so that they can recall how much they enjoy Chipotle.
In the last few months, we executed an integrator approach, which included a number of different marketing activities. We launched our largest ever mobile and direct mail promotions. We introduced chorizo as a new menu item and we will have in all of our restaurants before the end of the year. We developed and launched our first ever customer rewards program, Chiptopia, and will be studying the initial 3-month program to help us develop more lasting rewards program. We maintained a larger ongoing advertising presence than usual, and we launched a new animated short firm, A Love Story, to support Chiptopia, which was aimed at reminding and inspiring our fans and attracting new customers. It has already been viewed in totality more than 17 million times with support from PR, paid digital and social media buy along with placement on more than 10,000 movie screens. These marketing activities are an important part of our strategy to help drive our sales recovery and we are seeing encouraging results in the consumer research.
In a June 2 survey by YouGov, for example, consumer perceptions of Chipotle turned positive for the first time since November. While sentiment is not back to where it was prior to these issues, it shows movement in the right direction. 
This improving sentiment is also supported by our own ongoing brand health tracking study, which shows consistent upward trends since mid-January's all-time lows. During the second quarter, we saw modest improvements in consideration and admiration across key customer segments. And with millennials, 18 to 34, a key customer group for us, we continue to see that they have the most favorable opinion of Chipotle.
During the first quarter, new customer acquisition was down from the previous quarter, but we saw improvement in this area in the second quarter and a trend in new customer acquisition, which we can directly attribute to our aggressive promotional offers. While we still have work to do to increase key brand metrics and traffic volumes, we have a very full slate of marketing programs planned for the remainder of the year that we believe will continue to support our recovery.
The first phase of our recovery plan, which began in February and which we are just coming out of, focused on winning back our customers. Based on the data we have, we believe that a majority of our most loyal customers have returned, but many of them are not coming as frequently as they used to.
The second phase of our recovery plan, which we are in the early stages of now, continues our win-back strategy that adds a focus on increasing frequency and attracting new customers. Programs such as Chiptopia Summer Rewards and Love Story are aimed at helping us achieve these objectives.
Just 3 weeks after launching the Chiptopia program, we have more than 3.6 million participants and are seeing approximately 30% of all transactions participating in Chiptopia. This is a significant start to the program, and we anticipate our participant levels to continue to increase over the coming weeks. Most importantly, we are seeing growth in the number of guests that are visiting Chipotle at a run rate of more than 24 visits per year, our most frequent customer tier. These increased visits have helped the top line and have grown our traffic comp by about 5 points from June. It's still very early to draw conclusions on the long-term sustainability of these trends, but every incremental visit from a customer provides an opportunity for us to further restore trust.
All of these programs are helping to change the conversation about Chipotle. Q2 social sentiment is at 93% of the level it was precrisis, and the response to our Love Story film has been extremely well received. 80% of consumer conversation is positive. Overall, our marketing awareness is at its highest since Q1 2015.
Lastly, according to a survey by Ace Metrix, A Love Story is the highest scoring QSR ad they've ever tested, delivering strong results on breakthrough, which means high attention and likability relevant to other measures, as well as change, meaning viewers feel strongly that the brand is moving in a new direction. The survey indicates that the film delivered strongly not only with our brand loyalists but also with lapsed customers and brand considerers.
For the remainder of the year, our marketing programs will continue at a robust pace. Among the programs you can expect to see in the coming months are: ongoing emphasis on advertising and digital content to highlight our commitment to using high-quality ingredients and preparing food using classic cooking techniques just as we have always done without cutting corners and new content demonstrating how Chipotle has become a leader in food safety, targeted promotions aimed at inviting groups like students and families; the national rollout of chorizo by the end of the year; our annual Boorito Halloween promotion, which will have a charitable component with our Cultivate Foundation; a holiday promotion and a gift card incentive program; continued improvements to our mobile and e-commerce program; and continued emphasis on restaurant level marketing, which allows our restaurant managers to delight customers on a very local and individual basis. We are encouraged by the progress we are making to improve sentiment about our brand and drive traffic to our restaurants. While we recognize that there's a lot more work to be done to restore confidence, we believe that we have the right programs and the right teams in place to improve in these areas.
I will now turn the call over to Jack."
26446,367077111,1010313,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark.

The sales comp in the second quarter showed modest improvement from the trends we reported in April when we reported that comps were running in the negative 26% range. We'd like to see the sales recovery happen more quickly, but we are as committed as ever to do all we can to reengage with our customers to restore their trust in Chipotle and reestablish customer frequency.
The first half of 2016 has been focused on establishing and executing industry leading food safety practices, along with aggressive offers to invite our customers to return to Chipotle. As we begin the second half of 2016, we are optimistic about engaging our customers at a deeper level, going beyond basic broad-based free food offers with things like Chiptopia, with branding efforts that are uniquely Chipotle such as the Love Story video, rolling out chorizo and continuing to show leadership in food quality by removing the few remaining artificial ingredients from our food.
Though it's very early, we're optimistic about the customer engagement with Chiptopia so far. Over 3.6 million actual or digital cards have been issued, and as Steve mentioned, nearly 30% of all transactions are engaged in Chiptopia. Sales comps for the past 2 weeks have improved to down 20% to 21%, in that range, but importantly, transactions have improved from down 20% in June to down 15% during the first half of July, an improvement of 500 basis points.
Our main objective with Chiptopia is to reward and incentivize our loyal customers who have decreased their frequency since late last year and to restore their visit frequency back to their previous levels. Our research has shown that most of our loyal customers have returned to Chipotle but not at the same frequency, so Chiptopia is targeted at those customers. And the early frequency results are very encouraging. In fact, since Chiptopia began July 1, we've seen a 90% increase in the number of customers who visit 2.5 times or more each week compared to June. We've seen a 200% increase in the number of customers coming in from 2 times to 2.5 times per week compared to June. And we've seen a 140% increase in the number of customers who visit between 1 and 2 times each week compared to June. So we're off to a great start with Chiptopia so far. 
We'll continue to engage and encourage our customers to visit often during the entire 3-month program. And when our restaurant teams delight them with delicious food and great service, we have a great shot in maintaining or even improving these reestablished higher frequency levels. 
The average check has declined slightly during July by nearly 3% versus June as many customers have already redeemed their free chips and guac for registering in Chiptopia or they've redeemed their free burritos for earning frequency status. Some customers are spending a little less on extras. There's only a $6 minimum purchase price in Chiptopia, and we're also seeing a slightly smaller group size. One important note on the accounting for Chiptopia, although the program is intended to last for 3 months, ending September 30, there will be rewards available to be redeemed in the fourth quarter or beyond. Therefore, at the end of the third quarter, GAAP accounting requires that we defer a portion of the revenue from the third quarter into the fourth quarter or later when the awards are ultimately redeemed or the awards expire. It's not possible to project what that deferral might look like right now, but we'll fully explain the impact during our third quarter earnings call.
Our entire company is eager to see the sales recover happen even faster in all restaurants and all markets throughout the country. Many of you on the call today probably feel the same way. While we'd certainly like to be further along, there are signs that the recovery is well on its way and continues to march along.
The company-wide July sales comp of down approximately 20%, along with the July TC comp of down about 15%, has come a long way from the low point in January when sales were down 36% and TCs were down 34%. July so far represents a recovery versus the low point in January of 42% on lost sales, meaning that we recovered 42% of the lost sales from January. And we've recovered 53% of the transactions that we lost in January.
But most of our market across country are further along than this in their recovery. For example, in Middle America, the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and the Southwest, which combined account for nearly 2/3 of our comp restaurants, the comp sales were down about 18%, and the comp TCs are down 13% in July. This represents a recovery rate versus January of 46% on sales and nearly 60% on TCs. Our best market in the country is in Ohio, where comp sales are down just 12% and TCs are down just 6% in July. We still have a ways to go, but we're making progress.
Unfortunately, the recovery is not as far along in the Northeast and on the West Coast, where comp sales are still down around 26% and comp TCs are down around 21% in July. Of course, these are the areas closest to the events of last year, and so the recovery is just not as far along as it is in the rest of the country. In fact, sales recovery for the Northeast and the West Coast combined is only 35% and TC recovery is about 45% when comparing July to the January lows.
We returned to profitability during the quarter with EPS at $0.87 per share. Of course, fully restoring our earnings power is highly dependent on the pace and the magnitude of our sales recovery, which remains a top priority for us.
Running through the P&L for the quarter. We reported $998 million in sales, a decrease of 17% versus the second quarter of 2015. We generated restaurant level operating margin of 15.5% in the quarter, which is down from the second quarter of 2015 but up sequentially on the first quarter of 2016. During the second quarter, sales deleverage contributed about 800 basis points of pressure compared with Q2 of 2015.
Food costs were 34.2% in the quarter, up 110 basis points from prior year. Underlying inflation was minimal during the quarter as increased supplier costs for our new preparation of tomatoes, lettuce and steak along with food waste, more than offset last year's small increased menu prices and lower stock pricing for paper and beef. Food waste added about 70 basis points as we're still inefficient with some of the new procedures, we're still navigating through ordering and prepping the right amount of food at the right time, especially surrounding promotions. 
Looking at the rest of this year, we anticipate food costs will remain at right about the same level, as inefficiencies we achieve are likely to be offset by higher avocado pricing in Q3.
Labor expenses during the quarter were 27.7% of sales compared to 22.6% during the second quarter of 2015. Nearly all of this drop or about 450 basis points is due to sales deleverage. Remaining increase is due to labor inflation offset by better labor scheduling this year versus Q2 of last year. In Q2 of last year, we had a system recording issue, which led to elevated labor scheduling. Our underlying labor inflation is running at about 6%, while hourly wage inflation is closer to 9%.
Occupancy costs were 7.2% of sales, higher as a percent of sales by 180 basis points, all of it related to sales deleverage. Other operating costs were 15.2%, up from 10.9% during the second quarter of 2015 driven by deleverage and higher marketing and promo activities. Marketing costs during the quarter were 2.7% of sales, and promo activity added 1.6% of sales for a total of 4.3% combined compared to 2.3% last year. Our investment in marketing and promo will remain at elevated levels as we continue to aggressively engage with our customers to regain their trust and loyalty.
G&A expenses were $70.8 million in the quarter, which is virtually identical to last year's expenses of $70.2 million. A few months ago, we made the decision to temporarily hold off on hiring any new G&A headcount in an effort to manage our support cost during these challenging times. Instead, we narrowed the focus of all of our support teams to only those efforts which will lead to safer food, a better restaurant experience for our guests or increased sales. Our teams have stepped up to the challenge and are supporting a greater number of restaurants without adding resources and are focusing the vast majority of their efforts on those 3 things: food safety, the guest experience and sales building. 
Of course, we continue to hire at the restaurant level to support our new restaurants and to ensure every restaurant is fully staffed and ready to delight our customers when they visit. As a percentage of sales, G&A expenses increased 120 basis points to 7.1% of sales, due entirely to sales deleverage. Underlying G&A for the next 2 quarters will remain at about this level, but the third quarter will include the incremental cost of the All Managers' Conference, which is expected to be around $10 million.
Our pretax income was $41.7 million, and our tax rate during the quarter was 38.6%. For the full year 2016, we also estimate our effective tax rate will be about 38.6% compared to 38.2% in 2015, so the higher tax rate is a result of higher state taxes.
During the second quarter and through yesterday, we repurchased $170 million of CMG shares at an average price of $438. We generated cash from operations of $180 million during the quarter, and we continue to maintain more than $600 million in cash and investments. As we work to restore customer trust and restore our earnings capability, we still have the ability to fund our growth and buy back our stock opportunistically. As of today, we have $123 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.
These are challenging times, the most challenging we've ever faced. Our company is committed to restoring customer trust, recovering customer visits and restoring our economic model to its full potential, which we believe will position us to add significant shareholder value for a very long time.
Thank you for your time today, and we'll be happy to open the lines for the questions you may have."

The program has only been around for less than 3 weeks and the first week at a holiday weekend, which we saw some pretty choppy enrollment during that time with the 4th of July being closed and the buildup to the 4th of July, which is it's not a regular transaction or sales builder for us. Since then, we've seen a very regular engagement. We've seen a very regular ramp-up of people that are participating in the program. We have significant -- every single day, we have over 100,000 people that are added to the program. The majority of them are registered in the program. And we've seen significant repeat visits. We've seen like 28% of the people that are enrolled, they're engaged in Chiptopia, have come back a second time. So we're seeing exactly the results we had hoped that our already loyal customers who have reduced their visits after the results or after the events of last year are coming in more often. We're hopeful that will happen as we get into the end of this month. And by the way, there's an incentive for people to come back more often as the months close because each month accounts toward earning the big end-of-program awards, and so achieving a level in July is a starting point. Then, it starts over. Basically, now you need to achieve that same level in August and then September. So it's very, very early, and so we're optimistic that we got a 500 basis point impact in effectively less than 3 weeks. In terms of what's going forward after this, we're going to watch this very closely. We're going to learn from it. We're going to find out what works, what doesn't work both for our customers and for our teams in the restaurants. And we anticipate we will have another program. We just don't know yet whether it will be another temporary program, will it be a kind of permanent program, but it's very, very likely that we will have something to follow on when Chiptopia ends in -- at the end of September."

The first question was about the comparison. The comparison is not easier in July. In fact, if anything, the comparison is tougher in July, so we feel good about the 500 basis points of improvement so far. In terms of the average check, it's only down less than 3% in July. We had a gap even before July started, Joe, and that was -- a lot of that was due to lower group size. It's also due to the fact that we've had lot of promos throughout the last few months as we tried to earn customers back. With the less than 3% that we're seeing in July so far, right about half of that is due to the redemption of awards. That was part of the program. We were prepared to offer compelling incentives to get people signed up, and so all you have to do is come in, get a card. Don't even have to register yet, and you'll get free chips and guac. A lot of those have been redeemed already. The fact that there's a lot of redemption of burritos already means that our customers are marching through the levels. They're already earning Mild status. A bunch of them have earned Medium status. And believe it or not, within the first 12 or 13 days, we had thousands of people that ever -- that had earned the Hot status, which means they came 11 times already. And you can't come more than twice in a day, so you have to come basically 11 days. And people had already been part of the program within the first 12 or 13 days that we were open. So the redemption of awards, we totally expected that. The other thing we did on purpose, we had a pretty low threshold where if you came in and spent $6, which basically means come in and get a burrito, you'll be part of the program. Again, Joe, our objective was to get as many visits as possible, the idea there being once we get them in the restaurants, if we delight them with a terrific experience, we have a shot at keeping them. And so we didn't want to set a high threshold, and so that has contributed to folks participating without all the add-ons, without the drinks and things like that. So the average check, we were ready for that. And we think gaining the customer visit is most important, and we'll work on the average check later. And then in terms of technology, I don't know if Curt is on the phone. I think the question, Joe, was have we learned something about technology and do we have to make significant investments in technology going forward with our customers."

No customers got sick, and yet, that turned into a news story. So it's been frustrating that there have been things beyond our control, where things have worked perfectly well, and we followed all our protocols.

So that's one. And then the second question I had was for Jack about margins. I'm trying to reconcile what we're seeing in your margin structure now versus historically, which is to say I think you suggested that the current run rate, roughly $2 million AUV. Restaurant margins are kind of where they are in the mid-teens. If I go back to 2011 when your volumes were around $2 million, your restaurant margins were 26%. So I understand that there's been inflation, and you clearly have some food costs associated with it. But I'm just trying to understand where that -- if there's any way to bridge that roughly 1,000 basis point gap between what your margins have looked like at these volumes in the past and what you're guiding to now."

So during the time of the incident last fall, we didn't know the cause, and so we looked at every single ingredient that we were bringing into our restaurants and working with a number",571,"Sure. Well, Sara, I'll start with the food and the taste of the food. So during the time of the incident last fall, we didn't know the cause, and so we looked at every single ingredient that we were bringing into our restaurants and working with a number of food safety experts, tried to understand what the risk of those items were, of the individual items coming in. And I'll just give you an example that I think illustrates sort of how things happen. So take bell peppers for instance. So our -- one of our experts said that it would be helpful if we could test the bell peppers before you bring them into the -- before we bring them into the restaurant. Well, the way to test them though is to slice them up in a central kitchen and then wash them, test them and then package them. That turned out to degrade the flavor. It does not taste as good as when our crews would expertly chop using a cutting board and a knife right in there in front of the customer and then sauteing. So -- but in order to make sure that we had the highest food safety, we went right to the central kitchen. And we did this with a couple of other items also. And I fear that we probably did negatively impact the flavor, and I think maybe some customers noticed that also. We have reversed that though with bell peppers and other items because we have developed with our in-house food safety expert, Jim Marsden, a number of interventions that we've put in place from the farm all the way through the distribution system and into the restaurants. And so with peppers, for instance, we now have our crews blanch the peppers in boiling water, which would completely eliminate any pathogen that might be on the surface because blanching doesn't actually cook the pepper because it's for such a short period of time, but it's plenty of time to kill any pathogen that may be on the surface. Our crew then goes with the old process of with a knife and a cutting board chopping right in front of the customer and then sauteing as usual. We did the same thing with lettuce. We've put a number of interventions in place, so we brought chopping lettuce back into the restaurant. And so we've returned, I think, our food to taste levels that were where we were before the crisis. But we're going beyond that. We're going beyond that in the elimination of preservatives and dough conditioners in our tortilla. If you look at the ingredients at Chipotle overall, it's a really, really clean ingredient list. And what do I mean by that? It doesn't have the kinds of things that are very hard to pronounce, preservatives and fillers and artificial flavors and artificial colors, all these kinds of things. And so once our -- in the fall, our tortillas are rid of the preservatives, we will be in an extraordinary position to tell people, our customers, about our very, very clean ingredient label and be proud to display them.

There's about 300 and -- call it, 350 basis points or so, 325, 350 basis points of what I would call nonrecurring expenses. 200 of that is in our marketing and promo. We're intentionally overspending on that line item, and it's way above historical norms. There's another probably 125, 150 basis points or so of inefficiencies. We're wasting a lot of food. We're not very efficient with labor, and part of it is because we are taking on a lot of new procedures, and that's been inefficient. We're being inefficient in terms of dealing with the promotions, and we're tending to overstaff rather than understaff. So that's in that 325 to 350 basis points. Food cost, I believe, back then was probably in the 31% range or so, maybe even below that. There was a time when our food cost was in the 30% range. And so without the details in front of me, I'm guessing that was probably 300 basis points or so difference in food cost. And what's happened there is we just haven't raised prices very much over the year. Our model a year ago could handle a 34% food cost. With the deleveraging effects and all the inefficiencies, the 34% food cost is a lot more painful today. We also have labor inflation that had crept in since then, and I'm just guessing that's probably at least another 200 to 300 basis points. The labor inflation, especially in the last year, has been significant. We had -- intend to do a pass on the wage rates that we were seeing because of local pressures because of raises in minimum wages, some of them very significant in $10, $12, $13, and we haven't really raised -- right, we haven't passed on the cost of those higher wages. So there's probably a couple hundred basis points there. We do have recurring food safety costs that you heard me talk about. We talked about that being in the maybe 200 basis point range. I think it's going to better than that. I would say that's probably going to end up in the 100 to 150 basis points. Right now we've got about 150 in there. And so that's the only thing that's really, what I said, is an absolute permanent. So if you add all these things up together, you're probably in that 1,000, 1,100 basis points or so. So those are the items. We're very aware of the items. We believe the most important thing we can do. We lost 800 basis points because of deleverage. That's why most of our focus this year, of course, food safety first. Now secondly is to recover our customers. We're doing that through offers, through Chiptopia, through branding. And then our focus, as Monty mentioned, is making sure that our customers have a wonderful experience when they come back because if we get our sales back, we get 800 basis points of margin. These other items, though, we think we can chip away at these other items as well, but we don't want to go after them aggressively until we've recovered as many or all of our customers. And once we've done that, then we know that we can make a lot of progress on these other margin items as well."

Our sales recovery that began midway through the first quarter continued at a modest pace in the second quarter, and we saw a return to profitability along with the opening of 58 new restaurants.
During the second quarter, we generated total revenue of $998 million. Our sales comp improved by 6% from the first quarter to a negative 23.6% for the quarter. As a result of promotional activities, we are seeing slightly better improvements in comparable traffic, with customer traffic down 20% for the quarter. While we would like to see a sales recovery occurring more quickly, we're optimistic that our Chiptopia Summer Rewards program, which launched on July 1, will encourage more guests to visit our restaurants and that this will help lead to a sustained higher sales recovery.
Though the program is just a few weeks old, we're already seeing approximately 30% of all transactions participating in Chiptopia. We have seen further improvement in both comparable restaurant sales and transactions, with comp sales down about 21% in July and traffic improving so that it is now down to a negative mid-teens for July so far.
Diluted earnings per share was $0.87 for the quarter, down from $4.45 earned in the second quarter of last year. While our unit economic model has been significantly affected by the sales hit, it continues to fully fund our current level of new restaurant growth.
Last week, Chipotle celebrated its 23rd anniversary. Throughout our history, we've been working hard to change the way people think about and eat fast food. And as we have grown into a national brand, we have cultivated and been supported by a very loyal customer base. As customers have fallen in love with Chipotle, they have also placed an extraordinary level of trust in us and have come to know that we will do the right thing when it comes to our food, our employees and our approach to running our business. 
Through the food safety events we faced last year, we lost some of that trust. Our customers have come to expect a lot from us to prepare, cook and serve fresh, delicious food while pushing the envelope to encourage farming and ranching practices that respect animals and the environment and the people who raise the ingredients we use. We're committed to exceeding our customers' expectations and restoring their confidence that we will deliver upon our promises.
While there are no quick solutions to restoring trust and bringing our sales back to previous levels, we're focused on a number of activities, which will continue to emphasize driving traffic in the near term and increasing customer frequency. We will also focus on longer-term brand messaging and on advancing our Food with Integrity efforts, which have been key to building trust and loyalty with customers over the years. But the best thing that we can do in the near term is to encourage customers to come back into our restaurants and to ensure that our restaurant teams are delivering an extraordinary dining experience on each and every customer visit.
In the first half of the year, we have invested more heavily than ever in marketing and promotional activity, and those investments are beginning to pay off. Since the CDC's investigation in Chipotle concluded in February, we have done a number of things: First, we launched our largest ever mobile offer into our largest ever direct mail program; second, we introduced a new menu item, chorizo, and we expect to have it in all of our restaurants by the end of the year; third, we created our first ever customer rewards program, Chiptopia; and fourth, we launched a new animated short film in an effort to help customers appreciate what is unique about Chipotle. Collectively, these efforts, along with excellent operations, are bringing customers back into our restaurants, and our teams are working hard to provide an extraordinary experience in all of our restaurants every day.
The introduction of a new menu item such as chorizo is unusual for us. As you know, we have always maintained a very focused menu and rarely changed it. Instead, we focused on doing just a few things in our restaurants so that we can do them better than anybody else. But we have never ruled out additions or changes to the menu, and chorizo is one of the few changes that we have made to the menu in 23 years. Our chorizo is made with a blend of Responsibly Raised pork and chicken seasoned with paprika, toasted cumin and Chipotle peppers. We sear the chorizo in our restaurants to give it a perfect char, and we believe it's a great addition to our menu. It gives customers another option and one that has been well received, accounting for approximately 6% to 7% of entrée sales in the restaurants where it's available.
During the quarter, we also resumed serving locally grown produce in all of our restaurants. Typically, our local program for produce runs this summer and early fall months, during the time that makes up the local growing season for much of the country. As we look to establish Chipotle as a leader in food safety, it's also important to us that we remain true to our commitment to serving Food with Integrity, including locally grown produce. 
Through a partnership with PrimusLabs funded by Chipotle, we are working with local growers to make certain that they can achieve our high standards for food safety, and we're auditing any farms that we work with to be sure they are compliant with all of our rigorous safety standards. 
Initially, as we layer in new local produce suppliers that have met our new food safety standards, our local produce program will have fewer farm partners than it did in the past year. But as we scale the program in the coming years, we'll have more local farms participated in the program than ever before.
We're also working hard to achieve our goal of eliminating the very last artificial additives from our tortillas. Tortillas are the only food item on Chipotle's menu that contain any additives, which include a minimal number of preservatives and dough conditioners. While we have made significant strides in reducing the number of additives in our tortillas today, the goal is to achieve a simple recipe with only a few ingredients, much like tortillas made in a more traditional way that includes wheat flour, vegetable oil, water, salt and starter for the flour tortillas.
Finally, I'd like to address recent headlines around surrounding Mark Crumpacker, our Chief Creative and Development Officer. We were surprised to learn of these personal issues and placed Mark on a leave of absence. We believe this will allow us to remain focused on our work and our efforts to serve great tasting food to provide an extraordinary restaurant experience and to continue winning back our customers.
One of the cornerstones of our people culture is to build top-performing teams. Mark certainly had accomplished that in our development and marketing teams, and we have the utmost confidence in those teams and the people who lead them. And we know that they will do an excellent job running those departments. In Mark's absence, we have asked Mark Shambura, our Director of Brand Marketing, to lead our marketing team; and Carolyn Anderson, Executive Director of Facilities, Construction and Design, to lead our development efforts. And we have asked Curt Garner, who joined us as CIO late last year, to lead our e-commerce team.
Mark Shambura joined our marketing team in 2013, but his experience with Chipotle goes back further than that. Mark led our team at CAA Marketing from 2009 to 2011, working on some of the first innovative branded content programs, including the animated short, Back to the Start, and also worked on the development of our Cultivate food, music and ideas festivals. In his role as Brand Director of Marketing, Mark already has been overseeing several critical marketing functions, including all brand planning; content programs; digital, which includes web, mobile and social; and promotions and events.
Carolyn Anderson began working with Chipotle 20 years ago as an outside vendor in charge of facilities management. She joined us as National Facilities Manager in 2005 and was promoted to Facilities Director in 2008, where she was able to streamline our reinvest efforts to create programs to empower our restaurant managers to be better stewards of their restaurants, leading to substantially lower maintenance and repair costs. Carolyn's leadership and the exceptional work she and her team were doing led to her promotion to Director of Facilities and Construction in 2012 and again, in 2014, to a promotion to Executive Director of Facilities, Construction and Design. She is proven in building top-performing teams that have paved the way to redefine development's roles and responsibilities, and she has been critical to developing and executing our strategy surrounding sustainability, food safety and increasing our cash-on-cash returns for new restaurants.
Curt Garner has been involved with our e-commerce team since he came onboard last November and has been extremely valuable as a member of the management team over just the past 9 months. Curt oversees all of our information technology infrastructure and its impact on future sales channels, so shifting our entire pipeline out of store sales projects to Curt's guidance has been very natural fit. We are confident in the current strategic direction of these teams and have full faith and confidence in Mark, Carolyn and Curt's abilities to deliver great results.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

As we work to bring our customers back to our restaurants and to reinforce Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety, it's never been more important to have top-performing teams in our restaurants and among our field leadership. It's",1107,"Thank you, Steve. As we work to bring our customers back to our restaurants and to reinforce Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety, it's never been more important to have top-performing teams in our restaurants and among our field leadership. It's the strength of our people culture and our teams that has allowed us to quickly implement many new programs in food safety as well as marketing.
To be sure that our restaurant teams are aligned around our current priorities and that their efforts are directed at the right things, we have realigned some of the success measures for restaurant managers and teams, and we're tying incentives increasingly to our most urgent priorities of having an exceptional guest experience as well as effective local store marketing. 
We've also changed the prerequisites of becoming a Restaurateur, placing greater emphasis on measuring the guest experience, business fundamentals and food safety compliance. Historically, these measures have always been important, but we are emphasizing them even more and providing additional tools and training to be sure our restaurants are exceptional in achieving these high standards. We've also changed how we calculate our manager bonuses to reward excellence in these metrics, with the greatest emphasis on food safety.
This renewed focus on an excellent guest experience, local store marketing, food safety and business fundamentals will be the means by which restaurant managers are eligible to be interviewed for Restaurateur. Once they meet these green fees, as we call them, they're interviewed, as before, to determine if they have a team of all top-performers empowered to achieve high standards. 
Historically, these fundamentals were always important to becoming a Restaurateur, but our audits for them have become more specific and rigorous and our expectations for their achievement more stringent. The added focus we applied to that part of the process is already paying off in terms of generating sound business fundamentals in our restaurant and the improved food safety audits that we're seeing.
During the quarter, we made significant progress completing the implementation of an industry-leading traceability system, which will be fully implemented in all of our restaurants by the end of this month. Already, the traceability program has been rolled out in more than 1,900 restaurants. This has been a significant undertaking to put in place, and we're very pleased to be so close to completion of this industry-leading food safety enhancement.
Prior to this year, we had traceability in place between our suppliers and our distribution centers. And from the distribution centers, we could trace ingredients to our restaurants using ordering and distribution data. But the significance of this state-of-the-art traceability system is that we will have the ability to know exactly which supplier we got any particular food item from as well as the lot number of all produce, meats, sofritas, beans, salsas, dairy and tortillas, that are received in our restaurant. 
The system uses barcodes on every package to allow to be traced from the supplier of the restaurant the same way that overnight delivery services trace package shipments all over the world. This system is another significant way that Chipotle is becoming an industry leader in food safety because it gives us the ability to quickly investigate food quality issues in our supply chain or immediately remove food from our supply chain that we may find not up to our high standards.
This September, we will host our biannual All Managers' Conference. This year's conference will include restaurant managers, field leaders, operations leadership and select individuals from support departments. The content for this year's conference will be focused on helping our restaurant teams to create an excellent guest experience and teach them to more effectively market their individual restaurants. This conference is an excellent forum to reinvigorate our restaurant teams and ensure that they're totally focused on the things that will most powerfully allow Chipotle to achieve its goals.
On the development front, our openings continue to be on pace with our guidance for 2016. We have opened 116 restaurants so far this year, which is about half of our total planned openings of 220 to 235. We are pleased that we have a strong pipeline of real estate locations under consideration. But as I explained last quarter, we will continue to be judicious in evaluating those locations in light of the current operating environment and with an eye towards delivering strong returns.
We've refocused our real estate team on assessing future openings with a more conservative lens that takes into account our current economic model, particularly given recent changes to our average unit volumes. We've also temporarily shifted some of our markets into our developing markets category in order to direct our new store investments towards markets with the strongest track record of opening sales. This may slightly temper the number of openings in these markets in the near term as we look to rebuild our sales momentum and will help us ensure strong new store productivity.
The impact from this is primarily on where we open new stores with a minimal impact on the total opening. Because the real estate pipeline is inherently long term in nature, some of our efforts to reprioritize our market mix will not be realized until late in 2017. Of course, we will update you in the coming months as to how many restaurants we do expect to open in 2017.
We're also working to strengthen the returns in our new restaurants by optimizing our average investment cost. This year, we will realize some cost savings through a collaborative effort between our design and procurement functions. In addition, our real estate team has been able to find an increasing number of great sites with strong landlord work letters, providing for landlords to invest more in our build-out costs. The benefit of these efforts translate to an average investment cost that is shaping up to be around $800,000 for 2016 in spite of increased market pressures on materials and labor.
The strength of our teams continues to be our key advantage. Top-performing teams allow us to take on new tasks more rapidly than others might be able to and to create the great restaurant experiences that drive more traffic to our restaurants and delight our customers. We are confident that our teams will lead our recovery from this difficult time in our history such that we will emerge a stronger brand as a result of these challenging times and allow us to provide excellent value to our shareholders as well the many additional stakeholders who benefit from our successful achievements of our vision.
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

Throughout the quarter, we continue to heighten our marketing initiatives to drive sales and increase positive perceptions of our brand. Through quantitative and qualitative research we've undertaken regarding purchasing habit, we have a better understanding of our customers, their motivations and visitation patterns than we ever have before. We continue to increase promotional efforts more than we generally would because we think it's critical to reestablish contact and frequency among our guests so that they can recall how much they enjoy Chipotle.
In the last few months, we executed an integrator approach, which included a number of different marketing activities. We launched our largest ever mobile and direct mail promotions. We introduced chorizo as a new menu item and we will have in all of our restaurants before the end of the year. We developed and launched our first ever customer rewards program, Chiptopia, and will be studying the initial 3-month program to help us develop more lasting rewards program. We maintained a larger ongoing advertising presence than usual, and we launched a new animated short firm, A Love Story, to support Chiptopia, which was aimed at reminding and inspiring our fans and attracting new customers. It has already been viewed in totality more than 17 million times with support from PR, paid digital and social media buy along with placement on more than 10,000 movie screens. These marketing activities are an important part of our strategy to help drive our sales recovery and we are seeing encouraging results in the consumer research.
In a June 2 survey by YouGov, for example, consumer perceptions of Chipotle turned positive for the first time since November. While sentiment is not back to where it was prior to these issues, it shows movement in the right direction. 
This improving sentiment is also supported by our own ongoing brand health tracking study, which shows consistent upward trends since mid-January's all-time lows. During the second quarter, we saw modest improvements in consideration and admiration across key customer segments. And with millennials, 18 to 34, a key customer group for us, we continue to see that they have the most favorable opinion of Chipotle.
During the first quarter, new customer acquisition was down from the previous quarter, but we saw improvement in this area in the second quarter and a trend in new customer acquisition, which we can directly attribute to our aggressive promotional offers. While we still have work to do to increase key brand metrics and traffic volumes, we have a very full slate of marketing programs planned for the remainder of the year that we believe will continue to support our recovery.
The first phase of our recovery plan, which began in February and which we are just coming out of, focused on winning back our customers. Based on the data we have, we believe that a majority of our most loyal customers have returned, but many of them are not coming as frequently as they used to.
The second phase of our recovery plan, which we are in the early stages of now, continues our win-back strategy that adds a focus on increasing frequency and attracting new customers. Programs such as Chiptopia Summer Rewards and Love Story are aimed at helping us achieve these objectives.
Just 3 weeks after launching the Chiptopia program, we have more than 3.6 million participants and are seeing approximately 30% of all transactions participating in Chiptopia. This is a significant start to the program, and we anticipate our participant levels to continue to increase over the coming weeks. Most importantly, we are seeing growth in the number of guests that are visiting Chipotle at a run rate of more than 24 visits per year, our most frequent customer tier. These increased visits have helped the top line and have grown our traffic comp by about 5 points from June. It's still very early to draw conclusions on the long-term sustainability of these trends, but every incremental visit from a customer provides an opportunity for us to further restore trust.
All of these programs are helping to change the conversation about Chipotle. Q2 social sentiment is at 93% of the level it was precrisis, and the response to our Love Story film has been extremely well received. 80% of consumer conversation is positive. Overall, our marketing awareness is at its highest since Q1 2015.
Lastly, according to a survey by Ace Metrix, A Love Story is the highest scoring QSR ad they've ever tested, delivering strong results on breakthrough, which means high attention and likability relevant to other measures as well as change, meaning viewers feel strongly that the brand is moving in a new direction. The survey indicates that the film delivered strongly not only with our brand loyalists but also with lapsed customers and brand considerers.
For the remainder of the year, our marketing programs will continue at a robust pace. Among the programs you can expect to see in the coming months are: ongoing emphasis on advertising and digital content to highlight our commitment to using high-quality ingredients and preparing food using classic cooking techniques just as we have always done without cutting corners and new content demonstrating how Chipotle has become a leader in food safety, targeted promotions aimed at inviting groups like students and families; the national rollout of chorizo by the end of the year; our annual Boorito Halloween promotion, which will have a charitable component with our Cultivate Foundation; a holiday promotion and a gift card incentive program; continued improvements to our mobile and e-commerce program; and continued emphasis on restaurant level marketing, which allows our restaurant managers to delight customers on a very local and individual basis. We are encouraged by the progress we are making to improve sentiment about our brand and drive traffic to our restaurants. While we recognize that there's a lot more work to be done to restore confidence, we believe that we have the right programs and the right teams in place to improve in these areas.
I will now turn the call over to Jack."
26446,367077111,1011058,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark.

The sales comp in the second quarter showed modest improvement from the trends we reported in April when we reported that comps were running in the negative 26% range. We'd like to see the sales recovery happen more quickly, but we are as committed as ever to do all we can to reengage with our customers to restore their trust in Chipotle and reestablish customer frequency.
The first half of 2016 has been focused on establishing and executing industry leading food safety practices, along with aggressive offers to invite our customers to return to Chipotle. As we begin the second half of 2016, we are optimistic about engaging our customers at a deeper level, going beyond basic broad-based free food offers with things like Chiptopia, with branding efforts that are uniquely Chipotle such as the Love Story video, rolling out chorizo and continuing to show leadership in food quality by removing the few remaining artificial ingredients from our food.
Though it's very early, we're optimistic about the customer engagement with Chiptopia so far. Over 3.6 million actual or digital cards have been issued, and as Steve mentioned, nearly 30% of all transactions are engaged in Chiptopia. Sales comps for the past 2 weeks have improved to down 20% to 21%, in that range, but importantly, transactions have improved from down 20% in June to down 15% during the first half of July, an improvement of 500 basis points.
Our main objective with Chiptopia is to reward and incentivize our loyal customers who have decreased their frequency since late last year and to restore their visit frequency back to their previous levels. Our research has shown that most of our loyal customers have returned to Chipotle but not at the same frequency, so Chiptopia is targeted at those customers. And the early frequency results are very encouraging. In fact, since Chiptopia began July 1, we've seen a 90% increase in the number of customers who visit 2.5 times or more each week compared to June. We've seen a 200% increase in the number of customers coming in from 2 times to 2.5 times per week compared to June. And we've seen a 140% increase in the number of customers who visit between 1 and 2 times each week compared to June. So we're off to a great start with Chiptopia so far. 
We'll continue to engage and encourage our customers to visit often during the entire 3-month program. And when our restaurant teams delight them with delicious food and great service, we have a great shot in maintaining or even improving these reestablished higher frequency levels. 
The average check has declined slightly during July by nearly 3% versus June as many customers have already redeemed their free chips and guac for registering in Chiptopia or they've redeemed their free burritos for earning frequency status. Some customers are spending a little less on extras. There's only a $6 minimum purchase price in Chiptopia, and we're also seeing a slightly smaller group size. One important note on the accounting for Chiptopia, although the program is intended to last for 3 months, ending September 30, there will be rewards available to be redeemed in the fourth quarter or beyond. Therefore, at the end of the third quarter, GAAP accounting requires that we defer a portion of the revenue from the third quarter into the fourth quarter or later when the awards are ultimately redeemed or the awards expire. It's not possible to project what that deferral might look like right now, but we'll fully explain the impact during our third quarter earnings call.
Our entire company is eager to see the sales recover happen even faster in all restaurants and all markets throughout the country. Many of you on the call today probably feel the same way. While we'd certainly like to be further along, there are signs that the recovery is well on its way and continues to march along.
The company-wide July sales comp of down approximately 20%, along with the July TC comp of down about 15%, has come a long way from the low point in January when sales were down 36% and TCs were down 34%. July so far represents a recovery versus the low point in January of 42% on lost sales, meaning that we recovered 42% of the lost sales from January. And we've recovered 53% of the transactions that we lost in January.
But most of our market across country are further along than this in their recovery. For example, in Middle America, the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and the Southwest, which combined account for nearly 2/3 of our comp restaurants, the comp sales were down about 18%, and the comp TCs are down 13% in July. This represents a recovery rate versus January of 46% on sales and nearly 60% on TCs. Our best market in the country is in Ohio, where comp sales are down just 12% and TCs are down just 6% in July. We still have a ways to go, but we're making progress.
Unfortunately, the recovery is not as far along in the Northeast and on the West Coast, where comp sales are still down around 26% and comp TCs are down around 21% in July. Of course, these are the areas closest to the events of last year, and so the recovery is just not as far along as it is in the rest of the country. In fact, sales recovery for the Northeast and the West Coast combined is only 35% and TC recovery is about 45% when comparing July to the January lows.
We returned to profitability during the quarter with EPS at $0.87 per share. Of course, fully restoring our earnings power is highly dependent on the pace and the magnitude of our sales recovery, which remains a top priority for us.
Running through the P&L for the quarter. We reported $998 million in sales, a decrease of 17% versus the second quarter of 2015. We generated restaurant level operating margin of 15.5% in the quarter, which is down from the second quarter of 2015 but up sequentially on the first quarter of 2016. During the second quarter, sales deleverage contributed about 800 basis points of pressure compared with Q2 of 2015.
Food costs were 34.2% in the quarter, up 110 basis points from prior year. Underlying inflation was minimal during the quarter as increased supplier costs for our new preparation of tomatoes, lettuce and steak along with food waste, more than offset last year's small increased menu prices and lower stock pricing for paper and beef. Food waste added about 70 basis points as we're still inefficient with some of the new procedures, we're still navigating through ordering and prepping the right amount of food at the right time, especially surrounding promotions. 
Looking at the rest of this year, we anticipate food costs will remain at right about the same level, as inefficiencies we achieve are likely to be offset by higher avocado pricing in Q3.
Labor expenses during the quarter were 27.7% of sales compared to 22.6% during the second quarter of 2015. Nearly all of this drop or about 450 basis points is due to sales deleverage. Remaining increase is due to labor inflation offset by better labor scheduling this year versus Q2 of last year. In Q2 of last year, we had a system recording issue, which led to elevated labor scheduling. Our underlying labor inflation is running at about 6%, while hourly wage inflation is closer to 9%.
Occupancy costs were 7.2% of sales, higher as a percent of sales by 180 basis points, all of it related to sales deleverage. Other operating costs were 15.2%, up from 10.9% during the second quarter of 2015 driven by deleverage and higher marketing and promo activities. Marketing costs during the quarter were 2.7% of sales, and promo activity added 1.6% of sales for a total of 4.3% combined compared to 2.3% last year. Our investment in marketing and promo will remain at elevated levels as we continue to aggressively engage with our customers to regain their trust and loyalty.
G&A expenses were $70.8 million in the quarter, which is virtually identical to last year's expenses of $70.2 million. A few months ago, we made the decision to temporarily hold off on hiring any new G&A headcount in an effort to manage our support cost during these challenging times. Instead, we narrowed the focus of all of our support teams to only those efforts which will lead to safer food, a better restaurant experience for our guests or increased sales. Our teams have stepped up to the challenge and are supporting a greater number of restaurants without adding resources and are focusing the vast majority of their efforts on those 3 things: food safety, the guest experience and sales building. 
Of course, we continue to hire at the restaurant level to support our new restaurants and to ensure every restaurant is fully staffed and ready to delight our customers when they visit. As a percentage of sales, G&A expenses increased 120 basis points to 7.1% of sales, due entirely to sales deleverage. Underlying G&A for the next 2 quarters will remain at about this level, but the third quarter will include the incremental cost of the All Managers' Conference, which is expected to be around $10 million.
Our pretax income was $41.7 million, and our tax rate during the quarter was 38.6%. For the full year 2016, we also estimate our effective tax rate will be about 38.6% compared to 38.2% in 2015, so the higher tax rate is a result of higher state taxes.
During the second quarter and through yesterday, we repurchased $170 million of CMG shares at an average price of $438. We generated cash from operations of $180 million during the quarter, and we continue to maintain more than $600 million in cash and investments. As we work to restore customer trust and restore our earnings capability, we still have the ability to fund our growth and buy back our stock opportunistically. As of today, we have $123 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.
These are challenging times, the most challenging we've ever faced. Our company is committed to restoring customer trust, recovering customer visits and restoring our economic model to its full potential, which we believe will position us to add significant shareholder value for a very long time.
Thank you for your time today, and we'll be happy to open the lines for the questions you may have."

Can you just comment on the reasoning behind why the strong debt isn't necessarily having a bigger impact on the recovery? And secondarily, what's the plan when summer is over regarding loyalty?

The program has only been around for less than 3 weeks and the first week at a holiday weekend, which we saw some pretty choppy enrollment during that time with the 4th of July being closed and the buildup to the 4th of July, which is it's not a regular transaction or sales builder for us. Since then, we've seen a very regular engagement. We've seen a very regular ramp-up of people that are participating in the program. We have significant -- every single day, we have over 100,000 people that are added to the program. The majority of them are registered in the program. And we've seen significant repeat visits. We've seen like 28% of the people that are enrolled, they're engaged in Chiptopia, have come back a second time. So we're seeing exactly the results we had hoped that our already loyal customers who have reduced their visits after the results or after the events of last year are coming in more often. We're hopeful that will happen as we get into the end of this month. And by the way, there's an incentive for people to come back more often as the months close because each month accounts toward earning the big end-of-program awards, and so achieving a level in July is a starting point. Then, it starts over. Basically, now you need to achieve that same level in August and then September. So it's very, very early, and so we're optimistic that we got a 500 basis point impact in effectively less than 3 weeks. In terms of what's going forward after this, we're going to watch this very closely. We're going to learn from it. We're going to find out what works, what doesn't work both for our customers and for our teams in the restaurants. And we anticipate we will have another program. We just don't know yet whether it will be another temporary program, will it be a kind of permanent program, but it's very, very likely that we will have something to follow on when Chiptopia ends in -- at the end of September."

The first question was about the comparison. The comparison is not easier in July. In fact, if anything, the comparison is tougher in July, so we feel good about the 500 basis points of improvement so far. In terms of the average check, it's only down less than 3% in July. We had a gap even before July started, Joe, and that was -- a lot of that was due to lower group size. It's also due to the fact that we've had lot of promos throughout the last few months as we tried to earn customers back. With the less than 3% that we're seeing in July so far, right about half of that is due to the redemption of awards. That was part of the program. We were prepared to offer compelling incentives to get people signed up, and so all you have to do is come in, get a card. Don't even have to register yet, and you'll get free chips and guac. A lot of those have been redeemed already. The fact that there's a lot of redemption of burritos already means that our customers are marching through the levels. They're already earning Mild status. A bunch of them have earned Medium status. And believe it or not, within the first 12 or 13 days, we had thousands of people that ever -- that had earned the Hot status, which means they came 11 times already. And you can't come more than twice in a day, so you have to come basically 11 days. And people had already been part of the program within the first 12 or 13 days that we were open. So the redemption of awards, we totally expected that. The other thing we did on purpose, we had a pretty low threshold where if you came in and spent $6, which basically means come in and get a burrito, you'll be part of the program. Again, Joe, our objective was to get as many visits as possible, the idea there being once we get them in the restaurants, if we delight them with a terrific experience, we have a shot at keeping them. And so we didn't want to set a high threshold, and so that has contributed to folks participating without all the add-ons, without the drinks and things like that. So the average check, we were ready for that. And we think gaining the customer visit is most important, and we'll work on the average check later. And then in terms of technology, I don't know if Curt is on the phone. I think the question, Joe, was have we learned something about technology and do we have to make significant investments in technology going forward with our customers."

And I'll just give you an example that I think illustrates sort of how things happen. So take bell peppers for instance. So our -- one of our experts said that it would be helpful if we could test the bell peppers before you bring them into the -- before we bring them into the restaurant. Well, the way to test them though is to slice them up in a central kitchen and then wash them, test them and then package them. That turned out to degrade the flavor. It does not taste as good as when our crews would expertly chop using a cutting board and a knife right in there in front of the customer and then sauteing. So -- but in order to make sure that we had the highest food safety, we went right to the central kitchen. And we did this with a couple of other items also. And I fear that we probably did negatively impact the flavor, and I think maybe some customers noticed that also. We have reversed that though with bell peppers and other items because we have developed with our in-house food safety expert, Jim Marsden, a number of interventions that we've put in place from the farm all the way through the distribution system and into the restaurants. And so with peppers, for instance, we now have our crews blanch the peppers in boiling water, which would completely eliminate any pathogen that might be on the surface because blanching doesn't actually cook the pepper because it's for such a short period of time, but it's plenty of time to kill any pathogen that may be on the surface. Our crew then goes with the old process of with a knife and a cutting board chopping right in front of the customer and then sauteing as usual. We did the same thing with lettuce. We've put a number of interventions in place, so we brought chopping lettuce back into the restaurant. And so we've returned, I think, our food to taste levels that were where we were before the crisis. But we're going beyond that. We're going beyond that in the elimination of preservatives and dough conditioners in our tortilla. If you look at the ingredients at Chipotle overall, it's a really, really clean ingredient list. And what do I mean by that? It doesn't have the kinds of things that are very hard to pronounce, preservatives and fillers and artificial flavors and artificial colors, all these kinds of things. And so once our -- in the fall, our tortillas are rid of the preservatives, we will be in an extraordinary position to tell people, our customers, about our very, very clean ingredient label and be proud to display them. And I think that's not something typical fast food could do. So again, we're not only bringing our -- the great taste that we had precrisis, but we're continuing to push Food with Integrity in ways that are going to set industry standards."

There's about 300 and -- call it, 350 basis points or so, 325, 350 ba",588,"Sara, on the margins, so if you look at our 15.5% today and what's different than it would have been a few years ago, listen, I don't have the details of 2011, but I do know the pieces. There's about 300 and -- call it, 350 basis points or so, 325, 350 basis points of what I would call nonrecurring expenses. 200 of that is in our marketing and promo. We're intentionally overspending on that line item, and it's way above historical norms. There's another probably 125, 150 basis points or so of inefficiencies. We're wasting a lot of food. We're not very efficient with labor, and part of it is because we are taking on a lot of new procedures, and that's been inefficient. We're being inefficient in terms of dealing with the promotions, and we're tending to overstaff rather than understaff. So that's in that 325 to 350 basis points. Food cost, I believe, back then was probably in the 31% range or so, maybe even below that. There was a time when our food cost was in the 30% range. And so without the details in front of me, I'm guessing that was probably 300 basis points or so difference in food cost. And what's happened there is we just haven't raised prices very much over the year. Our model a year ago could handle a 34% food cost. With the deleveraging effects and all the inefficiencies, the 34% food cost is a lot more painful today. We also have labor inflation that had crept in since then, and I'm just guessing that's probably at least another 200 to 300 basis points. The labor inflation, especially in the last year, has been significant. We had -- intend to do a pass on the wage rates that we were seeing because of local pressures because of raises in minimum wages, some of them very significant in $10, $12, $13, and we haven't really raised -- right, we haven't passed on the cost of those higher wages. So there's probably a couple hundred basis points there. We do have recurring food safety costs that you heard me talk about. We talked about that being in the maybe 200 basis point range. I think it's going to better than that. I would say that's probably going to end up in the 100 to 150 basis points. Right now we've got about 150 in there. And so that's the only thing that's really, what I said, is an absolute permanent. So if you add all these things up together, you're probably in that 1,000, 1,100 basis points or so. So those are the items. We're very aware of the items. We believe the most important thing we can do. We lost 800 basis points because of deleverage. That's why most of our focus this year, of course, food safety first. Now secondly is to recover our customers. We're doing that through offers, through Chiptopia, through branding. And then our focus, as Monty mentioned, is making sure that our customers have a wonderful experience when they come back because if we get our sales back, we get 800 basis points of margin. These other items, though, we think we can chip away at these other items as well, but we don't want to go after them aggressively until we've recovered as many or all of our customers. And once we've done that, then we know that we can make a lot of progress on these other margin items as well."

We are beginning to emerge from the most difficult year in our history, and I've seen many reasons to be optimistic that we are headed in the right direction to restore our business to a place our many sharehol",1360,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everybody. We are beginning to emerge from the most difficult year in our history, and I've seen many reasons to be optimistic that we are headed in the right direction to restore our business to a place our many shareholders will be proud of. But please note that while we are on the road to recovery, we're not satisfied, and we'll continue to work extremely hard to make the necessary adjustments necessary to restore our business and deliver results as quickly as possible. 
From early this year, we have recovered more than 16 points of sales comp and we've recovered 20 points of traffic comp, and we're making steady progress toward further recovery. During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $1.04 billion, down 15% from last year on a comparable restaurant sales decline of 21.9%. During the third quarter, we opened 55 new restaurants, bringing our total number of restaurants to 2,178. And we generated diluted earnings per share of $0.27, which includes a negative $0.29 impact related to asset impairment. 
Since our recovery began, we have seen a gradually improving outlook for sales and earnings and fully expect that those trends will continue. 2016 will be marked as a significant reinvestment year as we continue to work to make Chipotle a stronger company in the wake of last year's events. Looking forward to 2017 and based on current trends, we believe that we will produce diluted earnings of $10 per share on same-store sales growth in the high single digits for 2017. We believe that the full year of 2017, we can generate restaurant-level operating margins of 20% and save more than $100 million in capital and operating expenses combined. To achieve these [indiscernible] of results, we must be steadfast in executing our recovery plan, which remains the primary focus of everybody at Chipotle. Specifically, we're focused on delivering a safe and extraordinary guest experience in every restaurant, restoring trust and building sales, restoring our economic model and enhancing the guest experience through innovation. Monty, Mark and Jack will provide additional detail on some of these priority areas, but right now, I'd like to speak to the last point, which is enhancing the guest experience. 
Two important enhancements to the customer experience are menu innovation and digital ordering. We are actively exploring ways to enhance the guest experience by offering new additions to our menu. We believe that this is a good way to entice infrequent or lapsed customers to return as well as a way to increase sales. Any time we consider new menu items, it's important to us that they remain consistent with our food culture, both in terms of the ingredients we use and how the new items are prepared. A great example of this is chorizo, which we launched nationwide earlier this month. Chorizo now accounts for roughly 7% of our sales around the country. Feedback from customers has been extremely positive, and we plan to ramp up our advertising in the fourth quarter to support chorizo by encouraging our customers to come in and try it. We're also currently testing 2 different desserts, and we hope to select 1 to offer in the near future. We believe that there's an opportunity to excite current customers and to attract new customers through thoughtful menu development, and we're exploring these options. 
We're also moving aggressively to make digital ordering more appealing to our customers and more efficient for our restaurants. Nearly all of our restaurants have a second make line in the back of the restaurant where we have fulfilled digital, fax and catering orders. By optimizing the use and design of these second make lines, we envision the time when digital ordering could account for a much larger percentage of sales than the 6% it represents today. Maximizing our digital sales requires changes both to the second make line itself and to the ways by which our customers place digital orders. Our original second make line resembles the service line our customers see in the front of the house, though scaled down and it takes up less space. 
The new line is a much more ergonomic and efficient design configured such that less labor will be required to produce higher sales volumes and thus sell more quickly. The new line incorporates an advanced queuing system that takes advantage of a heads-up visual display, which allows our crews to assemble orders without distraction. The benefits of these new lines will be enormous, including faster, more efficient assembly of orders, reduced errors and more consistent portion sizes for our customers, all of which we believe will help us drive increased sales volumes. After some additional testing is complete, we will begin to selectively add these new digitally enhanced lines -- digitally enabled lines to some of our highest-volume markets where it can best enhance our out-of-store ordering experience. It's important to note, however, that all of our original second make lines are still able to take advantage of enhanced digital ordering options even though they don't have the advantaged [ph] indicating system of the digitally enabled lines.
Our crews in these restaurants will work from paper tickets until their restaurants are upgraded with the new system. To stimulate additional use of these second lines, we're introducing a new mobile optimized ordering site that provides an alternative to our iOS and Android ordering apps. Mark will talk more about this new ordering option later in the call, but the new site makes ordering and paying for digital orders easier than ever. In addition to our new ordering site, we are testing a tablet-based ordering option, which allows customers to avoid the line and order in restaurant on available tablets and get their order made from the second decline in the back of the house. This tablet-based ordering system will initially be tested in a series of restaurants that are equipped with the new make line. When the full system is realized, the second make line has the potential to deliver as much as 50% of the sales from some locations, including digital orders from all sources, including catering and delivery services. 
Finally, we fully impaired the assets related to ShopHouse, which totaled approximately $14.5 million on a pre-taxes basis. We opened the first ShopHouse in 2011 and currently operate 15 ShopHouse restaurants in 3 separate markets. ShopHouse is managed by a small independent team, which was tasked with creating a compelling brand, which could develop into a compelling growth strategy and enhance long-term shareholder value. We're proud of the ShopHouse team, the delicious food they've created and the excellent customer service they've delivered. But after operating in 3 distinct markets and opening in a variety of trade areas, ShopHouse simply has not demonstrated the ability to support an attractive unit economic model. As a result, we have decided not to invest further in developing or growing the ShopHouse brand and will pursue strategic alternatives. 
Although the exotic ShopHouse cuisine was not able to attract sufficient customer loyalty and visit frequency to make it a viable growth strategy for us, we continue to believe that our approach to food, people and unit economics with the right cuisine, with the right concept can lead to a compelling growth strategy. And we are optimistic that our other growth seeds, serving pizza and soon burgers, both of which have broad customer appeal, can become further growth strategies for us. While this was not an easy decision, we trust in our overall growth seed approach where we can innovate and develop new concepts with a relatively small capital investment and little or no distraction to the Chipotle business. And we'll only invest additional resources, both time and money, into growth seeds that show the potential to become meaningful growth vehicle and a compelling way to enhance shareholder value. 
We continue to believe that we have an extraordinary potential and are fully confident in our ability to achieve it. Monty, Mark and Jack will talk in greater detail about our plans to realize our potential and build greater shareholder value.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

Achieving a full recovery means having all of our restaurants at their very best in terms of serving delicious, safe food and providing an excellent restaurant experience while continuing to grow sales. As we move forward with our recove",1520,"Thank you, Steve. Achieving a full recovery means having all of our restaurants at their very best in terms of serving delicious, safe food and providing an excellent restaurant experience while continuing to grow sales. As we move forward with our recovery plan, the guest experience remains our greatest area of focus. Providing an excellent guest experience starts with serving food that's always safe and delicious. While many of our enhanced food safety efforts occur outside the restaurants in the supply and distribution network and with enhanced technology, we also rely on strong restaurant teams and 2 leaders to carry out additional element to our food safety program in the restaurant. 
Ensuring that we execute these procedures in our restaurants has been a top priority. To accomplish this, we have significantly expanded training, food safety inspections and third-party and internal audits in our restaurants. These audits help us identify opportunities for improvement and ensure that all the programs we have put in place are being executed consistently and properly. To further these efforts and to continuously improve food safety in our restaurants and supply chain, we have also established an independent food safety advisory council made up of some of the country's foremost experts in food safety and food microbiology. This advisory council, alongside Dr. Jim Marsden, our Executive Director of Food Safety, is charged with continuously reviewing our food safety programs and looking for opportunities to strengthen them even more.
This quarter, we shared some key points about our enhanced food safety program with our customers through a PR campaign and highlighted 8 key areas of advancements that we made. The campaign included full-page ads in newspapers as well as online and social media advertising in addition to print and video materials of Steve describing why our food safety changes are so effective. The campaign was very well received and was effective in communicating the comprehensive steps we've taken. Details surrounding each of these programs continue to be available for you to see on our website. 
At the same time, we are keenly aware that safe food alone will not bring people into our restaurants. Instead, they come for delicious food and an excellent guest experience. This is why our restaurant teams are focused on delivering great-tasting food and an excellent customer service and clean, friendly restaurants. This starts with our commitment to serving the best-tasting food we can, food that is made with ingredients that are raised with respect for the environment, animals and the people who produce them. And we continue to look for ways to improve the quality of the food we serve, including our quest for better tortillas made with no artificial additives or preservatives, a promise we made last year and are close to fulfilling. 
So as we work to rebuild our company and strengthen our brand, it is critical that our entire organization is focused on those things that will most powerfully delight our guests and speed our recovery. For this reason, we use this year's All Managers' Conference as a time to articulate to our field leaders and managers 3 areas of focus that are in their control: first, providing an excellent guest experience; second, marketing their individual restaurants; and third, restoring and protecting our unit economic model. Our officer team asked our managers to first train the fundamentals of excellent operations so that they could then proceed on the path to restaurateur. 
Our relentless focus on the most important things and implementing them exceptionally well is what it always makes Chipotle great; and we know that to ensure our sales recover, we have to be better than ever to win our customers back. Also, great throughput is a key part of the guest experience at Chipotle and one of our key competitive advantages. To do it well requires constant training and focus. During the last year where we made implementation of our new food safety program the highest priority, some of our restaurant teams have lost some of the throughput skills that they had developed before the crisis. And with high turnover at the crew level, it is even more important that we continue to emphasize and train the skills needed to deliver fast throughput, including the 4 pillars of throughput.  Of course, a primary reason our throughput slowed was that our sales slowed after the crisis, but throughput can -- still can be and will be faster as our restaurant teams commit to drive this critical aspect of an excellent guest experience. Additionally, we are emphasizing the proper use of the second make line with our field teams to enable the teams on the front line to take great care of the guest in front of them. This will be even more important as we layer in some of the technology that Steve spoke about, which will revolutionize our use of the second way of serving our guests. Our initiatives surrounding catering and technology adoption for mobile and online ordering round out the makings of an excellent customer experience and will allow for further sales recovery and future growth.
Our restaurateur program remains central to our ability to continue to produce the leaders we need to accomplish our mission and guide our restaurant through the sales recovery. This program has allowed us the ability to relocate some of our best operational leaders in order to establish better uniformity of operations around the country. Specifically, in our fast-growing and high-volume northeast region, which includes New York and New England, we were not satisfied with our guest experience in terms of throughput and dining room cleanliness. By relocating some of our strongest executive leaders directly into these markets, we are now confident that they will quickly return these restaurants to the operational excellence that we and our customers have grown to expect. These leadership changes include the relocation of an executive regional director and an executive team director as well as the addition of 5 team directors. We have confidence that our newly strengthened northeast team will provide much-needed support to our general managers and quickly and dramatically improve the guest experience. 
Over the last 4 years, we have added many field leaders to our ranks to be sure that we have the right ratios of restaurants per leader to carry out our mission. I've met with all of our field executives since then, and I'm confident that they're all clear on our priorities and that they're the right people to help us achieve our mission. 
Prior to last year's issues, Chipotle has the strongest economic model in the industry. Of course, this model has been weakened due to lower sales volumes that we have seen this year. While it's critical to fully restore sales volumes and keep improving them from there, we also know that we need to improve our economic model now so that we can provide healthy returns even at lower volumes. Key to restoring our business model is making sure that we are being as efficient as we can with our financial resources but doing so without compromising the strength of our support teams and field leadership. We are using this crisis as an opportunity to take a critical and disciplined look at how we manage our financial resources, and we've established the goal of saving $100 million across operational, G&A and CapEx expenditures. These cost savings will not detract from the customer experience. Instead, we're finding these savings in a number of areas, including disciplined staffing in support departments and field leadership, better business terms with suppliers, operational efficiencies and new restaurant designs that remain true to our brand but have lower investment costs. This more disciplined approach to managing the expenses will allow us to strengthen our economic model to the benefit of shareholders while not compromising our ability to deliver an excellent customer experience.
Finally, we continue to believe that expanding Chipotle in Europe holds a lot of promise for our future. But we know that to best ensure our success there, we need to provide the area with more strategic attention. For this reason, we recently hired as Managing Director in Europe, Jim Slater, a proven industry leader who ran successful operations for Costa Coffee and led Costa to become the #1 coffee brand in the U.K. Jim will be working to develop our European markets into an investable growth strategy. We're excited to have Jim on board leading our European team, and together, they will work to determine the best strategy for our continued development in Europe. 
Through all of these initiatives, we are confident that the plan we have in place to drive our recovery is the right plan, and we know that we have proven leaders throughout this company who can inspire a culture of excellence and help lead the way to recovery. I'm confident that through our progress towards providing a better guest experience all of the time, increasing sales through marketing and strengthening our unit economic model, we will dramatically improve returns for our shareholders in the months and years ahead. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

I'm very glad to be back, and I'm eager to share with all of you some of the important work that we're doing to bring customers back and restore our brand image. But first, I want to apologize to everyone for recent events in my personal life. I'm sorry that I caused the destruction [ph] for the company, and I want you all to know that I've put this behind me, learn from it and return to my role in early September excited and with a renewed focus and determination to help drive Chipotle's recovery. I want to thank you all for your support and forgiveness, which has meant a great deal to me. 
Today, I'm going to recap the marketing activities from Q3, and then I'm going to talk about several important breakthroughs with regard to customer data, technology and restaurant design before reviewing development expectations. 
During the quarter, we successfully concluded the Chiptopia Summer Rewards program designed to restore the frequency of our most loyal customers. In all, we had just under 6 million participants, with more than 2.5 million of those earning rewards on the program. We issued 340,000 super rewards for customers who maintained higher frequency levels, including more than 75,000 catering for 20 rewards. We're excited by the potential positive brand impact of 75,000 catering parties over the coming 6 months. Throughout the course of the promotion, we saw increased transaction and frequency levels, but most important, we have nearly returned to precrisis levels among our most loyal customers. After the completion of the program, we anticipated traffic to fall slightly, but we have instead seen our improved sales levels generally continue to hold, which is very encouraging. 
During the quarter, we ran 3 marketing campaigns, each with different but complementary objectives. The first was the food safety advancements campaign Monty referred to, which was designed to communicate what we have done to ensure the safety of our food. The campaign was broad reaching, with more than 90 million impressions. Last customers engaged more than any others with the video component of the campaign. The results of the campaign are positive, and we will continue to communicate the benefits of our food safety program so that every customer can rest assured that our food is as safe as possible. 
The second campaign surrounded our Love Story animated short film, which was distributed through digital media, social channels and in movie theaters across the country. The film has been viewed more than 60 million times and has proven to be highly effective at building trust in the Chipotle brand. The campaign also included the Love Story game, which challenges players to match fresh ingredients while avoiding fake ones. The game launched earlier this month and quickly surpassed the initial results of our popular Friend or Faux online game from the summer of 2015. Millions of people have played the Love Story game, and more than 3 million BOGO rewards have been earned by playing the game. More than 35% of those have already been redeemed. 
The third campaign running during Q3 was the Ingredients Reign campaign, which is designed to increase visits to Chipotle and build brand trust by focusing on the higher quality -- high quality of our delicious ingredients. Ingredients Reign is running across nearly all media channels, including outdoor, radio, print, digital, social and theaters. Both Love Story and Ingredients Reign campaigns exceeded our expectations. And for this reason, both campaigns have been extended to run through much of the rest of the year. 
Finally, with regard to Q3, I'd like to provide an update on our latest consumer research. Admiration scores and serves healthy and nutritious food attributes have nearly returned to precrisis levels. Agreements that we have appropriately addressed the food safety issues increased to 90%. Sentiment on social media is increasingly positive, and press mentions were 80% positive last month. Both are at or near precrisis levels. However, consideration still lags precrisis levels by more than 10%, though it is up slightly for the quarter. 
Moving on to Q4 and beyond, we're releveraging significant improvements in our customer data capabilities along with a shift in marketing strategy to aggressively target new and lapsed customers. By combining transactional information with other customer data, we are now able to identify more than half of our customers and reach them with specific offers and tailored messages. This important breakthrough not only allows us to target messages and offers to current and lapsed customers, but it also allows us to accurately measure the effectiveness of those efforts by tracking return visits. We have already delivered 2 targeted campaigns using this data, and we are continuing to refine our programs in real time. But this new customer data has implications well beyond more targeted and measurable marketing. The data allows us to very accurately measure customer frequency and details about their orders and behavior. For example, using the data, we now know that during the last 6 months, we saw nearly 30 million new customers at Chipotle. These new customers are customers who we have not seen since before the food safety events of last year. In fact, transactions from these customers accounted for nearly half of all transactions over the last 6 months. Additionally, we know how many of these customers return to Chipotle for additional visits and how many of them became regular customers. When combined with our marketing and advertising efforts, this detailed view into frequency and behavior allows us to evaluate the return on various marketing and promotional activities. 
Beyond customer data, we have also now begun to benefit from the strengthening of our technology infrastructure. In just a matter of days, we are launching a new online ordering experience that makes ordering and paying for Chipotle from any mobile device easier and faster. This mobile optimized website works on any recent web-enabled device, and it requires no app download. The new ordering experience offers a beautiful and intuitive way to order from Chipotle. This new ordering experience is in addition to our existing apps for iOS and Android that currently have a combined user base of more than 2.6 million people. 
Additionally, our test and smarter pickups -- pickup -- I'm sorry. Additionally, our test of smarter pick-up times has concluded, and we are in the process of rolling this technology out nationwide. Smarter pick-up times allow us to adjust the wait time between order placement and pickup times based on the demand and capacity of a given restaurant at a given time. This means that the customer is always presented with the shortest possible time between order placement and pickup. Smarter pickup times works with our iOS and Android apps as well as our new online ordering and, when combined with the advanced second make line Steve described earlier, has significant potential to increase our online ordering volumes and improve the customer experience. We expect smarter pickup times will be rolled out nationwide by January. 
Recent advancements in our technology infrastructure are also going to have a significant impact on the customer experience of ordering catering at Chipotle. Next month, we will enable online ordering and payment for catering, which previously was only available via phone and required in-store payment. The ability to order and pay for catering online will dramatically improve the customer experience while simultaneously decreasing our call center costs. The next step with catering is offer delivery, and tests are currently under way. Both catering and mobile ordering will receive significant marketing to support -- support during Q4, a time of year where we typically see an increase in catering volume ahead of the holiday season. 
We have also been supporting the national rollout of chorizo, and we're excited by the results. As Steve mentioned, chorizo currently accounts for about 7% of sales, and customer's response has been very positive. 84% of customers who tried chorizo liked it, and 70% of those who tried it say that chorizo increased their desire to visit Chipotle, and 77% say that the new offering makes them feel more favorably towards Chipotle. Because of these strong results, we plan to increase the reach of our chorizo advertising campaign by more than 400%. 
Next, I'd like to talk about television advertising and the test that's currently under way. We recognize the need for wide-reaching efforts to invite new customers to Chipotle. The fact that nearly 30 million new or lapsed customers visited Chipotle over the last 6 months shows the customers are responding to our advertising and promotional efforts. But in order to accelerate that momentum, we are considering a national -- we are considering national television advertising. Because our Ingredients Reign campaign tested positively in terms of customer reception and brand trust, we are running a 30-second ad from that campaign in multiple test markets. If the tests reveal that television advertising delivers the results we want, we may begin to integrate national television buys into our advertising campaigns. 
You may also be aware that we are currently undertaking a review of advertising agencies. While we are pleased with our current agency partners, we have developed a robust new marketing strategy for 2017. And in order to ensure that we have the absolute best creative work on that strategy, we're reviewing potential new partners. The review will be complete by the end of the year and in time for the launch of a new campaign in the spring of 2017. 
Going forward, we believe that there will be opportunities to incorporate new menu items into our overall marketing. We have been encouraged by the response we have seen with chorizo and see an opportunity to build excitement among existing customers and attract new customers through the thoughtful addition of menu items that are consistent with our brand. Any new menu item will be accompanied by extensive advertising campaigns designed not only to tout [ph] the menu additions but to excite customers about coming into Chipotle. 
Finally, I'd like to report on the successful launch of a new restaurant design that has been in development for more than a year. The new design is an evolution of the current design with improvements in lighting, acoustics, seating, customer flow and the presentation of our kitchen. Additionally, the new design is more cost effective with an average cost of $760,000, which is about $40,000 less expensive than our current restaurant design. We also anticipate a reduction in maintenance and repairs as a result of this new design. This new restaurant design is already open in certain locations and under construction in several others. We expect that more than 50 new locations in 2017 will utilize this design, and even more than that will benefit from some aspects of the new design. 
Our new restaurants have been performing at approximately 73% of our comp restaurant volumes, slightly lower than precrisis levels. But in areas where we have increased marketing of our new restaurant openings, net [ph] performance has improved, and we are closing the gap with those precrisis levels. In total, we are planning to open between 195 and 210 new restaurants in 2017. As our returns on new restaurants have compressed this year along with our margins, we've lowered the number of restaurants we plan to open. We will continue to focus on opening up the best potential sites that combine a lower risk profile with the highest possible returns. And even with our lower sales levels in 2016, we are not seeing a marked increase in cannibalization of opening new restaurants, which remains at less than 1% nationally. Most important, we view this reduction in new restaurant openings as temporary. Our long-term development pipeline remains robust, and with our new lower-cost restaurant design, we are setting our new restaurants up to achieve even higher levels of return on investment. We strongly believe that the ultimate potential for Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. could total 5,000.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Jack."
26446,403179540,1060772,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. When the year began, we described 2016 as a year where we will make significant investments to ensure our food is safe and encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. We knew these significant investments would put additional pressure on",2861,"Thanks, Mark. When the year began, we described 2016 as a year where we will make significant investments to ensure our food is safe and encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. We knew these significant investments would put additional pressure on our margins in the form of elevated food costs, higher advertising and promotion costs and higher labor costs to serve our returning customers. We intentionally did not emphasize restaurant efficiencies and even encouraged extra staffing in our restaurants during -- throughout promotion peaks because we did not want to risk trading a few points of margin on the P&L in return for disappointing a customer who visits an understaffed restaurant. The sales decline from buying with these investments and inefficiencies have resulted in significant declines to our margins. As we near the end of 2016 and we begin to look ahead to 2017, we'll continue to do all we can to restore customer trust and recover customer visits. We also are committed to take important steps to restore our economic model. With the strategies you've heard Steve, Monty and Mark talked about, we believe we can deliver comp in the high single-digit range for the full year in 2017.  Of course, we hope these strategies will deliver an even greater sales increase, but we believe this comp projection represents a stretched yet responsible goal. 
With the focus on delivering greater efficiencies in our restaurants, identifying cost savings in everything we buy in our restaurants and in our offices, supporting our growing restaurant base with flat G&A and beginning to normalize our promotion and advertising, we expect to deliver a restaurant-level margin of 20% and EPS of $10 in 2017. While these projected results do not fully restore our economic model, it's an important step in the right direction. We continue to believe we can, over time, fully recover our restaurant margin as sales recover. From the unit economic standpoint, these projected results would lead to an average restaurant volume of around $2 million and restaurant ROI of around 50%, and the return potential for new stores is even greater as we expect the average new store investment to decline to around $760,000 in 2017. 
I'll talk more about what's expected in 2017 and in Q4, but now let me recap our results for the third quarter. During the third quarter, we reported sales of $1.04 billion, a 15% decrease from the third quarter of 2015. Our reported sales were reduced by $11.5 million because of deferred revenue related to our summer Chiptopia promotion. As a reminder, Chiptopia ended on September 30, and we recorded deferred revenue associated with rewards earned but not yet redeemed. These rewards can be redeemed or will expire over the next 6 months, and the deferred revenue will be recognized over this period. As a result, we reported a negative same-store sales comp of negative 21.9%, which included a negative 0.8% impact from the revenue deferral. The Q3 comp is comprised of July down 23.8%, and that includes 100 basis points from the revenue deferral; August was down 21.7%, which includes 70 basis points from the revenue deferral; and september was down 20.1%, which includes 70 basis points from the deferral. And while October comps for the first 2 weeks were affected by Hurricane Matthew and were down about 21%, the past 10 days have recovered and normalized and were down around 19%. While we're not satisfied with still being down around 19%, we continue see small but steady progress month after month. As a side note, July had improved the declines in the 21% range in the weeks before our Q2 [ph] earnings report but then was impacted by a negative month-end trading fact was comparing to our friends or foe BOGO from 2015, which ran the last week of July and into early August. It was also impacted by the Chiptopia revenue deferral.
Our traffic trends have also steadily improved, and we're down 15.2% overall in the quarter compared to down 19.6% in June. Transactions improved to 13.4% in September and most recently are running down 14% in the past week or so. Chiptopia helped drive the sales additions action improvement is our most loyal customers return to their historically pattern as Mark mentioned.
On a regional basis, we continue to see wide variances in the progress of the recovery with comp sales in the Midwest and middle regions of the country down in the 17% range since September, outperforming the coastal areas, especially in the Pacific Coast minorities, which are down closer to the 24% to 25% range at September. From a transaction standpoint, there are several markets, including Kansas City and Chicago and where traffic is down, down only in the high single digits. We know that restoring customer has to take time and renewed habits establish during Chiptopia for most loyal customers continue to hold the Love Story campaign that Mark mentioned launched this month. Although customers behave in October for a few weeks of data. So far, our high-frequency customers are continuing to visit this month with similar frequency to September. Restaurant level margin was 14.1%, down from 15.5% in the second quarter of this year. The deferred revenue related to Chiptopia negatively impacted our restaurant level margin by nearly 100 basis points, so underlying margin was 15.1%. The remaining decline from Q2's margin of 15.5% is due to higher marketing and promo costs related to Chiptopia and higher food cost. Food costs were 35.1% of sales. But excluding impact of the deferred revenue, underlying food cost was 34.7%. This represents a slight sequential increase from Q2 of 50 basis points primarily due to much higher cost for avocados. Avocados declined during the summer. We banded experienced higher pricing, although we had hoped that this should be a temporary slight. In recent weeks though, supply has become even tighter and pricing has become much more volatile than expected. In fact we've seen that some competitors recently posted signs in their doors and are out of avocados altogether. We have remained in supply of avocados, but pricing is risen from an average of about $30 per case during the first time of the year to case pricing approaching $80 this month. Because of these higher avocado prices, food cost will remain above 55% in Q4 before seeing some relief in early 2017. Our labor cost for the quarter was 27.6% of sales, up from 22.2% of sales last year. Without the revenue deferral, labor cost were 27.3% of sales. Sales deleverage accounted for approximately 300 basis points, and the remaining increase relates to inflation and additional labor related to Chiptopia and other promotions. Underlying wage inflation was in the 5% to 6% range in the quarter. Labor was about $9 million higher in Q3 versus Q2 this year to support higher sales levels that our transaction trends continue to improve. We also added increased labor as return to produce inside the restaurants, and we also had increased labor with the higher promo level activity of Chiptopia. In prior year, total labor dollars have been relatively flat from the second quarter to the third quarter. Other operating expenses as a percent of sales were 16% during the quarter and increase from 11.1% last year. About 290 basis points of the year-over-year increase is due to sales leverage, marketing promo expenses combined were 4.8% of sales during the quarter, which is double the rate of marketing at promo for the prior year. And it was 50 basis points higher than Q2 due to Chiptopia. In Q4, we anticipate our marketing and pro were made at about the same level as in a few markets. Also, as we invest in ads supporting chorizo and as Chiptopia earned award, our redeemed an expense in our promo line. G&A cost for the quarter were $78.4 million or 7.6% as a percent of sale. Underline G&A excluding stock comp was $61.9 million in the quarter in the quarter. During the quarter, we held our biannual All Manager Conference, which totaled about $10 million and $8 million of that was expensed in the third quarter. As a reminder, this conference will not be held in 2017 although we traditionally hold a smaller field leadership conference, which we expect to cost between $1 million and $2  million. Excluding our G&A was flat year-to-date on a total dollar basis compared to 2015 despite supporting an additional 247 restaurants opened over the past year. We froze our support headcount early in the summer, and is an actively prioritizing where we investor support to ensure we are investing in providing an excellent guest experience and recovering sales. And so we look at it in 2017, we are planning to continue to keep our underline G&A expenses before stock comp flat compared to 2016 and lower on a percent of sales basis despite during our restaurant base by another 200 restaurants. For the full year 2016, we estimate our effective tax rate will be 38.2% in line with 2015. The full year 2016 estimate expected tax rate benefited from additional federal tax credits earned and a tax benefit from previously earned California state tax credits that we now estimate will be offset by higher state tax rate. We currently anticipate the full year 2017 effective tax rate will be 39.5% and it's higher expected rate in 2017 not included the other previously mentioned tax credits related to prior year. Third quarter net income was $7.8 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.27. This included negative impact of $0.23 related to revenue deferral and a negative impact of $0.29 for the impairment of ShopHouse. And for these adjustments, Q3 EPS was $0.79 or $0.08 lower than Q2 this year due to the cost, the cost of Chiptopia and higher avocado costs. As of September 30, we maintained $609.8 million of cash and investments. During the quarter, we generated cash of operations of $101 million and generated free cash flow of $36 million. We also repurchased $70.3 million of stock during the quarter at an average price of $109 [ph] per share. Over the life of our share repurchase program, we grew [indiscernible] $1.9 billion of our stock at an average price of $289 per share. We'll continue to manage our balance sheet to invest in our sales recovery for our business and opportunistically return cash to shareholders via share repurchases. Recently, our Board of Directors approved an additional $100 million of repurchase authorization and as of yesterday's close and including the additional approval, we now have $154.6 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Looking ahead to Q4, we'll begin to compare against last year's comp of negative 14.6%. So of course, our comp will improve against the stock [ph] comparison and will likely be in the negative low single digits. Margins are expected to remain in the mid-teens as the benefit of a continued steady sales recovery and the reversal of the deferred revenue from Q3 will be offset by Q4 having seasonally lower average daily sales. G&A will be about $10 million lower than Q3 because of the E&C expense not recurring and slightly lower stock comp. And we believe these sales will improve to around $1 per share. Avocado pricing is a big wild card as every $10 per case price movement, up or down, will impact the EPS by $0.17. As I mentioned earlier, 2016 has been a year of significant investment in food safety and restoring customer trust and recovering customer visits. It's been a difficult year in terms of margins and earnings driven by lower sales, including related to leverage and the impact on the significant investments. We will continue to work harder to recover our sales, shifting our strategy from giveaway discounts and rewards to new menu items, technology-driven convenience, better operations including faster throughput and more aggressive brand marketing, including TV. We know that fully restoring our previously industry-leading economic model on fully recovering our sales. We feel confident we have a team in place to execute our strategy in 2017 and achieve a high single-digit comp sales increase at 20% restaurant level margin and a $10 EPS. Our comp target will not be an easy hurdle to meet and, of course, we're not in control of it. But we are in control of how we manage our restaurants and we are in control of how we manage our expenses, both in the restaurant and with our support G&A. To earn a full year 2017 target 20% restaurant level operating margin, we need to earn about 50 basis points of additional margin versus the current underlying run rate of about 15%. We will recover this 500 basis points in several ways. First, by effective scheduling of our crews we have the right staff at the right time to deliver an excellent guest experience but also to ensure we're not ever overstaffed, especially during low sales periods. We can manage our food cost more effectively by reducing waste by ordering, prepping and cooking to [indiscernible] throughout the day. By cooking to ideal temperatures, which not only makes our food taste better, it also results in avoiding unnecessary also more effectively manage smaller but important restaurant food safety, repairs and maintenance and supplies faster than sales this year. We have invested heavily in training our field leaders recently to effectively manage the business culture in the restaurant they oversee. These field leaders spent 2 full days in what we have called a business boot camp, and they have been training there GMs and reinforcing how to create an excellent guest expense while effectively managing their P&L. We also expect promo costs, which are another operating cost, will normalize in 2017 as we reduce the on giveaways and discounts. And marketing will either normalize or will remain at elevated levels in support of efforts such as TV advertising, which we would expect will result in higher sales and leverage in the rest of the P&L. In addition, we have an internal goal of saving at lease $100 million from recurring annual cost. This includes a review of everything we buy, both in the restaurants and in our offices. It also includes capital expenditures, including the new more efficient restaurant design Mark mentioned, which will reduce our investment cost from over $800,000 to around $760,000 [ph] in 2017, a savings of nearly 2,000 -- savings of nearly $10 million in 2017 alone. As I mentioned previously, we plan to keep our our underline G&A cost before stock comp flat in 2016 to 2017. In dollar terms, that will result in G&A before stock comp of around $20 million in 2017. We chose not to fill about 100 positions this year which were vacated during turnover and not rebuilt or improved in 2015 but were unfilled headcount adds. All of which will save around $10 million annually and will help our underlying G&A dollars remain at current levels. Our teams are effectively supporting our restaurant by stretching the ratios a bit and focusing only on those activities that maintain safer food as we do better guest experience, take sales or strengthen our economic model. We increased our field support significantly over the past 3 years and at nearly the lowest ratio of stores per field support staff than we've had in 10 years. We currently have nearly 300 field leaders, which include the area managers, team leader and impressive team leads. So even as we build 200 new restaurants, on average, the field leader will increase by less than 1 restaurant per field leader in 2017. Our restaurant teams are responding well to the challenge of more effectively managing cost and are energized to helping us restore our business. As we challenge our restaurant managers at the E&C, one of our Restaurateurs from our Park restaurant, California reached out to meet with an idea to simplify some of our back office functions. He said the [indiscernible] every restaurant, he'll save us more than $1 million across the country, across the entire company. I've seen similar commitments throughout the company in our restaurant and in our offices to be more disciplined and more discerning with every dollar we spent, and everyone feels ownership to do their part to help strengthen economic model while we work to win our customers back. We're confident that the approach we're taking will help restore our margin and our earning capabilities without taking away from the customer experience. In fact, the techniques our field leaders are teaching will result in scheduling and deploying restaurant teams to deliver the best experience and the most delicious safest food possible, which also leads to better financial result. These efforts will allow us to generate respectable results in 2017 but more importantly, we believe we will ultimately emerge from the challenge stronger than ever as our cost structure will be leaner, we will be more focused than ever and our level throughout the company will be sharper, and our economic model will be stronger than ever. Thanks for your time today, and we'll now open the line for questions."

We're going to focus on fundamentals and try to continually deliver a better experience through that method, but we also want to try to think new things, again to get some customers who may have lapsed to reinvigorate",324,"I think that we're going to do both. We're going to focus on fundamentals and try to continually deliver a better experience through that method, but we also want to try to think new things, again to get some customers who may have lapsed to reinvigorate our regular customers, to encourage them to come more and perhaps to even entice new customers who haven't tried Chipotle. It's important that when you add something to the restaurant, you take something away. And although with the addition of new menu items, we're not going to take away other menu items, there are things that we can do to create efficiencies in the way we prep, in the way we get ready for business, in the way we find leverage. Finding leverage is interesting because there'd been suggestions that we add breakfast, for instance. Well, I'm not saying that we won't add breakfast but when trying to find leverage, our second make line now has an enormous opportunity. The second make line can attract or provide for catering or delivery, for the mobile app to enable customers that are in line to get out of line and go to a tablet and probably things that we haven't thought of yet. It's extraordinarily leveraged because the labor to produce the food is much less at the second make line because of the new technology. So my point is that you need to -- you balance everything in the restaurants, and so we will make some things more efficient so we will be able to add things like a dessert item or a new menu item. Again, if you look at some other examples of fast food places getting too complicated, I don't think they kept this idea of taking away whenever you add something.

The new menu items, I wouldn't worry that we're going to slip into the traditional fast food model of introducing multiple new menu items ramped with advertising multiple times a year. Our business really doesn't support that anyway because it's really one price for everything you get at Chipotle unless you get something something extra like meat or guacamole. So we really we wanted to add lots and lots of menu items. However, there is a considerable amount of value to being able to advertise to people or to market to people something new, and we've seen it now with chorizo. It's been very effective which is why mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're going to increase the amount of reach of that campaign 4 times. And what it does is that it gives people a reason to reconsider Chipotle or just to add it to their routine where it may have dropped that we're seeing it may very effective. I wouldn't worry that you're going to see switching to this model of repetitive menu additions with lots and lots of advertising around them, but there is a real value that we've seen now very tangibly with chorizo in terms of adding something new every now and then so I really wouldn't worry that it's going to be a change, a complete change in strategy at all."

So the second make line that Steve referred to, we have one in our restaurants for many, many years, the classic version. This new version is much more efficient. Whether or not you have the tech component added to it or not, it's just a better layout, it's got bigger bins, it's set up to be more efficient. And that new line actually is slightly cheaper than our existing second make line. And so that line that is without all the technology component of it is actually a little bit cheaper than our existing lines, and so we're going to move quickly to have all of our restaurants outfitted with that new line starting in March of 2017. So all new restaurants will have it, and then we're going to selectively retrofit high-volume restaurants with it over the coming year. And so I think it's going to be relatively quick. Now what I just described was the line itself without the technology component. It's completely set up to handle it. We add that line to the restaurant. And then as we see fit, we can have the technology component to it, and it's not a tremendously expensive addition as well. So you're not going to see lots and lots of the need to build big kiosks in the front of the house, that sort of thing because this system, actually, whether you're using it from a tablet inside the restaurant or from your phone in your pocket uses a very, very similar ordering system to do what I described my call, the new online ordering site that we've developed.

Even though this is early on, what the teams have shown so far with this new approach is they can produce food a lot faster, more accurately and so this really both in efficiencies. If we didn't have second make line, I would say this would be a major undertaking, it would be a lot of training and it would take quite some time. The fact that all the restaurants already have a second line, struggling to make the food in the second make line with a little piece of paper with a lot of abbreviations. What they're going to get instead of that is there going to have a very clear indicator with this and so they're going to be doing the same things they always have. And with the restaurant that was retrofitted in New York, the teams have intuitively stopped, just gravitated towards the display screens and just intuitively just kind of made the food what they always would except they weren't stopping like in between every ingredient or 2 to look at this little bit the piece of paper that's on the size of a register receipt. So it's early but so far, we don't think there's going to be an increase in labor. The equipment cost is not that expensive. There will be an impact on depreciation on how many we can roll out, but it's not going to be significant, not something that's going to affect our ability to get to the $10 [ph] EPS."

It's a relatively small customer group, but it's a group that comes very often. When we look at, we slice and dice our customer group a number of different ways. And when you look at our customer group, for those customers that come at least a couple of times a month to one time per week or greater as one group, another group would be a customer that comes, say, once a month, another group would come 2 to 3 times a month, and another group would come once per every 6 months. When you take that most frequent group -- by the way, all of those groups were negatively affected by 25 -- anywhere between 20% and 25%, they all dropped down their visit frequency. And in the case of the infrequent customer, we just lost customers. And we lost them to the tune of about 20% to 25%. After Chiptopia, we recovered to a point of where most frequent customers are back to 95% to where they were before now. Some infrequent customers did not increase their frequency, but we were able to see some customers that are not coming as often as what they want now are coming once per week. So we don't have the exact same customers we have before. One thing we learned is gone through and we've gathered this data that Mark talked about, we found that we have kind of a constant movement of customers that are coming some are coming more frequently, some are coming less. What Chiptopia did was encourage those customers either coming frequently and reduced, a lot of them did come back and then encouraged some that are coming a couple of times per month to come at least once per week or more. But if you look at that most loyal customer group that come in multiple times per month, that group we've recovered 95%. Now the rest of the group is a much, much larger group of customers that come much less frequent. That's why the things that Mark talked about make some much sense, that's why TV advertising make sense, that's why advertising, things like chorizo which is new news makes a lot of sense once we decide which desert we want to go with to try to go beyond a test market. These are things that you can advertise and appeal to a broad group of customers themselves. That's what get much, much larger, tens of millions of customers to come to Chipotle and so that we can recover that group as well.

And additionally, we're now able to reach a very large number of those people. And so we have dramatically improved our ability to reach out to these customers. And they're not all frequency categories by the way, the range from 1 to more than 10 times in terms of a number of visits during that 6 month period so they're all across a different frequency bands, but we have such an extraordinary new ability to reach them that we're evaluating exactly how best to use that in order to create incentives for them. And we don't want to rely on a continuing basis on discounting. Obviously, that cheapens the brand and increased sense of entitlement such as people begin to expect it. So I very carefully evaluating how that's going to look but to answer your question, I would say yes, we're going to look at to how we can use this new information we have about our customers and this really amazing ability to track whether or not what we do with them drives them in. So we can determine now with a very high degree of fidelity whether or not an offer or an ad of a particular type or any other type of promotional or communication actually resulted in a visit from these customers. And so I don't want to commit right now to exactly what we're going to do because we're -- it's really just been over the last few months ago when we developed this capability, but we're absolutely going to use it in a way that allows us to create ongoing incentives to create the momentum for these less frequent customers become more frequent. I'm very excited about just the simple idea that so many new customers came to Chipotle. a couple of things to me. First is even though it's tempting to think that what people are still reluctant to come to Chipotle, with that volume of people coming in as new customers, I think that's unlikely. That's showing a pretty major shift in people's attitude. But also those somewhat infrequent new customers have extraordinarily potential to become frequent. They're the ones who have the potential to create comps for us in the future, and so we're going to be doing whatever we can to make their stay at Chipotle as enjoyable as possible. So I can't give you a firm answer, but I hope that helps you understand sort of how we're going to be looking at it."

I think though that as I mentioned in answering the last question, we've seen very, very large numbers of new customers experiencing Chipotle. And so I think there's extraordinary potential for us to continue bringing in large groups of new customers, and that's the reason why we're currently testing television. And television isn't -- isn't a fantasy. It's going to be a component of larger campaigns that we do, but it's very efficient when we get to the level of doing it nationally. And so I believe that, that probably has some of the most significant potential for us to bring in lots and lots and lots of new customers. And then assuming that we create a great experience for them when they come in the restaurant, they will then turn into more and more frequent customers. So I suspect that amongst those things, that has huge potential. But I will follow that with a very close second, which would be the increase in our digital promotion and the capability of online ordering. And I just want to take a second to tell you a little bit more about what I'm talking about with regard, for example, to smarter pickup times, which is the ability for somebody to come in to Chipotle and give an order very quickly after they ordered it. We've been conducting a test of it last several months of this technology and through our analysis of that, we found that when people place orders at Chipotle, there's a very significant lag between when they placed the order and when our restaurants allow them to come pick it up. This new technology actually eliminates our restaurants' ability to set that time gap and instead set it automatically based on the load of restaurant. And so we're seeing the potential to do as many as one entrée per minute using this new system. And so the marketing that goes around that, that encourages people to place their orders via digital, assuming then again of those orders are fulfilled in efficient and excellent way, I think has a tremendous amount of potential put that as a close second to the top-of-mind marketing we're going to be doing."

It's always been less than 1%. It's still less than 1% this year. And so it's not like there'd be a significant comp rebound. We have the pipeline so other than paring down, as I mentioned, pipeline. They just isn't an advantage the recovery doesn't get jumpstarted just because we would peel off another 25, 50 or 100 openings. So there wasn't any advantage to doing so. So we thought we did the responsible thing in doing what you could have assured the quality of the portfolio but going beyond that just didn't offer any benefit from what we could see."

We are beginning to emerge from the most difficult year in our history, and I've seen many reasons to be optimistic that we are headed in the right direction to restore our business to a place our many sharehol",1357,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everybody. We are beginning to emerge from the most difficult year in our history, and I've seen many reasons to be optimistic that we are headed in the right direction to restore our business to a place our many shareholders will be proud of. But please note that while we are on the road to recovery, we're not satisfied, and we'll continue to work extremely hard to make the necessary adjustments necessary to restore our business and deliver results as quickly as possible. 
From early this year, we have recovered more than 16 points of sales comp and we've recovered 20 points of traffic comp, and we're making steady progress toward further recovery. During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $1.04 billion, down 15% from last year on a comparable restaurant sales decline of 21.9%. During the third quarter, we opened 55 new restaurants, bringing our total number of restaurants to 2,178. And we generated diluted earnings per share of $0.27, which includes a negative $0.29 impact related to asset impairment. 
Since our recovery began, we have seen a gradually improving outlook for sales and earnings and fully expect that those trends will continue. 2016 will be marked as a significant reinvestment year as we continue to work to make Chipotle a stronger company in the wake of last year's events. Looking forward to 2017 and based on current trends, we believe that we will produce diluted earnings of $10 per share on same-store sales growth in the high single digits for 2017. We believe that the full year of 2017, we can generate restaurant-level operating margins of 20% and save more than $100 million in capital and operating expenses combined. To achieve these results, we must be steadfast in executing our recovery plan, which remains the primary focus of everybody at Chipotle. Specifically, we're focused on delivering a safe and extraordinary guest experience in every restaurant, restoring trust and building sales, restoring our economic model and enhancing the guest experience through innovation. Monty, Mark and Jack will provide additional detail on some of these priority areas, but right now, I'd like to speak to the last point, which is enhancing the guest experience. 
Two important enhancements to the customer experience are menu innovation and digital ordering. We are actively exploring ways to enhance the guest experience by offering new additions to our menu. We believe that this is a good way to entice infrequent or lapsed customers to return as well as a way to increase sales. Any time we consider new menu items, it's important to us that they remain consistent with our food culture, both in terms of the ingredients we use and how the new items are prepared. A great example of this is chorizo, which we launched nationwide earlier this month. Chorizo now accounts for roughly 7% of our sales around the country. Feedback from customers has been extremely positive, and we plan to ramp up our advertising in the fourth quarter to support chorizo by encouraging our customers to come in and try it. We're also currently testing 2 different desserts, and we hope to select 1 to offer in the near future. We believe that there's an opportunity to excite current customers and to attract new customers through thoughtful menu development, and we're exploring these options. 
We're also moving aggressively to make digital ordering more appealing to our customers and more efficient for our restaurants. Nearly all of our restaurants have a second make line in the back of the restaurant where we have fulfilled digital, fax and catering orders. By optimizing the use and design of these second make lines, we envision the time when digital ordering could account for a much larger percentage of sales than the 6% it represents today. Maximizing our digital sales requires changes both to the second make line itself and to the ways by which our customers place digital orders. Our original second make line resembles the service line our customers see in the front of the house, though scaled down and it takes up less space. 
The new line is a much more ergonomic and efficient design configured such that less labor will be required to produce higher sales volumes and thus sell more quickly. The new line incorporates an advanced queuing system that takes advantage of a heads-up visual display, which allows our crews to assemble orders without distraction. The benefits of these new lines will be enormous, including faster, more efficient assembly of orders, reduced errors and more consistent portion sizes for our customers, all of which we believe will help us drive increased sales volumes. After some additional testing is complete, we will begin to selectively add these new digitally enhanced lines -- digitally enabled lines to some of our highest-volume markets where it can best enhance our out-of-store ordering experience. It's important to note, however, that all of our original second make lines are still able to take advantage of enhanced digital ordering options even though they don't have the advantaged indicating system of the digitally enabled lines.
Our crews in these restaurants will work from paper tickets until their restaurants are upgraded with the new system. To stimulate additional use of these second lines, we're introducing a new mobile optimized ordering site that provides an alternative to our iOS and Android ordering apps. Mark will talk more about this new ordering option later in the call, but the new site makes ordering and paying for digital orders easier than ever. In addition to our new ordering site, we are testing a tablet-based ordering option, which allows customers to avoid the line and order in restaurant on available tablets and get their order made from the second decline in the back of the house. This tablet-based ordering system will initially be tested in a series of restaurants that are equipped with the new make line. When the full system is realized, the second make line has the potential to deliver as much as 50% of the sales from some locations, including digital orders from all sources, including catering and delivery services. 
Finally, we fully impaired the assets related to ShopHouse, which totaled approximately $14.5 million on a pre-taxes basis. We opened the first ShopHouse in 2011 and currently operate 15 ShopHouse restaurants in 3 separate markets. ShopHouse is managed by a small independent team, which was tasked with creating a compelling brand, which could develop into a compelling growth strategy and enhance long-term shareholder value. We're proud of the ShopHouse team, the delicious food they've created and the excellent customer service they've delivered. But after operating in 3 distinct markets and opening in a variety of trade areas, ShopHouse simply has not demonstrated the ability to support an attractive unit economic model. As a result, we have decided not to invest further in developing or growing the ShopHouse brand and will pursue strategic alternatives. 
Although the exotic ShopHouse cuisine was not able to attract sufficient customer loyalty and visit frequency to make it a viable growth strategy for us, we continue to believe that our approach to food, people and unit economics with the right cuisine, with the right concept can lead to a compelling growth strategy. And we are optimistic that our other growth seeds, serving pizza and soon burgers, both of which have broad customer appeal, can become further growth strategies for us. While this was not an easy decision, we trust in our overall growth seed approach where we can innovate and develop new concepts with a relatively small capital investment and little or no distraction to the Chipotle business. And we'll only invest additional resources, both time and money, into growth seeds that show the potential to become meaningful growth vehicle and a compelling way to enhance shareholder value. 
We continue to believe that we have an extraordinary potential and are fully confident in our ability to achieve it. Monty, Mark and Jack will talk in greater detail about our plans to realize our potential and build greater shareholder value.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

Achieving a full recovery means having all of our restaurants at their very best in terms of serving delicious, safe food and providing an excellent restaurant experience while continuing to grow sales. As we move forward with our recove",1520,"Thank you, Steve. Achieving a full recovery means having all of our restaurants at their very best in terms of serving delicious, safe food and providing an excellent restaurant experience while continuing to grow sales. As we move forward with our recovery plan, the guest experience remains our greatest area of focus. Providing an excellent guest experience starts with serving food that's always safe and delicious. While many of our enhanced food safety efforts occur outside the restaurants in the supply and distribution network and with enhanced technology, we also rely on strong restaurant teams and 2 leaders to carry out additional element to our food safety program in the restaurant. 
Ensuring that we execute these procedures in our restaurants has been a top priority. To accomplish this, we have significantly expanded training, food safety inspections and third-party and internal audits in our restaurants. These audits help us identify opportunities for improvement and ensure that all the programs we have put in place are being executed consistently and properly. To further these efforts and to continuously improve food safety in our restaurants and supply chain, we have also established an independent food safety advisory council made up of some of the country's foremost experts in food safety and food microbiology. This advisory council, alongside Dr. Jim Marsden, our Executive Director of Food Safety, is charged with continuously reviewing our food safety programs and looking for opportunities to strengthen them even more.
This quarter, we shared some key points about our enhanced food safety program with our customers through a PR campaign and highlighted 8 key areas of advancements that we made. The campaign included full-page ads in newspapers as well as online and social media advertising in addition to print and video materials of Steve describing why our food safety changes are so effective. The campaign was very well received and was effective in communicating the comprehensive steps we've taken. Details surrounding each of these programs continue to be available for you to see on our website. 
At the same time, we are keenly aware that safe food alone will not bring people into our restaurants. Instead, they come for delicious food and an excellent guest experience. This is why our restaurant teams are focused on delivering great-tasting food and an excellent customer service and clean, friendly restaurants. This starts with our commitment to serving the best-tasting food we can, food that is made with ingredients that are raised with respect for the environment, animals and the people who produce them. And we continue to look for ways to improve the quality of the food we serve, including our quest for better tortillas made with no artificial additives or preservatives, a promise we made last year and are close to fulfilling. 
So as we work to rebuild our company and strengthen our brand, it is critical that our entire organization is focused on those things that will most powerfully delight our guests and speed our recovery. For this reason, we use this year's All Managers' Conference as a time to articulate to our field leaders and managers 3 areas of focus that are in their control: first, providing an excellent guest experience; second, marketing their individual restaurants; and third, restoring and protecting our unit economic model. Our officer team asked our managers to first train the fundamentals of excellent operations so that they could then proceed on the path to restaurateur. 
Our relentless focus on the most important things and implementing them exceptionally well is what it always makes Chipotle great; and we know that to ensure our sales recover, we have to be better than ever to win our customers back. Also, great throughput is a key part of the guest experience at Chipotle and one of our key competitive advantages. To do it well requires constant training and focus. During the last year where we made implementation of our new food safety program the highest priority, some of our restaurant teams have lost some of the throughput skills that they had developed before the crisis. And with high turnover at the crew level, it is even more important that we continue to emphasize and train the skills needed to deliver fast throughput, including the 4 pillars of throughput.  Of course, a primary reason our throughput slowed was that our sales slowed after the crisis, but throughput can -- still can be and will be faster as our restaurant teams commit to drive this critical aspect of an excellent guest experience. Additionally, we are emphasizing the proper use of the second make line with our field teams to enable the teams on the front line to take great care of the guest in front of them. This will be even more important as we layer in some of the technology that Steve spoke about, which will revolutionize our use of the second way of serving our guests. Our initiatives surrounding catering and technology adoption for mobile and online ordering round out the makings of an excellent customer experience and will allow for further sales recovery and future growth.
Our restaurateur program remains central to our ability to continue to produce the leaders we need to accomplish our mission and guide our restaurant through the sales recovery. This program has allowed us the ability to relocate some of our best operational leaders in order to establish better uniformity of operations around the country. Specifically, in our fast-growing and high-volume northeast region, which includes New York and New England, we were not satisfied with our guest experience in terms of throughput and dining room cleanliness. By relocating some of our strongest executive leaders directly into these markets, we are now confident that they will quickly return these restaurants to the operational excellence that we and our customers have grown to expect. These leadership changes include the relocation of an executive regional director and an executive team director as well as the addition of 5 team directors. We have confidence that our newly strengthened northeast team will provide much-needed support to our general managers and quickly and dramatically improve the guest experience. 
Over the last 4 years, we have added many field leaders to our ranks to be sure that we have the right ratios of restaurants per leader to carry out our mission. I've met with all of our field executives since then, and I'm confident that they're all clear on our priorities and that they're the right people to help us achieve our mission. 
Prior to last year's issues, Chipotle has the strongest economic model in the industry. Of course, this model has been weakened due to lower sales volumes that we have seen this year. While it's critical to fully restore sales volumes and keep improving them from there, we also know that we need to improve our economic model now so that we can provide healthy returns even at lower volumes. Key to restoring our business model is making sure that we are being as efficient as we can with our financial resources but doing so without compromising the strength of our support teams and field leadership. We are using this crisis as an opportunity to take a critical and disciplined look at how we manage our financial resources, and we've established the goal of saving $100 million across operational, G&A and CapEx expenditures. These cost savings will not detract from the customer experience. Instead, we're finding these savings in a number of areas, including disciplined staffing in support departments and field leadership, better business terms with suppliers, operational efficiencies and new restaurant designs that remain true to our brand but have lower investment costs. This more disciplined approach to managing the expenses will allow us to strengthen our economic model to the benefit of shareholders while not compromising our ability to deliver an excellent customer experience.
Finally, we continue to believe that expanding Chipotle in Europe holds a lot of promise for our future. But we know that to best ensure our success there, we need to provide the area with more strategic attention. For this reason, we recently hired as Managing Director in Europe, Jim Slater, a proven industry leader who ran successful operations for Costa Coffee and led Costa to become the #1 coffee brand in the U.K. Jim will be working to develop our European markets into an investable growth strategy. We're excited to have Jim on board leading our European team, and together, they will work to determine the best strategy for our continued development in Europe. 
Through all of these initiatives, we are confident that the plan we have in place to drive our recovery is the right plan, and we know that we have proven leaders throughout this company who can inspire a culture of excellence and help lead the way to recovery. I'm confident that through our progress towards providing a better guest experience all of the time, increasing sales through marketing and strengthening our unit economic model, we will dramatically improve returns for our shareholders in the months and years ahead. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

But first, I want to apologize to everyone for recent events in my personal life. I'm sorry that I caused a distraction for the company, and I want you all to know that I've put this behind me, learn from it and return to my role in early September excited and with a renewed focus and determination to help drive Chipotle's recovery. I want to thank you all for your support and forgiveness, which has meant a great deal to me. 
Today, I'm going to recap the marketing activities from Q3, and then I'm going to talk about several important breakthroughs with regard to customer data, technology and restaurant design before reviewing development expectations. 
During the quarter, we successfully concluded the Chiptopia Summer Rewards program designed to restore the frequency of our most loyal customers. In all, we had just under 6 million participants, with more than 2.5 million of those earning rewards on the program. We issued 340,000 super rewards for customers who maintained higher frequency levels, including more than 75,000 catering for 20 rewards. We're excited by the potential positive brand impact of 75,000 catering parties over the coming 6 months. Throughout the course of the promotion, we saw increased transaction and frequency levels, but most important, we have nearly returned to precrisis levels among our most loyal customers. After the completion of the program, we anticipated traffic to fall slightly, but we have instead seen our improved sales levels generally continue to hold, which is very encouraging. 
During the quarter, we ran 3 marketing campaigns, each with different but complementary objectives. The first was the food safety advancements campaign Monty referred to, which was designed to communicate what we have done to ensure the safety of our food. The campaign was broad reaching, with more than 90 million impressions. Last customers engaged more than any others with the video component of the campaign. The results of the campaign are positive, and we will continue to communicate the benefits of our food safety program so that every customer can rest assured that our food is as safe as possible. 
The second campaign surrounded our Love Story animated short film, which was distributed through digital media, social channels and in movie theaters across the country. The film has been viewed more than 60 million times and has proven to be highly effective at building trust in the Chipotle brand. The campaign also included the Love Story game, which challenges players to match fresh ingredients while avoiding fake ones. The game launched earlier this month and quickly surpassed the initial results of our popular Friend or Faux online game from the summer of 2015. Millions of people have played the Love Story game, and more than 3 million BOGO rewards have been earned by playing the game. More than 35% of those have already been redeemed. 
The third campaign running during Q3 was the Ingredients Reign campaign, which is designed to increase visits to Chipotle and build brand trust by focusing on the higher quality -- high quality of our delicious ingredients. Ingredients Reign is running across nearly all media channels, including outdoor, radio, print, digital, social and theaters. Both Love Story and Ingredients Reign campaigns exceeded our expectations. And for this reason, both campaigns have been extended to run through much of the rest of the year. 
Finally, with regard to Q3, I'd like to provide an update on our latest consumer research. Admiration scores and serves healthy and nutritious food attributes have nearly returned to precrisis levels. Agreements that we have appropriately addressed the food safety issues increased to 90%. Sentiment on social media is increasingly positive, and press mentions were 80% positive last month. Both are at or near precrisis levels. However, consideration still lags precrisis levels by more than 10%, though it is up slightly for the quarter. 
Moving on to Q4 and beyond, we're releveraging significant improvements in our customer data capabilities along with a shift in marketing strategy to aggressively target new and lapsed customers. By combining transactional information with other customer data, we are now able to identify more than half of our customers and reach them with specific offers and tailored messages. This important breakthrough not only allows us to target messages and offers to current and lapsed customers, but it also allows us to accurately measure the effectiveness of those efforts by tracking return visits. We have already delivered 2 targeted campaigns using this data, and we are continuing to refine our programs in real time. But this new customer data has implications well beyond more targeted and measurable marketing. The data allows us to very accurately measure customer frequency and details about their orders and behavior. For example, using the data, we now know that during the last 6 months, we saw nearly 30 million new customers at Chipotle. These new customers are customers who we have not seen since before the food safety events of last year. In fact, transactions from these customers accounted for nearly half of all transactions over the last 6 months. Additionally, we know how many of these customers return to Chipotle for additional visits and how many of them became regular customers. When combined with our marketing and advertising efforts, this detailed view into frequency and behavior allows us to evaluate the return on various marketing and promotional activities. 
Beyond customer data, we have also now begun to benefit from the strengthening of our technology infrastructure. In just a matter of days, we are launching a new online ordering experience that makes ordering and paying for Chipotle from any mobile device easier and faster. This mobile optimized website works on any recent web-enabled device, and it requires no app download. The new ordering experience offers a beautiful and intuitive way to order from Chipotle. This new ordering experience is in addition to our existing apps for iOS and Android that currently have a combined user base of more than 2.6 million people. 
Additionally, our test and smarter pickups -- pickup -- I'm sorry. Additionally, our test of smarter pick-up times has concluded, and we are in the process of rolling this technology out nationwide. Smarter pick-up times allow us to adjust the wait time between order placement and pickup times based on the demand and capacity of a given restaurant at a given time. This means that the customer is always presented with the shortest possible time between order placement and pickup. Smarter pickup times works with our iOS and Android apps as well as our new online ordering and, when combined with the advanced second make line Steve described earlier, has significant potential to increase our online ordering volumes and improve the customer experience. We expect smarter pickup times will be rolled out nationwide by January. 
Recent advancements in our technology infrastructure are also going to have a significant impact on the customer experience of ordering catering at Chipotle. Next month, we will enable online ordering and payment for catering, which previously was only available via phone and required in-store payment. The ability to order and pay for catering online will dramatically improve the customer experience while simultaneously decreasing our call center costs. The next step with catering is offer delivery, and tests are currently under way. Both catering and mobile ordering will receive significant marketing to support -- support during Q4, a time of year where we typically see an increase in catering volume ahead of the holiday season. 
We have also been supporting the national rollout of chorizo, and we're excited by the results. As Steve mentioned, chorizo currently accounts for about 7% of sales, and customer's response has been very positive. 84% of customers who tried chorizo liked it, and 70% of those who tried it say that chorizo increased their desire to visit Chipotle, and 77% say that the new offering makes them feel more favorably towards Chipotle. Because of these strong results, we plan to increase the reach of our chorizo advertising campaign by more than 400%. 
Next, I'd like to talk about television advertising and the test that's currently under way. We recognize the need for wide-reaching efforts to invite new customers to Chipotle. The fact that nearly 30 million new or lapsed customers visited Chipotle over the last 6 months shows the customers are responding to our advertising and promotional efforts. But in order to accelerate that momentum, we are considering a national -- we are considering national television advertising. Because our Ingredients Reign campaign tested positively in terms of customer reception and brand trust, we are running a 30-second ad from that campaign in multiple test markets. If the tests reveal that television advertising delivers the results we want, we may begin to integrate national television buys into our advertising campaigns. 
You may also be aware that we are currently undertaking a review of advertising agencies. While we are pleased with our current agency partners, we have developed a robust new marketing strategy for 2017. And in order to ensure that we have the absolute best creative work on that strategy, we're reviewing potential new partners. The review will be complete by the end of the year and in time for the launch of a new campaign in the spring of 2017. 
Going forward, we believe that there will be opportunities to incorporate new menu items into our overall marketing. We have been encouraged by the response we have seen with chorizo and see an opportunity to build excitement among existing customers and attract new customers through the thoughtful addition of menu items that are consistent with our brand. Any new menu item will be accompanied by extensive advertising campaigns designed not only to tout the menu additions but to excite customers about coming into Chipotle. 
Finally, I'd like to report on the successful launch of a new restaurant design that has been in development for more than a year. The new design is an evolution of the current design with improvements in lighting, acoustics, seating, customer flow and the presentation of our kitchen. Additionally, the new design is more cost effective with an average cost of $760,000, which is about $40,000 less expensive than our current restaurant design. We also anticipate a reduction in maintenance and repairs as a result of this new design. This new restaurant design is already open in certain locations and under construction in several others. We expect that more than 50 new locations in 2017 will utilize this design, and even more than that will benefit from some aspects of the new design. 
Our new restaurants have been performing at approximately 73% of our comp restaurant volumes, slightly lower than precrisis levels. But in areas where we have increased marketing of our new restaurant openings, net performance has improved, and we are closing the gap with those precrisis levels. In total, we are planning to open between 195 and 210 new restaurants in 2017. As our returns on new restaurants have compressed this year along with our margins, we've lowered the number of restaurants we plan to open. We will continue to focus on opening up the best potential sites that combine a lower risk profile with the highest possible returns. And even with our lower sales levels in 2016, we are not seeing a marked increase in cannibalization of opening new restaurants, which remains at less than 1% nationally. Most important, we view this reduction in new restaurant openings as temporary. Our long-term development pipeline remains robust, and with our new lower-cost restaurant design, we are setting our new restaurants up to achieve even higher levels of return on investment. We strongly believe that the ultimate potential for Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. could total 5,000.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Jack."

When the year began, we described 2016 as a year where we will make significant investments to ensure our food is safe and encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. We knew these significant investments would put additional pressure on",2947,"Thanks, Mark. When the year began, we described 2016 as a year where we will make significant investments to ensure our food is safe and encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. We knew these significant investments would put additional pressure on our margins in the form of elevated food costs, higher advertising and promotion costs and higher labor costs to serve our returning customers. We intentionally did not emphasize restaurant efficiencies and even encouraged extra staffing in our restaurants during -- throughout promotion peaks because we did not want to risk trading a few points of margin on the P&L in return for disappointing a customer who visits an understaffed restaurant. The sales decline from buying with these investments and inefficiencies have resulted in significant declines to our margins. As we near the end of 2016 and we begin to look ahead to 2017, we'll continue to do all we can to restore customer trust and recover customer visits. We also are committed to take important steps to restore our economic model. With the strategies you've heard Steve, Monty and Mark talked about, we believe we can deliver comp in the high single-digit range for the full year in 2017.  Of course, we hope these strategies will deliver an even greater sales increase, but we believe this comp projection represents a stretched yet responsible goal. 
With the focus on delivering greater efficiencies in our restaurants, identifying cost savings in everything we buy in our restaurants and in our offices, supporting our growing restaurant base with flat G&A and beginning to normalize our promotion and advertising, we expect to deliver a restaurant-level margin of 20% and EPS of $10 in 2017. While these projected results do not fully restore our economic model, it's an important step in the right direction. We continue to believe we can, over time, fully recover our restaurant margin as sales recover. From the unit economic standpoint, these projected results would lead to an average restaurant volume of around $2 million and restaurant ROI of around 50%, and the return potential for new stores is even greater as we expect the average new store investment to decline to around $760,000 in 2017. 
I'll talk more about what's expected in 2017 and in Q4, but now let me recap our results for the third quarter. During the third quarter, we reported sales of $1.04 billion, a 15% decrease from the third quarter of 2015. Our reported sales were reduced by $11.5 million because of deferred revenue related to our summer Chiptopia promotion. As a reminder, Chiptopia ended on September 30, and we recorded deferred revenue associated with rewards earned but not yet redeemed. These rewards can be redeemed or will expire over the next 6 months, and the deferred revenue will be recognized over this period. As a result, we reported a negative same-store sales comp of negative 21.9%, which included a negative 0.8% impact from the revenue deferral. The Q3 comp is comprised of July down 23.8%, and that includes 100 basis points from the revenue deferral; August was down 21.7%, which includes 70 basis points from the revenue deferral; and September was down 20.1%, which includes 70 basis points from the deferral. And while October comps for the first 2 weeks were affected by Hurricane Matthew and were down about 21%, the past 10 days have recovered and normalized and were down around 19%. While we're not satisfied with still being down around 19%, we continue see small but steady progress month after month. As a side note, July had improved the declines in the 21% range in the weeks before our Q2 earnings report but then was impacted by a negative month-end trading stay [ph] effect. Plus comparing to our Friends and -- Friends or Faux BOGO from 2015, which ran the last week of July and into early August, it was also impacted by the Chiptopia revenue deferral.
Our traffic trends have also steadily improved and were down 15.2% overall in the quarter compared to down 19.6% in June. Transactions improved to 13.4% in September and, most recently, are running down 14% in the past week or so. Chiptopia helped drive the sales and transaction improvement in the quarter as our most loyal customers return to their historic frequency pattern as Mark mentioned.
On a regional basis, we continue to see wide variances in the progress of the recovery with comp sales in the Midwest and middle regions of the country down in the 17% range since September, outperforming the coastal areas, especially in the Pacific Coast minorities, which are down closer to the 24% to 25% range in September. 
From a transaction standpoint, there are several markets, including Kansas City and Chicago, Denver and Minneapolis, where traffic is now down only in the high single digits. We know that restoring customer habits takes time, and to help ensure that renewed habits established during Chiptopia for our most loyal customers continue to hold, The Love Story campaign that Mark mentioned was launched this month. Although hard to estimate customers' behavior in October from only a few weeks of data, so far, our high-frequency customers are continuing to visit this month with similar frequency to September. 
Restaurant-level margin was 14.1%, down from 15.5% in the second quarter of this year. The deferred revenue related to Chiptopia negatively impacted our restaurant-level margin by nearly 100 basis points, so underlying margin was 15.1%. The remaining decline from Q2's margin of 15.5% is due to higher marketing and promo costs related to Chiptopia and higher food costs. Food costs were 35.1% of sales. But excluding the impact of the deferred revenue, underlying food cost was 34.7%. This represents a slight sequential increase from Q2 of 50 basis points primarily due to much higher costs for avocados. Avocado supply declined during the summer. We began to experience higher pricing, although we had hoped that this would be a temporary spike. In recent weeks, though, supply has become even tighter and pricing has become much more volatile than expected. In fact, we have seen that some competitors recently have posted signs on their doors saying they're out of avocados altogether. We have remained in supply of avocados, but case pricing has risen from an average of about $30 per case during the first half of the year to a case pricing approaching $80 this month. Because of these higher avocado prices, food cost will remain above 35% in Q4 before seeing relief in early 2017. 
Our labor costs for the quarter were 27.6% of sales, up from 22.2% of sales last year. Without the revenue deferral, labor costs were 27.3% of sales. Sales deleverage accounted for approximately 300 basis points, and the remaining increase relates to inflation and additional labor related to Chiptopia and other promotions. Underlying wage inflation was in the 5% to 6% range in the quarter. Labor was about $9 million higher in Q3 versus Q2 this year to support higher sales levels as our transaction trends continue to improve. We also had increased labor as we return to prepping produce inside of the restaurants, and we also had increased labor with the higher promo level activity of Chiptopia. In prior year, total labor dollars had been relatively flat from the second quarter to the third quarter. 
Other operating expenses as a percent of sales were 16% during the quarter, an increase from 11.1% last year. About 290 basis points of the year-over-year increase is due to sales deleverage. Marketing promo expenses combined were 4.8% of sales during the quarter, which is double the rate of marketing and promo from the prior year, and it was 50 basis points higher than Q2 due to Chiptopia. In Q4, we anticipate our marketing and promo will remain at about the same level as we test TV in a few markets. Also, as we invest in ads supporting chorizo and as the Chiptopia earned rewards are redeemed and expensed in our promo line. 
G&A costs for the quarter were $78.4 million or 7.6% as a percent of sale. Underlying G&A, excluding stock comp, was $61.9 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we held our biannual All Managers' Conference, which totaled about $10 million, and $8 million of that was expensed in the third quarter. And as a reminder, this conference will not be held in 2017, although we traditionally hold a smaller field leadership conference, which we expect would cost between $1 million and $2 million. Excluding this year's AMC, our G&A was flat year-to-date on a total dollar basis compared to 2015 despite supporting an additional 247 new restaurants opened over the past year. 
We froze our support headcount early in the summer and had been actively prioritizing where we invest our support to ensure that we're investing and providing an excellent guest experience and recovering sales. As we look ahead to 2017, we are planning to continue to keep our underlying G&A expenses before stock comp flat compared to 2016 and lower on a percent of sales basis despite growing our restaurant base by another 200 restaurants. 
For the full year 2016, we estimate our effective tax rate will be 38.2%, in line with 2015. The full year 2016 estimated effective tax rate benefited from additional federal tax credits earned and a tax benefit from previously earned California state tax credits that we now estimate will be realized, and they were offset by higher state tax rate. We currently anticipate the full year 2017 effective tax rate will be 39.5%, and its higher expected rate in 2017 does not include the benefit of the previously mentioned tax credits related to prior year. 
Third quarter net income was $7.8 million, and diluted earnings per share was $0.27. This included the negative impact of $0.23 related to revenue deferral and a negative impact of $0.29 for the impairment of ShopHouse. Before these adjustments, Q3 EPS was $0.79 or $0.08 lower than Q2 of this year due to the agency costs, the cost of Chiptopia and higher avocado costs. As of September 30, we maintained $609.8 million of cash and investments. During the quarter, we generated cash from operations of $101 million and generated free cash flow of $36 million. We also repurchased $70.3 million of our stock during the quarter at an average price of $409 per share. Over the life of our share repurchase program, we've repurchased $1.9 billion of our stock at an average price of $289 per share. We'll continue to manage our balance sheet to invest in our sales recovery, grow our business and opportunistically return cash to shareholders via share repurchases. Recently, our Board of Directors approved an additional $100 million of repurchase authorization, and as of yesterday's close and including the additional approval, we now have $154.6 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead to Q4, we'll begin to compare against last year's comp of negative 14.6%. So of course, our comp will improve against that stock comparison and will likely be in the negative low single digits. Margins are expected to remain in the mid-teens as the benefit of a continued, steady sales recovery and the reversal of the deferred revenue from Q3 will be offset by Q4 having seasonally lower average daily sales. G&A will be about $10 million lower than Q3 because of the AMC expense not recurring and slightly lower stock comp. And we believe the EPS will improve to around $1 per share. Avocado pricing is the big wild card as every $10 per case price movement, up or down, will impact the EPS by $0.17. 
As I mentioned earlier, 2016 has been a year of significant investment in food safety and restoring customer trust and recovering customer visits. It has been a difficult year in terms of margins and earnings, driven by lower sales, including related deleverage and the impact on these significant investments. We will continue to work harder to recover our sales, shifting our strategy from giveaway discounts and rewards to new menu items; technology-driven convenience; better operations, including faster throughput; and more aggressive brand marketing, including TV. We know that fully restoring our previously industry-leading economic model depends on fully recovering our sales. We feel confident that we have the teams in place to execute our strategies in 2017 and achieve a high single-digit comp sales increase at 20% restaurant-level margin and a $10 EPS. Our comp target will not be an easy hurdle to meet and, of course, we're not in complete control of it. But we are in control of how we manage our restaurants, and we are in control of how we manage our expenses both in the restaurant and with our support G&A. To earn a full year 2017 target of 20% restaurant-level operating margin, we need to earn about 50 basis points of additional margin versus the current underlying run rate of about 15%. 
We will recover this 500 basis points in several ways. First, by effective scheduling of our crews to ensure we have the right staff at the right time to deliver an excellent guest experience but also to ensure we're not ever overstaffed, especially during low sales periods. We can manage our food costs more effectively by reducing waste; by ordering, prepping and cooking the correct quantities throughout the day; by cooking to ideal temperatures, which not only makes our food taste better, it also results in avoiding unnecessary yield loss. We can also more effectively manage smaller but important restaurant costs such as repairs and maintenance and casing [ph] supplies, which is growing faster than sales in recent year. We have invested heavily in training our field leaders recently to effectively manage the business culture in the restaurants they oversee. These field leaders spent 2 full days in what we have called a business boot camp, and they have been training their GMs and reinforcing how to create an excellent guest experience while effectively managing their P&L. 
We also expect promo costs, which are another operating costs, will normalize in 2017 as we reduce reliance on giveaways and discounts. And marketing will either normalize or will remain at elevated levels in support of efforts such as TV advertising, which, we would expect, will result in higher sales and create leverage on the rest of the P&L. In addition, we have an internal goal of saving at lease $100 million from recurring annual cost. This includes a review of everything we buy, both in the restaurants and in our offices. It also includes capital expenditures, including the new, more efficient restaurant design Mark mentioned, which will reduce our investment costs from over $800,000 to around $760,000 in 2017, a savings of nearly 2,000 -- or I'm sorry, savings of nearly $10 million in 2017 alone. 
As I mentioned previously, we plan to keep our underlying G&A cost before stock comp flat from 2016 to 2017. In dollar terms, that will result in G&A before stock comp of around $220 million in 2017. We chose not to fill about 100 staff positions this year, which were vacated via turnover and not refilled or were approved in 2015 but were unfilled headcount adds, all of which will save around $10 million annually and will help our underlying G&A dollars remain at the current level. 
Our teams are effectively supporting our restaurants by stretching the ratios a bit and focusing only on those activities that maintain safer food as we do a better guest experience to grow sales or strengthen our economic model. We increased our field support significantly over the past 3 years and have nearly the lowest ratio of stores per field support staff than we've had in 10 years. We currently have nearly 300 field leaders, which include the area managers, team leaders and impressive [ph] team leads. So even as we build 200 new restaurants, on average, the field leader ratio will increase by less than 1 restaurant per field leader in 2017. Our restaurant teams and support teams are responding well to the challenge of more effectively managing costs and are energized by helping us restore our business. As we challenge our restaurant managers at the AMC, one of our restaurateurs, Philip Esposito [ph], from our Newbury Park restaurant in California reached out to me the very day after the conference with an idea to simplify some of our back-office functions. His idea affects every restaurant and will save us more than $1 million across the country -- across the entire company. And I've seen similar commitments throughout the company in our restaurant and in our offices to be more disciplined and more discerning with every dollar we spent, and everyone feels ownership to do their part to help strengthen our economic model while we work to bring our customers back. We're confident that the approach we're taking will help restore our margin and our earning capabilities without taking away from the customer experience. In fact, the techniques our field leaders are teaching will result in scheduling and deploying the restaurant teams to deliver the best experience and the most delicious, safest food possible, which also leads to a better financial result. These efforts will allow us to generate respectable results in 2017, but more importantly, we believe we will ultimately emerge from this challenge stronger than ever as our cost structure will be leaner, we will be more focused than ever and our skill level throughout the company will be sharper, and our economic model with sales fully restored will be stronger than ever.

We're going to focus on fundamentals and try to continually deliver a better experience through that method, but we also want to try to think new things, again, to get some customers who may have lapsed, to reinvigorate our regular customers, to encourage them to come more and perhaps to even entice new customers who haven't tried Chipotle. It's important that when you add something to the restaurant, you take something away. And although with the addition of new menu items, we're not going to take away other menu items. There are things that we can do to create efficiencies in the way we prep, in the way we get ready for business, in the way we find leverage. Finding leverage is interesting because there've been suggestions that we add breakfast, for instance. Well, I'm not saying that we won't add breakfast, but when trying to find leverage, our second make line now has an enormous opportunity. The second make line can attract or provide for catering or delivery, for the mobile app to enable customers that are in line to get out of line and go to a tablet and probably things that we haven't thought of yet. It's extraordinarily leveraged because the labor to produce the food is much less at the second make line because of the new technology. So my point is that you need to -- you balance everything in the restaurants, and so we will make some things more efficient so we will be able to add things like a dessert item or a new menu item. Again, if you look at some other examples of fast-food places getting too complicated, I don't think they kept this idea of taking away whenever you add something. So on balance, you still have the same amount of ability to focus on delivering the extraordinary experience that we've been accustomed to."

The new menu items, I wouldn't worry that we're going to slip into the traditional fast-food model of introducing multiple new menu items wrapped with advertising multiple times a year. Our business really doesn't support that anyway just because it's really a one price for everything you get at Chipotle unless you get something extra like meat or guacamole. So we really don't have the ability even if we wanted to, to add lots and lots of menu items. However, there is a considerable amount of value to being able to advertise to people or to market to people something new, and we've seen it now with chorizo. It's been very effective, which is why I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're going to increase the amount of reach of that campaign 4x. And what it does is it gives people a reason to reconsider Chipotle or just to add it to their routine where they may have dropped on occasion, and we're seeing it to be very effective. And so I wouldn't worry that you're going to see switching to this model of repetitive menu additions with lots and lots of advertising around them, but there is a real value that we've seen now very tangibly with chorizo in terms of adding something new every now and then. So I really wouldn't worry that it's going to be a change -- a complete change in strategy at all."

So the second make line that Steve referred to, we have one in our restaurants for many, many years the classic version. This new version is much more efficient. Whether or not you have the tech component added to it or not, it's just a better layout. It's got bigger bins. It's set up to be more efficient. And that new line actually is slightly cheaper than our existing second make line. And so that line, that is without all the technology component on it is actually a little bit cheaper than our existing line. And so we're going to move quickly to have all of our restaurants outfitted with that new line starting in March of 2017. So all new restaurants will have it, and then we're going to selectively retrofit high-volume restaurants with it over the coming year. And so I think it's going to be relatively quick. Now what I just described was the line itself without the technology component. It's completely set up to handle it. We add that line to the restaurants. And then as we see fit, we can have the technology component to it, and it's not a tremendously expensive addition as well. And so you're not going to see lots and lots of the need to build big kiosks in the front of the house, that sort of thing, because this system, actually, whether you're using it from a tablet inside the restaurant or from your phone in your pocket uses the -- a very, very similar ordering system to the one I described in my call, the new online ordering site that we've developed. And so there's very, very little overall investment in this thing, and I believe that we can turn it around fairly efficiently as we roll it into our restaurants."

We think the labor is going to be neutral. We think, over time, it's going to be a laborsaving. The labor per sale of dollars on the second make line is more efficient than labor per sale of dollars on the front make line. Even though this is early on, what the teams have shown so far with this new approach is they can produce food a lot faster, more accurately, and so there's really built-in efficiencies. If we didn't have second make line, I would say this would be a major undertaking. It'd be a lot of training, and it would take quite some time. The fact that virtually all the restaurants already have a second make line, and what they're doing right now, they're struggling to make the food in the second make line with a little piece of paper with a lot of abbreviations. What they're going to get instead of that is they're going to have a very clear indicator with display screens, and so they're going to be doing the same things they always have. And with the restaurant that was retrofitted in New York, the teams have intuitively stopped, just gravitated towards the display screens and just intuitively just kind of made the food they -- the way they always would except they weren't stopping like in between every ingredient or 2 to look at this little bitty piece of paper that's on the size of a register receipt. So it's early, but so far, we don't think there is going to be an increase in labor. The equipment cost is not that expensive. There will be an impact on depreciation, depending on how many we can roll out, but it's not going to be significant, not something that's going to affect our ability to get to the $10 EPS."

It's a relatively small customer group, but it's a group that comes very often. When we look at -- we slice and dice our customer group a number of different ways. And when we look at our customer group, for those customers that come at least a couple of times a month to one time per week or greater as one group, another group would be some -- a customer that comes, say, once a month, another group would come 2 to 3 times a month, and another group would come once per every 6 months. When you take that most frequent group -- by the way, all of those groups were negatively affected by 25 -- anywhere between 20% and 25%, meaning they all dropped down their visit frequency. And in case of the infrequent customer, we just lost customers. And we lost them to the tune of about 20% to 25%. After Chiptopia, we recovered to a point of -- where our most frequent customers were back to 95% to where they were before. Now some infrequent customers did not increase their frequency, but we were able to see some customers that were not coming as often as, let's say, once per week, now were coming once per week. So we don't have the exact same customers we had before. One thing we've learned as we've gone through and we've gathered this data, mine this data that Mark talked about, we found that we have kind of a constant movement of customers that are coming. Some are coming more frequently. Some are coming less. What Chiptopia did was encourage those customers either were coming frequently and reduced, a lot of them did come back. And then we encouraged some that were coming a couple of times per month to come at least once per week or more. But if you look at that most loyal customer group that come in multiple times per month, that group, we've recovered 95%. Now the rest of the group is a much, much, much larger group of customers that come much less frequent. That's why the things that Mark talked about make so much sense. That's why TV advertising makes sense. That's why advertising things like chorizo, which is new news, makes a lot of sense. Dessert -- once we decide which dessert we want to go with to try to go beyond a test market, these are things that you can advertise and appeal to a broad group of customers. And so that's what our approach is to get that much, much larger, tens of millions of customers to come to Chipotle, and so we can recover that group as well. And then in terms of the comp, we don't have any menu price built into the comp at all."

John, when you -- an interesting thing which I mentioned in my remarks, I think, that's worth noting is that over the last 6 months, we saw 30 million customers that were either new or people that we hadn't seen before come into Chipotle, and this is -- thanks to this new data capability that we have. And additionally, we're now able to reach a very large number of those people. And so we have dramatically improved our ability to reach out to these customers. And they're not all frequency categories. By the way, this 30 million people range from 1 to more than 10 times in terms of number of visits during that 6-month period. So they're all across the different frequency bands, but we have such an extraordinary new ability to reach them that we're evaluating exactly how best to use that in order to create incentives for them. And we don't want to rely on a continuing basis on discounting. There's -- obviously, that cheapens the brand and creates a sense of entitlement ultimately such that people just begin to expect it. And so we're very carefully evaluating how that's going to look. But to answer your question, I would say yes, we're going to look at how we can use this new information we have about our customers and this really amazing ability to track whether or not what we do with them drives them in. So we can determine now with a very high degree of fidelity whether or not an offer or an add of a particular type or any other type of promotion or communication actually resulted in a visit from these customers. And so I don't want to commit right now to exactly what we're going to do because we're -- it's really just been over the last few months when we developed this capability, but we're absolutely going to use it in a way that allows us to create ongoing incentives to create the momentum for these less frequent customers become more frequent. I'm very excited about just the simple idea that so many new customers came to Chipotle. I mean, it says a couple of things to me. I mean, first, it says -- even though it's tempting to think that, well, people are still reluctant to come to Chipotle. With that volume of people coming in as new customers, I think that's unlikely. That's showing a pretty major shift in people's attitude. But also those somewhat infrequent new customers have extraordinary potential to become frequent. They're the ones who have the potential to create great comps for us in the future, and so we're going to be doing whatever we can to make their stay at Chipotle as enjoyable as possible. So I can't give you a firm answer, but I hope that helps you understand sort of how we're going to be looking at it."

I think, though, that as I mentioned in answering the last question, we've seen very, very large numbers of new customers experiencing Chipotle. And so I think there's extraordinary potential for us to continue bringing in large groups of new customers, and that's the reason why we're currently testing television. And television isn't a panacea. It's going to be a component of larger campaigns that we do, but it's very efficient when we get to the level of doing it nationally. And so I believe that, that probably has some of the most significant potential for us to bring in lots and lots and lots of new customers. And then assuming that we create a great experience for them when they come in the restaurant, they will then turn into more and more frequent customers. So I suspect that amongst those things, that has huge potential. But I will follow that with a very close second, which would be the increase in our digital promotion and to the capability of online ordering. And I just want to take a second to tell you a little bit more about what I'm talking about with regard, for example, to smarter pickup times, which is the ability for somebody to come in to Chipotle and get an order very quickly after they ordered it. We've been conducting a test over the last several months of this technology. And through our analysis of that, we found that when people place orders at Chipotle, there's a very significant lag between when they place the order and when our restaurants allow them to come pick it up. This new technology actually eliminates our restaurant's ability to set that time gap and instead sets it automatically based on the load of the restaurant. And so we're seeing the potential to do as many as one entrée per minute using this new system. And so the marketing that goes around that, that encourages people to place their orders via digital, assuming then, again, those orders are fulfilled in this efficient and excellent way, I think, has a tremendous amount of potential. So I put that as a close second to the top-of-mind marketing that we're going to be doing."

But having gotten over that hurdle actually enables us to do a lot of the things we talked about without further technological investment.

We are beginning to emerge from the most difficult year in our history, and I've seen many reasons to be optimistic that we are headed in the right direction to restore our business to a place our many sharehol",1358,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everybody. We are beginning to emerge from the most difficult year in our history, and I've seen many reasons to be optimistic that we are headed in the right direction to restore our business to a place our many shareholders will be proud of. But please note that while we are on the road to recovery, we're not satisfied, and we'll continue to work extremely hard to make the necessary adjustments necessary to restore our business and deliver results as quickly as possible. 
From early this year, we have recovered more than 16 points of sales comps and we've recovered 20 points of traffic comps, and we're making steady progress toward further recovery. During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $1.04 billion, down 15% from last year on a comparable restaurant sales decline of 21.9%. During the third quarter, we opened 55 new restaurants, bringing our total number of restaurants to 2,178. And we generated diluted earnings per share of $0.27, which includes a negative $0.29 impact related to asset impairment. 
Since our recovery began, we have seen a gradually improving outlook for sales and earnings and fully expect that those trends will continue. 2016 will be marked as a significant reinvestment year as we continue to work to make Chipotle a stronger company in the wake of last year's events. Looking forward to 2017 and based on current trends, we believe that we will produce diluted earnings of $10 per share on same-store sales growth in the high single digits for 2017. We believe that the full year of 2017, we can generate restaurant-level operating margins of 20% and save more than $100 million in capital and operating expenses combined. To achieve these results, we must be steadfast in executing our recovery plan, which remains the primary focus of everybody at Chipotle. Specifically, we're focused on delivering a safe and extraordinary guest experience in every restaurant, restoring trust and building sales, restoring our economic model and enhancing the guest experience through innovation. Monty, Mark and Jack will provide additional detail on some of these priority areas, but right now, I'd like to speak to the last point, which is enhancing the guest experience. 
Two important enhancements to the customer experience are menu innovation and digital ordering. We are actively exploring ways to enhance the guest experience by offering new additions to our menu. We believe that this is a good way to entice infrequent or lapsed customers to return as well as a way to increase sales. Any time we consider new menu items, it's important to us that they remain consistent with our food culture, both in terms of the ingredients we use and how the new items are prepared. A great example of this is chorizo, which we launched nationwide earlier this month. Chorizo now accounts for roughly 7% of our sales around the country. Feedback from customers has been extremely positive, and we plan to ramp up our advertising in the fourth quarter to support chorizo by encouraging our customers to come in and try it. We're also currently testing 2 different desserts, and we hope to select 1 to offer in the near future. We believe that there's an opportunity to excite current customers and to attract new customers through thoughtful menu development, and we're exploring these options. 
We're also moving aggressively to make digital ordering more appealing to our customers and more efficient for our restaurants. Nearly all of our restaurants have a second make line in the back of the restaurant where we have fulfilled digital, fax and catering orders. By optimizing the use and design of these second make lines, we envision the time when digital ordering could account for a much larger percentage of sales than the 6% it represents today. Maximizing our digital sales requires changes both to the second make line itself and to the ways by which our customers place digital orders. Our original second make line resembles the service line our customers see in the front of the house, though scaled down and it takes up less space. 
The new line is a much more ergonomic and efficient design configured such that less labor will be required to produce higher sales volumes and thus sell more quickly. The new line incorporates an advanced queuing system that takes advantage of a heads-up visual display, which allows our crews to assemble orders without distraction. The benefits of these new lines will be enormous, including faster, more efficient assembly of orders, reduced errors and more consistent portion sizes for our customers, all of which we believe will help us drive increased sales volumes. After some additional testing is complete, we will begin to selectively add these new digitally enhanced lines -- digitally enabled lines to some of our highest-volume markets where it can best enhance our out-of-store ordering experience. It's important to note, however, that all of our original second make lines are still able to take advantage of enhanced digital ordering options even though they don't have the advantaged indicating system of the digitally enabled lines.
Our crews in these restaurants will work from paper tickets until their restaurants are upgraded with the new system. To stimulate additional use of these second lines, we're introducing a new mobile optimized ordering site that provides an alternative to our iOS and Android ordering apps. Mark will talk more about this new ordering option later in the call, but the new site makes ordering and paying for digital orders easier than ever. In addition to our new ordering site, we are testing a tablet-based ordering option, which allows customers to avoid the line and order in restaurant on available tablets and get their order made from the second make line in the back of the house. This tablet-based ordering system will initially be tested in a series of restaurants that are equipped with the new make line. When the full system is realized, the second make line has the potential to deliver as much as 50% of the sales from some locations, including digital orders from all sources, including catering and delivery services. 
Finally, we fully impaired the assets related to ShopHouse, which totaled approximately $14.5 million on a pre-taxes basis. We opened the first ShopHouse in 2011 and currently operate 15 ShopHouse restaurants in 3 separate markets. ShopHouse is managed by a small independent team, which was tasked with creating a compelling brand, which could develop into a compelling growth strategy and enhance long-term shareholder value. We're proud of the ShopHouse team, the delicious food they've created and the excellent customer service they've delivered. But after operating in 3 distinct markets and opening in a variety of trade areas, ShopHouse simply has not demonstrated the ability to support an attractive unit economic model. As a result, we have decided not to invest further in developing or growing the ShopHouse brand and will pursue strategic alternatives. 
Although the exotic ShopHouse cuisine was not able to attract sufficient customer loyalty and visit frequency to make it a viable growth strategy for us, we continue to believe that our approach to food, people and unit economics with the right cuisine, with the right concept can lead to a compelling growth strategy. And we are optimistic that our other growth seeds, serving pizza and soon burgers, both of which have broad customer appeal, can become further growth strategies for us. While this was not an easy decision, we trust in our overall growth seed approach where we can innovate and develop new concepts with a relatively small capital investment and little or no distraction to the Chipotle business. And we'll only invest additional resources, both time and money, into growth seeds that show the potential to become meaningful growth vehicles and a compelling way to enhance shareholder value. 
We continue to believe that we have an extraordinary potential and are fully confident in our ability to achieve it. Monty, Mark and Jack will talk in greater detail about our plans to realize our potential and build greater shareholder value.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

Achieving a full recovery means having all of our restaurants at their very best in terms of serving delicious, safe food and providing an excellent restaurant experience while continuing to grow sales. As we move forward with our recove",1519,"Thank you, Steve. Achieving a full recovery means having all of our restaurants at their very best in terms of serving delicious, safe food and providing an excellent restaurant experience while continuing to grow sales. As we move forward with our recovery plan, the guest experience remains our greatest area of focus. Providing an excellent guest experience starts with serving food that's always safe and delicious. While many of our enhanced food safety efforts occur outside the restaurants in the supply and distribution network and with enhanced technology, we also rely on strong restaurant teams and team leaders to carry out additional element to our food safety program in the restaurant. 
Ensuring that we execute these procedures in our restaurants has been our top priority. To accomplish this, we have significantly expanded training, food safety inspections and third-party and internal audits in our restaurants. These audits help us identify opportunities for improvement and ensure that all the programs we have put in place are being executed consistently and properly. To further these efforts and to continuously improve food safety in our restaurants and supply chain, we have also established an independent food safety advisory council made up of some of the country's foremost experts in food safety and food microbiology. This advisory council, alongside Dr. Jim Marsden, our Executive Director of Food Safety, is charged with continuously reviewing our food safety programs and looking for opportunities to strengthen them even more.
This quarter, we shared some key points about our enhanced food safety program with our customers through a PR campaign and highlighted 8 key areas of advancements that we made. The campaign included full-page ads in newspapers as well as online and social media advertising in addition to print and video materials of Steve describing why our food safety changes are so effective. The campaign was very well received and was effective in communicating the comprehensive steps we've taken. Details surrounding each of these programs continue to be available for you to see on our website. 
At the same time, we are keenly aware that safe food alone will not bring people into our restaurants. Instead, they come for delicious food and an excellent guest experience. This is why our restaurant teams are focused on delivering great-tasting food and an excellent customer service and clean, friendly restaurants. This starts with our commitment to serving the best-tasting food we can, food that is made with ingredients that are raised with respect for the environment, animals and the people who produce them. And we continue to look for ways to improve the quality of the food we serve, including our quest for better tortillas made with no artificial additives or preservatives, a promise we made last year and are close to fulfilling. 
So as we work to rebuild our company and strengthen our brand, it is critical that our entire organization is focused on those things that will most powerfully delight our guests and speed our recovery. For this reason, we use this year's All Managers' Conference as a time to articulate to our field leaders and managers 3 areas of focus that are in their control: first, providing an excellent guest experience; second, marketing their individual restaurants; and third, restoring and protecting our unit economic model. Our officer team asked our managers to first train the fundamentals of excellent operations so that they could then proceed on the path to restaurateur. 
Our relentless focus on the most important things and implementing them exceptionally well is what always makes Chipotle great; and we know that to ensure our sales recover, we have to be better than ever to win our customers back. Also, great throughput is a key part of the guest experience at Chipotle and one of our key competitive advantages. To do it well requires constant training and focus. During the last year where we made implementation of our new food safety program the highest priority, some of our restaurant teams have lost some of the throughput skills that they had developed before the crisis. And with high turnover at the crew level, it is even more important that we continue to emphasize and train the skills needed to deliver fast throughput, including the 4 pillars of throughput.  Of course, a primary reason our throughput slowed was that our sales slowed after the crisis, but throughput can -- still can be and will be faster as our restaurant teams commit to drive this critical aspect of an excellent guest experience. Additionally, we are emphasizing the proper use of the second make line with our field teams to enable the teams on the front line to take great care of the guest in front of them. This will be even more important as we layer in some of the technology that Steve spoke about, which will revolutionize our use of the second way of serving our guests. Our initiatives surrounding catering and technology adoption for mobile and online ordering round out the makings of an excellent customer experience and will allow for further sales recovery and future growth.
Our restaurateur program remains central to our ability to continue to produce the leaders we need to accomplish our mission and guide our restaurants through the sales recovery. This program has allowed us the ability to relocate some of our best operational leaders in order to establish better uniformity of operations around the country. Specifically, in our fast-growing and high-volume northeast region, which includes New York and New England, we were not satisfied with our guest experience in terms of throughput and dining room cleanliness. By relocating some of our strongest executive leaders directly into these markets, we are now confident that they will quickly return these restaurants to the operational excellence that we and our customers have grown to expect. These leadership changes include the relocation of an executive regional director and an executive team director as well as the addition of 5 team directors. We have confidence that our newly strengthened northeast team will provide much-needed support to our general managers and quickly and dramatically improve the guest experience. 
Over the last 4 years, we have added many field leaders to our ranks to be sure that we have the right ratios of restaurants per leader to carry out our mission. I've met with all of our field executives since then, and I'm confident that they're all clear on our priorities and that they're the right people to help us achieve our mission. 
Prior to last year's issues, Chipotle had the strongest economic model in the industry. Of course, this model has been weakened due to lower sales volumes that we have seen this year. While it's critical to fully restore sales volumes and keep improving them from there, we also know that we need to improve our economic model now so that we can provide healthy returns even at lower volumes. Key to restoring our business model is making sure that we are being as efficient as we can with our financial resources but doing so without compromising the strength of our support teams and field leadership. We are using this crisis as an opportunity to take a critical and disciplined look at how we manage our financial resources, and we've established the goal of saving $100 million across operational, G&A and CapEx expenditures. These cost savings will not detract from the customer experience. Instead, we're finding these savings in a number of areas, including disciplined staffing in support departments and field leadership, better business terms with suppliers, operational efficiencies and new restaurant designs that remain true to our brand but have lower investment costs. This more disciplined approach to managing the expenses will allow us to strengthen our economic model to the benefit of shareholders while not compromising our ability to deliver an excellent customer experience.
Finally, we continue to believe that expanding Chipotle in Europe holds a lot of promise for our future. But we know that to best ensure our success there, we need to provide the area with more strategic attention. For this reason, we recently hired as Managing Director in Europe, Jim Slater, a proven industry leader who ran successful operations for Costa Coffee and led Costa to become the #1 coffee brand in the U.K. Jim will be working to develop our European markets into an investable growth strategy. We're excited to have Jim on board leading our European team, and together, they will work to determine the best strategy for our continued development in Europe. 
Through all of these initiatives, we are confident that the plan we have in place to drive our recovery is the right plan, and we know that we have proven leaders throughout this company who can inspire a culture of excellence and help lead the way to recovery. I'm confident that through our progress towards providing a better guest experience all of the time, increasing sales through marketing and strengthening our unit economic model, we will dramatically improve returns for our shareholders in the months and years ahead. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

I'm very glad to be back, and I'm eager to share with all of you some of the important work that we're doing to bring customers back and restore our brand image.

I'm sorry that I caused a distraction for the company, and I want you all to know that I've put this behind me, learned from it and return to my role in early September excited and with a renewed focus and determination to help drive Chipotle's recovery. I want to thank you all for your support and forgiveness, which has meant a great deal to me. 
Today, I'm going to recap the marketing activities from Q3, and then I'm going to talk about several important breakthroughs with regard to customer data, technology and restaurant design before reviewing development expectations. 
During the quarter, we successfully concluded the Chiptopia Summer Rewards program designed to restore the frequency of our most loyal customers. In all, we had just under 6 million participants, with more than 2.5 million of those earning rewards on the program. We issued 340,000 super rewards for customers who maintained higher frequency levels, including more than 75,000 catering for 20 rewards. We're excited by the potential positive brand impact of 75,000 catering parties over the coming 6 months. Throughout the course of the promotion, we saw increased transaction and frequency levels, but most important, we have nearly returned to precrisis levels among our most loyal customers. After the completion of the program, we anticipated traffic to fall slightly, but we have instead seen our improved sales levels generally continue to hold, which is very encouraging. 
During the quarter, we ran 3 marketing campaigns, each with different but complementary objectives. The first was the food safety advancements campaign Monty referred to, which was designed to communicate what we have done to ensure the safety of our food. The campaign was broad reaching, with more than 90 million impressions. Lapsed customers engaged more than any others with the video component of the campaign. The results of the campaign are positive, and we will continue to communicate the benefits of our food safety program so that every customer can rest assured that our food is as safe as possible. 
The second campaign surrounded our Love Story animated short film, which was distributed through digital media, social channels and in movie theaters across the country. The film has been viewed more than 60 million times and has proven to be highly effective at building trust in the Chipotle brand. The campaign also included the Love Story game, which challenges players to match fresh ingredients while avoiding fake ones. The game launched earlier this month and quickly surpassed the initial results of our popular Friend or Faux online game from the summer of 2015. Millions of people have played the Love Story game, and more than 3 million BOGO rewards have been earned by playing the game. More than 35% of those have already been redeemed. 
The third campaign running during Q3 was the Ingredients Reign campaign, which is designed to increase visits to Chipotle and build brand trust by focusing on the higher quality -- high quality of our delicious ingredients. Ingredients Reign is running across nearly all media channels, including outdoor, radio, print, digital, social and theaters. Both Love Story and Ingredients Reign campaigns exceeded our expectations. And for this reason, both campaigns have been extended to run through much of the rest of the year. 
Finally, with regard to Q3, I'd like to provide an update on our latest consumer research. Admiration scores and serves healthy and nutritious food attributes have nearly returned to precrisis levels. Agreements that we have appropriately addressed the food safety issues increased to 90%. Sentiment on social media is increasingly positive, and press mentions were 80% positive last month. Both are at or near precrisis levels. However, consideration still lags precrisis levels by more than 10%, though it is up slightly for the quarter. 
Moving on to Q4 and beyond, we're releveraging significant improvements in our customer data capabilities along with a shift in marketing strategy to aggressively target new and lapsed customers. By combining transactional information with other customer data, we are now able to identify more than half of our customers and reach them with specific offers and tailored messages. This important breakthrough not only allows us to target messages and offers to current and lapsed customers, but it also allows us to accurately measure the effectiveness of those efforts by tracking return visits. We have already delivered 2 targeted campaigns using this data, and we are continuing to refine our programs in real time. But this new customer data has implications well beyond more targeted and measurable marketing. The data allows us to very accurately measure customer frequency and details about their orders and behavior. For example, using the data, we now know that during the last 6 months, we saw nearly 30 million new customers at Chipotle. These new customers are customers who we have not seen since before the food safety events of last year. In fact, transactions from these customers accounted for nearly half of all transactions over the last 6 months. Additionally, we know how many of these customers return to Chipotle for additional visits and how many of them became regular customers. When combined with our marketing and advertising efforts, this detailed view into frequency and behavior allows us to evaluate the return on various marketing and promotional activities. 
Beyond customer data, we have also now begun to benefit from the strengthening of our technology infrastructure. In just a matter of days, we are launching a new online ordering experience that makes ordering and paying for Chipotle from any mobile device easier and faster. This mobile optimized website works on any recent web-enabled device, and it requires no app download. The new ordering experience offers a beautiful and intuitive way to order from Chipotle. This new ordering experience is in addition to our existing apps for iOS and Android that currently have a combined user base of more than 2.6 million people. 
Additionally, our test of smarter pickups -- pickup -- I'm sorry. Additionally, our test of smarter pick-up times has concluded, and we are in the process of rolling this technology out nationwide. Smarter pick-up times allow us to adjust the wait time between order placement and pickup times based on the demand and capacity of a given restaurant at a given time. This means that the customer is always presented with the shortest possible time between order placement and pickup. Smarter pickup times works with our iOS and Android apps as well as our new online ordering and, when combined with the advanced second make line Steve described earlier, has significant potential to increase our online ordering volumes and improve the customer experience. We expect smarter pickup times will be rolled out nationwide by January. 
Recent advancements in our technology infrastructure are also going to have a significant impact on the customer experience of ordering catering at Chipotle. Next month, we will enable online ordering and payment for catering, which previously was only available via phone and required in-store payment. The ability to order and pay for catering online will dramatically improve the customer experience while simultaneously decreasing our call center costs. The next step with catering is offer delivery, and tests are currently under way. Both catering and mobile ordering will receive significant marketing to support -- support during Q4, a time of year where we typically see an increase in catering volume ahead of the holiday season. 
We have also been supporting the national rollout of chorizo, and we're excited by the results. As Steve mentioned, chorizo currently accounts for about 7% of sales, and customer's response has been very positive. 84% of customers who tried chorizo liked it, and 70% of those who tried it say that chorizo increases their desire to visit Chipotle, and 77% say that the new offering makes them feel more favorably towards Chipotle. Because of these strong results, we plan to increase the reach of our chorizo advertising campaign by more than 400%. 
Next, I'd like to talk about television advertising and the test that's currently under way. We recognize the need for wide-reaching efforts to invite new customers to Chipotle. The fact that nearly 30 million new or lapsed customers visited Chipotle over the last 6 months shows the customers are responding to our advertising and promotional efforts. But in order to accelerate that momentum, we are considering a national -- we are considering national television advertising. Because our Ingredients Reign campaign tested positively in terms of customer reception and brand trust, we are running a 30-second ad from that campaign in multiple test markets. If the tests reveal that television advertising delivers the results we want, we may begin to integrate national television buys into our advertising campaigns. 
You may also be aware that we are currently undertaking a review of advertising agencies. While we are pleased with our current agency partners, we have developed a robust new marketing strategy for 2017. And in order to ensure that we have the absolute best creative work on that strategy, we're reviewing potential new partners. The review will be complete by the end of the year and in time for the launch of a new campaign in the spring of 2017. 
Going forward, we believe that there will be opportunities to incorporate new menu items into our overall marketing. We have been encouraged by the response we have seen with chorizo and see an opportunity to build excitement among existing customers and attract new customers through the thoughtful addition of menu items that are consistent with our brand. Any new menu item will be accompanied by extensive advertising campaigns designed not only to tout the menu additions but to excite customers about coming into Chipotle. 
Finally, I'd like to report on the successful launch of a new restaurant design that has been in development for more than a year. The new design is an evolution of the current design with improvements in lighting, acoustics, seating, customer flow and the presentation of our kitchen. Additionally, the new design is more cost effective with an average cost of $760,000, which is about $40,000 less expensive than our current restaurant design. We also anticipate a reduction in maintenance and repairs as a result of this new design. This new restaurant design is already open in certain locations and under construction in several others. We expect that more than 50 new locations in 2017 will utilize this design, and even more than that will benefit from some aspects of the new design. 
Our new restaurants have been performing at approximately 73% of our comp restaurant volumes, slightly lower than precrisis levels. But in areas where we have increased marketing of our new restaurant openings, that performance has improved, and we are closing the gap with those precrisis levels. In total, we are planning to open between 195 and 210 new restaurants in 2017. As our returns on new restaurants have compressed this year along with our margins, we've lowered the number of restaurants we plan to open. We will continue to focus on opening up the best potential sites that combine a lower risk profile with the highest possible returns. And even with our lower sales levels in 2016, we are not seeing a marked increase in cannibalization of opening new restaurants, which remains at less than 1% nationally. Most important, we view this reduction in new restaurant openings as temporary. Our long-term development pipeline remains robust, and with our new lower-cost restaurant design, we are setting our new restaurants up to achieve even higher levels of return on investment. We strongly believe that the ultimate potential for Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. could total 5,000.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Jack."

When the year began, we described 2016 as a year where we will make significant investments to ensure our food is safe and encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. We knew these significant investments would put additional pressure on",2947,"Thanks, Mark. When the year began, we described 2016 as a year where we will make significant investments to ensure our food is safe and encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. We knew these significant investments would put additional pressure on our margins in the form of elevated food costs, higher advertising and promotion costs and higher labor costs to serve our returning customers. We intentionally did not emphasize restaurant efficiencies and even encouraged extra staffing in our restaurants during -- throughout promotion peaks because we did not want to risk trading a few points of margin on the P&L in return for disappointing a customer who visits an understaffed restaurant. The sales decline from buying with these investments and inefficiencies have resulted in significant declines to our margins. As we near the end of 2016 and we begin to look ahead to 2017, we'll continue to do all we can to restore customer trust and recover customer visits. We also are committed to take important steps to restore our economic model. With the strategies you've heard Steve, Monty and Mark talk about, we believe we can deliver comp in the high single-digit range for the full year in 2017.  Of course, we hope these strategies will deliver an even greater sales increase, but we believe this comp projection represents a stretched yet responsible goal. 
With the focus on delivering greater efficiencies in our restaurants, identifying cost savings in everything we buy in our restaurants and in our offices, supporting our growing restaurant base with flat G&A and beginning to normalize our promotion and advertising, we expect to deliver a restaurant-level margin of 20% and EPS of $10 in 2017. While these projected results do not fully restore our economic model, it's an important step in the right direction. We continue to believe we can, over time, fully recover our restaurant margin as sales recover. From the unit economic standpoint, these projected results would lead to an average restaurant volume of around $2 million and restaurant ROI of around 50%, and the return potential for new stores is even greater as we expect the average new store investment to decline to around $760,000 in 2017. 
I'll talk more about what's expected in 2017 and in Q4, but now let me recap our results for the third quarter. During the third quarter, we reported sales of $1.04 billion, a 15% decrease from the third quarter of 2015. Our reported sales were reduced by $11.5 million because of deferred revenue related to our summer Chiptopia promotion. As a reminder, Chiptopia ended on September 30, and we recorded deferred revenues associated with rewards earned but not yet redeemed. These rewards can be redeemed or will expire over the next 6 months, and the deferred revenue will be recognized over this period. As a result, we reported a negative same-store sales comp of negative 21.9%, which included a negative 0.8% impact from the revenue deferral. The Q3 comp is comprised of July down 23.8%, and that includes 100 basis points from the revenue deferral; August was down 21.7%, which includes 70 basis points from the revenue deferral; and September was down 20.1%, which includes 70 basis points from the deferral. And while October comps for the first 2 weeks were affected by Hurricane Matthew and were down about 21%, the past 10 days have recovered and normalized and were down around 19%. While we're not satisfied with still being down around 19%, we continue see small but steady progress month after month. As a side note, July had improved the declines in the 21% range in the weeks before our Q2 earnings report but then was impacted by a negative month-end trading day effect. Plus comparing to our Friends and -- Friends or Faux BOGO from 2015, which ran the last week of July and into early August, it was also impacted by the Chiptopia revenue deferral.
Our traffic trends have also steadily improved and were down 15.2% overall in the quarter compared to down 19.6% in June. Transactions improved to 13.4% in September and, most recently, are running down 14% in the past week or so. Chiptopia helped drive the sales and transaction improvement in the quarter as our most loyal customers returned to their historic frequency pattern as Mark mentioned.
On a regional basis, we continue to see wide variances in the progress of the recovery with comp sales in the Midwest and middle regions of the country down in the 17% range since September, outperforming the coastal areas, especially in the Pacific Coast and the North East, which are down closer to the 24% to 25% range in September. 
From a transaction standpoint, there are several markets, including Kansas City and Chicago, Denver and Minneapolis, where traffic is now down only in the high single digits. We know that restoring customer habits takes time, and to help ensure that renewed habits established during Chiptopia for our most loyal customers continue to hold, The Love Story campaign that Mark mentioned was launched this month. Although hard to estimate customers' behavior in October from only a few weeks of data, so far, our high-frequency customers are continuing to visit this month with similar frequency to September. 
Restaurant-level margin was 14.1%, down from 15.5% in the second quarter of this year. The deferred revenue related to Chiptopia negatively impacted our restaurant-level margin by nearly 100 basis points, so underlying margin was 15.1%. The remaining decline from Q2's margin of 15.5% is due to higher marketing and promo costs related to Chiptopia and higher food costs. Food costs were 35.1% of sales. But excluding the impact of the deferred revenue, underlying food cost was 34.7%. This represents a slight sequential increase from Q2 of 50 basis points primarily due to much higher costs for avocados. Avocado supply declined during the summer. We began to experience higher pricing, although we had hoped that this would be a temporary spike. In recent weeks, though, supply has become even tighter and pricing has become much more volatile than expected. In fact, we have seen that some competitors recently have posted signs on their doors saying they're out of avocados altogether. We have remained in supply of avocados, but case pricing has risen from an average of about $30 per case during the first half of the year to a case pricing approaching $80 this month. Because of these higher avocado prices, food cost will remain above 35% in Q4 before seeing relief in early 2017. 
Our labor costs for the quarter were 27.6% of sales, up from 22.2% of sales last year. Without the revenue deferral, labor costs were 27.3% of sales. Sales deleverage accounted for approximately 300 basis points, and the remaining increase relates to inflation and additional labor related to Chiptopia and other promotions. Underlying wage inflation was in the 5% to 6% range in the quarter. Labor was about $9 million higher in Q3 versus Q2 this year to support higher sales levels as our transaction trends continue to improve. We also had increased labor as we return to prepping produce inside of the restaurants, and we also had increased labor with the higher promo level activity of Chiptopia. In prior year, total labor dollars had been relatively flat from the second quarter to the third quarter. 
Other operating expenses as a percent of sales were 16% during the quarter, an increase from 11.1% last year. About 290 basis points of the year-over-year increase is due to sales deleverage. Marketing promo expenses combined were 4.8% of sales during the quarter, which is double the rate of marketing and promo from the prior year, and it was 50 basis points higher than Q2 due to Chiptopia. In Q4, we anticipate our marketing and promo will remain at about the same level as we test TV in a few markets. Also, as we invest in ads supporting chorizo and as the Chiptopia earned rewards are redeemed and expensed in our promo line. 
G&A costs for the quarter were $78.4 million or 7.6% as a percent of sale. Underlying G&A, excluding stock comp, was $61.9 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we held our biannual All Managers' Conference, which totaled about $10 million, and $8 million of that was expensed in the third quarter. And as a reminder, this conference will not be held in 2017, although we traditionally hold a smaller field leadership conference, which we expect would cost between $1 million and $2 million. Excluding this year's AMC, our G&A was flat year-to-date on a total dollar basis compared to 2015 despite supporting an additional 247 new restaurants opened over the past year. 
We froze our support headcount early in the summer and had been actively prioritizing where we invest our support to ensure that we're investing and providing an excellent guest experience and recovering sales. As we look ahead to 2017, we are planning to continue to keep our underlying G&A expenses before stock comp flat compared to 2016 and lower on a percent of sales basis despite growing our restaurant base by another 200 restaurants. 
For the full year 2016, we estimate our effective tax rate will be 38.2%, in line with 2015. The full year 2016 estimated effective tax rate benefited from additional federal tax credits earned and a tax benefit from previously earned California state tax credits that we now estimate will be realized, and they were offset by higher state tax rate. We currently anticipate the full year 2017 effective tax rate will be 39.5%, and this higher expected rate in 2017 does not include the benefit of the previously mentioned tax credits related to prior year. 
Third quarter net income was $7.8 million, and diluted earnings per share was $0.27. This included the negative impact of $0.23 related to revenue deferral and a negative impact of $0.29 for the impairment of ShopHouse. Before these adjustments, Q3 EPS was $0.79 or $0.08 lower than Q2 of this year due to the agency costs, the cost of Chiptopia and higher avocado costs. As of September 30, we maintained $609.8 million of cash and investments. During the quarter, we generated cash from operations of $101 million and generated free cash flow of $36 million. We also repurchased $70.3 million of our stock during the quarter at an average price of $409 per share. Over the life of our share repurchase program, we've repurchased $1.9 billion of our stock at an average price of $289 per share. We'll continue to manage our balance sheet to invest in our sales recovery, grow our business and opportunistically return cash to shareholders via share repurchases. Recently, our Board of Directors approved an additional $100 million of repurchase authorization, and as of yesterday's close and including the additional approval, we now have $154.6 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead to Q4, we'll begin to compare against last year's comp of negative 14.6%. So of course, our comp will improve against that stock comparison and will likely be in the negative low single digits. Margins are expected to remain in the mid-teens as the benefit of a continued, steady sales recovery and the reversal of the deferred revenue from Q3 will be offset by Q4 having seasonally lower average daily sales. G&A will be about $10 million lower than Q3 because of the AMC expense not recurring and slightly lower stock comp. And we believe the EPS will improve to around $1 per share. Avocado pricing is the big wild card as every $10 per case price movement, up or down, will impact the EPS by $0.17. 
As I mentioned earlier, 2016 has been a year of significant investment in food safety and restoring customer trust and recovering customer visits. It has been a difficult year in terms of margins and earnings, driven by lower sales, including related deleverage and the impact on these significant investments. We will continue to work harder to recover our sales, shifting our strategy from giveaways, discounts and rewards to new menu items; technology-driven convenience; better operations, including faster throughput; and more aggressive brand marketing, including TV. We know that fully restoring our previously industry-leading economic model depends on fully recovering our sales. We feel confident that we have the teams in place to execute our strategies in 2017 and achieve a high single-digit comp sales increase at 20% restaurant-level margin and a $10 EPS. Our comp target will not be an easy hurdle to meet and, of course, we're not in complete control of it. But we are in control of how we manage our restaurants, and we are in control of how we manage our expenses both in the restaurant and with our support G&A. To earn a full year 2017 target of 20% restaurant-level operating margin, we need to earn about 50 basis points of additional margin versus the current underlying run rate of about 15%. 
We will recover this 500 basis points in several ways. First, by effective scheduling of our crews to ensure we have the right staff at the right time to deliver an excellent guest experience but also to ensure we're not ever overstaffed, especially during low sales periods. We can manage our food costs more effectively by reducing waste; by ordering, prepping and cooking the correct quantities throughout the day; by cooking to ideal temperatures, which not only makes our food taste better, it also results in avoiding unnecessary yield loss. We can also more effectively manage smaller but important restaurant costs such as repairs and maintenance and kitchen supplies, which is growing faster than sales in recent year. We have invested heavily in training our field leaders recently to effectively manage the business culture in the restaurants they oversee. These field leaders spent 2 full days in what we have called a business boot camp, and they have been training their GMs and reinforcing how to create an excellent guest experience while effectively managing their P&L. 
We also expect promo costs, which are another operating costs, will normalize in 2017 as we reduce reliance on giveaways and discounts. And marketing will either normalize or will remain at elevated levels in support of efforts such as TV advertising, which, we would expect, will result in higher sales and create leverage on the rest of the P&L. In addition, we have an internal goal of saving at lease $100 million from recurring annual cost. This includes a review of everything we buy, both in the restaurants and in our offices. It also includes capital expenditures, including the new, more efficient restaurant design Mark mentioned, which will reduce our investment costs from over $800,000 to around $760,000 in 2017, a savings of nearly 2,000 -- or I'm sorry, savings of nearly $10 million in 2017 alone. 
As I mentioned previously, we plan to keep our underlying G&A cost before stock comp flat from 2016 to 2017. In dollar terms, that would result in G&A before stock comp of around $220 million in 2017. We chose not to fill about 100 staff positions this year, which were vacated via turnover and not refilled or were approved in 2015 but were unfilled headcount adds, all of which will save around $10 million annually and will help our underlying G&A dollars remain at the current level. 
Our teams are effectively supporting our restaurants by stretching the ratios a bit and focusing only on those activities that maintain safer food, lead to a better guest experience to grow sales or strengthen our economic model. We increased our field support significantly over the past 3 years and have nearly the lowest ratio of stores per field support staff than we've had in 10 years. We currently have nearly 300 field leaders, which include the area managers, team leaders and impressive [ph] team leads. So even as we build 200 new restaurants, on average, the field leader ratio will increase by less than 1 restaurant per field leader in 2017. Our restaurant teams and support teams are responding well to the challenge of more effectively managing costs and are energized by helping us restore our business. As we challenge our restaurant managers at the AMC, one of our restaurateurs, Philip Esposito [ph], from our Newbury Park restaurant in California reached out to me the very day after the conference with an idea to simplify some of our back-office functions. His idea affects every restaurant and will save us more than $1 million across the country -- across the entire company. And I've seen similar commitments throughout the company in our restaurant and in our offices to be more disciplined and more discerning with every dollar we spend, and everyone feels ownership to do their part to help strengthen our economic model while we work to bring our customers back. We're confident that the approach we're taking will help restore our margins and our earning capabilities without taking away from the customer experience. In fact, the techniques our field leaders are teaching will result in scheduling and deploying the restaurant teams to deliver the best experience and the most delicious, safest food possible, which also leads to a better financial result. These efforts will allow us to generate respectable results in 2017, but more importantly, we believe we will ultimately emerge from this challenge stronger than ever as our cost structure will be leaner, we will be more focused than ever and our skill level throughout the company will be sharper, and our economic model with sales fully restored will be stronger than ever.

We're going to focus on fundamentals and try to continually deliver a better experience through that method, but we also want to try new things, again, to get some customers who may have lapsed, to reinvigorate our regular customers, to encourage them to come more and perhaps to even entice new customers who haven't tried Chipotle. It's important that when you add something to the restaurant, you take something away. And although with the addition of new menu items, we're not going to take away other menu items. There are things that we can do to create efficiencies in the way we prep, in the way we get ready for business, in the way we find leverage. Finding leverage is interesting because there've been suggestions that we add breakfast, for instance. Well, I'm not saying that we won't add breakfast, but when trying to find leverage, our second make line now has an enormous opportunity. The second make line can attract or provide for catering or delivery, or the mobile app to enable customers that are in line to get out of line and go to a tablet and probably things that we haven't thought of yet. It's extraordinary leverage because the labor to produce the food is much less at the second make line because of the new technology. So my point is that you need to -- you balance everything in the restaurants, and so we will make some things more efficient so we will be able to add things like a dessert item or a new menu item. Again, if you look at some other examples of fast-food places getting too complicated, I don't think they kept this idea of taking away whenever you add something. So on balance, you still have the same amount of ability to focus on delivering the extraordinary experience that we've been accustomed to."

The new menu items, I wouldn't worry that we're going to slip into the traditional fast-food model of introducing multiple new menu items wrapped with advertising multiple times a year. Our business really doesn't support that anyway just because it's really a one price for everything you get at Chipotle unless you get something extra like meat or guacamole. So we really don't have the ability even if we wanted to, to add lots and lots of menu items. However, there is a considerable amount of value to being able to advertise to people or to market to people something new, and we've seen it now with chorizo. It's been very effective, which is why I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're going to increase the amount of reach of that campaign 4x. And what it does is it gives people a reason to reconsider Chipotle or just to add it to their routine where they may have dropped on occasion, and we're seeing it to be very effective. And so I wouldn't worry that you're going to see switching to this model of repetitive menu additions with lots and lots of advertising around them, but there is a real value that we've seen now very tangibly with chorizo in terms of adding something new every now and then. So I really wouldn't worry that it's going to be a change -- a complete change in strategy at all."

So the second make line that Steve referred to, we've had one in our restaurants for many, many years the classic version. This new version is much more efficient. Whether or not you have the tech component added to it or not, it's just a better layout. It's got bigger bins. It's set up to be more efficient. And that new line actually is slightly cheaper than our existing second make line. And so that line, that is without all the technology component on it is actually a little bit cheaper than our existing line. And so we're going to move quickly to have all of our restaurants outfitted with that new line starting in March of 2017. So all new restaurants will have it, and then we're going to selectively retrofit high-volume restaurants with it over the coming year. And so I think it's going to be relatively quick. Now what I just described was the line itself without the technology component. It's completely set up to handle it. We add that line to the restaurants. And then as we see fit, we can add the technology component to it, and it's not a tremendously expensive addition as well. And so you're not going to see lots and lots of the need to build big kiosks in the front of the house, that sort of thing, because this system, actually, whether you're using it from a tablet inside the restaurant or from your phone in your pocket uses the -- a very, very similar ordering system to the one I described in my call, the new online ordering site that we've developed. And so there's very, very little overall investment in this thing, and I believe that we can turn it around fairly efficiently as we roll it into our restaurants."

We think the labor is going to be neutral. We think, over time, it's going to be a laborsaving. The labor per sale of dollars on the second make line is more efficient than labor per sale of dollars on the front make line. Even though this is early on, what the teams have shown so far with this new approach is they can produce food a lot faster, more accurately, and so there's really built-in efficiencies. If we didn't have second make line, I would say this would be a major undertaking. It'd be a lot of training, and it would take quite some time. The fact that virtually all the restaurants already have a second make line, and what they're doing right now, they're struggling to make the food in the second make line with a little piece of paper with a lot of abbreviations. What they're going to get instead of that is they're going to have a very clear indicator with display screens, and so they're going to be doing the same things they always have. And with the restaurant that was retrofitted in New York, the teams have intuitively stopped, just gravitated towards the display screens and just intuitively just kind of made the food they -- the way they always would except they weren't stopping like in between every ingredient or 2 to look at this little bitty piece of paper that's on the size of a register receipt. So it's early, but so far, we don't think there is going to be an increase in labor. The equipment cost is not that expensive. There will be an impact on depreciation, depending on how many we can roll out, but it's not going to be significant, not something that's going to affect our ability to get to the $10 EPS."

It's a relatively small customer group, but it's a group that comes very often. When we look at -- we slice and dice our customer group a number of different ways. And when we look at our customer group, for those customers that come at least a couple of times a month to one time per week or greater as one group, another group would be some -- a customer that comes, say, once a month, another group would come 2 to 3 times a month, and another group would come once per every 6 months. When you take that most frequent group -- by the way, all of those groups were negatively affected by 25 -- anywhere between 20% and 25%, meaning they all dropped down their visit frequency. And in case of the infrequent customer, we just lost customers. And we lost them to the tune of about 20% to 25%. After Chiptopia, we recovered to a point of -- where our most frequent customers were back to 95% to where they were before. Now some infrequent customers did not increase their frequency, but we were able to see some customers that were not coming as often as, let's say, once per week, now were coming once per week. So we don't have the exact same customers we had before. One thing we've learned as we've gone through and we've gathered this data, mined this data that Mark talked about, we found that we have kind of a constant movement of customers that are coming. Some are coming more frequently. Some are coming less. What Chiptopia did was encourage those customers either were coming frequently and reduced, a lot of them did come back. And then we encouraged some that were coming a couple of times per month to come at least once per week or more. But if you look at that most loyal customer group that come in multiple times per month, that group, we've recovered 95%. Now the rest of the group is a much, much, much larger group of customers that come much less frequent. That's why the things that Mark talked about make so much sense. That's why TV advertising makes sense. That's why advertising things like chorizo, which is new news, makes a lot of sense. Dessert -- once we decide which dessert we want to go with to try to go beyond a test market, these are things that you can advertise and appeal to a broad group of customers. And so that's what our approach is to get that much, much larger, tens of millions of customers to come to Chipotle, and so we can recover that group as well. And then in terms of the comp, we don't have any menu price built into the comp at all."

John, when you -- an interesting thing which I mentioned in my remarks, I think, that's worth noting is that over the last 6 months, we saw 30 million customers that were either new or people that we hadn't seen before come into Chipotle, and this is -- thanks to this new data capability that we have. And additionally, we're now able to reach a very large number of those people. And so we have dramatically improved our ability to reach out to these customers. And they're in all frequency categories. By the way, this 30 million people range from 1 to more than 10 times in terms of number of visits during that 6-month period. So they're all across the different frequency bands, but we have such an extraordinary new ability to reach them that we're evaluating exactly how best to use that in order to create incentives for them. And we don't want to rely on a continuing basis on discounting. There's -- obviously, that cheapens the brand and creates a sense of entitlement ultimately such that people just begin to expect it. And so we're very carefully evaluating how that's going to look. But to answer your question, I would say yes, we're going to look at how we can use this new information we have about our customers and this really amazing ability to track whether or not what we do with them drives them in. So we can determine now with a very high degree of fidelity whether or not an offer or an ad of a particular type or any other type of promotion or communication actually resulted in a visit from these customers. And so I don't want to commit right now to exactly what we're going to do because we're -- it's really just been over the last few months that we've developed this capability, but we're absolutely going to use it in a way that allows us to create ongoing incentives to create the momentum for these less frequent customers become more frequent. I'm very excited about just the simple idea that so many new customers came to Chipotle. I mean, it says a couple of things to me. I mean, first, it says -- even though it's tempting to think that, well, people are still reluctant to come to Chipotle. With that volume of people coming in as new customers, I think that's unlikely. That's showing a pretty major shift in people's attitude. But also those somewhat infrequent new customers have extraordinary potential to become frequent. They're the ones who have the potential to create great comps for us in the future, and so we're going to be doing whatever we can to make their stay at Chipotle as enjoyable as possible. So I can't give you a firm answer, but I hope that helps you understand sort of how we're going to be looking at it."

I think, though, that as I mentioned in answering the last question, we've seen very, very large numbers of new customers experiencing Chipotle. And so I think there's extraordinary potential for us to continue bringing in large groups of new customers, and that's the reason why we're currently testing television. And television isn't a panacea. It's going to be a component of larger campaigns that we do, but it's very efficient when we get to the level of doing it nationally. And so I believe that, that probably has some of the most significant potential for us to bring in lots and lots and lots of new customers. And then assuming that we create a great experience for them when they come in the restaurant, they will then turn into more and more frequent customers. So I suspect that amongst those things, that has huge potential. But I will follow that with a very close second, which would be the increase in our digital promotion and the capability of online ordering. And I just want to take a second to tell you a little bit more about what I'm talking about with regard, for example, to smarter pickup times, which is the ability for somebody to come in to Chipotle and get an order very quickly after they ordered it. We've been conducting a test over the last several months of this technology. And through our analysis of that, we found that when people place orders at Chipotle, there's a very significant lag between when they place the order and when our restaurants allow them to come pick it up. This new technology actually eliminates our restaurant's ability to set that time gap and instead sets it automatically based on the load of the restaurant. And so we're seeing the potential to do as many as one entrée per minute using this new system. And so the marketing that goes around that, that encourages people to place their orders via digital, assuming then, again, those orders are fulfilled in this efficient and excellent way, I think, has a tremendous amount of potential. So I put that as a close second to the top-of-mind marketing that we're going to be doing."

And I won't go through the technical details as to why it's more efficient both for us and for the customer. But having gotten over that hurdle actually enables us to do a lot of the things we talked about without further technological investment. Now I do want to caution, though, that, of course, when you're adding anything that consumers are interacting with and new technology for customers, there's always room for things to go wrong.

And then bigger-picture question. As you shift the focus next year to a little bit more on the unit-level economics, are you coming to accept that the base level of average unit buys and base level of restaurant margins may be lower and resetting that as the bar from what you'll grow going forward? Is this somewhat of a concession that recovering to full sales level seems less likely?"

We're also -- we are just recognizing that in the meantime, though, it moves us to do everything we can to be as efficient as we can be so as to drive the very best margin possible even during a time where our volume is still negatively affected. But like I said in my remarks, we're not going to -- we're not going to drive those costs down to the point where we're negatively affecting the guest experience or the ability our field teams have in order to continue to create really great restaurant teams and have great restaurant operations."

But I would expect us to be at more of this kind of steady level. We'll want to keep a strong balance sheet somewhere in the $0.5 billion [indiscernible] little higher on the balance sheet, and I will take excess cash flow and use that. So if you -- if in your model, if you take excess cash flow and assume that we kind of keep within the balance sheet or about within the balance sheet today and use any excess to buy back stock, I think it'll be in the ballpark of what we'll actually do. Now we'll be more optimistic, and we'll be more aggressive if the stock drops and less aggressive when the stock increases, but generally, that's the approach we'll take."
