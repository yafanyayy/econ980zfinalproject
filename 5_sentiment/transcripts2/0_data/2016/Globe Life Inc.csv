In the fourth quarter, net operating income from all operations was $131 million or $1.05 per share, a per share increase of 5% from a year ago. During the fourth quarter, management determined that the Part D business met the criteria to be held for sale and has classified it as discontinued operations. Net operating income from continuing operations, which excludes Part D, was $131 million or $1.05 per share, up 6% on a per share basis from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $133 million or $1.07 per share, a 5% decline on a per-share basis. The decline was due primarily to the fact that we had $11 million of tax-driven realized losses in the fourth quarter of this year compared to a gain of $5 million in the year-ago quarter.
With fixed maturities that amortized cost, our return on equity at December 31 was 14.5% and our book value per share was $30.09, an 8% increase from a year ago. 
On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities and market value, book value per share was $32.71, a decline of 10% from a year ago. 
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5.5% to $521 million while life underwriting margins was $145 million, up 6.3% from a year ago. Net life sales increased 2% to $99 million. 
On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $235 million and health underwriting margin was up $51 million, approximately the same as a year ago. Health sales declined 17% to $60 million due to declining group sales. Individual health sales were $38 million, up 20%. 
Administrative expenses were $48 million for the quarter, up 9% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.3% compared to 6.1% a year ago. The primary reasons for the increase in administrative expenses are higher information technology and pension costs. 
For the full year, administrative expenses were $186 million or 6.2% of premium. In 2016, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 5% and to remain around 6.2% of premium.

308916,323445037,926716,"Torchmark Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less acquired interest on policy, liabilities and debt, was $54 million compared to $55",883,"I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less acquired interest on policy, liabilities and debt, was $54 million compared to $55 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was flat.
As discussed on previous calls, the Part D segment has had a negative impact on excess investment income due to negative cash flows that occurred during the year, including the long delay of receiving reimbursements from CMS for excess claims paid by the company. The impact of the loss investment income from the delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in income from continuing operations rather than discontinued operations, in accordance the applicable accounting rules. 
In 2015, Part D had a negative impact on excess investment income of approximately $8 million. In 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 1% to 3%. However, on a per share basis, we should see the increase of about 6% to 8%. 
At the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, we're expecting a drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $8 million to $9 million.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $13.8 billion, including $13.3 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. At the fixed maturities, $12.6 billion are investment grade, with an average rating of A minus. And below investment grade bonds were $640 million, compared to $561 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.8% compared to 4.4% a year ago.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.6x, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 17%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A, same as a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $506 million, approximately $408 million less than at the end of the third quarter.
To complete the investment portfolio discussion, I'd like to address our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. As a result of spreads widening in the fourth quarter, the net unrealized loss of our energy portfolio increased by $122 million to a total of $165 million at December 31. However, we believe the risk of realizing a losses in the foreseeable future is minimal for the following reasons. $1.5 billion or 94% of our energy holdings are investment grade. Only $143 million or 9% of our energy holdings are in the oilfield service and drilling sector. Approximately 70% of these bonds are investment grade. 
Also, based on the consensus of expert views, our investment believes that oil is more likely to increase to $45 to $50 a barrel during the next 12 to 24 months as they remain at current levels. We believe the company portfolio can continue to operate for very long time with oil prices at $45 to $50 a barrel. Even if oil remains around $30 a barrel for the next 12 to 24 months, we would not expect to have any defaults during that period.
Finally, the copies we have invested in have a variety of options that they can utilize to avoid default, including but not limited to, reducing distributions to partners, drawing of lines of credits and reducing exploration activities. Now we do believe that there can be further downgrades, which could pressure our RBC ratio. However, that doesn't mean we would have to suspend or materially impact our stock buyback program. Frank will address this in more detail when he discusses capital. 
Now investment yield in the fourth quarter, we invested $341 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sector. We invested at an average yield of 5%, an average rating of A- and an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.81%, down 8 basis points from the 5.89% yield in the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.83%. The midpoint of our current guidance for 2016 assumes increasing money yield throughout the year, averaging 5.25% for the full year.
We continue to hope for higher interest rates. As discussed on previous analyst calls, rising new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven reflected on the balance sheet, since we would not expect to convert them to realized losses. we got to be intent, and more important, the ability to hold our investments through. However, if rates don't rise, a continued lower interest rate environment will impact our income statement but not the balance sheet. This would primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60. We don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or to put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
We're we will benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark will continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low-interest-rate environment.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $58.68. For the full year, we spent $359 milli",1442,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $58.68. For the full year, we spent $359 million of parent company cash to acquire 6.3 million shares at an average price of $56.99.
The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $46 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate additional free cash flow during the remainder of 2016. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders.
While our 2015 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect free cash flow in 2016 to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Thus, included in the $46 million available from assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have $366 million to $376 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. This level of free cash flow in 2016 is lower than recent years, due to lower distributable statutory earnings at our subsidiaries in 2015. 
As we've discussed on prior calls, a key driver of the lower earnings is higher commission and acquisition expenses associated with the higher levels of sales growth we have experienced in 2014 and 2015, coupled with lower growth rates and investment income due to lower new money yields and adverse Part D cash flows. Another significant driver of the lower earnings is higher federal income tax expense in 2015 as compared to 2014. 
At this time, we anticipate that statutory earnings in 2016 will be approximately the same as 2015, as the profits from recent sales start to emerge. The incremental impact of new sales lessons and the growth and investment income improves. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately if the million dollars to search and $60 million of assets of the parent company, absence the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last 3 years, that level has been around. And NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. Although we have not finalized our 2015 statutory financial statements, we expect that the RBC percentage at December 31, 2015, will be around the the 325% consolidated target. We do not anticipate any changes to our targeted RBC levels in 2016.
Our investment department has reviewed multiple scenarios of downgrades within our fixed maturity holdings, including those in the energy sector. 
To put their findings in the context, as a rule of thumb, downgrades of around $100 million in statutory book value would reduce our RBC ratio by approximately 2 percentage points and require around $9 million of additional capital to retain a 325% RBC level. Using this rule of thumb, and to the extent additional downgrade do occur in 2016, we are comfortable that we would be able to fund the additional capital requirements with available assets on hand and other sources of liquidity available to Torchmark without having to suspend or reduce the amount available for buybacks. 
Now, a few comments to provide an update on our Medicare Part D operations. Management has committed to a plan to sell the Part D business and expected to be sold before the end of the year. We have met the criteria to account for the business as held for sale, and the results of the Part D operations will be reflected within discontinued operations in our financial statements. As we have previously said, we originally decided to participate in the Medicare Part D program back in 2006 because most of the underwriting risks was covered by the government, and we believe that it would complement our Medicare supplement business. 
Over the years, the Part D business has been good for Torchmark as it has provided over $259 million of underwriting margin since 2006. However, this business have been changing rapidly over the past few years, and earnings have become much more volatile. Increased competition, industry consolidation and preferred net worth have reduced overall margins and made a more difficult for smaller players to compete in this market. While we are still generating profits from the Part D operations, this profits have been shrinking in recent years due to higher direct costs and increased administrative and compliance costs. We believe this trend will likely continue and perhaps, could even turning to significant losses in the future as drug costs, especially those in specialty drugs, continued to escalate. In addition, we've already seen regulatory changes that have shifted cost from the government to carriers, and appears likely that more cost shifting is to come. Overall, the risks and the administrative and compliance costs associated with the business are much greater than they once were and the business now demands and increasingly disproportionate amount of time and focus, given its level of earnings. 
Looking forward, we prefer to focus our attention on our core license insurance businesses and other lines of health business that produce more predictable stable margins. We've previously indicated that we view this business opportunistically and that we would review it on a really basis. While the Part D business has been a good opportunity to this point, we no longer believe that it is a business that make sense for Torchmark going forward. And therefore, it is the right time to exit the business. 
We have included in our website a final operating summary for the discontinued operation. For the year, we earned $10.8 million or $0.09 per share after tax. This amount was lower than we had anticipated on the last call due to higher-than-expected claims in the fourth quarter as a result of higher drug costs. To the extent we were to hold the business for the full year 2016, we estimate that our after-tax earnings would be in the range of $5 million to $9 million. As noted in our previous calls, the profits from the Part D business are further reduced by lost investment income, the results from having to finance substantial cash outflows during the year, including amounts paid upfront on behalf of the government that won't get repaid to us until the following year. These outflows are generally represented by the significant receivable balances that are included in the assets held-for-sale line of our consolidated balance sheet. 
The opportunity cost of not being able to timely invest the receivable balances is included in our continuing operations, as required by the applicable accounting rules. However, to reflect what management considers to be a better reflection of earnings from the Part D operations, we have included on our website a schedule showing the pro forma income from discontinued operations and includes an estimate of the after-tax cost of the forgot investment income. As we are in the midst of discussions with multiple parties regarding a purchase, we are unable to discuss the timing, potential value or other details of the sale. However, we do anticipate that the assets held for sale on our balance sheet will be fully recovered and do not believe the consummation of the sale will have a material impact on our income from continuing operations. 
Any such an impact on earnings is included in the range of earnings guidance provided.
Now with respect to our guidance for 2016. On our last call, we indicated a preliminary range of $4.25 to $4.55 for our 2016 net operating earnings per share with a midpoint of $4.40. Excluding the effect of the discontinued Part D operations, the midpoint would have been $4.35. We now estimate our earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of $4.28 to $4.48, a 6.1% growth at the midpoint over our 2015 earnings from continuing operations. A schedule providing prior year earnings per share for continued operations only and our revised 2016 earnings per share guidance has been placed on our website. Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

I mean, again, I've indicated think there's some couple of key drivers that all kind of work together to push that down. But you do have the higher sales and you talk about the higher sales and in the first year of those sales, acquisition expenses exceed the amount of premiums coming in, so there is a drag on your statutory earnings from those. And then you start having positive statutory incomes in that second year after the sale. But as you continue to do -- as we the last couple of years, where we had 2 really good years of continued sales growth, that's just pulling down the amount of statutory income and that we anticipate those future profits from those sales to start really emerging coming in the future here. But that's probably generating somewhere in that $15 million to $20 million of statutory drag in 2015 just by itself. And then on the normal years you'll have with increase in investment income that would help to offset that. But unfortunately, the last couple of years, with the continuing drag that we have had, largely from the Part D, and of course, lower interest rates, and to some degree, the higher direct response claims we've been having growth in that investment income up only around a 2% or probably above the 2% level rather than at that 4% so invested assets are growing at. So that's weighing in on it. We have talked about it a little bit about some higher acquisition, administrative costs, just in growth in 2015 from some of our IT and pension costs and that type of thing. And then the way that the accounting rules work for federal income taxes. Basically, you don't get quite the smoothing effect that you have on for GAAP purposes, and we just and the having's higher taxes in 2015 here than we did on a comparable basis in 2014."

In the fourth quarter, net operating income from all operations was $131 million or $1.05 per share, a per share increase of 5% from a year ago. During the fourth quarter, management determined that the Part D business met the criteria to be held for sale and has classified it as discontinued operations. 
Net operating income from continuing operations, which excludes Part D, was $131 million or $1.05 per share, up 6% on a per share basis from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $133 million or $1.07 per share, a 5% decline on a per share basis. The decline was due primarily to the fact that we had $11 million of tax-driven realized losses in the fourth quarter of this year compared to a gain of $5 million in the year-ago quarter.
With fixed maturities at amortized cost, our return on equity as of December 31 was 14.5% and our book value per share was $30.09, an 8% increase from a year ago. 
On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities at market value, book value per share was $32.71, a decline of 10% from a year ago. 
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5.5% to $521 million while life underwriting margin was $145 million, up 6.3% from a year ago. Net life sales increased 2% to $99 million. 
On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $235 million and health underwriting margin was up $51 million, approximately the same as a year ago. Health sales declined 17% to $60 million due to declining group sales. Individual health sales were $38 million, up 20%. 
Administrative expenses were $48 million for the quarter, up 9% from a year ago, and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.3% compared to 6.1% a year ago. The primary reasons for the increase in administrative expenses are higher information technology and pension costs. 
For the full year, administrative expenses were $186 million or 6.2% of premium. In 2016, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 5% and to remain around 6.2% of premium.

First, the excess investment income.

First, the excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less acquired interest on policy liabilities and debt, was $54 million compared to $55 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was flat.
As discussed on previous calls, the Part D segment has had a negative impact on excess investment income due to negative cash flows that occurred during the year, including the long delay receiving reimbursements from CMS for excess claims paid by the company. The impact of the loss investment income from the delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in income from continuing operations rather than discontinued operations, in accordance with applicable accounting rules. 
In 2015, Part D had a negative impact on excess investment income of approximately $8 million. In 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 1% to 3%. However, on a per share basis, we should see the increase of about 6% to 8%. 
At the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, we're expecting a drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $8 million to $9 million.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $13.8 billion, including $13.3 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. At the fixed maturities, $12.6 billion are investment grade, with an average rating of A-. And below investment grade bonds were $640 million compared to $561 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.8% compared to 4.4% a year ago.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.6x, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 17%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $506 million, approximately $408 million less than at the end of the third quarter.
To complete the investment portfolio discussion, I'd like to address our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. As a result of spreads widening in the fourth quarter, the net unrealized loss of our energy portfolio increased by $122 million to a total of $165 million at December 31. However, we believe the risk of realizing any losses in the foreseeable future is minimal for the following reasons: $1.5 billion or 94% of our energy holdings are investment grade; only $143 million or 9% of our energy holdings are in the oilfield service and drilling sector. Approximately 70% of these bonds are investment grade. 
Also, based on the consensus of expert views, our investment department believes that oil is more likely to increase to $45 or $50 a barrel during the next 12 to 24 months as they remain at current levels. We believe the companies in our portfolio can continue to operate for very long time with oil prices at $45 to $50 a barrel. Even if oil remains around $30 a barrel for the next 12 to 24 months, we would not expect to have any defaults during that period.
Finally, the companies we have invested in have a variety of options that they can utilize to avoid default including, but not limited to, reducing distributions to partners, drawing of lines of credits and reducing exploration activities. Now we do believe that there could be further downgrades which could pressure our RBC ratio. However, that doesn't mean we would have to suspend or materially impact our stock buyback program. Frank will address this in more detail when he discusses capital. 
Now as to investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $341 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sector. We invested at an average yield of 5%, an average rating of A- and an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.81%, down 8 basis points from the 5.89% yield in the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.83%. The midpoint of our current guidance for 2016 assumes increasing money yield throughout the year, averaging 5.25% for the full year.
We continue to hope for higher interest rates. As discussed on previous analyst calls, rising new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven reflected on the balance sheet since we'd not expect to convert them to realized losses. We got to be intent, and more important, the ability to hold our investments through maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued lower interest rate environment will impact our income statement, but not the balance sheet. This would primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60. We don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off DAC or to put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $58.68. For the full year, we spent $359 milli",1443,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $58.68. For the full year, we spent $359 million of parent company cash to acquire 6.3 million shares at an average price of $56.99.
The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $46 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate additional free cash flow during the remainder of 2016. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders.
While our 2015 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect free cash flow in 2016 to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Thus, including the $46 million available from assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have $366 million to $376 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. This level of free cash flow in 2016 is lower than recent years, due to lower distributable statutory earnings at our subsidiaries in 2015. 
As we've discussed on prior calls, a key driver of the lower earnings is higher commission and acquisition expenses associated with the higher levels of sales growth we have experienced in 2014 and 2015, coupled with lower growth rates and investment income due to lower new money yields and adverse Part D cash flows. Another significant driver of the lower earnings is higher federal income tax expense in 2015 as compared to 2014. 
At this time, we anticipate that statutory earnings in 2016 will be approximately the same as 2015, as the profits from recent sales start to emerge. The incremental impact of new sales lessons and the growth and investment income improves. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of assets at the parent company, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last 3 years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. Although we have not finalized our 2015 statutory financial statements, we expect that the RBC percentage at December 31, 2015, would be around the 325% consolidated target. We do not anticipate any changes to our targeted RBC levels in 2016.
Our investment department has reviewed multiple scenarios of downgrades within our fixed maturity holdings, including those in the energy sector. 
To put their findings into context, as a rule of thumb, downgrades of around $100 million in statutory book value would reduce our RBC ratio by approximately 2 percentage points and require around $9 million of additional capital to retain a 325% RBC level. Using this rule of thumb, and to the extent additional downgrades do occur in 2016, we are comfortable that we would be able to fund the additional capital requirements with available assets on hand and other sources of liquidity available to Torchmark without having to suspend or reduce the amount available for buybacks. 
Now a few comments to provide an update on our Medicare Part D operations. Management has committed to a plan to sell the Part D business and expect it to be sold before the end of the year. We have met the criteria to account for the business as held for sale, and the results of the Part D operations will be reflected within discontinued operations in our financial statements. As we have previously said, we originally decided to participate in the Medicare Part D program back in 2006 because most of the underwriting risks was covered by the government, and we believe that it would complement our Medicare supplement business. 
Over the years, the Part D business has been good for Torchmark as it has provided over $259 million of underwriting margin since 2006. However, this business has been changing rapidly over the past few years and the earnings have become much more volatile. Increased competition, industry consolidation and preferred networks have reduced overall margins and made it more difficult for smaller players to compete in this market. While we are still generating profits from the Part D operations, these profits have been shrinking in recent years due to higher direct costs and increased administrative and compliance costs. We believe this trend will likely continue and perhaps could even turning to significant losses in the future as drug costs, especially those on specialty drugs, continued to escalate. In addition, we have already seen regulatory changes that have shifted costs from the government to carriers, and appears likely that more cost shifting is to come. Overall, the risks and the administrative and compliance costs associated with the business are much greater than they once were and the business now demands an increasingly disproportionate amount of time and focus given its level of earnings. 
Looking forward, we prefer to focus our attention on our core life insurance businesses and other lines of health business that produce more predictable stable margins. We've previously indicated that we view this business opportunistically and that we would review it on a yearly basis. While the Part D business has been a good opportunity to this point, we no longer believe that it is a business that make sense for Torchmark going forward. And therefore, it is the right time to exit the business. 
We have included on our website a final operating summary for the discontinued operations. For the year, we earned $10.8 million or $0.09 per share after tax. This amount was lower than we had anticipated on the last call due to higher than expected claims in the fourth quarter as a result of higher drug costs. To the extent we were to hold the business for the full year 2016, we estimate that our after tax earnings would be in the range of $5 million to $9 million. As noted on our previous calls, the profits from the Part D business are further reduced by lost investment income that results from having to finance substantial cash outflows during the year, including amounts paid upfront on behalf of the government that won't get repaid to us until the following year. These outflows are generally represented by the significant receivable balances that are included in the assets held for sale line of our consolidated balance sheet. 
The opportunity cost of not being able to timely invest the receivable balances is included in our continuing operations, as required by the applicable accounting rules. However, to reflect what management considers to be a better reflection of earnings from the Part D operations, we have included on our website a schedule showing the pro forma income from discontinued operations that includes an estimate of the after tax costs of the forgone investment income. As we are in the midst of discussions with multiple parties regarding a purchase, we are unable to discuss the timing, potential value or other details of the sale. However, we do anticipate that the assets held for sale on our balance sheet will be fully recovered and do not believe the consummation of the sale will have a material impact on our income from continuing operations. Any such impact on earnings is included in the range of earnings guidance provided.
And with respect to our guidance for 2016. On our last call, we indicated a preliminary range of $4.25 to $4.55 for our 2016 net operating earnings per share with a midpoint of $4.40. Excluding the effect of the discontinued Part D operations, the midpoint would have been $4.35. We now estimate that our earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of $4.28 to $4.48, a 6.1% growth at the midpoint over our 2015 earnings from continued operations. A schedule providing prior year earnings per share for continued operations only and our revised 2016 earnings per share guidance has been placed on our website.

But you do have the higher sales, and we've talked about you have higher sales. And in the first year of those sales, acquisition expenses exceed the amount of premiums coming in, so there is a drag on your statutory earnings from those. And then in your -- you start having positive statutory incomes in that second year of the -- after the sale. But as you continue to, as we have the last couple of years where we've had 2 really good years of continued sales growth, that's just pulling down on the amount of statutory income and now we anticipate those future -- those profits from those sales to start really emerging coming in the future here. But that's probably generating somewhere in that $15 million to $20 million of statutory drag in 2015 just by itself. And then in a lot of the normal years, you'd have good increase in investment income that would help to offset that. But unfortunately, the last couple of years, with the continuing drag that we have had, largely from the Part D, and then, of course, lower interest rates, and to some degree, the higher direct response claims we've been having growth in that investment income up only around a 2% or probably above the 2% level rather than at that 4-or-so percent where invested assets are growing at. So that's weighing in on it. We have talked a little bit about it. We had some higher acquisition -- or administrative costs in this, just in growth in 2015 from some of our IT and pension costs and that type of thing. And then the way that the accounting rules work for federal income taxes, we just -- basically, you don't get quite the smoothing effect that you have on for GAAP purposes, and we just end up having some higher taxes in 2015 here than we did on a comparable basis for 2014."

In the fourth quarter, net operating income from all operations was $131 million or $1.05 per share, a per share increase of 5% from a year ago. During the fourth quarter, management determined that the Part D business met the criteria to be held for sale and has classified it as discontinued operations. 
Net operating income from continuing operations, which excludes Part D, was $131 million or $1.05 per share, up 6% on a per share basis from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $133 million or $1.07 per share, a 5% decline on a per share basis. The decline was due primarily to the fact that we had $11 million of tax-driven realized losses in the fourth quarter of this year compared to a gain of $5 million in the year-ago quarter.
With fixed maturities at amortized cost, our return on equity as of December 31 was 14.5% and our book value per share was $30.09, an 8% increase from a year ago. 
On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities at market value, book value per share was $32.71, a decline of 10% from a year ago. 
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5.5% to $521 million while life underwriting margin was $145 million, up 6.3% from a year ago. Net life sales increased 2% to $99 million. 
On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $235 million and health underwriting margin was up $51 million, approximately the same as a year ago. Health sales declined 17% to $60 million due to declining group sales. Individual health sales were $38 million, up 20%. 
Administrative expenses were $48 million for the quarter, up 9% from a year ago, and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.3% compared to 6.1% a year ago. The primary reasons for the increase in administrative expenses are higher information technology and pension costs. 
For the full year, administrative expenses were $186 million or 6.2% of premium. In 2016, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 5% and to remain around 6.2% of premium.

308916,323445037,927372,"Torchmark Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, the excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less acquired interest on policy liabilities and debt, was $54 million compared to",892,"I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, the excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less acquired interest on policy liabilities and debt, was $54 million compared to $55 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was flat.
As discussed on previous calls, the Part D segment has had a negative impact on excess investment income due to negative cash flows that occurred during the year, including the long delay receiving reimbursements from CMS for excess claims paid by the company. The impact of the loss investment income from the delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in income from continuing operations rather than discontinued operations, in accordance with applicable accounting rules. 
In 2015, Part D had a negative impact on excess investment income of approximately $8 million. In 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 1% to 3%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of about 6% to 8%. 
At the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, we're expecting a drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $8 million to $9 million.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $13.8 billion, including $13.3 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. At the fixed maturities, $12.6 billion are investment grade, with an average rating of A-. And below investment grade bonds are $640 million compared to $561 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.8% compared to 4.4% a year ago.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.6x, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 17%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $506 million, approximately $408 million less than at the end of the third quarter.
To complete the investment portfolio discussion, I'd like to address our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. As a result of spreads widening in the fourth quarter, the net unrealized loss of our energy portfolio increased by $122 million [ph] to a total of $165 million at December 31. However, we believe the risk of realizing any losses in the foreseeable future is minimal for the following reasons: $1.5 billion or 94% of our energy holdings are investment grade; only $143 million or 9% of our energy holdings are in the oilfield service and drilling sector. Approximately 70% of these bonds are investment grade. 
Also, based on the consensus of expert views, our investment department believes that oil is more likely to increase to $45 or $50 a barrel during the next 12 to 24 months as they remain at current levels. We believe the companies in our portfolio can continue to operate for very long time with oil prices at $45 to $50 a barrel. Even if oil remains around $30 a barrel for the next 12 to 24 months, we would not expect to have any defaults during that period.
Finally, the companies we have invested in have a variety of options that they can utilize to avoid default including, but not limited to, reducing distributions to partners, drawing on lines of credits and reducing exploration activities. Now we do believe that there could be further downgrades which could pressure our RBC ratio. However, that doesn't mean we would have to suspend or materially impact our stock buyback program. Frank will address this in more detail when he discusses capital. 
Now as to investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $341 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sector. We invested at an average yield of 5%, an average rating of A- and an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.81%, down 8 basis points from the 5.89% yield in the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.83%. The midpoint of our current guidance for 2016 assumes increasing money yield throughout the year, averaging 5.25% for the full year.
We continue to hope for higher interest rates. As discussed on previous analyst calls, rising new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven reflected on the balance sheet since we'd not expect to convert them to realized losses. We have the intent, and more important, the ability to hold our investments until maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued lower interest rate environment will impact our income statement, but not the balance sheet. This would primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60. We don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off DAC or to put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment [ph] income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital positions. In the fourth quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $58.68. For the full year, we spent $359 mill",1446,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital positions. In the fourth quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $58.68. For the full year, we spent $359 million of parent company cash to acquire 6.3 million shares at an average price of $56.99.
The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $46 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate additional free cash flow during the remainder of 2016. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders.
While our 2015 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect free cash flow in 2016 to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Thus, including the $46 million available from assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have $366 million to $376 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. This level of free cash flow in 2016 is lower than recent years, due to lower distributable statutory earnings at our subsidiaries in 2015. 
As we've discussed on prior calls, a key driver of the lower earnings is higher commission and acquisition expenses associated with the higher levels of sales growth we have experienced in 2014 and 2015, coupled with lower growth rates and investment income due to lower new money yields and adverse Part D cash flows. Another significant driver of the lower earnings is higher federal income tax expense in 2015 as compared to 2014. 
At this time, we anticipate that statutory earnings in 2016 will be approximately the same as 2015, as the profits from recent sales start to emerge. The incremental impact of new sales lessons and the growth and investment income improves. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of assets at the parent company, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last 3 years, that level has been around an NAIC / RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. Although we have not finalized our 2015 statutory financial statements, we expect that the RBC percentage at December 31, 2015, would be around the 325% consolidated target. We do not anticipate any changes to our targeted RBC levels in 2016.
Our investment department has reviewed multiple scenarios of downgrades within our fixed maturity holdings, including those in the energy sector. 
To put their findings into context, as a rule of thumb, downgrades of around $100 million in statutory book value would reduce our RBC ratio by approximately 2 percentage points and require around $9 million of additional capital to retain a 325% RBC level. Using this rule of thumb, and to the extent additional downgrades do occur in 2016, we are comfortable that we would be able to fund the additional capital requirements with available assets on hand and other sources of liquidity available to Torchmark without having to suspend or reduce the amount available for buybacks. 
Now a few comments to provide an update on our Medicare Part D operations. Management has committed to a plan to sell the Part D business and expect it to be sold before the end of the year. We have met the criteria to account for the business as held for sale, and the results of the Part D operations will be reflected within discontinued operations in our financial statements. As we have previously said, we originally decided to participate in the Medicare Part D program back in 2006 because most of the underwriting risk was covered by the government, and we believe that it would complement our Medicare supplement business. 
Over the years, the Part D business has been good for Torchmark as it has provided over $259 million of underwriting margin since 2006. However, this business has been changing rapidly over the past few years and the earnings have become much more volatile. Increased competition, industry consolidation and preferred networks have reduced overall margins and made it more difficult for smaller players to compete in this market. While we are still generating profits from the Part D operations, these profits have been shrinking in recent years due to higher direct costs and increased administrative and compliance costs. We believe this trend will likely continue and perhaps could even turn in to significant losses in the future as drug costs, especially those on specialty drugs, continue to escalate. In addition, we have already seen regulatory changes that have shifted costs from the government to carriers, and appears likely that more cost shifting is to come. Overall, the risks and the administrative and compliance costs associated with the business are much greater than they once were and the business now demands an increasingly disproportionate amount of time and focus given its level of earnings. 
Looking forward, we prefer to focus our attention on our core life insurance businesses and our other lines of health business that produce more predictable stable margins. We've previously indicated that we view this business opportunistically and that we would review it on a yearly basis. While the Part D business has been a good opportunity to this point, we no longer believe that it is a business that makes sense for Torchmark going forward. And therefore, it is the right time to exit the business. 
We have included on our website a final operating summary for the discontinued operations. For the year, we earned $10.8 million or $0.09 per share after tax. This amount was lower than we had anticipated on the last call due to higher than expected claims in the fourth quarter as a result of higher drug costs. To the extent we were to hold the business for the full year 2016, we estimate that our after tax earnings would be in the range of $5 million to $9 million. As noted on our previous calls, the profits from the Part D business are further reduced by lost investment income that results from having to finance substantial cash outflows during the year, including amounts paid upfront on behalf of the government that won't get repaid to us until the following year. These outflows are generally represented by the significant receivable balances that are included in the assets held for sale line of our consolidated balance sheet. 
The opportunity cost of not being able to timely invest the receivable balances is included in our continuing operations, as required by the applicable accounting rules. However, to reflect what management considers to be a better reflection of earnings from the Part D operations, we have included on our website a schedule showing the pro forma income from discontinued operations that includes an estimate of the after tax cost of the forgone investment income. As we are in the midst of discussions with multiple parties regarding a purchase, we are unable to discuss the timing, potential value or other details of the sale. However, we do anticipate that the assets held for sale on our balance sheet will be fully recovered and do not believe the consummation of the sale will have a material impact on our income from continuing operations. Any such impact on earnings is included in the range of earnings guidance provided.
And with respect to our guidance for 2016. On our last call, we indicated a preliminary range of $4.25 to $4.55 for our 2016 net operating earnings per share with a midpoint of $4.40. Excluding the effect of the discontinued Part D operations, the midpoint would have been $4.35. We now estimate that our earnings from continued operations will be in the range of $4.28 to $4.48, a 6.1% growth at the midpoint over our 2015 earnings from continued operations. A schedule providing prior year earnings per share for continued operations only and our revised 2016 earnings per share guidance has been placed on our website.

But you do have the higher sales, and we've talked about you have higher sales. And in the first year of those sales, acquisition expenses exceed the amount of premiums coming in, so there is a drag on your statutory earnings from those. And then in your -- you start having positive statutory incomes in that second year of the -- after the sale. But as you continue to, as we have the last couple of years where we've had 2 really good years of continued sales growth, that's just pulling down on the amount of statutory income and now we anticipate those future -- those profits from those sales to start really emerging coming in the future here. But that's probably generating somewhere in that $15 million to $20 million of statutory drag in 2015 just by itself. And then in a lot of normal years, you'd have good increase in investment income that would help to offset that. But unfortunately, the last couple of years, with the continuing drag that we have had, largely from the Part D, and then, of course, lower interest rates, and to some degree, the higher direct response claims we've been having growth in that investment income of only around a 2% or probably above the 2% level rather than at that 4-or-so percent where invested assets are growing at. So that's weighing in on it. We have talked a little bit about it. We had some higher acquisition -- or administrative costs in this, just in growth in 2015 from some of our IT and pension costs and that type of thing. And then the way that the accounting rules work for federal income taxes, we just -- basically, you don't get quite the smoothing effect that you have on for GAAP purposes, and we just end up having some higher taxes in 2015 here than we did on a comparable basis for 2014."

Within fixed maturities and amortized cost, our return on equity as of March 31 was 14.5% and our book value per share was $30.65, an 8% increase from a year ago. 
On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities of market value, book value per share was $35.72, a decline of 6% from a year ago. 
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 6% to $544 million, while life underwriting margin was $144 million, up 2% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin lagged to premium growth due to higher claims, primarily in direct response. For the full year, we expect life underwriting margin to increase 2% to 4% over 2015.

On the health side, premium revenue grew 30% to $236 million, and health underwriting margin was $52 million, approximately the same as the year-ago. For the full year, we expect health underwriting margin to grow 1% to 2%. 
Health sales declined 1% to $32 million, due to decline in group sales. Individual health sales were up 1% to $28 million. 
Administrative expenses were $48 million for the quarter, up 5% from a year ago and in line with our expectations.

At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $220 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $69 million. Net life sales were $50 million, up 7%, due primarily to increased agent productivity.
The average agent count for the first quarter was 6,206, down 2% over a year ago, and down 6% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 6,225. We expect 5% to 7% life sales growth for the full year 2016.
In our Direct Response operation at Global Life, life premiums were up 7% to $200 million. Life underwriting margin declined 13% to $37 million. Net life sales were down 8% to $41 million, due primarily to decreases in circulation. We expect life sales to be flat to down 3% for the full year 2016. 
At Liberty National, life premiums were $68 million, approximately the same as the year-ago quarter. While life underwriting margin was $18 million, up 6%. Net life sales increased 11% to $9 million, while net health sales increased 19% to $5 million. The sales increases were driven primarily by improvements in agent productivity, recruiting and retention. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 1,542, up 5% from a year ago and flat compared to the fourth quarter.

Health net sales growth is expected to be within the range of 5% to 7% for the full year of 2016.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $57 million, our health underwriting margin increased 8% to $12 million.

308916,331097706,964187,"Torchmark Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I will spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, regarding excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less acquired interest on that policy liabilities and debt, was $55 million, fla",959,"I will spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, regarding excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less acquired interest on that policy liabilities and debt, was $55 million, flat compared to the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 2%.
As discussed on previous calls, the Part D segment has a negative impact on excess investment income due to the negative cash flows that occurred during the year, including the long delay in receiving reimbursements from CMS for excess claims paid by the company. The impact of the loss investment income from the delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in income from continuing operations rather than in discontinued operations, in accordance with the applicable accounting rules.
In the first quarter, Part D had a negative impact on excess investment income of approximately $2.8 million compared to a negative impact of $2.5 million in the year-ago quarter. 
For the full year of 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow about 1% to 2%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of about 5% to 6%. 
At the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, we're expecting a drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $8 million to $9 million compared to a drag of $8 million in 2015.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $14.2 billion, including $13.5 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. At the fixed maturities, $12.7 billion are in investment grade, with an average rating of A minus, and below investment grade were $771 million compared to $604 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 5.7% compared to 4.8% at the end of the fourth quarter.
The increase in below investment grade bonds is due primarily to first quarter downgrades and securities in the energy and minerals and mining sectors.
However, due to increases in the underlying commodity prices, subsequent to these downgrades, the current market values of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of the downgrades. With a portfolio leverage of 3.6x, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 20%. And overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus, same as the year-ago.
In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturities portfolio of $970 million, approximately $464 million higher than at the end of the fourth quarter. 
Now to complete the discussion in investment portfolio, I'd like to address our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. The net unrealized loss of our energy portfolio decline from $165 million at the end of 2015 to $128 million at the end of the first quarter, an improvement of $37 million. We believe the risk of realizing losses in the foreseeable future is minimal for the following reasons. First, even with the significant rating agency downgrades in the first quarter, 89% of our energy holdings remain investment grade. 
Next, only $143 million or 9% of our energy holdings are in the oilfield service and drilling sector. While we had significant downgrades during the first quarter in these sectors, we are seeing improvements in margin values recently. We believe the companies we own have sufficient liquidity during the cycle. 
Third, based on the consensus of expert views, our investments oil is more likely to increase to $50 or $60 a barrel during the next 12 to 24 months and to remain at current levels. We believe that the companies in our portfolio can continue to operate for a very long time with oil prices at $40 to $50 a barrel. Even if oil declined to $30 a barrel and remain at that level for the next 12 to 24 months, we would not expect to have significant defaults during that period.
Finally, the companies we have invested in have a variety of options they can utilize to avoid default including, but not limited to, reducing distributions to partners, drawing on lines of credit and reducing exploration activities. We do not expect significant further downgrades on our energy portfolio. Also, the recent downgrades should not impact our stock buyback program. Frank will address this in more detail when he discusses capital.
As to investment yield. In the first quarter, we invested $287 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sector. We invested an average yield of 5%, an average rating of BBB+ at an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.83%, down 4 basis points from the 5.87% yield in the first quarter of 2015. In March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.81%. 
For the remainder of 2016, we have assumed a new money rate of 5% at the midpoint of our guidance. This rate is lower than we previously expected. We are disappointed interest rates have not risen as expected. However, while the continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement, it will not have a negative impact on the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that will require us to write-off DAC or to put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low-interest-rate environment. As we have said before, Torchmark can thrive in either a low or high interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the first quarter, we spent $80 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $53.26. So far in April, we have used $21 milli",1256,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the first quarter, we spent $80 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $53.26. So far in April, we have used $21 million to purchase 392,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have spent $101 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1.9 million shares at an average price of $53.38.
These purchases are being made from the parent company's free cash flow. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect free cash flow in 2016 to be around $320 million. Thus, including the $46 million available to the parent from massive fund at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have approximately $366 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. 
As previously mentioned, to date, we have used $101 million of this cash to buy 1.9 million Torchmark shares, leaving around $265 million of cash and other liquid assets available for the remainder of the year. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain at least $50 million to $60 million of assets at the parent company, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. 
Now a couple of comets regarding Torchmark's recent debt offering. In early April, Torchmark completed the issuance and sale of $300 million of 6.125% fixed rate junior subordinated debentures with a 40-year life but callable after 5 years. The debt was sold pursuant to Torchmark shelf registration statement from last August. The net proceeds from the debt issuance will be used to retire the $250 million outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest on the 6.375% senior notes due June 15, 2016, and for general corporate purposes including additional capital and other financing needs, if necessary, at our insurance subsidiaries. The issuance of the debt was consistent with guidance provided to S&P as to how we would refinance the upcoming maturity and the security will be treated as equity for their capital purposes. 
Both S&P and Moody's have assigned the same rating to the new Junior subordinated security, as exists on our current subordinated debentures. The issuance will have an immaterial impact on our earnings per share.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last 3 years, that level has been around an NAIC/RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. 
As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated RBC was 317%, 8 basis points below our target of 325%, primarily due to Part D earnings being lower and fourth quarter downgrades being greater than expected. 
During the first quarter of this year, we had approximately $245 million of net downgrade on an NAIC basis within our fixed income portfolio. This amount includes total downgrades from NAIC Class I to 2, 2 to 3 and 3 to 4, net of any upgrades during that period. So we don't calculate RBC on a quarterly basis. We estimate that these net downgrades will result in a decrease in our RBC percentage of approximately 5 basis points. This effect on RBC is consistent with the general rule of thumb we outlined last quarter, stating that for every $100 million in downgrades, a 2-basis-point reduction in RBC percentage would resolve and around $9 million of additional capital would be needed. The combination of the shortfall, as of the end of 2015, plus the additional capital needed due to the downgrades in the first quarter, indicates that we may need around $60 million of additional capital to return to a 325% RBC level. At this time, we do not plan on changing our targeted RBC level of 325%. 
However, as indicated on the last call, should we believe that our RBC level is being adversely impacted by downgrades, that we believe our temporary and that will reverse in the relatively near future, we may choose to temporary target an RBC ratio below 325%. We are comfortable that any additional capital needed to meet our target RBC levels for 2016 could be funded with excess proceeds from our recent debt issuance, available assets on hand and other sources of liquidity without having to suspend or reduce the amount available for share buybacks.
Now a few comments about Part D. On April 7, Torchmark was notified by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services that its 2 subsidiaries, UA and FUA were released from intermediate sanctions and returned to normal marketing and enrollment status, effective as of that date. The plans had operated under sanctions since August 1 half last year. While our plans will be able to accept new enrollees, we anticipate that additional sales during the remainder of 2016 will be minimal. We continue to proceed with the possible sale of our Part D contracts and the release of these sanctions will have no impact on the company's previously announced commitment to exit the Medicare Part D business. 
As noted on the last call, the disposition of our Part D business will release around $70 million of capital that we held at the end of 2015 relating to this business. Since the risk-based capital is determined primarily on the level of premiums received and claims made during the year, we will still be required to hold the majority of this capital at the end of 2016. We estimate that approximately $10 million to $15 million of capital would become available in 2016 with the remainder to be released in 2017. We will consider an extraordinary dividend of the excess capital to the parent company, depending on our capital needs for 2017. 
Now with respect to our guidance for 2016, we are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.51 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $4.43 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.05 increase over our previous guidance. $0.04 of this increase is due to the early adoption of a newly issued accounting standard ASU 2016-9 as of January 1, 2016. This new accounting standard simplifies certain aspects of accounting for our equity-based compensation and will primarily affect our net operating income through its impact on stock compensation expense net of taxes, diluted shares outstanding and earnings per share. As required by the new standard, the adoption is perspective and thus, will impact only 2016 and future periods.
In the first quarter, the company recorded $2 million in additional tax benefits as a reduction to stock option expense in our first quarter operating earnings, as opposed to directly increasing equity as would have occurred under prior guidance. The adoption also resulted in an increase to the weighted average diluted shares. The net effect of the change in the first quarter was a $0.01 increase in earnings per share. Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

The main thing is we don't want to put the money down and insurance companies, unless we -- until we determine we need to. Because once it's down there and then let's say bonds get upgraded and also we have excess capital, it's difficult to get that excess capital back out because when it goes through the extraordinary dividend process So we think the best use of capital right now is to monitor it, we've got cash available to cover any shortfall at this point.

In the first quarter, net operating income from continuing operations was $133 million or $1.08 per share, a per share increase of 6% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $124 million or $1.01 per share, also a 6% increase on a per share basis.
Within fixed maturities and amortized cost, our return on equity as of March 31 was 14.5% and our book value per share was $30.65, an 8% increase from a year ago. 
On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities at market value, book value per share was $35.72, a decline of 6% from a year ago. 
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 6% to $544 million, while life underwriting margin was $144 million, up 2% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin lagged premium growth due to higher claims, primarily in direct response. For the full year, we expect life underwriting margin to increase 2% to 4% over 2015. Net life sales were $104 million, flat compared to the year-ago quarter. 
On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $236 million, and health underwriting margin was $52 million, approximately the same as the year-ago. For the full year, we expect health underwriting margin to grow 1% to 2%. 
Health sales declined 1% to $32 million, due to decline in group sales. Individual health sales were up 1% to $28 million. 
Administrative expenses were $48 million for the quarter, up 5% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. The primary reason for the increase in administrative expenses is higher information technology cost. As a percentage of premiums from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.2%, same as a year ago. For the full year, we anticipate that administrative expenses will also be around 6.2% to premium. I will now turn the call over the Larry Hutchison for his comments on the marketing operations."

At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $220 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $69 million. Net life sales were $50 million, up 7%, due primarily to increased agent productivity.
The average agent count for the first quarter was 6,206, down 2% over a year ago, and down 6% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 6,225. We expect 5% to 7% life sales growth for the full year 2016.
In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 7% to $200 million. Life underwriting margin declined 13% to $37 million. Net life sales were down 8% to $41 million, due primarily to decreases in circulation. We expect life sales to be flat to down 3% for the full year 2016. 
At Liberty National, life premiums were $68 million, approximately the same as the year-ago quarter, while life underwriting margin was $18 million, up 6%. Net life sales increased 11% to $9 million, while net health sales increased 19% to $5 million. The sales increases were driven primarily by improvements in agent productivity, recruiting and retention. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 1,542, up 5% from a year ago and flat compared to the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,711. Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 7% to 9% for the full year 2016. Health net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 5% to 7% for the full year of 2016.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $57 million, our health underwriting margin increased 8% to $12 million. Health net sales were down 9% to $11 million, due primarily to reduced agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 827, up 5% from a year ago but down 6% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 881. We expect health sales growth to be in a range from 2% to 6% for the full year 2016.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 6% to $88 million. Net health sales were $12 million, down 2% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual sales grew 2% at $9 million. Our group sales declined 10% to $3 million. For the full year 2016, we expect growth in individual Medicare supplement sales to be around 9% to 11%.

308916,331097706,964455,"Torchmark Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, regarding excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on that policy liabilities and debt, was $55 million,",955,"I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, regarding excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on that policy liabilities and debt, was $55 million, flat compared to the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 2%.
As discussed on previous calls, the Part D segment has a negative impact on excess investment income due to the negative cash flows that occurred during the year, including the long delay in receiving reimbursement for CMS or excess claims paid by the company. The impact of the loss investment income from the delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in income from continuing operations rather than in discontinued operations in accordance with the applicable accounting rules.
In the first quarter, Part D had a negative impact on excess investment income of approximately $2.8 million compared to a negative impact of $2.5 million in the year-ago quarter. 
For the full year of 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow about 1% to 2%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of about 5% to 6%. 
At the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, we're expecting a drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $8 million to $9 million compared to a drag of $8 million in 2015.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $14.2 billion, including $13.5 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. At the fixed maturities, $12.7 billion are an investment-grade, with an average rating of A minus, and below investment-grades were $771 million compared to $604 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds with fixed maturities is 5.7% compared to 4.8% at the end of the fourth quarter.
The increase in below investment-grade bonds is due primarily to first quarter downgrades of securities in the energy and minerals and mining sectors.
However, due to increases in underlying commodity prices subsequent to these downgrades, the current market values of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of the downgrades. With a portfolio leverage of 3.6x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 20%. And overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus, same as the year-ago.
In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturities portfolio of $970 million, approximately $464 million higher than at the end of the fourth quarter. 
Now to complete the discussion in investment portfolio, I'd like to address our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. The net unrealized loss of our energy portfolio declined from $165 million at the end of 2015 to $128 million at the end of the first quarter, an improvement of $37 million. We believe the risk of realizing losses in the foreseeable future is minimal for the following reasons: First, even with the significant rating agency downgrades in the first quarter, 89% of our energy holdings remain investment-grade. 
Next, only $143 million or 9% of our energy holdings are in the oilfield service and drilling sector. While we had significant downgrades during the first quarter in these sectors, we're seeing improvement in margin values recently. We believe the companies we own have sufficient liquidity to endure the cycle. 
Third, based on the consensus of expert views, our investments [indiscernible] oil is more likely to increase to $50 or $60 a barrel during the next 12 to 24 months and will remain at current levels. We believe that the companies in our portfolio can continue to operate for a very long time with oil prices at $40 to $50 a barrel. Even if oil decline to $30 a barrel and remain at that level for the next 12 to 24 months, we wouldn't expect to have significant defaults during that period.
Finally, the companies we have invested in have a variety of options they can utilize to avoid default including, but not limited to, reducing distributions to partners, drawing on lines of credit and reducing exploration activities. We do not expect significant further downgrades on our energy portfolio. Also, the recent downgrades should not impact our stock buyback program. Frank will address this in more detail when he discusses capital.
As to investment yield, in the first quarter, we invested $287 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sector. We invested an average yield of 5%, an average rating of BBB+ at an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.83%, down 4 basis points from the 5.87% yield in the first quarter 2015. At March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.81%. 
For the remainder of 2016, we have assumed a new money rate of 5% at the midpoint of our guidance. This rate is lower than we previously expected. We are disappointed interest rates have not risen as expected. However, while the continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement, it will not have a negative impact on the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest instant protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that will require us to write-off DAC or to put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. As we have said before, Torchmark can thrive in either a low or high interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the first quarter, we spent $80 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $53.26. So far, in April, we have used $21 mill",1257,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the first quarter, we spent $80 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $53.26. So far, in April, we have used $21 million to purchase 392,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have spent $101 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1.9 million shares at an average price of $53.38.
These purchases are being made from the parent company's free cash flow. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect free cash flow in 2016 to be around $320 million. Thus, including the $46 million available to the parent from assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have approximately $366 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. 
As previously mentioned, to date, we have used $101 million of this cash to buy 1.9 million Torchmark shares, leaving around $265 million of cash and other liquid assets available for the remainder of the year. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain at least $50 million to $60 million of assets at the parent company, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. 
Now a couple of comments regarding Torchmark's recent debt offering. In early April, Torchmark completed the issuance and sale of $300 million of 6.125% fixed rate junior subordinated debentures with a 40-year life but callable after 5 years. The debt was sold pursuant to Torchmark shelf registration statement from last August. The net proceeds from the debt issuance will be used to retire the $250 million outstanding principal amount, plus accrued interest on the 6.375% senior notes due June 15, 2016, and for general corporate purposes, including additional capital and other financing needs, if necessary, at our insurance subsidiaries. The issuance of the debt was consistent with guidance provided to S&P as to how we would refinance the upcoming maturity and the security will be treated as equity for their capital purposes. 
Both S&P and Moody's have assigned the same rating to the new junior subordinated security, as exists on our current subordinated debentures. The issuance will have an immaterial impact on our earnings per share.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last 3 years, that level has been around an NAIC/RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. 
As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated RBC was 317%, 8 basis points below our target of 325%, primarily due to Part D earnings being lower and fourth quarter downgrades being greater than expected. 
During the first quarter of this year, we had approximately $245 million of net downgrade on an NAIC basis within our fixed income portfolio. This amount includes total downgrades from NAIC Class 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 4, net of any upgrades during that period. Though we don't calculate RBC on a quarterly basis, we estimate that these net downgrades will result in a decrease in our RBC percentage of approximately 5 basis points. This effect on RBC is consistent with the general rule of thumb we outlined last quarter, stating that for every $100 million in downgrades, a 2-basis-point reduction in RBC percentage would resolve and around $9 million of additional capital would be needed. The combination of the shortfall as of the end of 2015, plus the additional capital needed due to the downgrades in the first quarter, indicates that we may need around $60 million of additional capital to return to a 325% RBC level. At this time, we do not plan on changing our targeted RBC level of 325%. 
However, as indicated on the last call, should we believe that our RBC level is being adversely impacted by downgrades, that we believe are temporary and that will reverse in the relatively near future, we may choose to temporarily target an RBC ratio below 325%. We are comfortable that any additional capital needed to meet our target RBC levels for 2016 could be funded with excess proceeds from our recent debt issuance, available assets on hand and other sources of liquidity without having to suspend or reduce the amount available for share buybacks.
Now a few comments about Part D. On April 7, Torchmark was notified by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services that its 2 subsidiaries, UA and FUA, were released from intermediate sanctions and returned to normal marketing and enrollment status effective as of that date. The plans had operated under sanction since August 1 of last year. While our plans will be able to accept new enrollees, we anticipate that additional sales during the remainder of 2016 will be minimal. We continue to proceed with a possible sale of our Part D contract and the release of these sanctions will have no impact on the company's previously announced commitment to exit the Medicare Part D business. 
As noted on the last call, the disposition of our Part D business will release around $70 million of capital that we held at the end of 2015 relating to this business. Since the risk-based capital is determined primarily on the level of premiums received and claims made during the year, we will still be required to hold the majority of this capital at the end of 2016. We estimate that approximately $10 million to $15 million of capital will become available in 2016, with the remainder to be released in 2017. We will consider an extraordinary dividend of the excess capital to the parent company, depending on our capital needs for 2017. 
Now with respect to our guidance for 2016, we are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.51 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $4.43 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.05 increase over our previous guidance. $0.04 of this increase is due to the early adoption of a newly issued accounting standard ASU 2016-9 as of January 1, 2016. This new accounting standard simplifies certain aspects of accounting for our equity-based compensation and will primarily affect our net operating income through its impact on stock compensation expense net of taxes, diluted shares outstanding and earnings per share. As required by the new standard, the adoption is prospective, and thus, will impact only 2016 and future periods.
In the first quarter, the company recorded $2 million in additional tax benefits as a reduction to stock option expense in our first quarter operating earnings as opposed to directly increasing equity, as would have occurred under prior guidance. The adoption also resulted in an increase to the weighted average diluted shares. The net effect of the change in the first quarter was a $0.01 increase in earnings per share. 
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

So we would -- the guidance was around that 320%, we're fairly comfortable with that number."

The point is we could easily do that with the money that we have on hand.

One thing that Frank mentioned is that we're going to free up $70 million of capital in the next few years from Part D. That will go a long way forward to helping if there is any kind of capital shortage. The main thing is we don't want to put the money down on the insurance companies, unless we -- until we determine we need to because once it's down there, and then, let's say bonds get upgraded and also we have excess capital, it's difficult to get that excess capital back out because we have to go through the extraordinary dividend process with the States. So we think the best use of capital right now is to monitor it, we've got cash available to cover any shortfall at this point, and then we've got additional capital being freed up in the next 2 years, so if we get down the road and there is a sizable hole there, we'll fill them.

On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $236 million, and health underwriting margin was $52 million, approximately the same as a year-ago. For the full year, we expect health underwriting margin to grow 1% to 2%. 
Health sales declined 1% to $32 million, due to decline in group sales. Individual health sales were up 1% to $28 million. 
Administrative expenses were $48 million for the quarter, up 5% from a year ago and in line with our expectations.

At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $220 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $69 million. Net life sales were $50 million, up 7%, due primarily to increased agent productivity.
The average agent count for the first quarter was 6,206, down 2% over a year ago, and down 6% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 6,225. We expect 5% to 7% life sales growth for the full year 2016.
In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 7% to $200 million. Life underwriting margin declined 13% to $37 million. Net life sales were down 8% to $41 million, due primarily to decreases in circulation. We expect life sales to be flat to down 3% for the full year 2016.

308916,331097706,964873,"Torchmark Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, regarding excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $55 million, f",957,"I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, regarding excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $55 million, flat compared to the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 2%.
As discussed on previous calls, the Part D segment has a negative impact on excess investment income due to the negative cash flows that occurred during the year, including the long delay in receiving reimbursement for CMS or excess claims paid by the company. The impact of the loss investment income from the delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in income from continuing operations rather than in discontinued operations in accordance with the applicable accounting rules.
In the first quarter, Part D had a negative impact on excess investment income of approximately $2.8 million compared to a negative impact of $2.5 million in the year-ago quarter. 
For the full year of 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow about 1% to 2%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of about 5% to 6%. 
At the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, we're expecting a drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $8 million to $9 million compared to a drag of $8 million in 2015.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $14.2 billion, including $13.5 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. At the fixed maturities, $12.7 billion are investment-grade, with an average rating of A minus, and below investment-grades were $771 million compared to $604 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds with fixed maturities is 5.7% compared to 4.8% at the end of the fourth quarter.
The increase in below investment-grade bonds is due primarily to first quarter downgrades of securities in the energy and minerals and mining sectors.
However, due to increases in underlying commodity prices subsequent to these downgrades, the current market values of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of the downgrades. With a portfolio leverage of 3.6x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 20%. And overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus, same as a year ago.
In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturities portfolio of $970 million, approximately $464 million higher than at the end of the fourth quarter. 
Now to complete the discussion in investment portfolio, I'd like to address our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. The net unrealized loss of our energy portfolio declined from $165 million at the end of 2015 to $128 million at the end of the first quarter, an improvement of $37 million. We believe the risk of realizing losses in the foreseeable future is minimal for the following reasons: First, even with the significant rating agency downgrades in the first quarter, 89% of our energy holdings remain investment-grade. 
Next, only $143 million or 9% of our energy holdings are in the oilfield service and drilling sector. While we had significant downgrades during the first quarter in these sectors, we've seen improvement in market values recently. We believe the companies we own have sufficient liquidity to endure the cycle. 
Third, based on the consensus of expert views, our investment department believes that oil is more likely to increase to $50 or $60 a barrel during the next 12 to 24 months and will remain at current levels. We believe that the companies in our portfolio can continue to operate for a very long time with oil prices at $40 to $50 a barrel. Even if oil declined to $30 a barrel and remained at that level for the next 12 to 24 months, we wouldn't expect to have significant defaults during that period.
Finally, the companies we have invested in have a variety of options they can utilize to avoid default including, but not limited to, reducing distributions to partners, drawing on lines of credit and reducing exploration activities. We do not expect significant further downgrades on our energy portfolio. Also, the recent downgrades should not impact our stock buyback program. Frank will address this in more detail when he discusses capital.
As to investment yield, in the first quarter, we invested $287 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sector. We invested an average yield of 5%, an average rating of BBB+ at an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.83%, down 4 basis points from the 5.87% yield in the first quarter of 2015. At March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.81%. 
For the remainder of 2016, we have assumed a new money rate of 5% at the midpoint of our guidance. This rate is lower than we previously expected. We are disappointed interest rates have not risen as expected. However, while the continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement, it will not have a negative impact on the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that will require us to write-off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. As we have said before, Torchmark can thrive in either a low or high interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the first quarter, we spent $80 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $53.26. So far, in April, we have used $21 mill",1257,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the first quarter, we spent $80 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $53.26. So far, in April, we have used $21 million to purchase 392,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have spent $101 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1.9 million shares at an average price of $53.38.
These purchases are being made from the parent company's free cash flow. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect free cash flow in 2016 to be around $320 million. Thus, including the $46 million available to the parent from assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have approximately $366 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. 
As previously mentioned, to date, we have used $101 million of this cash to buy 1.9 million Torchmark shares, leaving around $265 million of cash and other liquid assets available for the remainder of the year. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain at least $50 million to $60 million of assets at the parent company, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. 
Now a couple of comments regarding Torchmark's recent debt offering. In early April, Torchmark completed the issuance and sale of $300 million of 6.125% fixed rate junior subordinated debentures with a 40-year life but callable after 5 years. The debt was sold pursuant to Torchmark shelf registration statement from last August. The net proceeds from the debt issuance will be used to retire the $250 million outstanding principal amount, plus accrued interest on the 6.375% senior notes due June 15, 2016, and for general corporate purposes, including additional capital and other financing needs, if necessary, at our insurance subsidiaries. The issuance of the debt was consistent with guidance provided to S&P as to how we would refinance the upcoming maturity and the security will be treated as equity for their capital purposes. 
Both S&P and Moody's have assigned the same rating to the new junior subordinated security as exists on our current subordinated debentures. The issuance will have an immaterial impact on our earnings per share.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last 3 years, that level has been around an NAIC/RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. 
As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated RBC was 317%, 8 basis points below our target of 325%, primarily due to Part D earnings being lower and fourth quarter downgrades being greater than expected. 
During the first quarter of this year, we had approximately $245 million of net downgrades on an NAIC basis within our fixed income portfolio. This amount includes total downgrades from NAIC Class 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 4, net of any upgrades during that period. Though we don't calculate RBC on a quarterly basis, we estimate that these net downgrades will result in a decrease in our RBC percentage of approximately 5 basis points. This effect on RBC is consistent with the general rule of thumb we outlined last quarter, stating that for every $100 million in downgrades, a 2-basis-point reduction in RBC percentage would result and around $9 million of additional capital would be needed. The combination of the shortfall as of the end of 2015, plus the additional capital needed due to the downgrades in the first quarter, indicates that we may need around $60 million of additional capital to return to a 325% RBC level. At this time, we do not plan on changing our targeted RBC level of 325%. 
However, as indicated on the last call, should we believe that our RBC level is being adversely impacted by downgrades, that we believe are temporary and that will reverse in the relatively near future, we may choose to temporarily target an RBC ratio below 325%. We are comfortable that any additional capital needed to meet our target RBC levels for 2016 could be funded with excess proceeds from our recent debt issuance, available assets on hand and other sources of liquidity without having to suspend or reduce the amount available for share buybacks.
Now a few comments about Part D. On April 7, Torchmark was notified by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services that its 2 subsidiaries, UA and FUA, were released from intermediate sanctions and returned to normal marketing and enrollment status effective as of that date. The plans had operated under sanction since August 1 of last year. While our plans will be able to accept new enrollees, we anticipate that additional sales during the remainder of 2016 will be minimal. We continue to proceed with a possible sale of our Part D contract, and the release of these sanctions will have no impact on the company's previously announced commitment to exit the Medicare Part D business. 
As noted on the last call, the disposition of our Part D business will release around $70 million of capital that we held at the end of 2015 relating to this business. Since the risk-based capital is determined primarily on the level of premiums received and claims made during the year, we will still be required to hold the majority of this capital at the end of 2016. We estimate that approximately $10 million to $15 million of capital will become available in 2016, with the remainder to be released in 2017. We will consider an extraordinary dividend of the excess capital to the parent company, depending on our capital needs for 2017. 
Now with respect to our guidance for 2016, we are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.51 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $4.43 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.05 increase over our previous guidance. $0.04 of this increase is due to the early adoption of a newly issued accounting standard ASU 2016-9 as of January 1, 2016. This new accounting standard simplifies certain aspects of accounting for our equity-based compensation and will primarily affect our net operating income through its impact on stock compensation expense, net of taxes, diluted shares outstanding and earnings per share. As required by the new standard, the adoption is prospective, and thus, will impact only 2016 and future periods.
In the first quarter, the company recorded $2 million in additional tax benefits as a reduction to stock option expense in our first quarter operating earnings as opposed to directly increasing equity, as would have occurred under prior guidance. The adoption also resulted in an increase to the weighted average diluted shares. The net effect of the change in the first quarter was a $0.01 increase in earnings per share. 
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

The point is we could easily do that with the money that we have on hand.

One thing that Frank mentioned is that we're going to free up $70 million of capital in the next few years from Part D. That will go a long way towards helping, if there is any kind of capital shortage. The main thing is that we don't want to put the money down on the insurance companies, unless we -- until we determine we need to because once it's down there, and then, let's say bonds get upgraded and also we have excess capital, it's difficult to get that excess capital back out because we have to go through the extraordinary dividend process with the States.

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $549 million, while life underwriting margin was $144 million, up 3% from the year ago. Growth in underwriting margin lagged to premium growth due primarily to higher-than-expected Direct Response claims.

Administrative expenses were $48 million for the quarter, up 6% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. The primary reason for the increase in administrative expenses is increased investments in information technology.

308916,376200447,1015439,"Torchmark Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we defined as net investment income less the required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $55 million, a 4% d",866,"I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we defined as net investment income less the required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $55 million, a 4% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income declined to 2%.
On April 5, we issued $300 million of junior subordinated debt, primarily to refinance the $250 million debt issue that matured on June 15. Issuing a new debt 70 days before the debt maturity resulted in a negative carry of $30 million. Excluding the negative carry, excess investment income in dollars and per share would have been up 1% and 4%, respectively.
As discussed on previous calls, the Part D segment has a negative impact on excess investment income due to negative gas flows that occurred during the year, including the long delay in receiving reimbursements from CMS where excess claims made by the company. The impact of the loss investment income from the delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in income from continuing operations rather than in discontinued operations, in accordance with the applicable accounting rules.
In the second quarter, Part D had a negative impact on excess investment income of approximately $2.5 million compared to negative impact of $2.3 million in the year-ago quarter.
For the full year 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 1% to 2%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of about 5% to 6%. At the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, we're expecting a drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $9 million compared to a drag of $8 million in 2015.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $14.4 billion, including $13.8 billion of fixed maturities of amortized costs. As the fixed maturities, $13 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds are $763 million compared to $580 million the year-ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds of fixed maturities is 5.5% compared to 4.4% a year ago. The increase in below investment grade bonds is due primarily to downgrade of securities in the energy and metals and mining sectors in previous quarters. However, due to the increases in the underlying commodity prices, the current market value of the securities are significantly higher than at the time of their downgrade.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.6x, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains of fixed maturities, is 20%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturities portfolio of $1.7 billion, approximately $700 million higher than at the end of the first quarter.
Now to complete the discussion in the investment portfolio, I'd like to give an update on our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the investment sector. At June 30, we had a net unrealized gain of $32 million compared to an unrealized loss of $165 million[ph] at the end of 2015, an improvement of $197 million. The average rating of the energy fixed maturities is BBB with 90% of the holdings being investment grade.
Regarding investment yield. In the second quarter, we invested $364 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.75%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 24 years. For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.80%, down 5 basis points from the 5.85% yield in the second quarter of 2015. Through June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.79%. For the remainder of 2016, we had assumed a new rate of 4.4% at the midpoint of our guidance. This range is lower than previously expected. The low and declining interest rate environment continues to be an issue. However, our concern regarding an extended period of lower interest rates is the impact on the income statement, not the balance sheet. As long as we're in this interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline and place a downward pressure on excess investment income. However, this decline will be lessened by the fact that on average, only about 2% of our fixed maturity portfolio will run off each year over the next 5 years. Torchmark will continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. As I mentioned earlier, lower interest rate is negatively impacting the income statement, but not the balance sheet. This [indiscernible] primarily sell noninterest protection products accounted for FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that will require us to write-off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet as our cash flow test results indicate that our reserves are more than adequate to compensate for lower interest rates.
As we have said before, Torchmark can thrive in either a low or high interest rate environment.
Now we'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.In the second quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $57.77. So far in July, we have used $10.6 mi",994,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.
In the second quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $57.77. So far in July, we have used $10.6 million to purchase 174,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have spent $174 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.1 million shares at an average price of $55.77. These are being made from the parent's free cash flow. The parent's free cash flow as we define as results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and in the dividends paid Torchmark shareholders. We expect free cash flow in 2016 to be around $320 million. With $174 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have around $146 million available for the remainder of the year from our free cash flow, plus other assets available at the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of parent assets at the end of 2016, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around and NAIC/RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our company's in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. As we discussed on the last call, we do not calculate RBC on a quarterly basis. However, we estimate that, that because of lower than expected capital levels as of year ended 2015, plus downgrade in our investment portfolio during the first quarter of this year, we would need around $60 million of additional capital to return to a 325% RBC level.
As we also discussed on the last call and for the following reasons, we believe the shortfall maybe temporary and thus made to choose an RBC ratio slightly below 325% for 2016. First, we anticipate that the sale of our Medicare Part D business would generate approximately $20 million to $25 million of additional capital to be available for 2016, plus an additional $55 million to $60 million of additional capital that will be available in 2017. Thus, the additional capital available from this sale alone would be sufficient to offset the shortfall noted above. Additionally, we anticipate that certain investments that were downgraded by the NAIC in the first half of this year will be upgraded by the end of 2017. Thus, we are comfortable with our ability to meet responsible RBC levels for 2016 and the return to our targeted 325% RBC ratio no later than 2017.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operation. In the quarter, growth in total life underwriting income lagged the growth in premium, primarily due to higher-than-expected policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. In previous quarters, we had seen a higher trend in policy obligations, primarily due to higher-than-originally expected claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2000 through 2007 and 2011 through 2015. While claims this year are emerging on the 2000 to 2007 policies as anticipated, we are seeing higher policy obligations and anticipated for policies issued in 2011 through 2014. The higher obligations for these policy years are the primary cause for the increase in the policy obligation percentage for the second quarter from the 53.5% we anticipated to 56%. 
Last quarter, we indicated that policy obligations for the full year 2016 would be in the range of 52% to 53% of premium or 52.5% at the midpoint. With the additional claims experienced through June 30, we now anticipate that the Direct Response policy obligations for the full year 2016 will be in the range of 54% to 55% of premiums or around 54.5% at the midpoint of this range. This 2% increase in the midpoint is primarily due to the higher expected obligations on the 2011 through 2014 policy years. As a result of the higher policy obligations, we now estimate that the underwriting margin percentage for our Direct Response operations will be in the range of 17% to 19% for the year.
Now a few comments about the sale of our Medicare Part D operations. The effective July 1, 2016, Torchmark entered into an agreement to sell its Medicare Part D Prescription Drug business through SilverScript Insurance Company, a subsidiary of CBS Health. Under the terms of the agreement, Torchmark will retain all rights to the assets and liabilities as well as corresponding profits or losses for the 2016 plan year and SilverScript will assume all rights and obligations related to the business after 2016. We will continue to administer the plans for the remainder of this year and will transition all administration to SilverScript early in 2017. The net proceeds from the sale are expected to be upset by the write-off of approximately $16 million of deferred acquisition costs related to Torchmark's Part D business. As such, the net impact of the sale is expected to be immaterial to Torchmark's financial statements. The remaining net assets reflected on the balance sheet related to discontinued operations are receivables and payables that are expected to be settled in the ordinary course of business during 2016 and 2017. We expect that the balance of any remaining receivables to be less than $100 million by the end of 2016.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $549 million, while life underwriting margin was $144 million, up 3% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin lagged premium growth due primarily to higher-than-expected Direct Response claims. For the full year, we expect life underwriting margin to increase 1% to 2% over 2015.

Administrative expenses were $48 million for the quarter, up 6% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. The primary reason for the increase in administrative expenses is increased investments in information technology. As a percentage of premiums, from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.2% compared to 6.0% a year ago.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we defined as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $55 million, a 4% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income declined 2%.
On April 5, we issued $300 million of junior subordinated debt, primarily to refinance the $250 million debt issue that matured on June 15. Issuing a new debt 70 days before the debt maturity resulted in a negative carry of $30 million. Excluding the negative carry, excess investment income in dollars and per share would have been up 1% and 4%, respectively.
As discussed on previous calls, the Part D segment has a negative impact on excess investment income due to negative cash flows that occurred during the year, including the long delay in receiving reimbursement from the CMS for excess claims made by the company. The impact of the loss investment income from the delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in the income from continuing operations rather than in discontinued operations, in accordance with the applicable accounting rules.
In the second quarter, Part D had a negative impact on excess investment income of approximately $2.5 million compared to negative impact of $2.3 million in the year-ago quarter.
For the full year 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 1% to 2%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of about 5% to 6%. At the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, we're expecting a drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $9 million compared to a drag of $8 million in 2015.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $14.4 billion, including $13.8 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $13 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A minus, and below investment-grade bonds are $763 million compared to $580 million the year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds of fixed maturities is 5.5% compared to 4.4% a year ago. The increase in below investment-grade bonds is due primarily to downgrades of securities in the energy and metals and mining sectors in previous quarters. However, due to the increases in the underlying commodity prices, the current market value of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of their downgrade.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.6x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 20%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturities portfolio of $1.7 billion, approximately $700 million higher than at the end of the first quarter.
Now to complete the discussion in the investment portfolio, I'd like to give an update on our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. At June 30, we had a net unrealized gain of $32 million compared to an unrealized loss of $165 million at the end of 2015, an improvement of $197 million. The average rating of the energy fixed maturities is BBB with 90% of the holdings being investment grade.
Regarding investment yield. In the second quarter, we invested $364 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.75%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 24 years. For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.80%, down 5 basis points from the 5.85% yield in the second quarter of 2015. At June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.79%. For the remainder of 2016, we have assumed a new money rate of 4.4% at the midpoint of our guidance. This range is lower than previously expected. The low and declining interest rate environment continues to be an issue. However, our concern regarding an extended period of lower interest rates is the impact on the income statement, not the balance sheet. As long as we're in this interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline and place downward pressure on excess investment income. However, this decline will be lessened by the fact that on average, only about 2% of our fixed maturity portfolio will run off each year over the next 5 years. Torchmark will continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended lower interest rate environment. As I mentioned earlier, lower interest rates negatively impact the income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest instant protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that will require us to write-off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet as our cash flow test results indicate that our reserves are more than adequate to compensate for lower interest rates.
As we have said before, Torchmark can thrive in either a low or high interest rate environment.
Now we'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.In the second quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $57.77. So far in July, we have used $10.6 mi",996,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.
In the second quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $57.77. So far in July, we have used $10.6 million to purchase 174,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have spent $174 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.1 million shares at an average price of $55.77. These are being made from the parent's free cash flows. The parent's free cash flows, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and in the dividends paid Torchmark shareholders. We expect free cash flow in 2016 to be around $320 million. With $174 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have around $146 million available for the remainder of the year from our free cash flow, plus other assets available at the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of parent assets at the end of 2016, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC/RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. As we discussed on the last call, we do not calculate RBC on a quarterly basis. However, we estimated that because of lower than expected capital levels as of year ended 2015, plus downgrades in our investment portfolio during the first quarter of this year, we would need around $60 million of additional capital to return to a 325% RBC level.
As we also discussed on the last call and for the following reasons, we believe the shortfall may be temporary and thus may to choose to maintain an RBC ratio slightly below 325% for 2016. First, we anticipate that the sale of our Medicare Part D business will generate approximately $20 million to $25 million of additional capital to be available for 2016, plus an additional $55 million to $60 million of additional capital that will be available in 2017. Thus, the additional capital available from this sale alone would be sufficient to offset the shortfall noted above. Additionally, we anticipate that certain investments that were downgraded by the NAIC in the first half of this year will be upgraded by the end of 2017. Thus, we are comfortable with our ability to meet responsible RBC levels for 2016 and to return to our targeted 325% RBC ratio no later than 2017.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. In the quarter, growth in total life underwriting income lagged the growth in premium, primarily due to higher-than-expected policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. In previous quarters, we had seen a higher trend in policy obligations, primarily due to higher than originally expected claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2000 through 2007 and 2011 through 2015. While claims this year are emerging on the 2000 to 2007 policies as anticipated, we are seeing higher policy obligations than anticipated for policies issued in 2011 through 2014. The higher obligations for these policy years are the primary cause for the increase in the policy obligation percentage for the second quarter from the 53.5% we anticipated to 56%. 
Last quarter, we indicated that policy obligations for the full year 2016 would be in the range of 52% to 53% of premium or 52.5% at the midpoint. With the additional claims experienced through June 30, we now anticipate that the Direct Response policy obligations for the full year 2016 will be in the range of 54% to 55% of premiums or around 54.5% at the midpoint of this range. This 2% increase in the midpoint is primarily due to the higher expected obligations on the 2011 through 2014 policy years. As a result of the higher policy obligations, we now estimate that the underwriting margin percentage for our Direct Response operations will be in the range of 17% to 19% for the year.
Now a few comments about the sale of our Medicare Part D operations. Effective July 1, 2016, Torchmark entered into an agreement to sell its Medicare Part D Prescription Drug business to SilverScript Insurance Company, a subsidiary of CBS Health. Under the terms of the agreement, Torchmark will retain all rights to the assets and liabilities as well as corresponding profits or losses for the 2016 plan year and SilverScript will assume all rights and obligations related to the business after 2016. We will continue to administer the plans for the remainder of this year and will transition all administration to SilverScript early in 2017. The net proceeds from the sale are expected to be offset by the write-off of approximately $16 million of deferred acquisition costs related to Torchmark's Part D business. As such, the net impact of the sale is expected to be immaterial to Torchmark's financial statements. The remaining net assets reflected on the balance sheet related to discontinued operations are receivables and payables that are expected to be settled in the ordinary course of business during 2016 and 2017. We expect the balance of any remaining receivables to be less than $100 million by the end of 2016.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

In the second quarter, net income was $138 million or $1.13 per share, a 13% increase on a per share basis. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $137 million or $1.11 per share for a per share increase of 8% from a year ago.
On a GAAP reported basis, our return on equity as of June 30 was 11.8% and book value per share was $39.87, an increase of 17% from a year ago. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, our return on equity was 14.6% and our book value per share was $31.11, an 8% increase from a year ago.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $549 million, while life underwriting margin was $144 million, up 3% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin lagged premium growth due primarily to higher-than-expected Direct Response claims. For the full year, we expect life underwriting margin to increase 1% to 2% over 2015.
Net life sales were $110 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter. On the health side, premium revenue grew 2% to $237 million and health underwriting margin was also up 2% to $53 million. For the full year, we expect health underwriting margin to grow 1% to 2%. Health sales increased 6% to $33 million. Individual health sales grew 8% to $30 million.
Administrative expenses were $48 million for the quarter, up 6% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. The primary reason for the increase in administrative expenses is increased investments in information technology. As a percentage of premiums, from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.2% compared to 6.0% a year ago. For the full year, we anticipate administrative expenses will also be around 6.2% of the premium.

In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 5% to $199 million. Life underwriting margin declined 10% to $33 million.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $55 million, a 4% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income declined 2%.
On April 5, we issued $300 million of junior subordinated debt, primarily to refinance the $250 million debt issue that matured on June 15. Issuing a new debt 70 days before the debt maturity resulted in a negative carry of $30 million. Excluding the negative carry, excess investment income in dollars and per share would have been up 1% and 4%, respectively.
As discussed on previous calls, the Part D segment has a negative impact on excess investment income due to negative cash flows that occurred during the year, including the long delay in receiving reimbursement from the CMS for excess claims paid by the company. The impact of the lost investment income from the delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in the income from continuing operations rather than in discontinued operations, in accordance with the applicable accounting rules.
In the second quarter, Part D had a negative impact on excess investment income of approximately $2.5 million compared to negative impact of $2.3 million in the year-ago quarter.
For the full year 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 1% to 2%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of about 5% to 6%. At the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, we're expecting a drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $9 million compared to a drag of $8 million in 2015.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $14.4 billion, including $13.8 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $13 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $763 million compared to $580 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 5.5% compared to 4.4% a year ago. The increase in below investment-grade bonds is due primarily to downgrades of securities in the energy and metals and mining sectors in previous quarters. However, due to the increases in the underlying commodity prices, the current market value of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of their downgrade.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.6x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 20%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturities portfolio of $1.7 billion, approximately $700 million higher than at the end of the first quarter.
Now to complete the discussion in the investment portfolio, I'd like to give an update on our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. At June 30, we had a net unrealized gain of $32 million compared to an unrealized loss of $165 million at the end of 2015, an improvement of $197 million. The average rating of the energy fixed maturities is BBB with 90% of the holdings being investment grade.
Regarding investment yield. In the second quarter, we invested $364 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.75%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 24 years. For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.80%, down 5 basis points from the 5.85% yield in the second quarter of 2015. At June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.79%. For the remainder of 2016, we have assumed a new money rate of 4.4% at the midpoint of our guidance. This rate is lower than previously expected. The low and declining interest rate environment continues to be an issue. However, our concern regarding an extended period of lower interest rates is the impact on the income statement, not the balance sheet. As long as we're in this interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline and place downward pressure on excess investment income. However, this decline will be lessened by the fact that on average, only about 2% of our fixed maturity portfolio will run off each year over the next 5 years. Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended lower [ph] interest rate environment. As I mentioned earlier, lower interest rates negatively impact the income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet as our cash flow test results indicate that our reserves are more than adequate to compensate for lower interest rates.
As we have said before, Torchmark can thrive in either a low or high interest rate environment.
Now we'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.In the second quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $57.77. So far in July, we have used $10.6 mi",993,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.
In the second quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $57.77. So far in July, we have used $10.6 million to purchase 174,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have spent $174 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.1 million shares at an average price of $55.77. These are being made from the parent's free cash flows. The parent's free cash flows, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect free cash flow in 2016 to be around $320 million. With $174 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have around $146 million available for the remainder of the year from our free cash flow, plus other assets available at the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of parent assets at the end of 2016, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC/RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. As we discussed on the last call, we do not calculate RBC on a quarterly basis. However, we estimated that because of lower-than-expected capital levels as of year ended 2015, plus downgrades in our investment portfolio during the first quarter of this year, we would need around $60 million of additional capital to return to a 325% RBC level.
As we also discussed on the last call and for the following reasons, we believe the shortfall may be temporary and thus may choose to maintain an RBC ratio slightly below 325% for 2016. First, we anticipate that the sale of our Medicare Part D business will generate approximately $20 million to $25 million of additional capital to be available for 2016, plus an additional $55 million to $60 million of additional capital that will be available in 2017. Thus, the additional capital available from this sale alone would be sufficient to offset the shortfall noted above. Additionally, we anticipate that certain investments that were downgraded by the NAIC in the first half of this year will be upgraded by the end of 2017. Thus, we are comfortable with our ability to meet responsible RBC levels for 2016 and to return to our targeted 325% RBC ratio no later than 2017.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. In the quarter, growth in total life underwriting income lagged the growth in premium, primarily due to higher-than-expected policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. In previous quarters, we had seen a higher trend in policy obligations, primarily due to higher than originally expected claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2000 through 2007 and 2011 through 2015. While claims this year are emerging on the 2000 to 2007 policies as anticipated, we are seeing higher policy obligations than anticipated for policies issued in 2011 through 2014. The higher obligations for these policy years are the primary cause for the increase in the policy obligation percentage for the second quarter from the 53.5% we anticipated to 56%. 
Last quarter, we indicated that policy obligations for the full year 2016 would be in the range of 52% to 53% of premium or 52.5% at the midpoint. With the additional claims experienced through June 30, we now anticipate that the Direct Response policy obligations for the full year 2016 will be in the range of 54% to 55% of premiums or around 54.5% at the midpoint of this range. This 2% increase in the midpoint is primarily due to the higher expected obligations on the 2011 through 2014 policy years. As a result of the higher policy obligations, we now estimate that the underwriting margin percentage for our Direct Response operations will be in the range of 17% to 19% for the year.
Now a few comments about the sale of our Medicare Part D operations. Effective July 1, 2016, Torchmark entered into an agreement to sell its Medicare Part D Prescription Drug business to SilverScript Insurance Company, a subsidiary of CVS Health. Under the terms of the agreement, Torchmark will retain all rights to the assets and liabilities as well as corresponding profits or losses for the 2016 plan year and SilverScript will assume all rights and obligations related to the business after 2016. We will continue to administer the plans for the remainder of this year and will transition all administration to SilverScript early in 2017. The net proceeds from the sale are expected to be offset by the write-off of approximately $16 million of deferred acquisition costs related to Torchmark's Part D business. As such, the net impact of the sale is expected to be immaterial to Torchmark's financial statements. The remaining net assets reflected on the balance sheet related to discontinued operations are receivables and payables that are expected to be settled in the ordinary course of business during 2016 and 2017. We expect the balance of any remaining receivables to be less than $100 million by the end of 2016.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $549 million, while life underwriting margin was $144 million, up 3% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin lagged premium growth due primarily to higher-than-expected Direct Response claims.

Administrative expenses were $48 million for the quarter, up 6% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. The primary reason for the increase in administrative expenses is increased investments in information technology.

308916,376200447,1018388,"Torchmark Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $55 million, a 4% dec",866,"I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $55 million, a 4% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income declined 2%.
On April 5, we issued $300 million of junior subordinated debt, primarily to refinance the $250 million debt issue that matured on June 15. Issuing a new debt 70 days before the debt maturity resulted in a negative carry of $30 million. Excluding the negative carry, excess investment income in dollars and per share would have been up 1% and 4%, respectively.
As discussed on previous calls, the Part D segment has a negative impact on excess investment income due to negative cash flows that occurred during the year, including the long delay in receiving reimbursement from the CMS for excess claims paid by the company. The impact of the lost investment income from the delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in the income from continuing operations rather than in discontinued operations, in accordance with the applicable accounting rules.
In the second quarter, Part D had a negative impact on excess investment income of approximately $2.5 million compared to negative impact of $2.3 million in the year-ago quarter.
For the full year 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 1% to 2%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of about 5% to 6%. At the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, we're expecting a drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $9 million compared to a drag of $8 million in 2015.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $14.4 billion, including $13.8 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $13 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $763 million compared to $580 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 5.5% compared to 4.4% a year ago. The increase in below investment-grade bonds is due primarily to downgrades of securities in the energy and metals and mining sectors in previous quarters. However, due to the increases in the underlying commodity prices, the current market value of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of their downgrade.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.6x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 20%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturities portfolio of $1.7 billion, approximately $700 million higher than at the end of the first quarter.
Now to complete the discussion in the investment portfolio, I'd like to give an update on our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. At June 30, we had a net unrealized gain of $32 million compared to an unrealized loss of $165 million at the end of 2015, an improvement of $197 million. The average rating of the energy fixed maturities is BBB with 90% of the holdings being investment grade.
Regarding investment yield. In the second quarter, we invested $364 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.75%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 24 years. For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.80%, down 5 basis points from the 5.85% yield in the second quarter of 2015. At June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.79%. For the remainder of 2016, we have assumed a new money rate of 4.4% at the midpoint of our guidance. This rate is lower than previously expected. The low and declining interest rate environment continues to be an issue. However, our concern regarding an extended period of lower interest rates is the impact on the income statement, not the balance sheet. As long as we're in this interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline and place downward pressure on excess investment income. However, this decline will be lessened by the fact that on average, only about 2% of our fixed maturity portfolio will run off each year over the next 5 years. Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended lower [ph] interest rate environment. As I mentioned earlier, lower interest rates negatively impact the income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet as our cash flow test results indicate that our reserves are more than adequate to compensate for lower interest rates.
As we have said before, Torchmark can thrive in either a low or high interest rate environment.
Now we'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.In the second quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $57.77. So far in July, we have used $10.6 mi",993,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.
In the second quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $57.77. So far in July, we have used $10.6 million to purchase 174,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have spent $174 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.1 million shares at an average price of $55.77. These are being made from the parent's free cash flows. The parent's free cash flows, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect free cash flow in 2016 to be around $320 million. With $174 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have around $146 million available for the remainder of the year from our free cash flow, plus other assets available at the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of parent assets at the end of 2016, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC/RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. As we discussed on the last call, we do not calculate RBC on a quarterly basis. However, we estimated that because of lower-than-expected capital levels as of year ended 2015, plus downgrades in our investment portfolio during the first quarter of this year, we would need around $60 million of additional capital to return to a 325% RBC level.
As we also discussed on the last call and for the following reasons, we believe the shortfall may be temporary and thus may choose to maintain an RBC ratio slightly below 325% for 2016. First, we anticipate that the sale of our Medicare Part D business will generate approximately $20 million to $25 million of additional capital to be available for 2016, plus an additional $55 million to $60 million of additional capital that will be available in 2017. Thus, the additional capital available from this sale alone would be sufficient to offset the shortfall noted above. Additionally, we anticipate that certain investments that were downgraded by the NAIC in the first half of this year will be upgraded by the end of 2017. Thus, we are comfortable with our ability to meet responsible RBC levels for 2016 and to return to our targeted 325% RBC ratio no later than 2017.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. In the quarter, growth in total life underwriting income lagged the growth in premium, primarily due to higher-than-expected policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. In previous quarters, we had seen a higher trend in policy obligations, primarily due to higher than originally expected claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2000 through 2007 and 2011 through 2015. While claims this year are emerging on the 2000 to 2007 policies as anticipated, we are seeing higher policy obligations than anticipated for policies issued in 2011 through 2014. The higher obligations for these policy years are the primary cause for the increase in the policy obligation percentage for the second quarter from the 53.5% we anticipated to 56%. 
Last quarter, we indicated that policy obligations for the full year 2016 would be in the range of 52% to 53% of premium or 52.5% at the midpoint. With the additional claims experienced through June 30, we now anticipate that the Direct Response policy obligations for the full year 2016 will be in the range of 54% to 55% of premiums or around 54.5% at the midpoint of this range. This 2% increase in the midpoint is primarily due to the higher expected obligations on the 2011 through 2014 policy years. As a result of the higher policy obligations, we now estimate that the underwriting margin percentage for our Direct Response operations will be in the range of 17% to 19% for the year.
Now a few comments about the sale of our Medicare Part D operations. Effective July 1, 2016, Torchmark entered into an agreement to sell its Medicare Part D Prescription Drug business to SilverScript Insurance Company, a subsidiary of CVS Health. Under the terms of the agreement, Torchmark will retain all rights to the assets and liabilities as well as corresponding profits or losses for the 2016 plan year and SilverScript will assume all rights and obligations related to the business after 2016. We will continue to administer the plans for the remainder of this year and will transition all administration to SilverScript early in 2017. The net proceeds from the sale are expected to be offset by the write-off of approximately $16 million of deferred acquisition costs related to Torchmark's Part D business. As such, the net impact of the sale is expected to be immaterial to Torchmark's financial statements. The remaining net assets reflected on the balance sheet related to discontinued operations are receivables and payables that are expected to be settled in the ordinary course of business during 2016 and 2017. We expect the balance of any remaining receivables to be less than $100 million by the end of 2016.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

In the third quarter, net income was $152 million or $1.25 per share, a 9% increase on a per share basis. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $140 million or $1.15 per share, $0.03 higher than anticipated in our previous guidance due primarily to lower-than-expected after-tax stock compensation expense. 
On a GAAP reported basis, our return on equity as of September 30 was 12.0%, and book value per share was $41.94. Excluding unrealized gains on fixed maturities, our return on equity was 14.7% and our book value per share was $31.86, an 8% increase from a year ago.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $546 million, while life underwriting margin was $143 million, down 1% from a year ago. The decline in underwriting margin was due primarily to the decline in the Direct Response margin. For the full year, we expect life underwriting margin to be around 1% higher than 2015.
Net life sales were $100 million, down 1% from the year-ago quarter. On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $237 million, and health underwriting margin was up 6% to $53 million. For the full year, we expect health underwriting margin to grow approximately 2%. Health sales were $33 million, same as in the year-ago quarter. However, individual health sales were $30 million, up 9%.
Administrative expenses were $49 million for the quarter, up 4% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.3%, same as a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses will be around 6.2% of premium.

At American Income, life premiums were up 10% to $231 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $74 million. Net life sales were $52 million, up 4%, due primarily to increased agent count. The average agent count for the third quarter was 7,004, up 6% from a year ago and up 6% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 7,025. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 6,750 to 6,950 at the end of 2016. We expect 7% to 8% life sales growth for the full year 2016 and 6% to 10% in 2017. 
In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $192 million. Life underwriting margin declined 26% to $29 million. Net life sales were down 9% to $35 million, due primarily to decreases in circulation. We expect life sales to be down 7% to 9% for the full year 2016 and flat to down 5% in 2017. The further sales decline in 2017 reflects changes in marketing designed to increase the profitability of new sales. 
At Liberty National, life premiums were $67 million, down 1% from the year-ago quarter, while life underwriting margin was $20 million, up 9%. Net life sales increased 11% to $10 million, while net health sales increased 3% to $5 million. The sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,799, up 13% from a year ago and up 3% compared to the second quarter. The producing agent count of Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,785. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 1,700 to 1,800 at the end of 2016.
Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 10% to 11% for the full year 2016 and 7% to 11% in 2017. Health net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 7% to 9% for the full year 2016 and 4% to 8% in 2017. We are very pleased with the progress of the turnaround of Liberty National.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $60 million, while health underwriting margin increased 19% to $13 million. Health net sales grew 8% to $14 million. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 986, up 9% from a year ago and 6% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,004. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 975 to 1,025 at the end of 2016. Health sales growth should be in a range of 2% to 4% for the full year 2016 and 3% to 7% for 2017.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 5% to $88 million. Net health sales were $10 million, down 14% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Medicare supplement sales grew 14% to $8 million, while group sales declined 57% to $2 million.
For the full year 2016, we expect growth in individual Medicare supplement sales to be around 7% and 9%. We expect sales growth in 2017 of 6% to 10%.

308916,405180483,1061543,"Torchmark Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I'm going to spend the next few minutes discussing our investment operations.

First, the excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $57 million, a 5% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 9%. 
For the full year 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow by approximately 2%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of approximately 6%. 
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $14.6 billion, including $13.9 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. As the fixed maturities, $13.2 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $753 million compared to $568 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 5.4% compared to 4.3% a year ago. The increase of below investment-grade bonds is due primarily to downgrades of securities in the energy and metals and mining sectors in previous quarters. However, due to increases in underlying commodity prices, the current market base of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of the downgrades. 
With a portfolio leverage of 3.6x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 19%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.9 billion, approximately $1 billion higher than a year ago. 
To complete the discussion in investment portfolio, I'd like to give an update on our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. At September 30, we had a net unrealized gain of $90 million compared to an unrealized loss of $165 million at the end of 2015, an improvement of $255 million. The average rating of the energy fixed maturities is triple BBB, with 90% of the holdings being investment grade.
Now investment yield. In the third quarter, we invested $275 million of investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.40%, an average rating of BBB and an average life of 25 years. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.77%, down 4 basis points from the 5.81% yield in the third quarter of 2015. At September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.76%. 
At the midpoint of our guidance, we assumed a new money rate of 4.45% in the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of 4.65% in 2017. The low and declining interest rate environment continues to be an issue. However, our concern regarding an extended period of lower interest rates is the impact on the income statement, not the balance sheet. As long as we're in this interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline and place downward pressure on the growth of investment income. However, this decline will be lessened by the fact that, on average, only about 2% of our fixed maturity portfolio will run off each year over the next 5 years. Torchmark will continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. 
As I mentioned earlier, lower interest rates negatively impact the income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet as our cash flow test results indicate that our reserves are more than adequate to compensate for lower interest rates. As we have said before, Torchmark can thrive in either low or high interest rate environment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $77 million to buy 1.2 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $62.65. So far in October, we have used $16.4 m",755,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $77 million to buy 1.2 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $62.65. So far in October, we have used $16.4 million to purchase 255,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have spent $256 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 4.4 million shares at an average price of $57.96. These are being made from the parent's free cash flows. The parent company's free cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect free cash flow in 2016 to be around $320 million. With $256 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have around $64 million available for the remainder of the year from our free cash flow, plus other assets available at the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of parent assets at the end of 2016. 
For 2017, we preliminarily estimate that the free cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. 
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC/RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our company in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. 
As we discussed on the last call, we do not calculate RBC on a quarterly basis. However, we estimated that because of lower-than-expected capital levels as of year-end 2015 plus downgrades in our investment portfolio during this year, we would need around $60 million of additional capital to return to a 325% RBC level.
As we also discussed, we believe this shortfall may be somewhat temporary and thus, we may choose to maintain an RBC ratio slightly below 325% for 2016. With the combination of proceeds from our second quarter debt issuances, capital we generated from the sale of our Medicare Part D business and potential upgrades in our investment portfolio, we are comfortable with our ability to meet responsible RBC levels for 2016 and to meet our targeted 325% RBC ratio no later than the end of 2017 without having to utilize any of our free cash flow for capital contributions.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. In the quarter, growth in total life income lagged behind the growth in premium, primarily due to higher-than-expected policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. In previous quarters, we discussed the higher trend in policy obligations, primarily due to higher than originally expected claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2000 through 2007 and 2011 through 2015. While claims this year are emerging on the 2000 through 2007 policies largely as anticipated, we are seeing higher policy obligations than anticipated for certain segments of our business issued in 2011 through 2015. The higher obligations for these policy years are the primary cause for the increase in the policy obligation percentage from the 55% we had anticipated for the third quarter to 57%.
Last quarter, we indicated that policy obligations for the full year 2016 would be in the range of 54% to 55% of premium or 54.5% at the midpoint. With further analysis and additional claims experienced through September 30, we now anticipate that the Direct Response of policy obligations for the full year 2016 will be around 56% of premiums at the midpoint of this range, a 1.5 percentage point increase. As a result of the expected higher policy obligations, we now estimate that the underwriting margin for the Direct Response operations will be in the arrange of 16% to 17% for the year. We also anticipate that the underwriting margin in 2017 will decline slightly and be in the range of 14% to 16% of premium for the full year. 
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

It's really been driven by a couple of factors. O",291,"Yes, I think the decline from 2015 to 2016 statutory earnings, which are really because of our decline of free cash flows from that $360 million that you were mentioning to we're at $320 million this year. It's really been driven by a couple of factors. One of it was the higher Direct Response claims as well as some of the lowering of the Part D margins that we've had over the course of time. So clearly, some of the higher Direct Response claims have had an impact on our statutory earnings. Probably about 1/3 of that decline has just been from a really good sale that we've had in the past couple of years. And so as we grow sales and if we're growing sales at 8%, 9%, 10%, that generates a significant amount of 1st-year statutory strain. Now if you have that over several years, then the profits of that are being generated from those sales start to catch up too and help to then grow the statutory earnings going forward. And then there's some other factors, just the higher -- our higher IT expenses generally administrative expenses. We've had some ups and downs on the tax rate, perhaps, but -- so for the most part -- and what we kind of see your going forward is why I think that for 2017, the Direct Response is continuing to have a little bit more of an impact, I think what you'll see as far as not having the growth from '15 to '16 or '16 to '17 -- excuse me, but I think in the near term and for 2017, statutory earnings, I would not expect them to be significantly differently than what you're seeing really at today's levels."

In the third quarter, net income was $152 million or $1.25 per share, a 9% increase on a per share basis. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $140 million or $1.15 per share, $0.03 higher than anticipated in our previous guidance due primarily to lower-than-expected after-tax stock compensation expense. 
On a GAAP reported basis, our return on equity as of September 30 was 12.0%, and book value per share was $41.94. Excluding unrealized gains on fixed maturities, our return on equity was 14.7% and our book value per share was $31.86, an 8% increase from a year ago.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $546 million, while life underwriting margin was $143 million, down 1% from a year ago. The decline in underwriting margin was due primarily to the decline in the Direct Response margin. For the full year, we expect life underwriting margin to be around 1% higher than 2015.
Net life sales were $100 million, down 1% from the year-ago quarter. On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $237 million, and health underwriting margin was up 6% to $53 million. For the full year, we expect health underwriting margin to grow approximately 2%. Health sales were $33 million, same as in the year-ago quarter. However, individual health sales were $30 million, up 9%.
Administrative expenses were $49 million for the quarter, up 4% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.3%, same as a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses will be around 6.2% of premium.

At American Income, life premiums were up 10% to $231 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $74 million. Net life sales were $52 million, up 4%, due primarily to increased agent count. The average agent count for the third quarter was 7,004, up 6% from a year ago and up 6% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 7,025. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 6,750 to 6,950 at the end of 2016. We expect 7% to 8% life sales growth for the full year 2016 and 6% to 10% in 2017. 
In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $192 million. Life underwriting margin declined 26% to $29 million. Net life sales were down 9% to $35 million, due primarily to decreases in circulation. We expect life sales to be down 7% to 9% for the full year 2016 and flat to down 5% in 2017. The further sales decline in 2017 reflects changes in marketing designed to increase the profitability of new sales. 
At Liberty National, life premiums were $67 million, down 1% from the year-ago quarter, while life underwriting margin was $20 million, up 9%. Net life sales increased 11% to $10 million, while net health sales increased 3% to $5 million. The sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,799, up 13% from a year ago and up 3% compared to the second quarter. The producing agent count of Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,785. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 1,700 to 1,800 at the end of 2016.
Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 10% to 11% for the full year 2016 and 7% to 11% in 2017. Health net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 7% to 9% for the full year 2016 and 4% to 8% in 2017. We are very pleased with the progress of the turnaround of Liberty National.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $60 million, while health underwriting margin increased 19% to $13 million. Health net sales grew 8% to $14 million. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 986, up 9% from a year ago and 6% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,004. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 975 to 1,025 at the end of 2016. Health sales growth should be in a range of 2% to 4% for the full year 2016 and 3% to 7% for 2017.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 5% to $88 million. Net health sales were $10 million, down 14% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Medicare supplement sales grew 14% to $8 million, while group sales declined 57% to $2 million.
For the full year 2016, we expect growth in individual Medicare supplement sales to be around 7% and 9%. We expect sales growth in 2017 of 6% to 10%.

308916,405180483,1061737,"Torchmark Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I'm going to spend the next few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, the excess investment income.

First, the excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $57 million, a 5% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 9%. 
For the full year 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow by approximately 2%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of approximately 6%. 
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $14.6 billion, including $13.9 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. As the fixed maturities, $13.2 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $753 million compared to $568 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 5.4% compared to 4.3% a year ago. The increase of below investment-grade bonds is due primarily to downgrades of securities in the energy and metals and mining sectors in previous quarters. However, due to increases in underlying commodity prices, the current market base of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of the downgrades. 
With a portfolio leverage of 3.6x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 19%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.9 billion, approximately $1 billion higher than a year ago. 
To complete the discussion in investment portfolio, I'd like to give an update on our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. At September 30, we had a net unrealized gain of $90 million compared to an unrealized loss of $165 million at the end of 2015, an improvement of $255 million. The average rating of the energy fixed maturities is triple BBB, with 90% of the holdings being investment grade.
Now investment yield. In the third quarter, we invested $275 million of investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.40%, an average rating of BBB and an average life of 25 years. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.77%, down 4 basis points from the 5.81% yield in the third quarter of 2015. At September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.76%. 
At the midpoint of our guidance, we assumed a new money rate of 4.45% in the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of 4.65% in 2017. The low and declining interest rate environment continues to be an issue. However, our concern regarding an extended period of lower interest rates is the impact on the income statement, not the balance sheet. As long as we're in this interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline and place downward pressure on the growth of investment income. However, this decline will be lessened by the fact that, on average, only about 2% of our fixed maturity portfolio will run off each year over the next 5 years. Torchmark will continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. 
As I mentioned earlier, lower interest rates negatively impact the income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet as our cash flow test results indicate that our reserves are more than adequate to compensate for lower interest rates. As we have said before, Torchmark can thrive in either low or high interest rate environment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $77 million to buy 1.2 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $62.65. So far in October, we have used $16.4 million to purchase 255,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have spent $256 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 4.4 million shares at an average price of $57.96. These are being made from the parent's free cash flows. The parent company's free cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect free cash flow in 2016 to be around $320 million. With $256 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have around $64 million available for the remainder of the year from our free cash flow, plus other assets available at the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of parent assets at the end of 2016. 
For 2017, we preliminarily estimate that the free cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. 
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our company in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. 
As we discussed on the last call, we do not calculate RBC on a quarterly basis. However, we estimated that because of lower-than-expected capital levels as of year-end 2015 plus downgrades in our investment portfolio during this year, we would need around $60 million of additional capital to return to a 325% RBC level.
As we also discussed, we believe this shortfall may be somewhat temporary and thus, we may choose to maintain an RBC ratio slightly below 325% for 2016. With the combination of proceeds from our second quarter debt issuances, capital we generated from the sale of our Medicare Part D business and potential upgrades in our investment portfolio, we are comfortable with our ability to meet responsible RBC levels for 2016 and to meet our targeted 325% RBC ratio no later than the end of 2017 without having to utilize any of our free cash flow for capital contributions.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. In the quarter, growth in total life income lagged behind the growth in premium, primarily due to higher-than-expected policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. In previous quarters, we discussed the higher trend in policy obligations, primarily due to higher than originally expected claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2000 through 2007 and 2011 through 2015. While claims this year are emerging on the 2000 through 2007 policies largely as anticipated, we are seeing higher policy obligations than anticipated for certain segments of our business issued in 2011 through 2015. The higher obligations for these policy years are the primary cause for the increase in the policy obligation percentage from the 55% we had anticipated for the third quarter to 57%.
Last quarter, we indicated that policy obligations for the full year 2016 would be in the range of 54% to 55% of premium or 54.5% at the midpoint. With further analysis and additional claims experienced through September 30, we now anticipate that the Direct Response of policy obligations for the full year 2016 will be around 56% of premiums at the midpoint of this range, a 1.5 percentage point increase. As a result of the expected higher policy obligations, we now estimate that the underwriting margin for the Direct Response operations will be in the range of 16% to 17% for the year. We also anticipate that the underwriting margin in 2017 will decline slightly and be in the range of 14% to 16% of premium for the full year. 
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

So to the extent that, that moves, if that were to change significantly, something would happen between now and the end of the year, our stock price would fluctuate enough, that would also have some impact.

It's really being driven by a couple of factors. One of it was the higher Direct Response claims as well as some of the lowering of the Part D margins that we've had over the course of time. So clearly, some of the higher Direct Response claims had an impact on our statutory earnings. Probably about 1/3 of that decline has just been from the really good sales that we've had in the past couple of years. And so as we grow sales, and if we're growing sales at 8%, 9%, 10%, that generates a significant amount of first year statutory strain. Now if you have that over several years, then the profits that are being generated from those sales start to catch up, too, and help to then grow the statutory earnings going forward. And then, there's some other factors, just the higher -- our higher IT expenses, generally administrative expenses. We've had some ups and downs on the tax rate, perhaps, but -- so for the most part -- and what we kind of see here for going forward is while I think that for 2017, the Direct Response is continuing to have a little bit more of an impact, I think what you'll see as far as not having the growth from '15 to '16 or '16 to '17 -- excuse me, but I think in the near term and for 2017, statutory earnings, I would not expect them to be significantly different than what you're seeing really at today's levels."

In the third quarter, net income was $152 million or $1.25 per share, a 9% increase on a per share basis. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $140 million or $1.15 per share, $0.03 higher than anticipated in our previous guidance due primarily to lower-than-expected after-tax stock compensation expense. 
On a GAAP reported basis, our return on equity as of September 30 was 12.0%, and book value per share was $41.94. Excluding unrealized gains on fixed maturities, our return on equity was 14.7% and our book value per share was $31.86, an 8% increase from a year ago.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $546 million, while life underwriting margin was $143 million, down 1% from a year ago. The decline in underwriting margin was due primarily to the decline in the Direct Response margin. For the full year, we expect life underwriting margin to be around 1% higher than 2015.
Net life sales were $100 million, down 1% from the year-ago quarter. On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $237 million, and health underwriting margin was up 6% to $53 million. For the full year, we expect health underwriting margin to grow approximately 2%. Health sales were $33 million, same as in the year-ago quarter. However, individual health sales were $30 million, up 9%.
Administrative expenses were $49 million for the quarter, up 4% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.3%, same as a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses will be around 6.2% of premium.

At American Income, life premiums were up 10% to $231 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $74 million. Net life sales were $52 million, up 4%, due primarily to increased agent count. The average agent count for the third quarter was 7,004, up 6% from a year ago and up 6% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 7,025. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 6,750 to 6,950 at the end of 2016. We expect 7% to 8% life sales growth for the full year 2016 and 6% to 10% in 2017. 
In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $192 million. Life underwriting margin declined 26% to $29 million. Net life sales were down 9% to $35 million, due primarily to decreases in circulation. We expect life sales to be down 7% to 9% for the full year 2016 and flat to down 5% in 2017. The further sales decline in 2017 reflects changes in marketing designed to increase the profitability of new sales. 
At Liberty National, life premiums were $67 million, down 1% from the year-ago quarter, while life underwriting margin was $20 million, up 9%. Net life sales increased 11% to $10 million, while net health sales increased 3% to $5 million. The sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,799, up 13% from a year ago and up 3% compared to the second quarter. The producing agent count of Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,785. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 1,700 to 1,800 at the end of 2016.
Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 10% to 11% for the full year 2016 and 7% to 11% in 2017. Health net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 7% to 9% for the full year 2016 and 4% to 8% in 2017. We are very pleased with the progress of the turnaround of Liberty National.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $60 million, while health underwriting margin increased 19% to $13 million. Health net sales grew 8% to $14 million. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 986, up 9% from a year ago and 6% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,004. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 975 to 1,025 at the end of 2016. Health sales growth should be in a range of 2% to 4% for the full year 2016 and 3% to 7% for 2017.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 5% to $88 million. Net health sales were $10 million, down 14% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Medicare supplement sales grew 14% to $8 million, while group sales declined 57% to $2 million.
For the full year 2016, we expect growth in individual Medicare supplement sales to be around 7% and 9%. We expect sales growth in 2017 of 6% to 10%.

308916,405180483,1061986,"Torchmark Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I'm going to spend the next few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, the excess investment income.

First, the excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $57 million, a 5% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 9%. 
For the full year 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow by approximately 2%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of approximately 6%. 
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $14.6 billion, including $13.9 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $13.2 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $753 million compared to $568 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 5.4% compared to 4.3% a year ago. The increase of below investment-grade bonds is due primarily to downgrades of securities in the energy and metals and mining sectors in previous quarters. However, due to increases in underlying commodity prices, the current market base of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of the downgrades. 
With a portfolio leverage of 3.6x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 19%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.9 billion, approximately $1 billion higher than a year ago. 
To complete the discussion in investment portfolio, I'd like to give an update on our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. At September 30, we had a net unrealized gain of $90 million compared to an unrealized loss of $165 million at the end of 2015, an improvement of $255 million. The average rating of the energy fixed maturities is triple BBB, with 90% of the holdings being investment grade.
Now investment yield. In the third quarter, we invested $275 million of investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.40%, an average rating of BBB and an average life of 25 years. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.77%, down 4 basis points from the 5.81% yield in the third quarter of 2015. At September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.76%. 
At the midpoint of our guidance, we assumed a new money rate of 4.45% in the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of 4.65% in 2017. The low and declining interest rate environment continues to be an issue. However, our concern regarding an extended period of lower interest rates is the impact on the income statement, not the balance sheet. As long as we're in this interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline and place downward pressure on the growth of investment income. However, this decline will be lessened by the fact that, on average, only about 2% of our fixed maturity portfolio will run off each year over the next 5 years. Torchmark will continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. 
As I mentioned earlier, lower interest rates negatively impact the income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet as our cash flow test results indicate that our reserves are more than adequate to compensate for lower interest rates. As we have said before, Torchmark can thrive in either low or high interest rate environment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $77 million to buy 1.2 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $62.65. So far in October, we have used $16.4 million to purchase 255,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have spent $256 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 4.4 million shares at an average price of $57.96. These are being made from the parent's free cash flows. The parent company's free cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect free cash flow in 2016 to be around $320 million. With $256 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have around $64 million available for the remainder of the year from our free cash flow, plus other assets available at the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of parent assets at the end of 2016. 
For 2017, we preliminarily estimate that the free cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. 
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our company in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. 
As we discussed on the last call, we do not calculate RBC on a quarterly basis. However, we estimated that because of lower-than-expected capital levels as of year-end 2015 plus downgrades in our investment portfolio during this year, we would need around $60 million of additional capital to return to a 325% RBC level.
As we also discussed, we believe this shortfall may be somewhat temporary and thus, we may choose to maintain an RBC ratio slightly below 325% for 2016. With the combination of proceeds from our second quarter debt issuances, capital we generated from the sale of our Medicare Part D business and potential upgrades in our investment portfolio, we are comfortable with our ability to meet responsible RBC levels for 2016 and to meet our targeted 325% RBC ratio no later than the end of 2017 without having to utilize any of our free cash flow for capital contributions.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. In the quarter, growth in total life income lagged behind the growth in premium, primarily due to higher-than-expected policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. In previous quarters, we discussed the higher trend in policy obligations, primarily due to higher than originally expected claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2000 through 2007 and 2011 through 2015. While claims this year are emerging on the 2000 through 2007 policies largely as anticipated, we are seeing higher policy obligations than anticipated for certain segments of our business issued in 2011 through 2015. The higher obligations for these policy years are the primary cause for the increase in the policy obligation percentage from the 55% we had anticipated for the third quarter to 57%.
Last quarter, we indicated that policy obligations for the full year 2016 would be in the range of 54% to 55% of premium or 54.5% at the midpoint. With further analysis and additional claims experience through September 30, we now anticipate that the Direct Response of policy obligations for the full year 2016 will be around 56% of premiums at the midpoint of this range, a 1.5 percentage point increase. As a result of the expected higher policy obligations, we now estimate that the underwriting margin for the Direct Response operations will be in the range of 16% to 17% for the year. We also anticipate that the underwriting margin in 2017 will decline slightly and be in the range of 14% to 16% of premium for the full year. 
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

And then AIL margin, I mean, it's a big enough block of business that if there were some fluctuations in the claims that we have in 2017, if you move about 0.5 percentage point, then their margin ends up being probably $0.03 worth of earnings and then just generally on the buybacks. And obviously, our expectations of free cash flow for next year, looking at our projections, we really only have statutory earnings completed through June 30 at this point in time. So to the extent that, that moves, if that were to change significantly, something would happen between now and the end of the year, our stock price were to fluctuate enough, that would also have some impact.

It's really being driven by a couple of factors. One of it was the higher Direct Response claims as well as some of the lowering of the Part D margins that we've had over the course of time. So clearly, some of the higher Direct Response claims had an impact on our statutory earnings. Probably about 1/3 of that decline has just been from the really good sales that we've had in the past couple of years. And so as we grow sales, and if we're growing sales at 8%, 9%, 10%, that generates a significant amount of first year statutory strain. Now if you have that over several years, then the profits that are being generated from those sales start to catch up to it and help to then grow the statutory earnings going forward. And then, there's some other factors, just the higher -- our higher IT expenses, general and administrative expenses. We've had some ups and downs on the tax rate, perhaps, but -- so for the most part -- and what we kind of see here for going forward is while I think that for 2017, the Direct Response is continuing to have a little bit more of an impact, I think what you'll see as far as not having the growth from '15 to '16 or '16 to '17 -- excuse me, but I think in the near term and for 2017, statutory earnings, I would not expect them to be significantly different than what you're seeing really at today's levels."

In the third quarter, net income was $152 million or $1.25 per share, a 9% increase on a per share basis. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $140 million or $1.15 per share, $0.03 higher than anticipated in our previous guidance due primarily to lower-than-expected after-tax stock compensation expense. 
On a GAAP reported basis, our return on equity as of September 30 was 12.0%, and book value per share was $41.94. Excluding unrealized gains on fixed maturities, our return on equity was 14.7% and our book value per share was $31.86, an 8% increase from a year ago.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $546 million, while life underwriting margin was $143 million, down 1% from a year ago. The decline in underwriting margin was due primarily to the decline in the Direct Response margin. For the full year, we expect life underwriting margin to be around 1% higher than 2015.
Net life sales were $100 million, down 1% from the year-ago quarter. On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $237 million, and health underwriting margin was up 6% to $53 million. For the full year, we expect health underwriting margin to grow approximately 2%. Health sales were $33 million, same as in the year-ago quarter. However, individual health sales were $30 million, up 9%.
Administrative expenses were $49 million for the quarter, up 4% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.3%, same as a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses will be around 6.2% of premium.

At American Income, life premiums were up 10% to $231 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $74 million. Net life sales were $52 million, up 4%, due primarily to increased agent count. The average agent count for the third quarter was 7,004, up 6% from a year ago and up 6% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 7,025. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 6,750 to 6,950 at the end of 2016. We expect 7% to 8% life sales growth for the full year 2016 and 6% to 10% in 2017. 
In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $192 million. Life underwriting margin declined 26% to $29 million. Net life sales were down 9% to $35 million, due primarily to decreases in circulation. We expect life sales to be down 7% to 9% for the full year 2016 and flat to down 5% in 2017. The further sales decline in 2017 reflects changes in marketing designed to increase the profitability of new sales. 
At Liberty National, life premiums were $67 million, down 1% from the year-ago quarter, while life underwriting margin was $20 million, up 9%. Net life sales increased 11% to $10 million, while net health sales increased 3% to $5 million. The sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,799, up 13% from a year ago and up 3% compared to the second quarter. The producing agent count of Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,785. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 1,700 to 1,800 at the end of 2016.
Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 10% to 11% for the full year 2016 and 7% to 11% in 2017. Health net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 7% to 9% for the full year 2016 and 4% to 8% in 2017. We are very pleased with the progress of the turnaround of Liberty National.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $60 million, while health underwriting margin increased 19% to $13 million. Health net sales grew 8% to $14 million. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 986, up 9% from a year ago and 6% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,004. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 975 to 1,025 at the end of 2016. Health sales growth should be in a range of 2% to 4% for the full year 2016 and 3% to 7% for 2017.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 5% to $88 million. Net health sales were $10 million, down 14% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Medicare supplement sales grew 14% to $8 million, while group sales declined 57% to $2 million.
For the full year 2016, we expect growth in individual Medicare supplement sales to be around 7% and 9%. We expect sales growth in 2017 of 6% to 10%.

308916,405180483,1062511,"Torchmark Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I'm going to spend the next few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, the excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $57 millio",658,"I'm going to spend the next few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, the excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $57 million, a 5% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 9%. 
For the full year 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow by approximately 2%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of approximately 6%. 
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $14.6 billion, including $13.9 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $13.2 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $753 million compared to $568 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 5.4% compared to 4.3% a year ago. The increase of below investment-grade bonds is due primarily to downgrades of securities in the energy and metals and mining sectors in previous quarters. However, due to increases in underlying commodity prices, the current market base of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of the downgrades. 
With a portfolio leverage of 3.6x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 19%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.9 billion, approximately $1 billion higher than a year ago. 
To complete the discussion in investment portfolio, I'd like to give an update on our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. At September 30, we had a net unrealized gain of $90 million compared to an unrealized loss of $165 million at the end of 2015, an improvement of $255 million. The average rating of the energy fixed maturities is triple BBB, with 90% of the holdings being investment grade.
Now investment yield. In the third quarter, we invested $275 million of investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.40%, an average rating of BBB and an average life of 25 years. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.77%, down 4 basis points from the 5.81% yield in the third quarter of 2015. At September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.76%. 
At the midpoint of our guidance, we assumed a new money rate of 4.45% in the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of 4.65% in 2017. The low and declining interest rate environment continues to be an issue. However, our concern regarding an extended period of lower interest rates is the impact on the income statement, not the balance sheet. As long as we're in this interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline and place downward pressure on the growth of investment income. However, this decline will be lessened by the fact that, on average, only about 2% of our fixed maturity portfolio will run off each year over the next 5 years. Torchmark will continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. 
As I mentioned earlier, lower interest rates negatively impact the income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet as our cash flow test results indicate that our reserves are more than adequate to compensate for lower interest rates. As we have said before, Torchmark can thrive in either low or high interest rate environment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $77 million to buy 1.2 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $62.65. So far in October, we have used $16.4 m",756,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $77 million to buy 1.2 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $62.65. So far in October, we have used $16.4 million to purchase 255,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have spent $256 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 4.4 million shares at an average price of $57.96. These are being made from the parent's free cash flows. The parent company's free cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect free cash flow in 2016 to be around $320 million. With $256 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have around $64 million available for the remainder of the year from our free cash flow, plus other assets available at the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of parent assets at the end of 2016. 
For 2017, we preliminarily estimate that the free cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. 
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our company in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. 
As we discussed on the last call, we do not calculate RBC on a quarterly basis. However, we estimated that because of lower-than-expected capital levels as of year-end 2015 plus downgrades in our investment portfolio during this year, we would need around $60 million of additional capital to return to a 325% RBC level.
As we also discussed, we believe this shortfall may be somewhat temporary and thus, we may choose to maintain an RBC ratio slightly below 325% for 2016. With the combination of proceeds from our second quarter debt issuances, capital we generated from the sale of our Medicare Part D business and potential upgrades in our investment portfolio, we are comfortable with our ability to meet responsible RBC levels for 2016 and to meet our targeted 325% RBC ratio no later than the end of 2017 without having to utilize any of our free cash flow for capital contributions.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. In the quarter, growth in total life income lagged behind the growth in premium, primarily due to higher-than-expected policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. In previous quarters, we discussed the higher trend in policy obligations, primarily due to higher than originally expected claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2000 through 2007 and 2011 through 2015. While claims this year are emerging on the 2000 through 2007 policies largely as anticipated, we are seeing higher policy obligations than anticipated for certain segments of our business issued in 2011 through 2015. The higher obligations for these policy years are the primary cause for the increase in the policy obligation percentage from the 55% we had anticipated for the third quarter to 57%.
Last quarter, we indicated that policy obligations for the full year 2016 would be in the range of 54% to 55% of premium or 54.5% at the midpoint. With further analysis and additional claims experience through September 30, we now anticipate that the Direct Response of policy obligations for the full year 2016 will be around 56% of premiums at the midpoint of this range, a 1.5 percentage point increase. As a result of the expected higher policy obligations, we now estimate that the underwriting margin for the Direct Response operations will be in the range of 16% to 17% for the year. We also anticipate that the underwriting margin in 2017 will decline slightly and be in the range of 14% to 16% of premium for the full year. 
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

And then AIL margin, I mean, it's a big enough block of business that if there were some fluctuations in the claims that we have in 2017, if you move about 0.5 percentage point, then their margin ends up being probably $0.03 worth of earnings and then just generally on the buybacks. And obviously, our expectations of free cash flow for next year, looking at our projections, we really only have statutory earnings completed through June 30 at this point in time. So to the extent that, that moves, if that were to change significantly, something would happen between now and the end of the year, our stock price were to fluctuate enough, that would also have some impact. But if you look at the edges of the range, and I think as we've talked about it in prior years, the bottom end of that range really assumes that you have kind of at the lower end of the margins for each of the distributions and you have some lower interest rates.

It's really being driven by a couple of factors. One of it was the higher Direct Response claims as well as some of the lowering of the Part D margins that we've had over the course of time. So clearly, some of the higher Direct Response claims had an impact on our statutory earnings. Probably about 1/3 of that decline has just been from the really good sales that we've had in the past couple of years. And so as we grow sales, and if we're growing sales at 8%, 9%, 10%, that generates a significant amount of first year statutory strain. Now if you have that over several years, then the profits that are being generated from those sales start to catch up to it and help to then grow the statutory earnings going forward. And then, there's some other factors, just the higher -- our higher IT expenses, general and administrative expenses. We've had some ups and downs on the tax rate, perhaps, but -- so for the most part -- and what we kind of see here for going forward is while I think that for 2017, the Direct Response is continuing to have a little bit more of an impact, I think what you'll see as far as not having the growth from '15 to '16 or '16 to '17 -- excuse me, but I think in the near term and for 2017, statutory earnings, I would not expect them to be significantly different than what you're seeing really at today's levels."
