Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. With me today, as usual, are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Before we start, let me say that t",2624,"Thank you, Carrie, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. With me today, as usual, are several members of Cabot's executive management team. 
Before we start, let me say that the standard regarding forward-looking statements are included in this morning's press release applies to the comments on today's call. This morning's press release, along with our press release from 2 weeks ago outlining our updated 2016 budget, highlights that while our industry continues to struggle to adjust to persistently low commodity prices, Cabot remains well-positioned to navigate through this challenging market environment due to our high-quality asset base, low cost structure, strong balance sheet and our capital discipline. While most financial metrics were down year-over-year amid a backdrop of lower commodity prices, I am pleased with our overall report card for the year, which included 13% production growth despite continued price-related curtailment and a significant reduction in capital spending. Additionally, we grew reserves 11% despite reduced operating activity and lower SEC prices used in calculating year-end reserves. I believe these results highlight the quality of our assets and their ability to generate positive results in most commodity price cycles. Our ability to grow production and reserves in a capital efficient manner is a certainly impressive. I'm equally as pleased with the continued reduction in our cost structure throughout the organization. 
2015 marked another year of lower operating cost and finding cost for Cabot, driven by a combination of internally driven efficiencies and lower service costs. This reduction in cost has allowed for improving project level economics despite lower commodity prices and positions the company well for the eventual recovery in both natural gas and oil price realizations. Capital discipline has been a hallmark of Cabot's strategy over the years and 2015 was no exception. 
We ended 2015 with a capital program that came in 14% lower than budget, while still delivering on our production guidance for the year. This reduction in capital spending was especially apparent in the fourth quarter as we generated positive free cash flow despite realizing our lowest price for the year. Our previously announced 2016 budget also highlights the company's financial discipline, with another 58% year-over-year reduction in capital spending. We remain committed to our prudent capital allocation strategy and will strive to continue to improve capital efficiencies throughout our operation, which we believe will result in continued value creation for our shareholders. 
As I highlighted to our shareholders over the last 18 months, our game plan has remained relatively unchanged during this down cycle, giving our strategy has always been to first maintain balance sheet strength. We also align our capital spending with anticipated operating cash flows and allocate capital to our highest return project. We also run a lean efficient operation in order to keep operating cost, including low overhead, and we focus on delivering long-term value creation from our high-quality asset base. This strategy has allowed us to prosper in most favorable price environments, and we think we will continue to be able to navigate successfully through this current downturn. 
Now let's move to the Marcellus, and 2015 was another successful year for our Marcellus program, which generated positive free cash flow for the year despite lower natural gas price realizations. We continue to allocate the majority of our capital to our high return assets in Marcellus, which still generate good returns despite the lower realizations. We averaged approximately 1.5 Bcf per day of net production despite curtailing over 75 Bcf of net production during the year. This surplus curtail volume at year-end gives us significant flexibility this year and allowed us to reduce capital spending substantially year-over-year, with minimal impact to our production. 
On the operations front, we went to from 3 drilling rigs in the fourth quarter down to 1 rig in mid-January. We are currently running 1 frac crew on daylight operations only and plan to continue at this pace throughout 2016. With the decrease in drilling activity, we plan to work down our backlog of drill uncompleted wells throughout the year, from 63 at year-end '15 to 48 at year-end '16. This inventory, along with expected curtail year-end volumes, provides us with flexibility to ramp our volumes in '17, assuming both a timely and service for Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise, and an improvement in realizations in Appalachia. 
Our team in the Marcellus continues to improve their operating efficiencies, which is evidenced from the reduction in well costs by over 30% relative to the prior year. We expect to average a 7,000 a foot lateral for the 2016 Marcellus program at a well cost of approximately $6.7 million or approximately $960 per lateral foot. This well cost does include all the capital associated with roads, pad buildout, production facilities and things of that nature. 
On the operating cost front, we continue to see a reduction in our per-unit cost, with direct OpEx decreasing to $0.04 per Mcf and total cash cost per unit decreasing to $0.82 per Mcf, with gathering and transportation being the biggest component. 
In this morning's press release, we announced an increase in our Marcellus EUR guidance, as well as a 15% increase in our Marcellus inventory to 3,450 locations and an increase in our Lower Marcellus guidance for EUR per thousand foot from 3.6 Bcf to 3.8 Bcf, further reinforcing our estimated recoveries as best-in-class across the entire Marcellus. 
Pricing remains the biggest challenge for us in the northeast PA. However, we are optimistic about future given the significant reduction of activity in our operating area, which should ultimately result in a reduction of supply. For example, in the 6 county area in Northeast PA, that accounts for over 8 Bcf per day of natural gas production, there are currently only 4 rigs operating and 4 daylight only frac crews working. While no one can refute the wells in this part of the state, are very productive and there's a backlog of wells still waiting for completion that can add volumes to the mix with a relatively limited capital investment, these production levels were simply not sustainable based on the reduced level of activity we see today. This could set us up for a favorable rebalancing of supply and demand later this year or in early '17, which could certainly greatly benefit Cabot. 
While it is far too early to [indiscernible] any significant details on our plans for '17, I would highlight that our unique set of assets in the Marcellus provides us with optionality as we assess our plans for the future. If market conditions improve and our take away capacity is placed in service according to our current expectations, then we can deliver on a program that generates double-digit production growth in 2017. More importantly, this program can provide even greater cash flow growth due to increasing margins as we assess more favorable markets all while deleveraging the balance sheet at today's strip. However, if there are any unexpected delays in infrastructure buildout or, more generally, market conditions remain depressed, we have an asset that requires minimal capital investment to maintain flat production. In that scenario, while top line production volumes would be flat, we would still realize significant cash flow growth in '17 due to improving price realizations, while generating free cash flow and deleveraging the balance sheet. While there is still a lot of uncertainty on how market conditions will evolve over the next 12 to 24 months, we are fortunate to have a set of assets that allow for this type of flexibility as we weather the storm. 
Moving down south into Texas in the Eagle Ford. Our team experienced another exceptional year operationally, which was unfortunately overshadowed by lower crude prices. Our drilling team continued to outperform expectations, reducing our spud TD drilling days for a 7,704 foot lateral to 8 days. This has resulted in a 45% reduction in drilling cost relative to 2014, almost all of which was driven by internal efficiencies as opposed to service cost reductions given that our rig was under a long-term older contract priced environment during the year. The team drilled its longest lateral to date, 11,588 feet in 11.6 days from spud to TD, with a total measured depth of 19,930 feet. Kudos to the drilling team. 
Additionally, the rig we utilized during 2015 ranked second in total footage drilled among the roughly 200 rigs that our third-party provider contracted throughout all basins in 2015, another good indication of our efficiencies. We do anticipate an eventual recovery in oil prices that we believe our 86,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford can provide for long-term value creation in a slightly more favorable price environment. As a result, our focus in 2016 is to reduce our operating activity to the minimum levels needed to ensure we maintain all our core acreage. 
We recently released our Eagle Ford drilling rig based on our anticipated level of activity. We will be able to maintain all of our leasehold obligations through '16. We exited '15 with 23 net wells drilled, but uncompleted, and we'll work down some of that inventories throughout the year due to conditions -- continuous operation commitments, which should help [indiscernible] some of our natural declines we see in the field. We plan to exit 2016 with 13 net drilled uncompleted wells in our backlog. 
I'll move to the [indiscernible] reserve results. In this morning's release, we announced our sixth consecutive year of double-digit reserve growth, which is true and impressive, given the increasing trend of declining reserves across industry due to price related revisions. Our year-end reserves increased 11% to 8.2 TCFE despite a 40% and 47% reduction in natural gas and oil price realization [indiscernible] in our reserve report, respectively. Cabot's all sourced mining and development costs for the year were $0.57 per Mcfe, while our Marcellus all source fining and development costs were $0.31 per Mcf, both significantly lower than prior years driven by strong performance revisions in the Marcellus as our well performance has continued to exceed expectations. Our [indiscernible] developed percentage decreased slightly from 61% in '14 to 59% in '15, primarily as our percentage of crude undeveloped reserves associated with drilled, but uncompleted wells, increased from 7% to 11%. 2015 is another positive year report for Cabot, especially in light of the environment we are operating in today. 
Get to a Constitution. I'm sure it's on many of your minds. Recently, we had a [indiscernible] activity surrounding Constitution Pipeline. While we do not have specific details we can share today regarding our final permit issuance, I can assure you that discussions to have the permit issued as soon as possible are ongoing. At the backdrop of 16 activity on January 8, Constitution asked FERC for a partial notice to proceed with non-[indiscernible] clearing. On January 29, FERC issued the notice to proceed for [indiscernible] but limited our activity at this time to Pennsylvania. Tree felling began February 5 in Pennsylvania. As of today, approximately 60% of the trees in Pennsylvania [indiscernible] Constitution right away are down. This represents approximately 18% of the trees for the entire right away. Additionally, the FERC is still considering our request for felling trees in New York. Also, on January 28, the FERC issued an order on the pending rehearing request regarding the December 2014 order that issued our FERC certificate. The order early considered and firmly rejected all arguments and ultimately declined all request for rehearing, another positive step for Constitution. 
Moving on to the Atlantic Sunrise project. As a reminder, this new pipeline will transport 850,000 [indiscernible] on Cabot's behalf to markets in the Atlantic -- in the mid-Atlantic area. To date, the project remains on schedule, with initial pipe shipments already on location and the draft environmental impact statement expected shortly from the FERC. 
Before I move on, I would like to make one quick point on perceived real impact of pipelines. Bottom line, pipelines get very right away gets reclaimed with a much [indiscernible] footprint than the renewables. In the case of Constitution, there are approximately 1,100 acres of ride away. For example, for solar to produce an equivalent level of power generation, it require, instead of an 1,100-acre right away, [indiscernible] pipeline, solar equivalent would take 25,600-acre footprint of solar panels and the wind, on an equivalent level of production as Constitution might produce, it would require approximately 2,000 turbans spread across 260 miles, which is double the length of the Constitution [indiscernible] pipeline right away. Certainly, staggering differences, yet the narrative is not discussed much. Again, just fun facts. 
In addition to Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise pipelines, Cabot is also involved in three other significant projects in the northeastern beginning in late '17. The Benny's pipeline, Tennessee's [indiscernible] Pipeline and the [indiscernible] Freedom Power Plant. Collectively, these projects add approximately 445,000 dekatherms per day of new long-term sales and transport capacity for Cabot. [indiscernible] in the Maxie freedom project is especially unique as we will be the sole supplier of up to 165 -- 165,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas to this new facility located just a few miles away from our existing infrastructure. This project highlight our ongoing marketing strategy, along with other projects in the queue. 
Another marketing related item I'd like to highlight is our mix of firm sales and therm transportation capacity moving forward relative to our plant production profile. There's been a lot of discussion recently around the industry about capacity being overbuilt and the significant commitments and liabilities that producers have subscribed to over the past few years. While we have been questioned during the past few years for not having enough firm transportation out of our supply area as the Northeast market became oversupplied, longer-term, I believe -- excuse me, I believe our strategy of not over committing to [indiscernible] and instead focusing on high-quality capacity, with strong demand on the other side of the pipeline, is the appropriate strategy. As a result, we feel our overall marketing strategy and the modest amount of commitments we have going forward will continue to provide significant growth from our future production plans and continue our long term strong financial position. 
I'll move to our guidance, brief comment there. As a reminder, earlier this month, we released our updated guidance for '16. Our updated budget of $325 million was designed to allow us to spend within operating cash flows at strip prices, while still providing measured growth in 2016 in the 2% to 7% arrange. We also anticipate between $80 million and $150 million of contributions for our investments in Constitution at Atlantic Sunrise, which will be dependent upon the ongoing regulatory process and the corresponding impact of the timing of actual construction activities. Drilling completion and facility capital account for approximately 92% of the capital budget, with approximately 70% allocated to the Marcellus and 30% allocated to the Eagle Ford shale. In total, we plan to drill approximately 30 net wells in '16 and complete approximately 55 net wells. This level of activity allows us to meet all of our obligatory drilling and operating commitments and maintain operating efficiencies throughout the program, while our anticipated year-end backlog of 61 drilled, uncompleted wells, companywide, provides us flexibility into 2017. As for pricing, we are currently forecasting a companywide natural gas differential of $0.70 per Mcf for the full year before the impact of derivatives, which represents a $0.15 improvement relative to our 2015 differential. 
Obviously, this overall program is dependent upon the referenced infrastructure project and their timing. If delayed, these numbers could move lower. 
In summary, that's our program. And Carrie, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions."

That's good question, Michael. Certainly, in a macro environment at the time of commissioning of new infrastructure is going to play in our decision on how much will be acceleration incremental volumes, if you will, versus how much is going to displace off of 3 pipes that we're are currently producing, and I'll let Jeff answer some of this in a brief second. But in the beginning, Michael, I think it would be prudent for us to fill the new infrastructure first because the price points we're going to be receiving on the newbuilds is going to be a price point out of the challenged realizations that we've had either on Millennium, Tennessee or the Leidy Line. So we would fill that immediately and there will be a transition period of the backfill of the displaced volumes that we put into the new pipes. And we will continue to, again, backfill. But we do expect that we would probably see, with the volumes that we're going to be lifting out of the current area and off our current three pipes, we do expect to see a compression of the differential. And when you look at the timing of commissioning of those -- the new pipes out of that area, we think it could be contemporaneous with an inflection point of the supply side due to the limited amount of activity up in that particular area as we speak. So there's going to be a combination of things that will help dictate and set the table for us on how we would grow into that new capacity. I will also say this though. We are delivering returns today and we're -- been in a punitive price environment and realizations more so than most for an extended period of time. The program still today delivers free cash flow with good returns. The incremental volumes that we move into new areas with we think improved realizations is going to even, in spite of keeping the current strip, we think is going to significantly improve our life from where we are today."

And looking at what levers we may or may not need to pull on that as we go forward.

And that's no different today, although that market, that asset sale market, is very challenged and you'll hear a lot of people that are going to be there. But we're very comfortable with the base plant. We're comfortable with the kind of the low 50% debt to total capital. Our year end number, 2.5x, obviously, just the math will move up. We'd like it to stay at 2.5x, but clearly, with the underlying commodity prices or cash flow is it is going to move up some during the course of '16, which we're comfortable with because this map laid out in Dan's comments, we see a delevering event in '17 just by the nature of these infrastructure and what our new volumes will get to.

And there's a number of considerations. As you might appreciate, we looked at all angles and all options and all scenarios on getting to the commissioning and construction stage of Constitution. We do think that there's been adequate amount of time and deliberation in New York. 29 months is the process to date. So we've had great discussions in the past with New York on trying to address all concerns and mitigate each stakeholder's concerns about laying the pipeline. How it would be done. We've reroute it. We discussed about stream crossing, how to board, how to open cut, all those things. In this environment, and the environment we live right now, there's certainly a contingent out there that don't want hydro carbons in the mix. And that contingent is vocal and they speak out. There's -- I believe that we have the Constitution Pipeline. From what we've been able to tell, the governors of New York's plan and looking at the energy future for New York, natural gas is an energy source that's required for him to be able to fulfill his plan. So we think we're going to get to the endgame and we certainly would like and put New York into the process and all the work that we've done in the past to be used to design -- actually for us to follow to the endgame on construction for this pipeline. The FERC has a job to do also. They have a fiduciary role to the public to have projects move forward. They have a lot of projects in front of them. Certainly, their jobs have become more challenged in the world we live today. But nevertheless, I think they have a job to fulfill to be able to take all parties, consider -- issues under consideration, look at the validity of all those considerations and make prudent decision that's best for the public's need. And we think they will do that. But I do not think, Jeff, again, back to core of your question.

We think that we have as equally as good opportunity to be able to market our gas, not only to actually to the east, northeast and southeast, up into our area, but we do think that we'll be able to market our gas into the south. More supply -- just on a general note, more supplier, whether it's oil or gas into a limited demand circumstance is going to be -- is going to have that dynamic of lower prices.

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. With me today, as usual, are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Before we start, let me say that the",2615,"Thank you, Carrie, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. With me today, as usual, are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Before we start, let me say that the standard boilerplate regarding -- forward-looking statements are included in this morning's press release, applies to the comments on today's call.
This morning's press release, along with our press release from 2 weeks ago outlining our updated 2016 budget, highlights that while our industry continues to struggle to adjust to persistently low commodity prices, Cabot remains well positioned to navigate through this challenging market environment due to our high-quality asset base, low cost structure, strong balance sheet and our capital discipline.
While most financial metrics were down year-over-year amid a backdrop of lower commodity prices, I am pleased with our overall report card for the year, which included 13% production growth despite continued price-related curtailments and a significant reduction in capital spending. Additionally, we grew reserves 11% despite reduced operating activity and lower SEC prices used in calculating year-end reserves.
I believe these results highlight the quality of our assets and their ability to generate positive results in most commodity price cycles. Our ability to grow production and reserves in a capital-efficient manner is a certainly impressive. And I'm equally as pleased with the continued reduction in our cost structure throughout the organization.
2015 marked another year of lower operating cost and finding cost for Cabot, driven by a combination of internally driven efficiencies and lower service cost. This reduction in cost has allowed for improving project-level economics despite lower commodity prices and positions the company well for the eventual recovery in both natural gas and oil price realizations.
Capital discipline has been a hallmark of Cabot's strategy over the years and 2015 was no exception. We ended 2015 with a capital program that came in 14% lower than budget, while still delivering on our production guidance for the year. This reduction in capital spending was especially apparent in the fourth quarter as we generated positive free cash flow despite realizing our lowest price for the year.
Our previously announced 2016 budget also highlights the company's financial discipline with another 58% year-over-year reduction in capital spending. We remain committed to our prudent capital allocation strategy and will strive to continue to improve capital efficiencies throughout our operation, which we believe will result in continued value creation for our shareholders.
As I highlighted to our shareholders over the last 18 months, our game plan has remained relatively unchanged during this down cycle, given our strategy has always been to first maintain balance sheet strength. We also align our capital spending with anticipated operating cash flows and allocate capital to our highest return projects. We also run a lean efficient operation in order to keep operating cost, including low overhead, and we focus on delivering long-term value creation from our high-quality asset base. This strategy has allowed us to prosper in most favorable price environments, and we think we will continue to be able to navigate successfully through this current downturn.
Now let's move to the Marcellus, and 2015 was another successful year for our Marcellus program, which generated positive free cash flow for the year despite lower natural gas price realizations. We continue to allocate the majority of our capital to our high-return assets in Marcellus, which still generate good returns despite the lower realizations. We averaged approximately 1.5 Bcf per day of net production despite curtailing over 75 Bcf of net production during the year. This surplus curtailed volume at year-end gives us significant flexibility this year and allowed us to reduce capital spending substantially year-over-year with minimal impact to our production.
On the operations front, we went to from 3 drilling rigs in the fourth quarter down to 1 rig in mid-January. We are currently running 1 frac crew on daylight operations only and plan to continue at this pace throughout 2016. With the decrease in drilling activity, we plan to work down our backlog of drilled uncompleted wells throughout the year from 63 at year-end '15 to 48 at year-end '16. This inventory, along with expected curtailed year-end volumes, provides us with flexibility to ramp our volumes in '17, assuming both a timely in-service for Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise and an improvement in realizations in Appalachia.
Our team in the Marcellus continues to improve their operating efficiencies, which is evident from the reduction in well costs by over 30% relative to the prior year. We expect to average a 7,000-foot lateral for the 2016 Marcellus program at a well cost of approximately $6.7 million or approximately $960 per lateral foot. This well cost does include all the capital associated with roads, pad buildout, production facilities and things of that nature.
On the operating cost front, we continue to see a reduction in our per-unit cost, with direct OpEx decreasing to $0.04 per Mcf, and total cash cost per unit decreasing to $0.82 per Mcf, with gathering and transportation being the biggest component.
In this morning's press release, we announced an increase in our Marcellus EUR guidance as well as a 15% increase in our Marcellus inventory to 3,450 locations and an increase in our Lower Marcellus guidance for EUR per thousand foot from 3.6 Bcf to 3.8 Bcf, further reinforcing our estimated recoveries as best in class across the entire Marcellus.
Pricing remains the biggest challenge for us in the Northeast PA. However, we are optimistic about the future given the significant reduction of activity in our operating area, which should ultimately result in a reduction of supply. For example, in the 6-county area in Northeast PA that accounts for over 8 Bcf per day of natural gas production, there are currently only 4 rigs operating and 4 daylight-only frac crews working. While no one can refute the wells in this part of the state are very productive and there's a backlog of wells still waiting for completion that can add volumes to the mix with a relatively limited capital investment, these production levels were simply not sustainable based on the reduced level of activity we see today. This could set us up for a favorable rebalancing of supply and demand later this year or in early '17, which could certainly greatly benefit Cabot.
While it is far too early to provide any significant details on our plans for '17, I would highlight that our unique set of assets in the Marcellus provides us with optionality as we assess our plans for the future. If market conditions improve and our takeaway capacity is placed in service according to our current expectations, then we can deliver on a program that generates double-digit production growth in 2017. More importantly, this program can provide even greater cash flow growth due to increasing margins as we assess more favorable markets all while deleveraging the balance sheet at today's strip.
However, if there are any unexpected delays in the infrastructure buildout or more generally, market conditions remain depressed, we have an asset that requires minimal capital investment to maintain flat production. In that scenario, while top line production volumes would be flat, we would still realize significant cash flow growth in '17 due to improving price realizations while generating free cash flow and deleveraging the balance sheet. While there is still a lot of uncertainty on how market conditions will evolve over the next 12 to 24 months, we are fortunate to have a set of assets that allow for this type of flexibility as we weather the storm.
Moving down south into Texas in the Eagle Ford. Our team experienced another exceptional year operationally, which was unfortunately overshadowed by lower crude prices. Our drilling team continued to outperform expectations, reducing our spud-to-TD drilling days for a 7,704-foot lateral to 8 days. This has resulted in a 45% reduction in drilling cost relative to 2014, almost all of which was driven by internal efficiencies as opposed to service cost reductions given that our rig was under a long-term older contract priced environment during the year. The team drilled its longest lateral to date of 11,588 feet in 11.6 days from spud to TD, with a total measured depth of 19,930 feet. Kudos to the drilling team.
Additionally, the rig we utilized during 2015 ranked second in total footage drilled among the roughly 200 rigs that our third-party provider contracted throughout all basins in 2015, another good indication of our efficiencies. We do anticipate an eventual recovery in oil prices that we believe our 86,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford can provide for long-term value creation in a slightly more favorable price environment. As a result, our focus in 2016 is to reduce our operating activity to the minimum levels needed to ensure we maintain all our core acreage.
We recently released our Eagle Ford drilling rig based on our anticipated level of activity. We will be able to maintain all of our leasehold obligations through '16. We exited '15 with 23 net wells drilled but uncompleted, and we'll work down some of that inventory throughout the year due to conditions -- continuous operation commitments, which should help arrest some of our natural declines we see in the field. We plan to exit 2016 with 13 net drilled uncompleted wells in our backlog.
I'll move to the proved reserve results. In this morning's release, we announced our sixth consecutive year of double-digit reserve growth, which is truly -- and impressive, given the increasing trend of declining reserves across industry due to price-related revisions. Our year-end reserves increased 11% to 8.2 Tcfe despite a 40% and 47% reduction in natural gas and oil price realizations used in our reserve report, respectively.
Cabot's all-source finding and development costs for the year were $0.57 per Mcfe, while our Marcellus all-source finding and development costs were $0.31 per Mcf, both significantly lower than prior years, driven by strong performance revisions in the Marcellus as our well performance has continued to exceed expectations. Our proved developed percentage decreased slightly from 61% in '14 to 59% in '15, primarily as our percentage of crude undeveloped reserves associated with drilled but uncompleted wells increased from 7% to 11%. 2015 is another positive year report for Cabot, especially in light of the environment we are operating in today.
Get to Constitution. I'm sure it's on many of your minds. Recently, we had a flurry of activity surrounding Constitution Pipeline. While we do not have specific details, we can share today regarding our final permit issuance. I can assure you that discussions to have the permit issued as soon as possible are ongoing. As a backdrop of '16 activity on January 8, Constitution asked FERC for a partial notice to proceed with non-mechanized tree clearing. On January 29, FERC issued the notice to proceed for tree felling but limited our activity at this time to Pennsylvania.
Tree felling began February 5 in Pennsylvania. As of today, approximately 60% of the trees in Pennsylvania on the Constitution right-of-way are down. This represents approximately 18% of the trees for the entire right-of-way. Additionally, the FERC is still considering our request for felling trees in New York. Also, on January 28, the FERC issued an order on the pending rehearing request regarding the December 2014 order that issued our FERC certificate. The order early considered and firmly rejected all arguments and ultimately declined all request for rehearing, another positive step for Constitution.
Moving on to the Atlantic Sunrise project. As a reminder, this new pipeline will transport 850,000 dekatherms on Cabot's behalf to markets in the Atlantic -- in the mid-Atlantic area. To date, the project remains on schedule, with initial pipe shipments already on location and the draft environmental impact statement expected shortly from the FERC.
Before I move on, I would like to make one quick point on perceived versus real impact of pipelines. Bottom line, pipelines get buried, the right-of-way gets reclaimed with a much smaller footprint than renewables. In the case of Constitution, there are approximately 1,100 acres of right-of-way. For example, for solar to produce an equivalent level of power generation, it require, instead of an 1,100-acre-foot right-of-way, the buried pipeline, solar equivalent would take 25,600-acre footprint of solar panels. And for wind, on an equivalent level of production as Constitution might produce, it would require approximately 2,000 turbines spread across 260 miles, which is double the length of the Constitution buried pipeline right-of-way. Certainly staggering differences, yet the narrative is not discussed much. Again, just fun facts.
In addition to Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise pipelines, Cabot is also involved in 3 other significant projects in the Northeast beginning in late '17: The PennEast Pipeline, Tennessee's Orion Pipeline and the Moxie Freedom Power Plant. Collectively, these projects add approximately 445,000 dekatherms per day of new long-term sales and transport capacity for Cabot. Our involvement in the Moxie Freedom project is especially unique as we will be the sole supplier of up to 165 dekatherms -- 165,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas to this new facility located just a few miles away from our existing infrastructure. These projects highlight our ongoing marketing strategy, along with other projects in the queue.
Another marketing-related item I'd like to highlight is our mix of firm sales and firm transportation capacity moving forward relative to our plant production profile. There's been a lot of discussion recently around the industry about capacity being overbuilt and the significant commitments and liabilities that producers have subscribed to over the past few years.
While we have been questioned during the past few years for not having enough firm transportation out of our supply area as the Northeast market became oversupplied, longer term, I believe our strategy of not overcommitting to FT and instead focusing on high-quality capacity with strong demand on the other side of the pipeline is the appropriate strategy. As a result, we feel our overall marketing strategy and the modest amount of commitments we have going forward will continue to provide significant growth from our future production plans and continue our long-term strong financial position.
I'll move to our guidance, brief comment there. As a reminder, earlier this month, we released our updated guidance for '16. Our updated budget of $325 million was designed to allow us to spend within operating cash flows at strip prices while still providing measured growth in 2016 in the 2% to 7% range. We also anticipate between $80 million and $150 million of contributions for our investments in Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise, which will be dependent upon the ongoing regulatory process and the corresponding impact of the timing of actual construction activities. Drilling completion and facility capital account for approximately 92% of the capital budget, with approximately 70% allocated to the Marcellus and 30% allocated to the Eagle Ford shale.
In total, we plan to drill approximately 30 net wells in '16 and complete approximately 55 net wells. This level of activity allows us to meet all our other obligatory drilling and operating commitments and maintain operating efficiencies throughout the program, while our anticipated year-end backlog of 61 drilled uncompleted wells companywide provides us flexibility into 2017. As for pricing, we are 
currently forecasting a companywide natural gas differential of $0.70 per Mcf for the full year before the impact of derivatives, which represents a $0.15 improvement relative to our 2015 differential. Obviously, this overall program is dependent on the reference to infrastructure projects and their timing. If delayed, these numbers could move lower.
In summary, that's our program. And Carrie, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions."

But if we could go back to -- you've already touched on a lot of these themes, but if I could try a question that would maybe tie it together. Looking ahead to the time when you have the more takeaway and more local demand, how should we think about the cost in the number of wells that you'll need to turn the line to fill up those new pipes? And with this -- what I'm really after is, how should we think about your capital efficiency? Because it's hard to judge based on your results because you guys have been infrastructure constrained for so long. So when you look to today, you have to deliver another $500 million a day.

That's a good question, Michael. Certainly, the macro environment at the time of commissioning of new infrastructure is going to play in our decision on how much will be acceleration incremental volumes, if you will, versus how much is going to displace off the 3 pipes that we're currently producing on, and I'll let Jeff answer some of this in a brief second. But in the beginning, Michael, I think it would be prudent for us to fill the new infrastructure first because the price points we're going to be receiving on the  newbuilds is going to be a price point out of the challenged realizations that we've had either on Millennium, Tennessee or the Leidy Line. So we would fill that immediately, and there will be a transition period of the backfill of the displaced volumes that we put into the new pipes. And we will continue to, again, backfill. But we do expect that we would probably see, with the volumes that we'd be lifting out of the current area and off our current 3 pipes, we do expect to see a compression of the differential. And when you look at the timing of commissioning of those -- the new pipes out of that area, we think it could be contemporaneous with an inflection point of the supply side due to the limited amount of activity up in that particular area as we speak. So there's going to be a combination of things that will help dictate and set the table for us on how we would grow into that new capacity. I will also say this though. We are delivering returns today and we're in a -- been in a punitive price environment and realizations more so than most for an extended period of time. The program still today delivers free cash flow with good returns. The incremental volumes that we move into new areas with, we think, improved realizations is going to, even in spite of keeping the current strip, we think, is going to significantly improve our life from where we are today."

And that's no different today, although that market, that asset sale market is very challenged and you hear a lot of people that are going to be there. But we're very comfortable with the base plan. We're comfortable with the kind of the low 50% debt to total capital. Our year-end number, 2.5x, obviously, just the math, will move up. We'd like it to stay at 2.5x. But clearly, with the underlying commodity prices and where cash flow is, it is going to move up some during the course of '16, which we're comfortable with because this map laid out, in Dan's comments, we see a delevering event in '17 just by the nature of these infrastructure and what our new volumes will get to.

And as you might appreciate, we looked at all angles and all options and all scenarios on getting to the commissioning and construction stage of Constitution. We do think that there's been adequate amount of time and deliberation in New York. 29 months is the process to date. So we've had great discussions in the past with New York on trying to address all concerns and mitigate the -- each stakeholder's concerns about laying the pipeline, how it would be done, we've rerouted, we discussed about stream crossings, how to bore, how to open-cut, all those things. In this environment and the environment we live right now, there's certainly a contingent out there that don't want hydrocarbons in the mix. And that contingent is vocal and they speak out. There's -- I believe that we have that -- the Constitution Pipeline, from what we've been able to tell, the governor's -- of New York's plan and looking at the energy future for New York, natural gas is an energy source that's required for him to be able to fulfill his plan. So we think we're going to get to the endgame, and we certainly would like the input of New York into the process and all the work that we've done in the past to be used to design -- to actually for us to follow to the endgame on construction for this pipeline. The FERC has a job to do also. They have a fiduciary role to the public to have projects move forward. They have a lot of projects in front of them. Certainly, their jobs have become more challenged in the world we live today. But nevertheless, I think they have a job to fulfill to be able to take all parties, consider -- issues under consideration, look at the validity of all those considerations and make prudent decisions to -- that's best for the public's need, and we think they will do that. But I do not think, Jeff, again, back to your -- core of your question, I don't think it's ever been challenged yet through the court systems that the FERC is going to have to override a state's either lack of response or a negative response."

All of those -- all that volume, 850 million, is committed right now to WGL and to the Cove Point LNG facility. We think that the volume of gas that is out there right now obviously strains the supply/demand curve. We think additional demand is coming. We think there will be -- in the south, to your point, in the south and along the Gulf Coast, we think there's significant amount of LNG displacement that will occur with some of the supply volumes that are in the south. And we think that we have as equally as good opportunity to be able to market our gas, not only directionally actually to the east, northeast and southeast, up into our area, but we do think that we'll be able to market our gas into the south. More supply -- just on a general note, more supply, whether it's oil or gas, into a limited demand circumstance, is going to be -- is going to have that dynamic of lower prices. We think that, maybe through this period of time, looking at what's going on in our industry and looking at the capital programs that have been reduced, looking at the ratings that have been imposed, public rating on some of the companies, looking at the oversupplied market, maybe there would be some rationalization in the market as we move forward also.

If you examine it closely and look at the meters along with 6-county area that we produce in, we're actually the null [ph] point for the 3 pipes that we produce in. So for example, most of our gas that goes into the Millennium goes to the east where a majority of the gas out of the Bradford, Tioga County, for example, goes west. Same thing happens in -- on Tennessee and same thing happens on Transco. So we are -- we like where we are geographically and getting into the pipes. I think with Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise, it enhances that. But I don't see a large overbuilt situation in Northeast PA like we do in Southwest PA and the Utica. We feel like that the overbuilt infrastructure will absorb some of the Utica gas, but it will definitely head west and northwest and south."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. With me today, as usual, are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Before we start, let me say that the",2617,"Thank you, Carrie, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. With me today, as usual, are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Before we start, let me say that the standard boilerplate regarding -- forward-looking statements are -- included in this morning's press release, applies to the comments on today's call.
This morning's press release, along with our press release from 2 weeks ago outlining our updated 2016 budget, highlights that while our industry continues to struggle to adjust to persistently low commodity prices, Cabot remains well positioned to navigate through this challenging market environment due to our high-quality asset base, low cost structure, strong balance sheet and our capital discipline.
While most financial metrics were down year-over-year amid a backdrop of lower commodity prices, I am pleased with our overall report card for the year, which included 13% production growth despite continued price-related curtailments and a significant reduction in capital spending. Additionally, we grew reserves 11% despite reduced operating activity and lower SEC prices used in calculating year-end reserves.
I believe these results highlight the quality of our assets and their ability to generate positive results in most commodity price cycles. Our ability to grow production and reserves in a capital-efficient manner is a certainly impressive. And I'm equally as pleased with the continued reduction in our cost structure throughout the organization.
2015 marked another year of lower operating cost and finding costs for Cabot, driven by a combination of internally driven efficiencies and lower service cost. This reduction in cost has allowed for improving project-level economics despite lower commodity prices and positions the company well for the eventual recovery in both natural gas and oil price realizations.
Capital discipline has been a hallmark of Cabot's strategy over the years and 2015 was no exception. We ended 2015 with a capital program that came in 14% lower than budget, while still delivering on our production guidance for the year. This reduction in capital spending was especially apparent in the fourth quarter as we generated positive free cash flow despite realizing our lowest price for the year.
Our previously announced 2016 budget also highlights the company's financial discipline with another 58% year-over-year reduction in capital spending. We remain committed to our prudent capital allocation strategy and will strive to continue to improve capital efficiencies throughout our operation, which we believe will result in continued value creation for our shareholders.
As I highlighted to our shareholders over the last 18 months, our game plan has remained relatively unchanged during this down cycle, given our strategy has always been to first maintain balance sheet strength. We also align our capital spending with anticipated operating cash flows and allocate capital to our highest return projects. We also run a lean efficient operation in order to keep operating cost, including low overhead, and we focus on delivering long-term value creation from our high-quality asset base. This strategy has allowed us to prosper in most favorable price environments, and we think we will continue to be able to navigate successfully through this current downturn.
Now let's move to the Marcellus, and 2015 was another successful year for our Marcellus program, which generated positive free cash flow for the year despite lower natural gas price realizations. We continue to allocate the majority of our capital to our high-return assets in Marcellus, which still generate good returns despite the lower realizations. We averaged approximately 1.5 Bcf per day of net production despite curtailing over 75 Bcf of net production during the year. This surplus curtailed volume at year-end gives us significant flexibility this year and allowed us to reduce capital spending substantially year-over-year with minimal impact to our production.
On the operations front, we went from 3 drilling rigs in the fourth quarter down to 1 rig in mid-January. We are currently running 1 frac crew on daylight operations only and plan to continue at this pace throughout 2016. With the decrease in drilling activity, we plan to work down our backlog of drilled uncompleted wells throughout the year from 63 at year-end '15 to 48 at year-end '16. This inventory, along with expected curtailed year-end volumes, provides us with flexibility to ramp our volumes in '17, assuming both a timely in-service for Constitution and the Atlantic Sunrise and an improvement in realizations in Appalachia.
Our team in the Marcellus continues to improve their operating efficiencies, which is evident from the reduction in well costs by over 30% relative to the prior year. We expect to average a 7,000-foot lateral for the 2016 Marcellus program at a well cost of approximately $6.7 million or approximately $960 per lateral foot. This well cost does include all the capital associated with roads, pad buildout, production facilities and things of that nature.
On the operating cost front, we continue to see a reduction in our per-unit cost, with direct OpEx decreasing to $0.04 per Mcf, and total cash cost per unit decreasing to $0.82 per Mcf, with gathering and transportation being the biggest component.
In this morning's press release, we announced an increase in our Marcellus EUR guidance as well as a 15% increase in our Marcellus inventory to 3,450 locations and an increase in our Lower Marcellus guidance for EUR per thousand foot from 3.6 Bcf to 3.8 Bcf, further reinforcing our estimated recoveries as best in class across the entire Marcellus.
Pricing remains the biggest challenge for us in the Northeast PA. However, we are optimistic about the future given the significant reduction of activity in our operating area, which should ultimately result in a reduction of supply. For example, in the 6-county area in Northeast PA that accounts for over 8 Bcf per day of natural gas production, there are currently only 4 rigs operating and 4 daylight-only frac crews working. While no one can refute the wells in this part of the state are very productive and there's a backlog of wells still waiting for completion that can add volumes to the mix with a relatively limited capital investment, these production levels were simply not sustainable based on the reduced level of activity we see today. This could set us up for a favorable rebalancing of supply and demand later this year or in early '17, which could certainly greatly benefit Cabot.
While it is far too early to provide any significant details on our plans for '17, I would highlight that our unique set of assets in the Marcellus provides us with optionality as we assess our plans for the future. If market conditions improve and our takeaway capacity is placed in service according to our current expectations, then we can deliver on a program that generates double-digit production growth in 2017. More importantly, this program can provide even greater cash flow growth due to increasing margins as we assess more favorable markets all while deleveraging the balance sheet at today's strip.
However, if there are any unexpected delays in the infrastructure buildout or more generally, market conditions remain depressed, we have an asset that requires minimal capital investment to maintain flat production. In that scenario, while top line production volumes would be flat, we would still realize significant cash flow growth in '17 due to improving price realizations while generating free cash flow and deleveraging the balance sheet. While there is still a lot of uncertainty on how market conditions will evolve over the next 12 to 24 months, we are fortunate to have a set of assets that allow for this type of flexibility as we weather the storm.
Moving down south into Texas in the Eagle Ford. Our team experienced another exceptional year operationally, which was unfortunately overshadowed by lower crude prices. Our drilling team continued to outperform expectations, reducing our spud-to-TD drilling days for a 7,700-foot lateral to 8 days. This has resulted in a 45% reduction in drilling cost relative to 2014, almost all of which was driven by internal efficiencies as opposed to service cost reductions given that our rig was under a long-term older contract priced environment during the year. The team drilled its longest lateral to date of 11,588 feet in 11.6 days from spud to TD, with a total measured depth of 19,930 feet. Kudos to the drilling team.
Additionally, the rig we utilized during 2015 ranked second in total footage drilled among the roughly 200 rigs that our third-party provider contracted throughout all basins in 2015, another good indication of our efficiencies. We do anticipate an eventual recovery in oil prices and we believe our 86,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford can provide for long-term value creation in a slightly more favorable price environment. As a result, our focus in 2016 is to reduce our operating activity to the minimum levels needed to ensure we maintain all our core acreage.
We recently released our Eagle Ford drilling rig based on our anticipated level of activity. We will be able to maintain all of our leasehold obligations through '16. We exited '15 with 23 net wells drilled but uncompleted, and we'll work down some of that inventory throughout the year due to conditions -- continuous operation commitments, which should help arrest some of our natural declines we see in the field. We plan to exit 2016 with 13 net drilled uncompleted wells in our backlog.
I'll move to the proved reserve results. In this morning's release, we announced our sixth consecutive year of double-digit reserve growth, which is truly impressive, given the increasing trend of declining reserves across industry due to price-related revisions. Our year-end reserves increased 11% to 8.2 Tcfe despite a 40% and 47% reduction in natural gas and oil price realizations used in our reserve report, respectively.
Cabot's all-source finding and development costs for the year were $0.57 per Mcfe, while our Marcellus all-source finding and development costs were $0.31 per Mcf, both significantly lower than prior years, driven by strong performance revisions in the Marcellus as our well performance has continued to exceed expectations. Our proved developed percentage decreased slightly from 61% in '14 to 59% in '15, primarily as our percentage of crude undeveloped reserves associated with drilled but uncompleted wells increased from 7% to 11%. 2015 is another positive year report for Cabot, especially in light of the environment we are operating in today.
Let's get to Constitution. I'm sure it's on many of your minds. Recently, we had a flurry of activity surrounding Constitution Pipeline. While we do not have specific details we can share today regarding our final permit issuance, I can assure you that discussions to have the permit issued as soon as possible are ongoing. As a backdrop of '16 activity, on January 8, Constitution asked FERC for a partial notice to proceed with non-mechanized tree clearing. On January 29, FERC issued the notice to proceed for tree felling but limited our activity at this time to Pennsylvania.
Tree felling began February 5 in Pennsylvania. As of today, approximately 60% of the trees in Pennsylvania on the Constitution right-of-way are down. This represents approximately 18% of the trees for the entire right-of-way. Additionally, the FERC is still considering our request for felling trees in New York. Also, on January 28, the FERC issued an order on the pending rehearing request regarding the December 2014 order that issued our FERC certificate. The order early considered and  firmly rejected all arguments and ultimately declined all requests for rehearing; another positive step for Constitution.
Moving on to the Atlantic Sunrise project. As a reminder, this new pipeline will transport 850,000 dekatherms on Cabot's behalf to markets in the Atlantic -- in the mid-Atlantic area. To date, the project remains on schedule, with initial pipe shipments already on location and the draft environmental impact statement expected shortly from the FERC.
Before I move on, I would like to make one quick point on perceived versus real impact of pipelines. Bottom line, pipelines get buried, the right-of-way gets reclaimed with a much smaller footprint than renewables. In the case of Constitution, there are approximately 1,100 acres of right-of-way. For example, for solar to produce an equivalent level of power generation, it would require, instead of an 1,100-acre-foot right-of-way, the buried pipeline, solar equivalent would take 25,600-acre footprint of solar panels. And for wind, on an equivalent level of production as Constitution might produce, it would require approximately 2,000 turbines spread across 260 miles, which is double the length of the Constitution buried pipeline right-of-way. Certainly staggering differences, yet the narrative is not discussed much. Again, just fun facts.
In addition to Constitution and the Atlantic Sunrise pipelines, Cabot is also involved in 3 other significant projects in the Northeast beginning in late '17: The PennEast Pipeline, Tennessee's Orion Pipeline and the Moxie Freedom Power Plant. Collectively, these projects add approximately 445,000 dekatherms per day of new long-term sales and transport capacity for Cabot. Our involvement in the Moxie Freedom project is especially unique as we will be the sole supplier of up to 165 dekatherms -- 165,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas to this new facility located just a few miles away from our existing infrastructure. These projects highlight our ongoing marketing strategy, along with other projects in the queue.
Another marketing-related item I'd like to highlight is our mix of firm sales and firm transportation capacity moving forward relative to our planned production profile. There's been a lot of discussion recently around the industry about capacity being overbuilt and the significant commitments and liabilities that producers have subscribed to over the past few years.
While we have been questioned during the past few years for not having enough firm transportation out of our supply area as the Northeast market became oversupplied, longer term, I believe our strategy of not overcommitting to FT and instead focusing on high-quality capacity with strong demand on the other side of the pipeline is the appropriate strategy. As a result, we feel our overall marketing strategy and the modest amount of commitments we have going forward will continue to provide significant growth from our future production plan and continue our long-term strong financial position.
I'll move to our guidance, brief comment there. As a reminder, earlier this month, we released our updated guidance for '16. Our updated budget of $325 million was designed to allow us to spend within operating cash flows at strip prices while still providing measured growth in 2016 in the 2% to 7% range. We also anticipate between $80 million and $150 million of contributions for our investments in Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise, which will be dependent upon the ongoing regulatory process and the corresponding impact of the timing of actual construction activities. Drilling completion and facility capital account for approximately 92% of the capital budget, with approximately 70% allocated to the Marcellus and 30% allocated to the Eagle Ford shale.
In total, we plan to drill approximately 30 net wells in '16 and complete approximately 55 net wells. This level of activity allows us to meet all our other obligatory drilling and operating commitments and maintain operating efficiencies throughout the program, while our anticipated year-end backlog of 61 drilled uncompleted wells company-wide provides us flexibility into 2017. As for pricing, we are 
currently forecasting a companywide natural gas differential of $0.70 per Mcf for the full year before the impact of derivatives, which represents a $0.15 improvement relative to our 2015 differential. Obviously, this overall program is dependent on the reference to infrastructure projects and their timing. If delayed, these numbers could move lower.
In summary, that's our program. And Carrie, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions."

But if we could go back to -- you've already touched on a lot of these themes, but if I could try a question that would maybe tie it together. Looking ahead to the time when you have the more takeaway and more local demand, how should we think about the cost in the number of wells that you'll need to turn the line to, to fill up those new pipes? And with this -- what I'm really after is, how should we think about your capital efficiency? Because it's hard to judge based on your results because you guys have been infrastructure constrained for so long. So when you look to today, you have to deliver another 500 MMcf a day. How many wells and how much capital should we think about that requiring?"

That's a good question, Michael. Certainly, the macro environment at the time of commissioning of new infrastructure is going to play in our decision on how much will be acceleration incremental volumes, if you will, versus how much is going to displace off the 3 pipes that we're currently producing on, and I'll let Jeff answer some of this in a brief second. But in the beginning, Michael, I think it would be prudent for us to fill the new infrastructure first because the price points we're going to be receiving on the  newbuilds is going to be a price point out of the challenged realizations that we've had either on Millennium, Tennessee or the Leidy Line. So we would fill that immediately, and there will be a transition period of the backfill of the displaced volumes that we put into the new pipes. And we will continue to, again, backfill. But we do expect that we would probably see, with the volumes that we'd be lifting out of the current area and off our current 3 pipes, we do expect to see a compression of the differential. And when you look at the timing of commissioning of those -- the new pipes out of that area, we think it could be contemporaneous with an inflection point of the supply side due to the limited amount of activity up in that particular area as we speak. So there's going to be a combination of things that will help dictate and set the table for us on how we would grow into that new capacity. I will also say this though. We are delivering returns today and we're in a -- been in a punitive price environment and realizations, more so than most, for an extended period of time. The program still today delivers free cash flow with good returns. The incremental volumes that we move into new areas with, we think, improved realizations is going to, even in spite of keeping the current strip, we think, is going to significantly improve our life [ph] from where we are today."

As Dan said in his comments, we've always tried to target, and our guidance highlights that also that we're trying to stay, create a capital program that's right on top of where -- or inside of the anticipated cash flow based on the assumptions. Now one caveat to that is we do have the 2 infrastructure projects that we're watching very closely, and its impact on our leverage, and looking at what levers we may or may not need to pull on that as we go forward. As you look back in history, Cabot has always done a great job of -- when it did want to expand capital in better markets, it used the combination of asset sales and the like to kind of -- to make -- hit our desired levels and kind of maintain our financial strategy. And that's no different today, although that market, that asset sale market is very challenged and you hear a lot of people that are going to be there. But we're very comfortable with the base plan. We're comfortable with the kind of the low 50% debt to total capital. Our year-end number, 2.5x, obviously, just the math, will move up. We'd like it to stay at 2.5x. But clearly, with the underlying commodity prices and where cash flow is, it is going to move up some during the course of '16, which we're comfortable with, because as Matt laid out in Dan's comments, we see a delevering event in '17 just by the nature of these infrastructure and what our new volumes will get to. So we're very comfortable with where we're at right now."

And as you might appreciate, we have looked at all angles and all options and all scenarios on getting to the commissioning and construction stage of Constitution. We do think that there's been adequate amount of time and deliberation in New York. 29 months is the process to date. So we've had great discussions in the past with New York on trying to address all concerns and mitigate the -- each stakeholder's concerns about laying the pipeline, how it would be done; we've rerouted; we've discussed about stream crossings, how to bore, how to open-cut, all those things. In this environment and the environment we live right now, there's certainly a contingent out there that don't want hydrocarbons in the mix. And that contingent is vocal and they speak out. There's -- I believe that we have that -- the Constitution Pipeline, from what we've been able to tell, from the governor of New York's plan and looking at the energy future for New York, natural gas is an energy source that's required for him to be able to fulfill his plan. So we think we're going to get to the endgame, and we certainly would like the input of New York into the process and all the work that we've done in the past to be used to design -- to actually for us to follow to the endgame on construction for this pipeline. The FERC has a job to do also. They have a fiduciary role to the public to have projects move forward. They have a lot of projects in front of them. Certainly, their jobs have become more challenged in the world we live today. But nevertheless, I think they have a job to fulfill to be able to take all the parties' issues under consideration, look at the validity of all those considerations and make prudent decisions that, that's best for the public's need, and we think they will do that.

All of those -- all that volume, 850 million, is committed right now to WGL and to the Cove Point LNG facility. We think that the volume of gas that is out there right now obviously strains the supply/demand curve. We think additional demand is coming. We think there will be -- in the south, to your point, in the south and along the Gulf Coast, we think there's significant amount of LNG displacement that will occur with some of the supply volumes that are in the south. And we think that we have as equally as good opportunity to be able to market our gas, not only directionally to the east, northeast and southeast, up into our area, but we do think that we'll be able to market our gas into the south. More supply -- just on a general note, more supply, whether it's oil or gas, into a limited demand circumstance, is going to be -- is going to have that dynamic of lower prices. We think that, maybe through this period of time, looking at what's going on in our industry and looking at the capital programs that have been reduced, looking at the ratings that have been imposed, public rating on some of the companies, looking at the oversupplied market, maybe there would be some rationalization in the market as we move forward also.

If you examine it closely and look at the meters along the 6-county area that we produce in, we're actually the null [ph] point for the 3 pipes that we produce in. So for example, most of our gas that goes into the Millennium goes to the east, where a majority of the gas out of the Bradford, Tioga County, for example, goes west. Same thing happens in -- on Tennessee and same thing happens on Transco. So we are -- we like where we are geographically and getting into the pipes. I think with Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise, it enhances that. But I don't see a large overbuilt situation in Northeast PA like we do in Southwest PA and the Utica. We feel like that the overbuilt infrastructure will absorb some of the Utica gas, but it will definitely head west and northwest and south."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. With me today, as usual, are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Before we start, let me say that the",2618,"Thank you, Carrie, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. With me today, as usual, are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Before we start, let me say that the standard boilerplate regarding -- forward-looking statements are -- included in this morning's press release, applies to the comments on today's call.
This morning's press release, along with our press release from 2 weeks ago outlining our updated 2016 budget, highlights that while our industry continues to struggle to adjust to persistently low commodity prices, Cabot remains well positioned to navigate through this challenging market environment due to our high-quality asset base, low cost structure, strong balance sheet and our capital discipline.
While most financial metrics were down year-over-year amid a backdrop of lower commodity prices, I am pleased with our overall report card for the year, which included 13% production growth despite continued price-related curtailments and a significant reduction in capital spending. Additionally, we grew reserves 11% despite reduced operating activity and lower SEC prices used in calculating year-end reserves.
I believe these results highlight the quality of our assets and their ability to generate positive results in most commodity price cycles. Our ability to grow production and reserves in a capital-efficient manner is a certainly impressive. And I'm equally as pleased with the continued reduction in our cost structure throughout the organization.
2015 marked another year of lower operating cost and finding costs for Cabot, driven by a combination of internally driven efficiencies and lower service cost. This reduction in cost has allowed for improving project-level economics despite lower commodity prices and positions the company well for the eventual recovery in both natural gas and oil price realizations.
Capital discipline has been a hallmark of Cabot's strategy over the years and 2015 was no exception. We ended 2015 with a capital program that came in 14% lower than budget, while still delivering on our production guidance for the year. This reduction in capital spending was especially apparent in the fourth quarter as we generated positive free cash flow despite realizing our lowest price for the year.
Our previously announced 2016 budget also highlights the company's financial discipline with another 58% year-over-year reduction in capital spending. We remain committed to our prudent capital allocation strategy and will strive to continue to improve capital efficiencies throughout our operation, which we believe will result in continued value creation for our shareholders.
As I highlighted to our shareholders over the last 18 months, our game plan has remained relatively unchanged during this down cycle, given our strategy has always been to first maintain balance sheet strength. We also align our capital spending with anticipated operating cash flows and allocate capital to our highest return projects. We also run a lean efficient operation in order to keep operating cost, including low overhead, and we focus on delivering long-term value creation from our high-quality asset base. This strategy has allowed us to prosper in most favorable price environments, and we think we will continue to be able to navigate successfully through this current downturn.
Now let's move to the Marcellus, and 2015 was another successful year for our Marcellus program, which generated positive free cash flow for the year despite lower natural gas price realizations. We continue to allocate the majority of our capital to our high-return assets in Marcellus, which still generate good returns despite the lower realizations. We averaged approximately 1.5 Bcf per day of net production despite curtailing over 75 Bcf of net production during the year. This surplus curtailed volume at year-end gives us significant flexibility this year and allowed us to reduce capital spending substantially year-over-year with minimal impact to our production.
On the operations front, we went from 3 drilling rigs in the fourth quarter down to 1 rig in mid-January. We are currently running 1 frac crew on daylight operations only and plan to continue at this pace throughout 2016. With the decrease in drilling activity, we plan to work down our backlog of drilled uncompleted wells throughout the year from 63 at year-end '15 to 48 at year-end '16. This inventory, along with expected curtailed year-end volumes, provides us with flexibility to ramp our volumes in '17, assuming both a timely in-service for Constitution and the Atlantic Sunrise and an improvement in realizations in Appalachia.
Our team in the Marcellus continues to improve their operating efficiencies, which is evident from the reduction in well costs by over 30% relative to the prior year. We expect to average a 7,000-foot lateral for the 2016 Marcellus program at a well cost of approximately $6.7 million or approximately $960 per lateral foot. This well cost does include all the capital associated with roads, pad buildout, production facilities and things of that nature.
On the operating cost front, we continue to see a reduction in our per unit cost, with direct OpEx decreasing to $0.04 per Mcf, and total cash cost per unit decreasing to $0.82 per Mcf, with gathering and transportation being the biggest component.
In this morning's press release, we announced an increase in our Marcellus EUR guidance as well as a 15% increase in our Marcellus inventory to 3,450 locations and an increase in our Lower Marcellus guidance for EUR per thousand foot from 3.6 Bcf to 3.8 Bcf, further reinforcing our estimated recoveries as best in class across the entire Marcellus.
Pricing remains the biggest challenge for us in the Northeast PA. However, we are optimistic about the future given the significant reduction of activity in our operating area, which should ultimately result in a reduction of supply. For example, in the 6-county area in Northeast PA that accounts for over 8 Bcf per day of natural gas production, there are currently only 4 rigs operating and 4 daylight-only frac crews working. While no one can refute the wells in this part of the state are very productive and there's a backlog of wells still waiting for completion that can add volumes to the mix with a relatively limited capital investment, these production levels were simply not sustainable based on the reduced level of activity we see today. This could set us up for a favorable rebalancing of supply and demand later this year or in early '17, which could certainly greatly benefit Cabot.
While it is far too early to provide any significant details on our plans for '17, I would highlight that our unique set of assets in the Marcellus provides us with optionality as we assess our plans for the future. If market conditions improve and our takeaway capacity is placed in service according to our current expectations, then we can deliver on a program that generates double-digit production growth in 2017. More importantly, this program can provide even greater cash flow growth due to increasing margins as we assess more favorable markets all while deleveraging the balance sheet at today's strip.
However, if there are any unexpected delays in the infrastructure buildout or more generally, market conditions remain depressed, we have an asset that requires minimal capital investment to maintain flat production. In that scenario, while top line production volumes would be flat, we would still realize significant cash flow growth in '17 due to improving price realizations while generating free cash flow and deleveraging the balance sheet. While there is still a lot of uncertainty on how market conditions will evolve over the next 12 to 24 months, we are fortunate to have a set of assets that allow for this type of flexibility as we weather the storm.
Moving down south into Texas in the Eagle Ford. Our team experienced another exceptional year operationally, which was unfortunately overshadowed by lower crude prices. Our drilling team continued to outperform expectations, reducing our spud-to-TD drilling days for a 7,700-foot lateral to 8 days. This has resulted in a 45% reduction in drilling cost relative to 2014, almost all of which was driven by internal efficiencies as opposed to service cost reductions given that our rig was under a long-term older contract priced environment during the year. The team drilled its longest lateral to date of 11,588 feet in 11.6 days from spud to TD, with a total measured depth of 19,930 feet. Kudos to the drilling team.
Additionally, the rig we utilized during 2015 ranked second in total footage drilled among the roughly 200 rigs that our third-party provider contracted throughout all basins in 2015, another good indication of our efficiencies. We do anticipate an eventual recovery in oil prices and we believe our 86,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford can provide for long-term value creation in a slightly more favorable price environment. As a result, our focus in 2016 is to reduce our operating activity to the minimum levels needed to ensure we maintain all our core acreage.
We recently released our Eagle Ford drilling rig based on our anticipated level of activity. We will be able to maintain all of our leasehold obligations through '16. We exited '15 with 23 net wells drilled but uncompleted, and we'll work down some of that inventory throughout the year due to conditions -- continuous operation commitments, which should help arrest some of our natural declines we see in the field. We plan to exit 2016 with 13 net drilled uncompleted wells in our backlog.
I'll move to the proved reserve results. In this morning's release, we announced our sixth consecutive year of double-digit reserve growth, which is truly impressive, given the increasing trend of declining reserves across industry due to price-related revisions. Our year-end reserves increased 11% to 8.2 Tcfe despite a 40% and 47% reduction in natural gas and oil price realizations used in our reserve report, respectively.
Cabot's all-source finding and development costs for the year were $0.57 per Mcfe, while our Marcellus all-source finding and development costs were $0.31 per Mcf, both significantly lower than prior years, driven by strong performance revisions in the Marcellus as our well performance has continued to exceed expectations. Our proved developed percentage decreased slightly from 61% in '14 to 59% in '15, primarily as our percentage of crude undeveloped reserves associated with drilled but uncompleted wells increased from 7% to 11%. 2015 is another positive year report for Cabot, especially in light of the environment we are operating in today.
Let's get to Constitution. I'm sure it's on many of your minds. Recently, we had a flurry of activity surrounding Constitution Pipeline. While we do not have specific details we can share today regarding our final permit issuance, I can assure you that discussions to have the permit issued as soon as possible are ongoing. As a backdrop of '16 activity, on January 8, Constitution asked FERC for a partial notice to proceed with non-mechanized tree clearing. On January 29, FERC issued the notice to proceed for tree felling but limited our activity at this time to Pennsylvania.
Tree felling began February 5 in Pennsylvania. As of today, approximately 60% of the trees in Pennsylvania on the Constitution right-of-way are down. This represents approximately 18% of the trees for the entire right-of-way. Additionally, the FERC is still considering our request for felling trees in New York. Also, on January 28, the FERC issued an order on the pending rehearing request regarding the December 2014 order that issued our FERC certificate. The order early considered and  firmly rejected all arguments and ultimately declined all requests for rehearing; another positive step for Constitution.
Moving on to the Atlantic Sunrise project. As a reminder, this new pipeline will transport 850,000 dekatherms on Cabot's behalf to markets in the Atlantic -- in the mid-Atlantic area. To date, the project remains on schedule, with initial pipe shipments already on location and the draft environmental impact statement expected shortly from the FERC.
Before I move on, I would like to make one quick point on perceived versus real impact of pipelines. Bottom line, pipelines get buried, the right-of-way gets reclaimed with a much smaller footprint than renewables. In the case of Constitution, there are approximately 1,100 acres of right-of-way. For example, for solar to produce an equivalent level of power generation, it would require, instead of an 1,100-acre-foot right-of-way, the buried pipeline, solar equivalent would take 25,600-acre footprint of solar panels. And for wind, on an equivalent level of production as Constitution might produce, it would require approximately 2,000 turbines spread across 260 miles, which is double the length of the Constitution buried pipeline right-of-way. Certainly staggering differences, yet the narrative is not discussed much. Again, just fun facts.
In addition to Constitution and the Atlantic Sunrise pipelines, Cabot is also involved in 3 other significant projects in the Northeast beginning in late '17: The PennEast Pipeline, Tennessee's Orion Pipeline and the Moxie Freedom Power Plant. Collectively, these projects add approximately 445,000 dekatherms per day of new long-term sales and transport capacity for Cabot. Our involvement in the Moxie Freedom project is especially unique as we will be the sole supplier of up to 165 dekatherms -- 165,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas to this new facility located just a few miles away from our existing infrastructure. These projects highlight our ongoing marketing strategy, along with other projects in the queue.
Another marketing-related item I'd like to highlight is our mix of firm sales and firm transportation capacity moving forward relative to our planned production profile. There's been a lot of discussion recently around the industry about capacity being overbuilt and the significant commitments and liabilities that producers have subscribed to over the past few years.
While we have been questioned during the past few years for not having enough firm transportation out of our supply area as the Northeast market became oversupplied, longer term, I believe our strategy of not overcommitting to FT and instead focusing on high-quality capacity with strong demand on the other side of the pipeline is the appropriate strategy. As a result, we feel our overall marketing strategy and the modest amount of commitments we have going forward will continue to provide significant growth from our future production plan and continue our long-term strong financial position.
I'll move to our guidance, brief comment there. As a reminder, earlier this month, we released our updated guidance for '16. Our updated budget of $325 million was designed to allow us to spend within operating cash flows at strip prices while still providing measured growth in 2016 in the 2% to 7% range. We also anticipate between $80 million and $150 million of contributions for our investments in Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise, which will be dependent upon the ongoing regulatory process and the corresponding impact of the timing of actual construction activities. Drilling completion and facility capital account for approximately 92% of the capital budget, with approximately 70% allocated to the Marcellus and 30% allocated to the Eagle Ford shale.
In total, we plan to drill approximately 30 net wells in '16 and complete approximately 55 net wells. This level of activity allows us to meet all our other obligatory drilling and operating commitments and maintain operating efficiencies throughout the program, while our anticipated year-end backlog of 61 drilled uncompleted wells company-wide provides us flexibility into 2017. As for pricing, we are currently forecasting a companywide natural gas differential of $0.70 per Mcf for the full year before the impact of derivatives, which represents a $0.15 improvement relative to our 2015 differential. Obviously, this overall program is dependent on the reference to infrastructure projects and their timing. If delayed, these numbers could move lower.
In summary, that's our program. And Carrie, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions."

But if we could go back to -- you've already touched on a lot of these themes, but if I could try a question that would maybe tie it together.

And historically, we have never been over 6 rigs. And we have had, majority of the time, 1 to 2 frac crews. Episodically, we've had 3 frac crews on a one-off pad site or something like that. But typically, in the past, we've never been greater than 2 frac crews.

That's a good question, Michael. Certainly, the macro environment at the time of commissioning of new infrastructure is going to play in our decision on how much will be acceleration incremental volumes, if you will, versus how much is going to displace off the 3 pipes that we're currently producing on, and I'll let Jeff answer some of this in a brief second. But in the beginning, Michael, I think it would be prudent for us to fill the new infrastructure first because the price points we're going to be receiving on the  newbuilds is going to be a price point out of the challenged realizations that we've had either on Millennium, Tennessee or the Leidy Line. So we would fill that immediately, and there will be a transition period of the backfill of the displaced volumes that we put into the new pipes. And we will continue to, again, backfill. But we do expect that we would probably see, with the volumes that we'd be lifting out of the current area and off our current 3 pipes, we do expect to see a compression of the differential. And when you look at the timing of commissioning of those -- the new pipes out of that area, we think it could be contemporaneous with an inflection point of the supply side due to the limited amount of activity up in that particular area as we speak. So there's going to be a combination of things that will help dictate and set the table for us on how we would grow into that new capacity. I will also say this though. We are delivering returns today and we're in a -- been in a punitive price environment and realizations, more so than most, for an extended period of time. The program still today delivers free cash flow with good returns. The incremental volumes that we move into new areas with, we think, improved realizations is going to, even in spite of keeping the current strip, we think, is going to significantly improve our life [ph] from where we are today."

As Dan said in his comments, we've always tried to target, and our guidance highlights that also that we're trying to stay, create a capital program that's right on top of where -- or inside of the anticipated cash flow based on the assumptions. Now one caveat to that is we do have the 2 infrastructure projects that we're watching very closely, and its impact on our leverage, and looking at what levers we may or may not need to pull on that as we go forward. As you look back in history, Cabot has always done a great job of -- when it did want to expand capital in better markets, it used the combination of asset sales and the like to kind of -- to make -- hit our desired levels and kind of maintain our financial strategy. And that's no different today, although that market, that asset sale market is very challenged and you hear a lot of people that are going to be there. But we're very comfortable with the base plan. We're comfortable with the kind of the low 50% debt to total capital. Our year-end number, 2.5x, obviously, just the math, will move up. We'd like it to stay at 2.5x. But clearly, with the underlying commodity prices and where cash flow is, it is going to move up some during the course of '16, which we're comfortable with, because as Matt laid out in Dan's comments, we see a delevering event in '17 just by the nature of these infrastructure and what our new volumes will get to.

And as you might appreciate, we have looked at all angles and all options and all scenarios on getting to the commissioning and construction stage of Constitution. We do think that there's been adequate amount of time and deliberation in New York. 29 months is the process to date. So we've had great discussions in the past with New York on trying to address all concerns and mitigate the -- each stakeholder's concerns about laying the pipeline, how it would be done; we've rerouted; we've discussed about stream crossings, how to bore, how to open-cut, all those things. In this environment and the environment we live right now, there's certainly a contingent out there that don't want hydrocarbons in the mix. And that contingent is vocal and they speak out. There's -- I believe that we have that -- the Constitution Pipeline, from what we've been able to tell, from the governor of New York's plan and looking at the energy future for New York, natural gas is an energy source that's required for him to be able to fulfill his plan. So we think we're going to get to the endgame, and we certainly would like the input of New York into the process and all the work that we've done in the past to be used to design -- to actually for us to follow to the endgame on construction for this pipeline. The FERC has a job to do also. They have a fiduciary role to the public to have projects move forward. They have a lot of projects in front of them. Certainly, their jobs have become more challenged in the world we live today. But nevertheless, I think they have a job to fulfill to be able to take all the parties' issues under consideration, look at the validity of all those considerations and make prudent decisions that, that's best for the public's need, and we think they will do that.

All of those -- all that volume, 850 million, is committed right now to WGL and to the Cove Point LNG facility. We think that the volume of gas that is out there right now obviously strains the supply/demand curve. We think additional demand is coming. We think there will be -- in the south, to your point, in the south and along the Gulf Coast, we think there's significant amount of LNG displacement that will occur with some of the supply volumes that are in the south. And we think that we have as equally as good opportunity to be able to market our gas, not only directionally to the east, northeast and southeast, up into our area, but we do think that we'll be able to market our gas into the south. More supply -- just on a general note, more supply, whether it's oil or gas, into a limited demand circumstance, is going to be -- is going to have that dynamic of lower prices. We think that, maybe through this period of time, looking at what's going on in our industry and looking at the capital programs that have been reduced, looking at the ratings that have been imposed, public rating on some of the companies, looking at the oversupplied market, maybe there would be some rationalization in the market as we move forward also.

If you examine it closely and look at the meters along the 6-county area that we produce in, we're actually the null [ph] point for the 3 pipes that we produce in. So for example, most of our gas that goes into the Millennium goes to the east, where a majority of the gas out of the Bradford, Tioga County, for example, goes west. Same thing happens in -- on Tennessee and same thing happens on Transco. So we are -- we like where we are geographically and getting into the pipes. I think with Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise, it enhances that. But I don't see a large overbuilt situation in Northeast PA like we do in Southwest PA and the Utica. We feel like that the overbuilt infrastructure will absorb some of the Utica gas, but it will definitely head west and northwest and south."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are the members of Cabot's Executive management team. And before we get started, let me say that the standard boilerplate regard",1934,"Thank you, Rocco, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are the members of Cabot's Executive management team. And before we get started, let me say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward-looking statements including in this morning's press release do apply to my comments today. As an opening comments, I think it's impressive that during the worst quarter, our industry has faced in many years, Cabot's first quarter results highlight our ability to deliver growth without burning the balance sheet even in this low commodity price environment. Cabot grew daily equivalent production by 7% sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 while funding all investing activities with a combination of operating cash flow and proceeds from a noncore asset sales. At today's strip prices, we do anticipate that the company will be able to deliver a cash-flow-neutral to cash-flow-positive program each quarter this year as price realizations continue to improve and capital spending continues to trend downward over the next few quarters. Despite the significant improvement in our natural gas differentials during the quarter, which improved from a minus $0.75 in the fourth quarter of '15 to a minus $0.60 during the first quarter of '16, the company experienced its lower price realizations in many years. The lower realizations were the result of an average NYMEX settlement price of $2.09 per Mmbtu during the first quarter, which was the lowest average NYMEX price we have witnessed since the first quarter of 1999. While lower prices certainly had an impact on industry-wide margins and cash flows, including Cabot's, the good news is that the outlook for natural gas price continues to improve as the country is beginning to experience a decline in dry gas productions stemming from a significant reduction in drilling and completion activities and an improvement in natural gas price -- natural gas demand driven by increased power generation and exports. While the improvements and differentials had a meaningful impact on our results for the quarter, our ability to continue to lower our cost structure has also helped the bottom line. Cash cost, including G&A and interest expense, during the quarter were $1.18 per Mcfe compared to $1.26 per Mcfe during the fourth quarter of '15. In addition to our reduction in unit cost, we also reduced our capital spending relative to the fourth quarter of '15, highlighting our commitment to financial discipline. 
As mentioned and as you are all aware, one of our core tenet is our commitment to maintaining our balance sheet strength. We took a major step during the quarter to ensure that strength by issuing approximately $1 billion of equity in late February with a portion of the proceeds used to pay off the outstanding borrowing on our revolving credit facility. Subsequent to the offering, the company is extremely well positioned to weather the current environment and remain opportunistic with liquidity of approximately $2.2 billion and a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 1.6x at quarter end. Additionally, subsequent to the quarter end, Cabot's bank group unanimously approved a borrowing base of $3.2 billion. 
Moving into the region. In the Marcellus, we continue to operate 1 drilling rig and 1 frac crew working daylight hours only. During the quarter, we drilled 7 wells and completed 12 wells. Our primary focus is on enhancing operating efficiencies, resulting in further cost reductions. The success of these efforts was evident in the first quarter with drilling and completion cost savings of approximately 14% compared to to the fourth quarter of 2015. On average, useful lateral link for the 7 wells drilled during the first quarter of '16 was over 7,400 feet, which exceeded our previous best quarter average by over 1,000 feet. Even with the longer laterals, we were able to maintain average drilling days flat relative to the fourth quarter of '15 at 12 days from spud to TD. 
On the production front, we averaged over 1.6 Bcf per day in net production for the quarter while reducing direct field operating cost to $0.03 per Mcf. We exited the first quarter, with 54 wells waiting on completion, which does not include the 4 wells we are currently completing. In addition, we have over 60 drilling permits approved and ready to go in the Marcellus. As we evaluate our plans for future operating activities in the Marcellus, it is important to understand that the supply outlook for our operating area in the Northeast Pennsylvania. While there's been a lot of focus recently on the expectations for meaningful supply declines across North America, which we do fully subscribed to and believe will impact us positively, we are already seeing that dynamic play itself out in our operating area. For example, in the 6 County area, we define as Northeast Pennsylvania, there was about 8.4 Bcf per day of production in February compared to about 7.6 Bcf per day in April based on our estimates. Not surprisingly, these lower production levels have positively impact the local phases, with and Tennessee differentials for the month of April coming in at their lowest levels since mid-2013. We expect that trend to continue in May, resulting in our second quarter differential guidance range of $0.50 to $0.55 below NYMEX, a $0.05 to $0.10 improvement relative to the first quarter and a $0.35 to $0.40 improvement compared to the second quarter of '15. While curtailments are certainly driving some portion of this production decline, we believe that curtailments in Northeastern Pennsylvania were not as substantial in April since the cash price in the day market has been about $0.20 to $0.30 better than in February and March. Our reservoir team has spent a lot of time scrubbing the state data for over 4,000 wells in Northeast PA in attempt to better understand the anticipated production declines in our, as well as to assess the level of drilled uncompleted wells. Our engineers built production curves for all of their producing wells in the 6 County area. Additionally, assumptions were made for nonproducing wells as to whether we thought a well was temporarily not producing for reasons like curtailments and will ultimately be placed back on production when prices were higher or if the well would never be placed back on production due to poor performance or a significant period of inactivity. 
Ultimately, we found that even when assuming all shut-in production comes back online after the summer, we can still see a 25% decline from year-end 2015 to year-end 2016. Question then becomes is there enough operating activity occurring currently to fill that void or will the areas see exit-to-exit production declines, resulting in a positive outlook for pricing next winter. Our best estimate is, at this point, is that approximately 120 wells will be completed in our area of this year and modeling suggest that, that is simply not enough activity to backfill the declining production we see. This is very positive for Cabot. Our engineers study also revealed an estimate of drilled uncompleted wells that is significantly less than the 800 plus or minus wells you hear reported by some other third-party sources. Only 3 rigs are currently operating in our area and I do not expect that, that inventory will grow. In fact, it will be shrinking throughout the year, which is positive as we think about 2017 and beyond. 
While there will always be some inventory of drilled uncompleted wells, I'll remind everyone that the most capital-intensive portion of drilling and completing a well is the completion side. Accordingly, I suspect, it will take higher prices, healthier balance sheet and cheaper access to capital before we see a meaningful uptick in completion activity in our area. 
In the Eagle Ford, the drilling rig release -- was released in early February. The drill team has turned its focus to the completions required to maintain lease obligations. During the first quarter, our team in South Texas completed and placed on production 9 wells with an average completion, lateral length of 7,760 feet. During the quarter, Cabot also completed its longest Eagle Ford well today with 46 stages in a lateral length, 11,200-plus feet. Capital efficiency and cost savings continue to be the primary focus with our Eagle Ford completions cost down by approximately 30% compared to the same quarter in 2015. 
At the current strip, our plans for the remainder of the year are focused solely on maintaining all of our leasehold obligations through '16 and not increasing our operating activity above these minimum levels. However, our anticipated backlog of '15 drilled uncompleted wells at year end '16 does allow for flexibility. All right now, everyone is aware of the recent New York DC decision to deny water quality certificate permit last week pertaining to Constitution pipeline. Today, we are not going to dwell on the specifics of the denial notice and unfortunately, we cannot expand on the legal strategy going forward other than to refer you to our April 25 Constitution press release, which clearly refutes allegations of The New York DEC. Because of this, we do want to remind you of our total commitment to the project and we remain confident we will ultimately prevail. Because of New York's denial, we have pushed back the service date for Constitution to the second half of '18. Moreover, we do want to reiterate that although this additional capacity is important to our long-term plans, we have successfully continued our efforts to access new markets. Previously, we announced several new projects that collectively add approximately 450,000 MMBtu per day of new long-term sales and transportation capacity to new market areas. Additionally, we've been very active with 2 additional projects that again solidify our long-term growth profile and improved our infrastructure situation. We will be providing updates and details on these transactions in the weeks to come. 
Regarding Atlantic Sunrise, the project continues to move forward on all fronts, particularly on land, regulatory and permitting side of the project. Our expectations are to receive the draft environmental impact statement soon and per the FERC scheduling notice in March, the final EIS is scheduled for October. Cabot now anticipates contributing $30 million to $35 million to its equity investments in these pipeline projects in 2016, down from the original guidance of $80 million to $150 million. In regard to the remainder of 2016, we have guided with curtailed volumes for our second and third quarters. Additionally, we're in the process of updating our plans for '17 and beyond in light of the recent news regarding Constitution and the addition of several other projects we are working on. However, I will comment that similar to our plan for '16, Cabot will be able to economically grow our natural gas production in '17. While we have a range of outcomes for '17 at this point, the ultimate level of growth will be the direct result of our underlying expectations for price realizations during the year. We also anticipate a further acceleration of our growth rate in '18 in anticipation of the timely in-service of the various infrastructure projects I referred to earlier. These projects will add approximately 1.3 Bcf per day of new firm transportation capacity and long-term sales in 2018. And this figure does not include any Constitution capacity. 
In summary, our strong financial position, the lowering of our cost structure, reduced level of our industry activity, improving natural gas differentials and strong portfolio of future takeaway opportunities outside of New York, position us well for the future. Rocco, with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

Our supply study we done out there, our expectations are that the supply side will continue to diminish, that you'll have narrowing differentials and I think that will certainly bode well for realizations. NYMEX is going to do what it does, but certainly the Northeast has been one of the most punitive areas for differentials and I think now that with the supply side and lack of activity, it is now coming in more parity with other areas of the country. I would expect that when you look at the parties that are up in the Northeast that have positions, I don't think the Northeast PA is going to be an area that they're going to run up to and commence the program any time near term.

We have looked at New York's own projections, their 2030 projections have Constitution or additional gas as a part of their energy source.

We have looked at New York's own projections, their 2030 projections have Constitution or additional gas as a part of their energy source. They anticipate that in 2030, that natural gas is going to represent about 50% of New York's fuel source. And the natural gas has to get up there and meet that demand in some way. The fact that the Constitution pipeline and others are fully subscribed projects represent the demands that's necessary up there and it's there for the public need. And so when you look at what the future holds, the grants that New York has given to some of the Southern tier counties in New York for tax into Constitution pipeline, for the use of natural gas in areas that are stranded and do not have the use of natural gas, I think it is obvious that the public need and the majority would benefit from Constitution being a fuel source for energy in New York. When you look out ahead and you look at a desire to have renewables, we all know that we are a company and an industry that endorses renewables as part of the energy mix. We'll continue to endorse renewables as part of the energy mix, but we also think it's prudent to be realistic about scalability, timing and to take in consideration the cost associated with the renewables in this environment and the general public and the consumer and what it will cost if, in fact, there's not access to natural gas as the clean fuel that it is. Keep in mind that a lot of the benefits from the CO2 reductions that we see today are a direct result of natural gas being a fuel source and it's not a hard equation to -- and it's not a difficult set of facts to understand.

I do agree with it being more difficult and activists trying to stop progress on the midstream. I think in certain areas of the country, it will be more pronounced than others and geographically, it seems to be up in the East right now where it's a little bit more populated. It seems to have more intensity and more emotion attached to it. But again, I'll go back to what we referred to last quarter and you look at the footprint necessary to get a certain level of energy to a demand source. Natural gas has one of the smallest footprints that there are out there. If you make an equivalent to renewables and what it takes to deliver a equivalent production, what's being discounted and not discussed is the footprint necessary to be able to deliver renewables and the equivalent production levels. So all those things are part of it, but I think geographically, it's going to be more difficult in other areas to lay the infrastructure. But I do think that the process is being considered by the administrators in a way differently than it has been in the past. And I think it's clear there is not scalable opportunities for renewables to take the place of what hydrocarbons and natural gas in particular will deliver as far as demand is concerned. So just a difficult time right now. And I do feel though that with projects that we have in place, I think the mitigation discussions that we'll have going forward to mitigate an objective way will also come into play. I think we do that, but we're going to be better at the -- that aspect of it. We're certainly sensitive to all the needs out there and we'll continue to move forward with what we think are projects for the majority's need."

And before we get started -- excuse me, let me say that the standard boile",1941,"Thank you, Rocco, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are the members of Cabot's executive management team. And before we get started -- excuse me, let me say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward-looking statements including in this morning's press release do apply to my comments today. 
As an opening comment, I think it's impressive that during the worst quarter our industry has faced in many years, Cabot's first quarter results highlight our ability to deliver growth without burning the balance sheet, even in this low commodity price environment. Cabot grew daily equivalent production by 7% sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, while funding all investing activities with a combination of operating cash flow and proceeds from a noncore asset sale. At today's strip prices, we do anticipate that the company will be able to deliver a cash-flow-neutral to cash-flow-positive program each quarter this year as price realizations continue to improve and capital spending continues to trend downward over the next few quarters. 
Despite a significant improvement in our natural gas differentials during the quarter, which improved from a minus $0.75 in the fourth quarter of '15 to a minus $0.60 during the first quarter of '16, the company experienced its lowest price realizations in many years. The lower realizations were the result of an average NYMEX settlement price of $2.09 per MMBtu during the first quarter, which was the lowest average NYMEX price we have witnessed since the first quarter of 1999. While lower prices have certainly had an impact on industry-wide margins and cash flows, including Cabot's, the good news is that the outlook for natural gas price continues to improve as the country is beginning to experience a decline in dry gas productions, stemming from a significant reduction in drilling and completion activities and an improvement in natural gas price -- natural gas demand driven by increased power generation and exports. While the improvements and differentials had a meaningful impact on our results for the quarter, our ability to continue to lower our cost structure has also helped the bottom line. Cash cost, including G&A and interest expense, during the quarter were $1.18 per Mcfe compared to $1.26 per Mcfe during the fourth quarter of '15. In addition to our reduction in unit cost, we also reduced our capital spending relative to the fourth quarter of '15, highlighting our commitment to financial discipline. 
As mentioned and as you are all aware, one of our core tenets is our commitment to maintaining our balance sheet strength. We took a major step during the quarter to ensure that strength by issuing approximately $1 billion of equity in late February, with a portion of the proceeds used to pay off the outstanding borrowing on our revolving credit facility. Subsequent to the offering, the company is extremely well positioned to weather the current environment and remain opportunistic, with liquidity of approximately $2.2 billion and a net-debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of only 1.6x at quarter end. Additionally, subsequent to the quarter end, Cabot's bank group unanimously approved a borrowing base of $3.2 billion.
Moving into the region. In the Marcellus, we continue to operate 1 drilling rig and 1 frac crew working daylight hours only. During the quarter, we drilled 7 wells and completed 12 wells. Our primary focus is on enhancing operating efficiencies, resulting in further cost reductions. The success of these efforts was evident in the first quarter, with drilling and completion cost savings of approximately 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. On average, useful lateral length for the 7 wells drilled during the first quarter of '16 was over 7,400 feet, which exceeded our previous best quarter average by over 1,000 feet. Even with the longer laterals, we were able to maintain average drilling days flat relative to the fourth quarter of '15 at 12 days from spud to TD.
On the production front, we averaged over 1.6 Bcf per day in net production for the quarter, while reducing direct field operating cost to $0.03 per Mcf. We exited the first quarter with 54 wells waiting on completion, which does not include the 4 wells we are currently completing. 
In addition, we have over 60 drilling permits approved and ready to go in the Marcellus. As we evaluate our plans for future operating activities in the Marcellus, it is important to understand the supply outlook for our operating area in the Northeast Pennsylvania. While there has been a lot of focus recently on the expectations for meaningful supply declines across North America, which we do fully subscribe to and believe will impact us positively. We are already seeing that dynamic play itself out in our operating area. For example, in the 6 County area, we define as Northeast Pennsylvania, there was about 8.4 Bcf per day of production in February compared to about 7.6 Bcf per day in April based on our estimates. Not surprisingly, these lower production levels have positively impact the local phases, with Leidy and Tennessee differentials for the month of April coming in at their lowest levels since mid-2013. We expect that trend to continue in May, resulting in our second quarter differential guidance range of $0.50 to $0.55 below NYMEX, a $0.05 to $0.10 improvement relative to the first quarter and a $0.35 to $0.40 improvement compared to the second quarter of '15. While curtailments are certainly driving some portion of this production decline, we believe that curtailments in Northeast Pennsylvania were not as substantial in April since the cash price in the day market has been about $0.20 to $0.30 better than in February and March. Our reservoir team has spent a lot of time scrubbing the state data for over 4,000 wells in Northeast PA in an attempt to better understand the anticipated production declines in our area as well as to assess the level of drilled uncompleted wells, engineers' built production curves for all of the producing wells in the 6 County area. Additionally, assumptions were made for nonproducing wells as to whether we thought a well was temporarily not producing for reasons like curtailments and would  ultimately be placed back on production when prices were higher or if the well would never be placed back on production due to poor performance or a significant period of inactivity.
Ultimately, we found that even when assuming all shut-in production comes back online after the summer, we could still see a 25% decline from year-end 2015 to year-end 2016. Question then becomes is there enough operating activity occurring currently to fill that void or will the areas see exit-to-exit production declines resulting in a positive outlook for pricing next winter? Our best estimate is -- at this point is that approximately 120 wells will be completed in our area this year and modeling suggests that, that is simply not enough activity to backfill the declining production we see. This is very positive for Cabot. Our engineers study also revealed an estimate of drilled uncompleted wells that is significantly less than this 800 plus or minus wells you hear reported by some other third-party sources. Only 3 rigs are currently operating in our area, and I do not expect that, that inventory will grow. In fact, it will be shrinking throughout the year, which is positive as we think about 2017 and beyond.
While there will always be some inventory of drilled uncompleted wells, I'll remind everyone that the most capital-intensive portion of drilling and completing a well is the completion side. Accordingly, I suspect it will take higher prices, healthier balance sheet and cheaper access to capital before we see a meaningful uptick in completion activity in our area.
In the Eagle Ford, the drilling rig release -- was released in early February. The drill team has turned its focus to the completions required to maintain lease obligations. During the first quarter, our team in South Texas completed and placed on production 9 wells with an average completion lateral length of 7,760 feet. During the quarter, Cabot also completed its longest Eagle Ford well to date with 46 stages in a lateral length, 11,200-plus feet. Capital efficiency and cost savings continue to be the primary focus, with our Eagle Ford completions cost down by approximately 30% compared to the same quarter in 2015.
At the current strip, our plans for the remainder of the year are focused solely on maintaining all of our leasehold obligations through '16 and not increasing our operating activity above these minimum levels. However, our anticipated backlog of '15 drilled uncompleted wells at year-end '16 does allow for flexibility. All right. Now everyone is aware of the recent New York DEC decision to deny water quality certificate permit last week pertaining to Constitution Pipeline. Today, we are not going to dwell on the specifics of the denial notice, and unfortunately, we cannot expand on the legal strategy going forward other than to refer you to our April 25 Constitution press release, which clearly refutes the allegations of The New York DEC. Because of this, we do want to remind you of our total commitment to the project, and we remain confident we will ultimately prevail. Because of New York's denial, we have pushed back the service date for Constitution to the second half of '18. Moreover, we do want to reiterate that although this additional capacity is important to our long-term plans, we had successfully continued our efforts to access new markets. Previously, we announced several new projects that collectively add approximately 450,000 MMBtu per day of new long-term sales and transportation capacity to new market areas. Additionally, we have been very active with 2 additional projects that, again, solidify our long-term growth profile and improve our infrastructure situation. We will be providing updates and details on these transactions in the weeks to come. 
Regarding Atlantic Sunrise, the project continues to move forward on all fronts, particularly on land, regulatory and permitting side of the project. Our expectations are to receive the draft environmental impact statement soon and per the FERC scheduling notice in March, the final EIS is scheduled for October. Cabot now anticipates contributing $30 million to $35 million to its equity investments in these pipeline projects in 2016, down from the original guidance of $80 million to $150 million. In regard to the remainder of 2016, we have guided with curtailed volumes for our second and third quarters. Additionally, we are in the process of updating our plans for '17 and beyond in light of the recent news regarding Constitution and the addition of several other projects we are working on. However, I will comment that similar to our plan for '16, Cabot will be able to economically grow our natural gas production in '17. While we have a range of outcomes for '17 at this point, the ultimate level of growth will be the direct result of our underlying expectations for price realizations during year. We also anticipate a further acceleration of our growth rate in '18 in anticipation of the timely in-service of the various infrastructure projects I referred to earlier. These projects will add approximately 1.3 Bcf per day of new firm transportation capacity and long-term sales in 2018, and this figure does not include any Constitution capacity.
In summary, our strong financial position, the lowering of our cost structure, reduced level of our industry activity, improving natural gas differentials and strong portfolio of future takeaway opportunities outside of New York, position us well for the future. 
Rocco, with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

And I think that's being reflected in the differentials that you're referring to, and that our guidance is based on our expectations. Our supply study we done out there, our expectations are that the supply side will continue to diminish that you'll have narrowing differentials, and I think that will certainly bode well for realizations. NYMEX is going to do what it does, but certainly the Northeast has been one of the most punitive areas for differentials and I think now that with the supply side and lack of activity, it is now coming in more parity with other areas of the country. I would expect that when you look at the parties that are up in the Northeast that have positions, I don't think the Northeast PA is going to be an area that they're going to run up to and commence the program any time near term.

We have looked at New York's own projections, their 2030 projections have Constitution or additional gas as a part of their energy source. They anticipate that in 2030 that natural gas is going to represent about 50% of New York's fuel source. And the natural gas has to get up there and meet that demand in some way. The fact that the Constitution Pipeline and others are fully subscribed projects represent the demand that's necessary up there, and it's there for the public need. And so when you look at what the future holds, the grants that New York has given to some of the Southern tier counties in New York for taps into Constitution Pipeline, for the use of natural gas in areas that are stranded and do not have the use of natural gas, I think it is obvious that the public need and the majority would benefit from Constitution being a fuel source for energy in New York. When you look out ahead and you look at a desire to have renewables, we all know that we are a company in an industry that endorses renewables as part of the energy mix. We'll continue to endorse renewables as part of the energy mix, but we also think it's prudent to be realistic about scalability, timing and to take in consideration the cost associated with renewables in this environment and the general public and the consumer and what it will cost if, in fact, there's not access to natural gas as the clean fuel that it is. Keep in mind that a lot of the benefits from the CO2 reductions that we see today are a direct result of natural gas being a fuel source, and it's not a hard equation to -- and it's not a difficult set of facts to understand, though they, at times, are not represented in a lot of the media print."

I do agree with that's being more difficult and the activists trying to stop progress on the midstream. I think in certain areas of the country, it will be more pronounced than others, and geographically, it seems to be up in the East right now where it's a little bit more populated. It seems to have more intensity and more emotion attached to it. But again, I'll go back to what we referred to last quarter and you look at the footprint necessary to get a certain level of energy to a demand source. Natural gas has one of the smallest footprints that there are out there. If you make an equivalent to renewables and what it takes to deliver a equivalent production, what's being discounted and not discussed is the footprint necessary to be able to deliver renewables and the equivalent production level. So all those things are part of it, but, I think, geographically, it's going to be more difficult in other areas to lay the infrastructure -- but I do think that the process is being considered by the administrators in a way differently than it has been in the past. And I think it's clear that there are not scalable opportunities for renewables to take the place of what hydrocarbons and natural gas, in particular, will deliver as far as demand is concerned. So just a difficult time right now. I do feel though that with projects that we have in place, I think the mitigation discussions that we'll have going forward to mitigate an objective way will also come into play. I think we do that, but we're going to be better at the -- that aspect of it. We're certainly sensitive to all the needs out there, and we'll continue to move forward with what we think are projects for the majority's need."

With me today are the members of Cabot's executive management team. And before we get started -- excuse me, let me say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward-looking statements including in this morning's press release do apply to my comments today. 
As an opening comment, I think it's impressive that during the worst quarter our industry has faced in many years, Cabot's first quarter results highlight our ability to deliver growth without burdening the balance sheet, even in this low commodity price environment. Cabot grew daily equivalent production by 7% sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, while funding all investing activities with a combination of operating cash flow and proceeds from a noncore asset sale. At today's strip prices, we do anticipate that the company will be able to deliver a cash-flow-neutral to cash-flow-positive program each quarter this year as price realizations continue to improve and capital spending continues to trend downward over the next few quarters. 
Despite a significant improvement in our natural gas differentials during the quarter, which improved from a minus $0.75 in the fourth quarter of '15 to a minus $0.60 during the first quarter of '16, the company experienced its lowest price realizations in many years. The lower realizations were the result of an average NYMEX settlement price of $2.09 per MMBtu during the first quarter, which was the lowest average NYMEX price we have witnessed since the first quarter of 1999. While lower prices have certainly had an impact on industry-wide margins and cash flows, including Cabot's, the good news is that the outlook for natural gas prices continues to improve as the country is beginning to experience a decline in dry gas productions, stemming from a significant reduction in drilling and completion activities and an improvement in natural gas price -- natural gas demand driven by increased power generation and exports. While the improvements in differentials had a meaningful impact on our results for the quarter, our ability to continue to lower our cost structure has also helped the bottom line. Cash cost, including G&A and interest expense, during the quarter were $1.18 per Mcfe compared to $1.26 per Mcfe during the fourth quarter of '15. In addition to our reduction in unit cost, we also reduced our capital spending relative to the fourth quarter of '15, highlighting our commitment to financial discipline. 
As mentioned and as you are all aware, one of our core tenets is our commitment to maintaining our balance sheet strength. We took a major step during the quarter to ensure that strength by issuing approximately $1 billion of equity in late February, with a portion of the proceeds used to pay off the outstanding borrowing on our revolving credit facility. Subsequent to the offering, the company is extremely well positioned to weather the current environment and remain opportunistic, with liquidity of approximately $2.2 billion and a net-debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of only 1.6x at quarter end. Additionally, subsequent to the quarter end, Cabot's bank group unanimously approved a borrowing base of $3.2 billion.
Moving into the region. In the Marcellus, we continue to operate 1 drilling rig and 1 frac crew working daylight hours only. During the quarter, we drilled 7 wells and completed 12 wells. Our primary focus is on enhancing operating efficiencies, resulting in further cost reductions. The success of these efforts was evident in the first quarter, with drilling and completion cost savings of approximately 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. On average, usable lateral length for the 7 wells drilled during the first quarter of '16 was over 7,400 feet, which exceeded our previous best quarter average by over 1,000 feet. Even with the longer laterals, we were able to maintain average drilling days flat relative to the fourth quarter of '15 at 12 days from spud to TD.
On the production front, we averaged over 1.6 Bcf per day in net production for the quarter, while reducing direct field operating cost to $0.03 per Mcf. We exited the first quarter with 54 wells waiting on completion, which does not include the 4 wells we are currently completing. 
In addition, we have over 60 drilling permits approved and ready to go in the Marcellus. As we evaluate our plans for future operating activities in the Marcellus, it is important to understand the supply outlook for our operating area in the Northeast Pennsylvania. While there has been a lot of focus recently on the expectations for meaningful supply declines across North America, which we do fully subscribe to and believe will impact us positively. We are already seeing that dynamic play itself out in our operating area. For example, in the 6 County area, we define as Northeast Pennsylvania, there was about 8.4 Bcf per day of production in February compared to about 7.6 Bcf per day in April based on our estimates. Not surprisingly, these lower production levels have positively impact the local faces, with Leidy and Tennessee differentials for the month of April coming in at their lowest levels since mid-2013. We expect that trend to continue in May, resulting in our second quarter differential guidance range of $0.50 to $0.55 below NYMEX, a $0.05 to $0.10 improvement relative to the first quarter and a $0.35 to $0.40 improvement compared to the second quarter of '15. While curtailments are certainly driving some portion of this production decline, we believe that curtailments in Northeast Pennsylvania were not as substantial in April since the cash price in the day market has been about $0.20 to $0.30 better than in February and March. Our reservoir team has spent a lot of time scrubbing the state data for over 4,000 wells in Northeast PA in an attempt to better understand the anticipated production declines in our area as well as to assess the level of drilled uncompleted wells. Our engineers built production curves for all of the producing wells in the 6 County area. Additionally, assumptions were made for nonproducing wells as to whether we thought a well was temporarily not producing for reasons like curtailments and would  ultimately be placed back on production when prices were higher or if the well would never be placed back on production due to poor performance or a significant period of inactivity.
Ultimately, we found that even when assuming all shut-in production comes back online after the summer, we could still see a 25% decline from year-end 2015 to year-end 2016. Question then becomes is there enough operating activity occurring currently to fill that void or will the areas see exit-to-exit production declines resulting in a positive outlook for our pricing next winter? Our best estimate is -- at this point is that approximately 120 wells will be completed in our area this year and modeling suggests that, that is simply not enough activity to backfill the declining production we see. This is very positive for Cabot. Our engineers study also revealed an estimate of drilled uncompleted wells that is significantly less than this 800 plus or minus wells you hear reported by some other third-party sources. Only 3 rigs are currently operating in our area, and I do not expect that duct inventory will grow. In fact, it will be shrinking throughout the year, which is positive as we think about 2017 and beyond.
While there will always be some inventory of drilled uncompleted wells, I would remind everyone that the most capital-intensive portion of drilling and completing a well is the completion side. Accordingly, I suspect it will take higher prices, healthier balance sheet and cheaper access to capital before we see a meaningful uptick in completion activity in our area.
In the Eagle Ford, the drilling rig release -- was released in early February. The drill team has turned its focus to the completions required to maintain lease obligations. During the first quarter, our team in South Texas completed and placed on production 9 wells with an average completion lateral length of 7,760 feet. During the quarter, Cabot also completed its longest Eagle Ford well to date with 46 stages and a lateral length of 11,200-plus feet. Capital efficiency and cost savings continue to be the primary focus, with our Eagle Ford completions costs down by approximately 30% compared to the same quarter in 2015.
At the current strip, our plans for the remainder of the year are focused solely on maintaining all of our leasehold obligations through '16 and not increasing our operating activity above these minimum levels. However, our anticipated backlog of '15 drilled uncompleted wells at year-end '16 does allow for flexibility. All right. Now everyone is aware of the recent New York DEC decision to deny water quality certificate permit last week pertaining to the Constitution Pipeline. Today, we are not going to dwell on the specifics of the denial notice, and unfortunately, we cannot expand on the legal strategy going forward other than to refer you to our April 25 Constitution press release, which clearly refutes the allegations of The New York DEC. Because of this, we do want to remind you of our total commitment to the project, and we remain confident we will ultimately prevail. Because of New York's denial, we have pushed back the service date for Constitution to the second half of '18. Moreover, we do want to reiterate that although this additional capacity is important to our long-term plans, we have successfully continued our efforts to access new markets. Previously, we announced several new projects that collectively add approximately 450,000 MMBtu per day of new long-term sales and transportation capacity to new market areas. Additionally, we have been very active with 2 additional projects that, again, solidify our long-term growth profile and improve our infrastructure situation. We will be providing updates and details on these transactions in the weeks to come. 
Regarding Atlantic Sunrise, the project continues to move forward on all fronts, particularly on land, regulatory and permitting side of the project. Our expectations are to receive the draft environmental impact statement soon and per the FERC scheduling notice in March, the final EIS is scheduled for October. Cabot now anticipates contributing $30 million to $35 million to its equity investments in these pipeline projects in 2016, down from the original guidance of $80 million to $150 million. In regard to the remainder of 2016, we have guided with curtailed volumes for our second and third quarters. Additionally, we are in the process of updating our plan for '17 and beyond in light of the recent news regarding Constitution and the addition of several other projects we are working on. However, I will comment that similar to our plan for '16, Cabot will be able to economically grow our natural gas production in '17. While we have a range of outcomes for '17 at this point, the ultimate level of growth will be the direct result of our underlying expectations for price realizations during the year. We also anticipate a further acceleration of our growth rate in '18 in anticipation of the timely in-service of the various infrastructure projects I referred to earlier. These projects will add approximately 1.3 Bcf per day of new firm transportation capacity and long-term sales in 2018, and this figure does not include any Constitution capacity.
In summary, our strong financial position, the lowering of our cost structure, reduced level of industry activity, improving natural gas differentials and strong portfolio of future takeaway opportunities outside of New York, position us well for the future. 
Rocco, with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

And I think that's being reflected in the differentials that you're referring to, and that our guidance is based on our expectations. Our supply study we've done out there, our expectations are that the supply side will continue to diminish that you'll have narrowing differentials, and I think that will certainly bode well for realizations. NYMEX is going to do what it does, but certainly the Northeast has been one of the most punitive areas for differentials and I think now that with the supply side and lack of activity, it is now coming in more parity with other areas of the country. I would expect that when you look at the parties that are up in the Northeast that have positions, I don't think the Northeast PA is going to be an area that they're going to run up to and commence a program any time near term. So I do expect to see continued narrowing of the differentials, and I think it's a positive for Cabot."

We have looked at New York's own projections, their 2030 projections have Constitution or additional gas as a part of their energy source. They anticipate that in 2030 that natural gas is going to represent about 50% of New York's fuel source. And the natural gas has to get up there and meet that demand in some way. The fact that the Constitution Pipeline and others are fully subscribed projects represent the demand that's necessary up there, and it's for the public need. And so when you look at what the future holds, the grants that New York has given to some of the Southern tier counties in New York for taps into Constitution Pipeline, for the use of natural gas in areas that are stranded and do not have the use of natural gas, I think it is obvious that the public need and the majority would benefit from Constitution being a fuel source for energy in New York. When you look out ahead and you look at a desire to have renewables, we all know that we are a company and an industry that endorses renewables as part of the energy mix. We'll continue to endorse renewables as part of the energy mix, but we also think it's prudent to be realistic about scalability, timing and to take into consideration the cost associated with renewables in this environment and the general public and the consumer and what it will cost if, in fact, there's not access to natural gas as the clean fuel that it is. Keep in mind that a lot of the benefits from the CO2 reductions that we see today are a direct result of natural gas being a fuel source, and it's not a hard equation to -- and it's not a difficult set of facts to understand, though they, at times, are not represented in a lot of the media print."

I do agree with it being more difficult and the activists trying to stop progress on the midstream. I think in certain areas of the country, it will be more pronounced than others, and geographically, it seems to be up in the East right now where it's a little bit more populated. It seems to have more intensity and more emotion attached to it. But again, I'll go back to what we referred to last quarter and you look at the footprint necessary to get a certain level of energy to a demand source. Natural gas has one of the smallest footprints that there are out there. If you make an equivalent to renewables and what it takes to deliver an equivalent production, what's being discounted and not discussed is the footprint necessary to be able to deliver renewables and the equivalent production level. So all those things are part of it, but, I think, geographically, it's going to be more difficult in other areas to lay the infrastructure -- but I do think that the process is being considered by the administrators, in a way, differently than it has been in the past. And I think it's clear that there are not scalable opportunities for renewables to take the place of what hydrocarbons and natural gas, in particular, will deliver as far as demand is concerned. So just a difficult time right now. I do feel though that with projects that we have in place, I think the mitigation discussions that we'll have going forward to mitigate in an objective way will also come into play. I think we do that, but we're going to be better at the -- that aspect of it. We're certainly sensitive to all the needs out there, and we'll continue to move forward with what we think are projects for the majority's need."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are the members of Cabot's executive management team. And before we get started -- excuse me, let me say that the standard boile",1946,"Thank you, Rocco, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are the members of Cabot's executive management team. And before we get started -- excuse me, let me say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward-looking statements including in this morning's press release do apply to my comments today. 
As an opening comment, I think it's impressive that during the worst quarter our industry has faced in many years, Cabot's first quarter results highlight our ability to deliver growth without burdening the balance sheet, even in this low commodity price environment. Cabot grew daily equivalent production by 7% sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, while funding all investing activities with a combination of operating cash flow and proceeds from a noncore asset sale. At today's strip prices, we do anticipate that the company will be able to deliver a cash-flow-neutral to cash-flow-positive program each quarter this year as price realizations continue to improve and capital spending continues to trend downward over the next few quarters. 
Despite a significant improvement in our natural gas differentials during the quarter, which improved from a minus $0.75 in the fourth quarter of '15 to a minus $0.60 during the first quarter of '16, the company experienced its lowest price realizations in many years. The lower realizations were the result of an average NYMEX settlement price of $2.09 per MMBtu during the first quarter, which was the lowest average NYMEX price we have witnessed since the first quarter of 1999. While lower prices have certainly had an impact on industry-wide margins and cash flows, including Cabot's, the good news is that the outlook for natural gas prices continues to improve as the country is beginning to experience a decline in dry gas productions, stemming from a significant reduction in drilling and completion activities and an improvement in natural gas price -- natural gas demand driven by increased power generation and exports. While the improvements in differentials had a meaningful impact on our results for the quarter, our ability to continue to lower our cost structure has also helped the bottom line. Cash cost, including G&A and interest expense, during the quarter were $1.18 per Mcfe compared to $1.26 per Mcfe during the fourth quarter of '15. In addition to our reduction in unit cost, we also reduced our capital spending relative to the fourth quarter of '15, highlighting our commitment to financial discipline. 
As mentioned and as you are all aware, one of our core tenets is our commitment to maintaining our balance sheet strength. We took a major step during the quarter to ensure that strength by issuing approximately $1 billion of equity in late February, with a portion of the proceeds used to pay off the outstanding borrowing on our revolving credit facility. Subsequent to the offering, the company is extremely well positioned to weather the current environment and remain opportunistic, with liquidity of approximately $2.2 billion and a net-debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of only 1.6x at quarter end. Additionally, subsequent to the quarter end, Cabot's bank group unanimously approved a borrowing base of $3.2 billion.
Moving into the region. In the Marcellus, we continue to operate 1 drilling rig and 1 frac crew working daylight hours only. During the quarter, we drilled 7 wells and completed 12 wells. Our primary focus is on enhancing operating efficiencies, resulting in further cost reductions. The success of these efforts was evident in the first quarter, with drilling and completion cost savings of approximately 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. On average, usable lateral length for the 7 wells drilled during the first quarter of '16 was over 7,400 feet, which exceeded our previous best quarter average by over 1,000 feet. Even with the longer laterals, we were able to maintain average drilling days flat relative to the fourth quarter of '15 at 12 days from spud to TD.
On the production front, we averaged over 1.6 Bcf per day in net production for the quarter, while reducing direct field operating cost to $0.03 per Mcf. We exited the first quarter with 54 wells waiting on completion, which does not include the 4 wells we are currently completing. 
In addition, we have over 60 drilling permits approved and ready to go in the Marcellus. As we evaluate our plans for future operating activities in the Marcellus, it is important to understand the supply outlook for our operating area in the Northeast Pennsylvania. While there has been a lot of focus recently on the expectations for meaningful supply declines across North America, which we do fully subscribe to and believe will impact us positively. We are already seeing that dynamic play itself out in our operating area. For example, in the 6 County area, we define as Northeast Pennsylvania, there was about 8.4 Bcf per day of production in February compared to about 7.6 Bcf per day in April based on our estimates. Not surprisingly, these lower production levels have positively impact the local faces, with Leidy and Tennessee differentials for the month of April coming in at their lowest levels since mid-2013. We expect that trend to continue in May, resulting in our second quarter differential guidance range of $0.50 to $0.55 below NYMEX, a $0.05 to $0.10 improvement relative to the first quarter and a $0.35 to $0.40 improvement compared to the second quarter of '15. While curtailments are certainly driving some portion of this production decline, we believe that curtailments in Northeast Pennsylvania were not as substantial in April since the cash price in the day market has been about $0.20 to $0.30 better than in February and March. Our reservoir team has spent a lot of time scrubbing the state data for over 4,000 wells in Northeast PA in an attempt to better understand the anticipated production declines in our area as well as to assess the level of drilled uncompleted wells. Our engineers built production curves for all of the producing wells in the 6 County area. Additionally, assumptions were made for nonproducing wells as to whether we thought a well was temporarily not producing for reasons like curtailments and would  ultimately be placed back on production when prices were higher or if the well would never be placed back on production due to poor performance or a significant period of inactivity.
Ultimately, we found that even when assuming all shut-in production comes back online after the summer, we could still see a 25% decline from year-end 2015 to year-end 2016. Question then becomes is there enough operating activity occurring currently to fill that void or will the areas see exit-to-exit production declines resulting in a positive outlook for our pricing next winter? Our best estimate is -- at this point is that approximately 120 wells will be completed in our area this year and modeling suggests that, that is simply not enough activity to backfill the declining production we see. This is very positive for Cabot. Our engineers study also revealed an estimate of drilled uncompleted wells that is significantly less than this 800 plus or minus wells you hear reported by some other third-party sources. Only 3 rigs are currently operating in our area, and I do not expect that duct inventory will grow. In fact, it will be shrinking throughout the year, which is positive as we think about 2017 and beyond.
While there will always be some inventory of drilled uncompleted wells, I would remind everyone that the most capital-intensive portion of drilling and completing a well is the completion side. Accordingly, I suspect it will take higher prices, healthier balance sheet and cheaper access to capital before we see a meaningful uptick in completion activity in our area.
In the Eagle Ford, the drilling rig release -- was released in early February. The drill team has turned its focus to the completions required to maintain lease obligations. During the first quarter, our team in South Texas completed and placed on production 9 wells with an average completion lateral length of 7,760 feet. During the quarter, Cabot also completed its longest Eagle Ford well to date with 46 stages and a lateral length of 11,200-plus feet. Capital efficiency and cost savings continue to be the primary focus, with our Eagle Ford completions costs down by approximately 30% compared to the same quarter in 2015.
At the current strip, our plans for the remainder of the year are focused solely on maintaining all of our leasehold obligations through '16 and not increasing our operating activity above these minimum levels. However, our anticipated backlog of '15 drilled uncompleted wells at year-end '16 does allow for flexibility. All right. Now everyone is aware of the recent New York DEC decision to deny water quality certificate permit last week pertaining to the Constitution Pipeline. Today, we are not going to dwell on the specifics of the denial notice, and unfortunately, we cannot expand on the legal strategy going forward other than to refer you to our April 25 Constitution press release, which clearly refutes the allegations of The New York DEC. Because of this, we do want to remind you of our total commitment to the project, and we remain confident we will ultimately prevail. Because of New York's denial, we have pushed back the service date for Constitution to the second half of '18. Moreover, we do want to reiterate that although this additional capacity is important to our long-term plans, we have successfully continued our efforts to access new markets. Previously, we announced several new projects that collectively add approximately 450,000 MMBtu per day of new long-term sales and transportation capacity to new market areas. Additionally, we have been very active with 2 additional projects that, again, solidify our long-term growth profile and improve our infrastructure situation. We will be providing updates and details on these transactions in the weeks to come. 
Regarding Atlantic Sunrise, the project continues to move forward on all fronts, particularly on land, regulatory and permitting side of the project. Our expectations are to receive the draft environmental impact statement soon and per the FERC scheduling notice in March, the final EIS is scheduled for October. Cabot now anticipates contributing $30 million to $35 million to its equity investments in these pipeline projects in 2016, down from the original guidance of $80 million to $150 million. In regard to the remainder of 2016, we have guided with curtailed volumes for our second and third quarters. Additionally, we are in the process of updating our plan for '17 and beyond in light of the recent news regarding Constitution and the addition of several other projects we are working on. However, I will comment that similar to our plan for '16, Cabot will be able to economically grow our natural gas production in '17. While we have a range of outcomes for '17 at this point, the ultimate level of growth will be the direct result of our underlying expectations for price realizations during the year. We also anticipate a further acceleration of our growth rate in '18 in anticipation of the timely in-service of the various infrastructure projects I referred to earlier. These projects will add approximately 1.3 Bcf per day of new firm transportation capacity and long-term sales in 2018, and this figure does not include any Constitution capacity.
In summary, our strong financial position, the lowering of our cost structure, reduced level of industry activity, improving natural gas differentials and strong portfolio of future takeaway opportunities outside of New York, position us well for the future. 
Rocco, with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

NYMEX is going to do what it does, but certainly the Northeast has been one of the most punitive areas for differentials and I think now that with the supply side and lack of activity, it is now coming in more parity with other areas of the country. I would expect that when you look at the parties that are up in the Northeast that have positions, I don't think the Northeast PA is going to be an area that they're going to run up to and commence a program any time near term.

The fact that the Constitution Pipeline and others are fully subscribed projects represent the demand that's necessary up there, and it's for the public need. And so when you look at what the future holds, the grants that New York has given to some of the Southern tier counties in New York for taps into Constitution Pipeline, for the use of natural gas in areas that are stranded and do not have the use of natural gas, I think it is obvious that the public need and the majority would benefit from Constitution being a fuel source for energy in New York. When you look out ahead and you look at a desire to have renewables, we all know that we are a company and an industry that endorses renewables as part of the energy mix. We'll continue to endorse renewables as part of the energy mix, but we also think it's prudent to be realistic about scalability, timing and to take into consideration the cost associated with renewables in this environment and the general public and the consumer and what it will cost if, in fact, there's not access to natural gas as the clean fuel that it is. Keep in mind that a lot of the benefits from the CO2 reductions that we see today are a direct result of natural gas being a fuel source, and it's not a hard equation to -- and it's not a difficult set of facts to understand, though they, at times, are not represented in a lot of the media print."

I do agree with it being more difficult and the activists trying to stop progress on the midstream. I think in certain areas of the country, it will be more pronounced than others, and geographically, it seems to be up in the East right now where it's a little bit more populated. It seems to have more intensity and more emotion attached to it. But again, I'll go back to what we referred to last quarter and you look at the footprint necessary to get a certain level of energy to a demand source. Natural gas has one of the smallest footprints that there are out there. If you make an equivalent to renewables and what it takes to deliver an equivalent production, what's being discounted and not discussed is the footprint necessary to be able to deliver renewables and the equivalent production level. So all those things are part of it, but, I think, geographically, it's going to be more difficult in other areas to lay the infrastructure -- but I do think that the process is being considered by the administrators, in a way, differently than it has been in the past. And I think it's clear that there are not scalable opportunities for renewables to take the place of what hydrocarbons and natural gas, in particular, will deliver as far as demand is concerned. So just a difficult time right now. I do feel though that with projects that we have in place, I think the mitigation discussions that we'll have going forward to mitigate in an objective way will also come into play. I think we do that, but we're going to be better at the -- that aspect of it. We're certainly sensitive to all the needs out there, and we'll continue to move forward with what we think are projects for the majority's need."

I have today with me several members of the executive team. 
Before we start, let me do say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward-looking statements included in this morning's press release last my comments on today's call. 
Cabot's second quarter results highlight our ability to deliver production growth while also generating positive free cash flow, even in a low commodity price environment. We believe this characteristic sets us apart for most of our industry peers. Cabot averaged 1.67 Bcfe per day of net production during the quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015. This increase was driven by 14% increase in our Marcellus production volumes as compared to the prior-year comparable quarter. Despite a realized natural gas price of only $1.63 per Mcf, we generated positive free cash flow for the quarter and we anticipate that the company will be able to deliver a more meaningful level of free cash flow during the second half of the year based on current strip prices.
Natural gas realizations did improve by 9% sequentially as compared to the first quarter of the year, due in part to a significant improvement in local basis differential during the quarter. Before the impact of derivatives, Cabot's realizations were $0.40 below the average NYMEX settle price of $1.95 during the quarter, as compared to $0.60 below the average NYMEX settlement price in the first quarter. While basis differentials have subsequently widened in the third quarter due to a significant increase in the NYMEX prices, the good news is that we are forecasting much higher price realizations during the second half of the year, resulting in more free cash flow for the year than originally forecast. This increase in expected cash flows has allowed for the introduction of a second frac crew in the Marcellus for a portion of the second half of the year, which will help give us a jumpstart on 2017 production. Using the current 5-year forward curve for [indiscernible], which is a good proxy for the most punitive pricing a portion of our Marcellus production receives, our well level internal rate of returns are over 100% and our PV 10s are approximately $14 million. I cannot think of another asset that generates those economics in the current price environment, and therefore, we feel extremely comfortable about slightly increasing our levels of operating activity beginning with this additional frac crew. 
The second quarter results also demonstrate our continued emphasis on cost control, with unit costs declining by 12% compared to the prior-year comparable quarter and 2% compared to the first quarter of this year. We have now delivered a sequential decline in unit costs for 12 of the last 13 quarters and expect this trend to continue, further improving our industry-leading cost structure. 
Our balance sheet remains extremely strong, with over $500 million of cash on hand and a net debt to EBITDAX ratio of only 1.8x at quarter end. Based on our current forecast, we anticipate delevering between now and year end while our current liquidity of $2.2 billion should continue to improve, given our outlook for positive free cash flow in the second half of the year. This financial flexibility will serve as well as we formulate our plans for 2017 and beyond. 
In the Marcellus, we continue to operate 1 drilling rig and as mentioned, have recently added a second frac crew to accelerate the completion of our duck inventory, which will allow for our an acceleration of production in the first quarter of 2017. During the quarter, we drilled 7 wells, completed 8 wells, and placed 12 wells on production. The average lateral length for the 7 wells drilled during the second quarter was approximately 7,000 feet. However, given that all of the wells, 100% of the wells we placed on production year-to-date were drilled in '15 and the average lateral length was a little bit shorter and closer to 6,000 feet, the good news is that we should continue improvements in capital efficiency in 2017 as we began leasing on production the longer lateral wells from this year's program. On the production front, we averaged approximately 1.54 Bcf per day of net production for the Marcellus during the quarter, which was slightly below the midpoint of our expectations due to unscheduled downtime related to infrastructure maintenance in the region. Had we not experienced this downtime, we would have eclipsed the high end of our production guidance range for the quarter. Unfortunately, July production volumes have also been impacted somewhat by outages on Transco for their majority of the month. However, we are confident that we'll be able to keep production levels flat for the second quarter, based on our plans on placing 12 wells on production during the third quarter. 
On the operations front, our drilling team continues to capture more efficiency gains, which was evident by new record for drilling days during the quarter of approximately 9 days for spud to TD and 13 days for spud to spud. We also drilled our longest Marcellus well to date, with a total measured depth of over 18,000 feet, and a lateral length of over 10,000 feet, which is scheduled to be completed in 2017.
A brief comment on our Eagle Ford shale. Despite a significant reduction in our Eagle Ford operating activity, including no wells drilled and only 3 wells completed during the quarter, our oil volumes for the second quarter exceeded our guidance due to outperformance from the newer wells that were placed on production. Given that our last Eagle Ford well was placed on production in May, we are not placing any wells on production during the third quarter. We are forecasting declines in our oil production volumes for the remainder of the year, which is in line with our original plan. At this point in time, based on our current outlook and oil prices, our plan is to continue to allocate a minimal amount of capital to our Eagle Ford assets and instead, focus on arresting base declines, meeting our leasehold obligations and waiting for a slightly higher oil price environment before allocating any additional capital to this asset. I would highlight that even in today's prices, our returns in Eagle Ford far exceed our cost of capital, but given the much higher returns we see in the Marcellus, we believe the best place for additional capital today is in Susquehanna County. As you may all be aware, Cabot is directly involved with multiple pipeline ventures that focus on our growth opportunities over the next several years. 
I would like to provide a few updates and comments on the progress of these important infrastructure projects since our last call. Regarding Constitution, our initial [indiscernible] was filed on July 12, 2016, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, including -- included in this brief is a very comprehensive summary of the issues we found regarding the New York DEC water quality application process  and additionally outlines the schedule for the appeal process. Together, this brief should answer the majority of your questions concerning Constitution. We have made progress as well with Atlantic Sunrise during early March. The FERC issued a scheduling notice for Atlantic Sunrise and on May 5, 2016, issued the draft environmental statement. Our expectations are to receive the final environmental impact statement during October, and to remain on schedule for a late 2017 in service. For the Tennessee gas pipeline [indiscernible] project, the FERC also issued their scheduling notice for environmental review during June and indicated that the final environmental assessment would be issued by mid August, 2016. This $135 million per day project remains on schedule for a June 18 in-service date. Also of note was the recent issuance of the draft environmental impact statement by the FERC on the 1 Bcf a day [indiscernible] project. The final EIS is scheduled for mid-December, and this project remains on schedule for late '18. As a reminder, Cabot has $150 million a day committed to the [indiscernible] project. 
Moving on to our recent announcements of [indiscernible] energy center power facility. We're very excited to be the exclusive provider of up to 240 million cubic foot a day to Pennsylvania's natural gas facility in one of the most efficient power plants in the U.S. Together with our previous announcement to provide 100% of the natural gas requirements the Moxie Freedom plan, Cabot will be providing more than 400 million cubic foot a day to local demand projects. Both facilities are essentially tied into our gathering system, eliminating the need to commit to expensive long-term FTE agreements. And our pricing terms, although confidential, provide very attractive rates of returns with net backs that are expected to be materially better than our anticipated net backs in the local region. Assuming a gross exit rate for this year of approximately 2 Bcf per day, we have line of sight to double our production to over 4 Bcf per day, assuming all of the announced projects are approved and built. For all the Constitution naysayers out there, while we're still extremely confident that the project is ultimately constructed, even without Constitution volumes, we still have direct line of sight to have the ability to produce over 3.5 Bcf per day by the end of 2018, which is effectively double the production levels we average during the second quarter. Not to mention our marketing team continues to evaluate additional projects that would all be incremental to the numbers I just discussed.
Our outlook comment. As a result of continued efficiency gains and incremental cost savings, the company plans to complete an additional 15 to 20 Marcellus wells was during the second half of the year, and will also incur an additional $20 million of capital. The production impact of accelerated Marcellus completions will not be realized until early 2017, therefore, we're leaving our current '16 production guidance unchanged. While our plan for '17 are still being evaluated and our official budget will not be announced until October, I can say that measured growth in the 5% to 10% range in '17 is a prudent and reasonable assumption and based on today's outlook, we would generate even more positive cash flow next year than we will this year. When you look at Cabot's story over the next several years, I see a company with a strong balance sheet that continues to get better, best-in-class economics that continue to improve, cash margins that are expected to almost double by 2018 at this current strip, a growth outlook that allows for a doubling of Marcellus production volumes once the majority of our infrastructure is in service and a significant level of free cash flow accumulated during the period of time, providing optionality for program acceleration, dividend announcement, share buyback, balance sheet management, et cetera. Needless to say, the outlook for Cabot is certainly bright and I look forward to providing more details about our long-term plans in October. 
Ericson, with that brief statement, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

We put together or I should say the process of putting together a 5-year model, we'll present this 5-year plan to our board in October. In discussions with that model, when you look at our organic program, what we are able to achieve with the assumptions that we placed in there on commodity pricing. And then we also look at the available opportunities out there and also just our own internal ideas of what we might be able to do different to enhance long-term shareholder value and that's a continuing discussion we have in our board meeting, not only in every board meeting, but we also have an off-site meeting that many are aware, in September, that is a strategic discussion at a 30,000-foot level. The macro market, the movements in the market, strengths of the market, opportunities in the market, to see how we can continue to enhance shareholder value. So we have not been an acquisitive company, but we have been a company that continues to evaluate the opportunities that are out there and the asset basis and/or in some cases, the corporate companies that have possible needs and their future to do something different. So we haven't made any decisions, but we do evaluate the market."

We have I think demonstrated with our plan how we're running the company and what we have done and trying to rationalize our growth and measured growth is what we have provided. We do that because we are trying to maximize our return in a soft commodity price environment and we're certainly trying to look at the market in a macro sense to determine what we think best -- our input into the market and how we think that would best maintain the margins and strength of Cabot. So when you look at the M&A market, diversity is one of those areas that we discuss, not only geographic diversity, but also commodity diversity. We look at that in a way that compares what we have in our organic program, the risk of execution of our organic program and how we might be able to enhance the valuations, the return profile in our program if, in fact, we had a bolt on, we had a new greenfield operation or we had a merge opportunity out there. And to your point, what we see on a term profile with every dollar that Cabot invests, it does challenge us to look at the market out there, to look at other assets and to be able to say that we are prepared to displace any capital allocated to our Marcellus and allocate elsewhere. And when we don't get comfortable with that, in essence, dilution, in that investment, in that context, we do look at the infrastructure buildout, we know we have a significant growth profile coming for Cabot and it's just around the corner. It's now not measured in years, it's measured in months of when we're going to see that. So our focus is more internally right now to get our program lined up and to be prepared to grow into that market, double our production or greater and do that as efficiently as we can."

The options keep getting better, the volumes are more to our liking. The durations are more to our liking. And so we're watching this capacity release market very closely and as we get further into the year, we find that there's more producers or I should call them producers, shippers that aren't using their capacity. It's quite dynamical, it's something that we think, at some point, we will pick up some additional capacity just bridges the cap -- excuse me, bridges the gap over to closer to 2018.

I have today with me several members of the executive team. 
Before we start, let me do say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward-looking statements included in this morning's press release applies to my comments on today's call. 
Cabot's second quarter results highlight our ability to deliver production growth while also generating positive free cash flow even in a low commodity price environment. We believe this characteristic sets us apart for most of our industry peers. 
Cabot averaged 1.67 Bcfe per day of net production during the quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015. This increase was driven by 14% increase in our Marcellus production volumes as compared to the prior year comparable quarter. Despite a realized natural gas price of only $1.63 per Mcf, we generated positive free cash flow for the quarter, and we anticipate that the company will be able to deliver a more meaningful level of free cash flow during the second half of the year based on current strip prices.
Natural gas realizations did improve by 9% sequentially as compared to the first quarter of the year, due in part to a significant improvement in local basis differential during the quarter. Before the impact of derivatives, Cabot's realizations were $0.40 below the average NYMEX settle price of $1.95 during the quarter as compared to $0.60 below the average NYMEX settlement price in the first quarter. While basis differentials have subsequently widened in the third quarter due to a significant increase in the NYMEX prices, the good news is that we are forecasting much higher price realizations during the second half of the year, resulting in more free cash flow for the year than originally forecast. This increase in expected cash flows has allowed for the introduction of a second frac crew in the Marcellus for a portion of the second half of the year, which will help give us a jump start on 2017 production. 
Using the current 5-year forward curve for Leidy Line, which is a good proxy for the most punitive pricing a portion of our Marcellus production receives, our well level internal rate of returns are over 100%, and our PV-10s are approximately $14 million. I cannot think of another asset that generates those economics in the current price environment, and therefore, we feel extremely comfortable about slightly increasing our levels of operating activity beginning with this additional frac crew. 
The second quarter results also demonstrate our continued emphasis on cost control, with unit costs declining by 12% compared to the prior year comparable quarter and 2% compared to the first quarter of this year. We have now delivered a sequential decline in unit costs for 12 of the last 13 quarters and expect this trend to continue, further improving our industry-leading cost structure. 
Our balance sheet remains extremely strong, with over $500 million of cash on hand and a net debt to EBITDAX ratio of only 1.8x at quarter-end. Based on our current forecast, we anticipate delevering between now and year-end, while our current liquidity of $2.2 billion should continue to improve given our outlook for positive free cash flow in the second half of the year. This financial flexibility will serve as well as we formulate our plans for 2017 and beyond. 
In the Marcellus, we continue to operate one drilling rig, and as mentioned, have recently added a second frac crew to accelerate the completion of our DUC inventory, which will allow for an acceleration of production in the first quarter of 2017. 
During the quarter, we drilled 7 wells, completed 8 wells, and placed 12 wells on production. The average lateral length for the 7 wells drilled during the second quarter was approximately 7,000 feet. However, given that all of the wells, 100% of the wells we placed on production year-to-date, were drilled in '15, and the average lateral length was a little bit shorter and closer to 6,000 feet. The good news is that we should continue improvements in capital efficiency in 2017 as we've began placing on production the longer lateral wells from this year program. 
On the production front, we averaged approximately 1.54 Bcf per day of net production for the Marcellus during the quarter, which was slightly below the midpoint of our expectations due to unscheduled downtime related to infrastructure maintenance in the region. Had we not experienced this downtime, we would have eclipsed the high end of our production guidance range for the quarter. Unfortunately, July production volumes have also been impacted somewhat by outages on Transco for their majority of the month. However, we are confident that we'll be able to keep production levels flat for the second quarter based on our plans on placing 12 wells on production during the third quarter. 
On the operations front, our drilling team continues to capture more efficiency gains, which was evident by new record for drilling days during the quarter of approximately 9 days for spud to TD and 13 days for spud to spud. We also drilled our longest Marcellus well to date with a total measured depth of over 18,000 feet and a lateral length of over 10,000 feet, which is scheduled to be completed in 2017.
A brief comment on our Eagle Ford shale. Despite a significant reduction in our Eagle Ford operating activity, including no wells drilled and only 3 wells completed during the quarter, our oil volumes for the second quarter exceeded our guidance due to outperformance from the newer wells that were placed on production. Given that our last Eagle Ford well was placed on production in May, we are not placing any wells on production during the third quarter. We are forecasting declines in our oil production volumes for the remainder of the year, which is in line with our original plan. At this point in time, based on our current outlook on oil prices, our plan is to continue to allocate a minimal amount of capital to our Eagle Ford assets, and instead, focus on arresting base declines, meeting our leasehold obligations and waiting for a slightly higher oil price environment before allocating any additional capital to this asset. 
I would highlight that even in today's prices, our returns in Eagle Ford far exceed our cost of capital. But given the much higher returns we see in the Marcellus, we believe the best place for additional capital today is in Susquehanna County. 
As you may all be aware, Cabot is directly involved with multiple pipeline ventures that focus on our growth opportunities over the next several years. I would like to provide a few updates and comments on the progress of these important infrastructure projects since our last call. 
Regarding Constitution, our initial appellant brief was filed on July 12, 2016 with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, including -- included in this brief is a very comprehensive summary of the issues we found regarding the New York DEC water quality application process, and additionally outlines the schedule for the appeal process. Together, this brief should answer the majority of your questions concerning Constitution. 
We have made progress as well with Atlantic Sunrise during early March. The FERC issued a scheduling notice for Atlantic Sunrise, and on May 5, 2016, issued the draft environmental impact statement. Our expectations are to receive the final environmental impact statement during October, and to remain on schedule for a late 2017 in service. 
For the Tennessee gas pipeline Orion project, the FERC also issued their scheduling notice for environmental review during June and indicated that the final environmental assessment would be issued by mid August, 2016. This $135 million per day project remains on schedule for a June 18 in-service date. 
Also of note was the recent issuance of the draft environmental impact statement by the FERC on the 1 Bcf a day PennEast project. The final EIS is scheduled for mid-December, and this project remains on schedule for late '18. As a reminder, Cabot has $150 million a day committed to the PennEast project. 
Moving on to our recent announcements of Lackawanna Energy Center power facility. We are very excited to be the exclusive provider of up to 240 million cubic foot a day to Pennsylvania's largest natural gas facility and one of the most efficient power plants in the U.S. Together with our previous announcement to provide 100% of the natural gas requirements to the Moxie Freedom plan, Cabot will be providing more than 400 million cubic foot a day to local demand projects. Both facilities are essentially tied into our gathering system, eliminating the need to commit to expensive long-term FT agreements. 
And our pricing terms, although confidential, provide very attractive rate of returns with netbacks that are expected to be materially better than our anticipated netbacks in the local region. Assuming a gross exit rate for this year of approximately 2 Bcf per day, we have line of sight to double our production to over 4 Bcf per day, assuming all of the announced projects are approved and built. 
For all the Constitution naysayers out there, while we're still extremely confident that the project is ultimately constructed even without Constitution volumes, we still have direct line of sight to have the ability to produce over 3.5 Bcf per day by the end of 2018, which is effectively double the production levels we average during the second quarter. Not to mention, our marketing team continues to evaluate additional projects that would all be incremental to the numbers I just discussed.
And our outlook comment. As a result of continued efficiency gains and incremental cost savings, the company plans to complete an additional 15 to 20 Marcellus wells during the second half of the year and will also incur an additional $20 million of capital. The production impact of accelerated Marcellus completions will not be realized until early 2017, therefore, we're leaving our current '16 production guidance unchanged. 
While our plan for '17 are still being evaluated and our official budget will not be announced until October, I can say that measured growth in the 5% to 10% range in '17 is a prudent and reasonable assumption. And based on today's outlook, we would generate even more positive free cash flow next year than we will this year. 
When you look at Cabot's story over the next several years, I see a company with a strong balance sheet that continues to get better, best-in-class economics that continue to improve, cash margins that are expected to almost double by 2018 at this current strip, a growth outlook that allows for a doubling of Marcellus production volumes once the majority of our infrastructure is in service and a significant level of free cash flow accumulated during the period of time, providing optionality for program acceleration, dividend enhancement, share buyback, balance sheet management, et cetera. 
Needless to say, the outlook for Cabot is certainly bright, and I look forward to providing more details about our long-term plans in October. 
Ericson, with that brief statement, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

And to your point, what we receive on a term profile with every dollar that Cabot invests, it does challenge us to look at the market out there, to look at other assets and to be able to say that we are prepared to displace any capital allocated to our Marcellus and allocate elsewhere. And when we don't get comfortable with that, in essence, dilution of that investment in that context, we do look at the infrastructure build-out, we know we have a significant growth profile coming for Cabot, and it's just around the corner. It's now not measured really in years. It's measured in months of when we're going to see that. So our focus is more internally, right now, to get our program lined up and to be prepared to grow into that market, double our production or greater and do that as efficiently as we can."

Diversifying our commodity a little bit more to power from gas, and being in the local PJM area, as you mentioned, it's our benefit to link some power pricing to our gas prices. So the benefit of these 2 particular projects are unique in that, as Dan mentioned in the speech, that we -- literally, no FT that we had to buy to get there. So we're all of a sudden, out of the gate, we're $0.50 to $0.60 better than having to purchase long-term liability FT to get to these power plants. That said, the pricing for the power plants -- a small portion of each one of these plants is local pricing because power plants, generally, just buy gas, daily gas. So a small percentage of that load is related to local gas, daily pricing. However, what we've done is set arbitrary floors and caps under the agreement that protect Cabot and also protect the power generator, and we fluctuate between those floors and caps based on day forward power prices or at least a percent of day forward power price. And that enables, essentially, the generator and for Cabot to win. And it's just a -- that's a great structure for everyone."

And if you think about that, you say real quick, it's not that difficult. I have Phil Stalnaker sitting over here beside me, and he squirms every day when we look out at the end of '18, which is not that far out in front of us. And it's his group that is less than 100 people out there and -- but with some excellent rock, his job is to manage the economic growth of our operation out there and to build into this infrastructure. Now ideally, we were hoping what happen is Constitution would have come on by now, and as everybody knows the pains of that process. But we've stacked these other infrastructure projects in line now. But the good news is they're all going to happen, but they're going to happen kind of on top of each other and contemporaneous, which does require us to start out ahead of that ramp-up in a way that would have some of the decisions we're making today in preparation for what we expect to be able to build into as these projects come online. So we like the dynamics of where the market is, and we certainly like the better pricing we see. For example, to your point, in the first quarter of '17, that's all good. And certainly, we'll be in that space to benefit from it, but we were looking at more of a long-term build and getting up to the 3.5, 4 Bcf production range towards the end of '18."

So absolutely, that's a standout project for us. As we move down the list, it's interesting that the next 4 projects that we have, and in total, these all add up to about 1.5 Bcf a day. Just make one comment, the good news is, on the 1.5, all the 50,000 a day is already placed and sold to very good markets. So in terms of ranking or just how excited we are about these projects over the next 18 months, both power plant facilities are way up there on the list: good markets, no transport, ratable burns. I mean, it's very exciting. The TGP Orion project of 135,000 a day, again, 100% of that gas is sold. And it's going to South Jersey to a power plant that they're going to operate in the southern part of New Jersey. Great pricing there. And then the PennEast Pipeline, that pipeline is 1 Bcf a day, and we have 100,000 sold already and 50,000 of capacity. But keep in mind, the impact of a PennEast or the impact of Atlantic Sunrise, what that's going to do to basis differentials on Transco? As you start moving, a lot of gas off that pipe, a lot of gas out of our supplier, where our expectations are that pricing raises differentials both on Tennessee and on Transco are going to improve. I mean, there's just -- there is no doubt in my mind. So not only do we have all these projects take away to the region, and you know a rising tide lifts all ships.

I have today with me several members of the executive team. 
Before we start, let me do say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward-looking statements included in this morning's press release applies to my comments on today's call. 
Cabot's second quarter results highlight our ability to deliver production growth while also generating positive free cash flow even in a low commodity price environment. We believe this characteristic sets us apart for most of our industry peers. 
Cabot averaged 1.67 Bcfe per day of net production during the quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015. This increase was driven by 14% increase in our Marcellus production volumes as compared to the prior year comparable quarter. Despite a realized natural gas price of only $1.63 per Mcf, we generated positive free cash flow for the quarter, and we anticipate that the company will be able to deliver a more meaningful level of free cash flow during the second half of the year based on current strip prices.
Natural gas realizations did improve by 9% sequentially as compared to the first quarter of the year, due in part to a significant improvement in local basis differential during the quarter. Before the impact of derivatives, Cabot's realizations were $0.40 below the average NYMEX settle price of $1.95 during the quarter as compared to $0.60 below the average NYMEX settlement price in the first quarter. While basis differentials have subsequently widened in the third quarter due to a significant increase in the NYMEX prices, the good news is that we are forecasting much higher price realizations during the second half of the year, resulting in more free cash flow for the year than originally forecast. This increase in expected cash flows has allowed for the introduction of a second frac crew in the Marcellus for a portion of the second half of the year, which will help give us a jump start on 2017 production. 
Using the current 5-year forward curve for Leidy Line, which is a good proxy for the most punitive pricing a portion of our Marcellus production receives, our well level internal rate of returns are over 100%, and our PV-10s are approximately $14 million. I cannot think of another asset that generates those economics in the current price environment, and therefore, we feel extremely comfortable about slightly increasing our levels of operating activity beginning with this additional frac crew. 
The second quarter results also demonstrate our continued emphasis on cost control, with unit costs declining by 12% compared to the prior year comparable quarter and 2% compared to the first quarter of this year. We have now delivered a sequential decline in unit costs for 12 of the last 13 quarters and expect this trend to continue, further improving our industry-leading cost structure. 
Our balance sheet remains extremely strong, with over $500 million of cash on hand and a net debt to EBITDAX ratio of only 1.8x at quarter-end. Based on our current forecast, we anticipate delevering between now and year-end, while our current liquidity of $2.2 billion should continue to improve given our outlook for positive free cash flow in the second half of the year. This financial flexibility will serve us well as we formulate our plans for 2017 and beyond. 
In the Marcellus, we continue to operate one drilling rig, and as mentioned, have recently added a second frac crew to accelerate the completion of our DUC inventory, which will allow for an acceleration of production in the first quarter of 2017. 
During the quarter, we drilled 7 wells, completed 8 wells, and placed 12 wells on production. The average lateral length for the 7 wells drilled during the second quarter was approximately 7,000 feet. However, given that all of the wells, 100% of the wells we placed on production year-to-date, were drilled in '15, and the average lateral length was a little bit shorter and closer to 6,000 feet. The good news is that we should continue improvements in capital efficiency in 2017 as we've began placing all production on the longer lateral wells from this year program. 
On the production front, we averaged approximately 1.54 Bcf per day of net production for the Marcellus during the quarter, which was slightly below the midpoint of our expectations due to unscheduled downtime related to infrastructure maintenance in the region. Had we not experienced this downtime, we would have eclipsed the high end of our production guidance range for the quarter. Unfortunately, July production volumes have also been impacted somewhat by outages on Transco for the majority of the month. However, we are confident that we'll be able to keep production levels flat for the second quarter based on our plans on placing 12 wells on production during the third quarter. 
On the operations front, our drilling team continues to capture more efficiency gains, which was evident by new record for drilling days during the quarter of approximately 9 days for spud to TD and 13 days for spud to spud. We also drilled our longest Marcellus well to date with a total measured depth of over 18,000 feet and a lateral length of over 10,000 feet, which is scheduled to be completed in 2017.
A brief comment on our Eagle Ford shale. Despite a significant reduction in our Eagle Ford operating activity, including no wells drilled and only 3 wells completed during the quarter, our oil volumes for the second quarter exceeded our guidance due to outperformance from the newer wells that were placed on production. Given that our last Eagle Ford well was placed on production in May, we are not placing any wells on production during the third quarter. We are forecasting declines in our oil production volumes for the remainder of the year, which is in line with our original plan. At this point in time, based on our current outlook on oil prices, our plan is to continue to allocate a minimal amount of capital to our Eagle Ford assets, and instead, focus on arresting base declines, meeting our leasehold obligations and waiting for a slightly higher oil price environment before allocating any additional capital to this asset. 
I would highlight that even in today's prices, our returns in Eagle Ford far exceed our cost of capital. But given the much higher returns we see in the Marcellus, we believe the best place for additional capital today is in Susquehanna County. 
As you may all be aware, Cabot is directly involved with multiple pipeline ventures that focus on our growth opportunities over the next several years. I would like to provide a few updates and comments on the progress of these important infrastructure projects since our last call. 
Regarding Constitution, our initial appellant brief was filed on July 12, 2016 with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, including -- included in this brief is a very comprehensive summary of the issues we found regarding the New York DEC water quality application process, and additionally outlines the schedule for the appeal process. Together, this brief should answer the majority of your questions concerning Constitution. 
We have made progress as well with Atlantic Sunrise during early March. The FERC issued a scheduling notice for Atlantic Sunrise, and on May 5, 2016, issued the draft environmental impact statement. Our expectations are to receive the final environmental impact statement during October, and to remain on schedule for a late 2017 in-service. 
For the Tennessee gas pipeline Orion project, the FERC also issued their scheduling notice for environmental review during June and indicated that the final environmental assessment would be issued by mid August, 2016. This $135 million per day project remains on schedule for a June 18 in-service date. 
Also of note was the recent issuance of the draft environmental impact statement by the FERC on the 1 Bcf a day PennEast project. The final EIS is scheduled for mid-December, and this project remains on schedule for late '18. As a reminder, Cabot has $150 million a day committed to the PennEast project. 
Moving on to our recent announcements of Lackawanna Energy Center power facility. We are very excited to be the exclusive provider of up to 240 million cubic foot a day to Pennsylvania's largest natural gas facility and one of the most efficient power plants in the U.S. Together with our previous announcement to provide 100% of the natural gas requirements to the Moxie Freedom plan, Cabot will be providing more than 400 million cubic foot a day to local demand projects. Both facilities are essentially tied into our gathering system, eliminating the need to commit to expensive long-term FT agreements. 
And our pricing terms, although confidential, provide very attractive rates of returns with netbacks that are expected to be materially better than our anticipated netbacks in the local region. Assuming a gross exit rate for this year of approximately 2 Bcf per day, we have line of sight to double our production to over 4 Bcf per day, assuming all of the announced projects are approved and built. 
For all the Constitution naysayers out there, while we're still extremely confident that the project is ultimately constructed even without Constitution volumes, we still have direct line of sight to have the ability to produce over 3.5 Bcf per day by the end of 2018, which is effectively double the production levels we average during the second quarter. Not to mention, our marketing team continues to evaluate additional projects that would all be incremental to the numbers I just discussed.
And our outlook comment. As a result of continued efficiency gains and incremental cost savings, the company plans to complete an additional 15 to 20 Marcellus wells during the second half of the year and will also incur an additional $20 million of capital. The production impact of accelerated Marcellus completions will not be realized until early 2017, therefore, we're leaving our current '16 production guidance unchanged. 
While our plan for '17 are still being evaluated and our official budget will not be announced until October, I can say that measured growth in the 5% to 10% range in '17 is a prudent and reasonable assumption. And based on today's outlook, we would generate even more positive free cash flow next year than we will this year. 
When you look at Cabot's story over the next several years, I see a company with a strong balance sheet that continues to get better, best-in-class economics that continue to improve, cash margins that are expected to almost double by 2018 at this current strip, a growth outlook that allows for a doubling of Marcellus production volumes once the majority of our infrastructure is in service and a significant level of free cash flow accumulated during the period of time, providing optionality for program acceleration, dividend enhancement, share buyback, balance sheet management, et cetera. 
Needless to say, the outlook for Cabot is certainly bright, and I look forward to providing more details about our long-term plans in October. 
Ericson, with that brief statement, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

We have, I think, demonstrated with our plan, how we're running the company and what we have done and trying to rationalize our growth and measured growth is what we have provided. We do that because we are trying to maximize our return in a soft commodity price environment, and we're certainly trying to look at the market in a macro sense to determine what we think best -- our input into the market and how we think that would best maintain the margins and strength of Cabot. So when you look at the M&A market, diversity is one of those areas that we discuss, not only geographic diversity, but also commodity diversity. We look at that in a way that compares what we have in our organic program, the risk of execution of our organic program and how we might be able to enhance the valuations, the return profile in our program if, in fact, we had a bolt-on, we had a new greenfield operation or we had a merge opportunity out there. And to your point, what we receive on a term profile with every dollar that Cabot invests, it does challenge us to look at the market out there, to look at other assets and to be able to say that we are prepared to displace any capital allocated to our Marcellus and allocate elsewhere. And when we don't get comfortable with that, in essence, dilution of that investment in that context, we do look at the infrastructure build-out, we know we have a significant growth profile coming for Cabot, and it's just around the corner. It's now not measured really in years. It's measured in months of when we're going to see that. So our focus is more internally, right now, to get our program lined up and to be prepared to grow into that market, double our production or greater and do that as efficiently as we can."

We're pretty happy we didn't pull the trigger back in February on a number of these capacity deals. The -- quite frankly, the rates keep improving. The options keep getting better. The volumes are more to our liking. The durations are more to our liking. And so we're watching this capacity release market very closely. And as we get further into the year, we find that there's more producers -- or I should call them producers/shippers that aren't using their capacity. And it's quite dynamic, but it's something that we think, at some point, we will pick up some additional capacity that just bridges the cap -- excuse me, bridges the gap over to -- closer to 2018. So a lot of options right now, and I think the -- there are really good options to improve netbacks."

And we have -- we're -- first of all, we're very, very happy to be with our partners in the power generation business. Diversifying our commodity a little bit more to power from gas, and being in the local PJM area, as you mentioned, it's our benefit to link some power pricing to our gas prices. So the benefit of these 2 particular projects are unique in that, as Dan mentioned in the speech, that we -- literally, no FT that we had to buy to get there. So we're all of a sudden, out of the gate, we're $0.50 to $0.60 better than having to purchase long-term liability FT to get to these power plants. That said, the pricing for the power plants -- a small portion of each one of these plants is local pricing because power plants, generally, just buy gas, daily gas. So a small percentage of that load is related to local gas, daily pricing. However, what we've done is set arbitrary floors and caps under the agreement that protect Cabot and also protect the power generator, and we fluctuate between those floors and caps based on day forward power prices or at least a percent of day forward power price. And that enables, essentially, the generator and for Cabot to win. And it's just a -- that's a great structure for everyone."

And if you think about that, you say real quick, it's not that difficult. I have Phil Stalnaker sitting over here beside me, and he squirms every day when we look out at the end of '18, which is not that far out in front of us. And it's his group that is less than 100 people out there and -- but with some excellent rock, his job is to manage the economic growth of our operation out there and to build into this infrastructure. Now ideally, we were hoping what happen is Constitution would have come on by now, and as everybody knows the pains of that process. But we've stacked these other infrastructure projects in line now. But the good news is they're all going to happen, but they're going to happen kind of on top of each other and contemporaneous, which does require us to start out ahead of that ramp-up in a way that would have some of the decisions we're making today in preparation for what we expect to be able to build into as these projects come online. So we like the dynamics of where the market is, and we certainly like the better pricing we see. For example, to your point, in the first quarter of '17, that's all good. And certainly, we'll be in that space to benefit from it, but we were looking at more of a long-term build and getting up to the 3.5, 4 Bcf production range towards the end of '18."

So absolutely, that's a standout project for us. As we move down the list, it's interesting that the next 4 projects that we have, and in total, these all add up to about 1.5 Bcf a day. Just make one comment, the good news is, on the 1.5, all the 50,000 a day is already placed and sold to very good markets. So in terms of ranking or just how excited we are about these projects over the next 18 months, both power plant facilities are way up there on the list: good markets, no transport, ratable burns. I mean, it's very exciting. The TGP Orion project of 135,000 a day, again, 100% of that gas is sold. And it's going to South Jersey to a power plant that they're going to operate in the southern part of New Jersey. Great pricing there. And then the PennEast Pipeline, that pipeline is 1 Bcf a day, and we have 100,000 sold already and 50,000 of capacity. But keep in mind, the impact of a PennEast or the impact of Atlantic Sunrise, what that's going to do to basis differentials on Transco? As you start moving, a lot of gas off that pipe, a lot of gas out of our supplier, where our expectations are that pricing raises differentials both on Tennessee and on Transco are going to improve. I mean, there's just -- there is no doubt in my mind. So not only do we have all these projects take away to the region, and you know a rising tide lifts all ships.

I have today with me several members of the executive team. 
Before we start, let me do say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward-looking statements included in this morning's press release applies to my comments on today's call. 
Cabot's second quarter results highlight our ability to deliver production growth while also generating positive free cash flow even in a low commodity price environment. We believe this characteristic sets us apart for most of our industry peers. 
Cabot averaged 1.67 Bcfe per day of net production during the quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015. This increase was driven by 14% increase in our Marcellus production volumes as compared to the prior year comparable quarter. Despite a realized natural gas price of only $1.63 per Mcf, we generated positive free cash flow for the quarter, and we anticipate that the company will be able to deliver a more meaningful level of free cash flow during the second half of the year based on current strip prices.
Natural gas realizations did improve by 9% sequentially as compared to the first quarter of the year, due in part to a significant improvement in local basis differential during the quarter. Before the impact of derivatives, Cabot's realizations were $0.40 below the average NYMEX settle price of $1.95 during the quarter as compared to $0.60 below the average NYMEX settlement price in the first quarter. While basis differentials have subsequently widened in the third quarter due to a significant increase in the NYMEX prices, the good news is that we are forecasting much higher price realizations during the second half of the year, resulting in more free cash flow for the year than originally forecast. This increase in expected cash flows has allowed for the introduction of a second frac crew in the Marcellus for a portion of the second half of the year, which will help give us a jump start on 2017 production. 
Using the current 5-year forward curve for Leidy Line, which is a good proxy for the most punitive pricing a portion of our Marcellus production receives, our well level internal rate of returns are over 100%, and our PV-10s are approximately $14 million. I cannot think of another asset that generates those economics in the current price environment, and therefore, we feel extremely comfortable about slightly increasing our levels of operating activity beginning with this additional frac crew. 
The second quarter results also demonstrate our continued emphasis on cost control, with unit costs declining by 12% compared to the prior year comparable quarter and 2% compared to the first quarter of this year. We have now delivered a sequential decline in unit costs for 12 of the last 13 quarters and expect this trend to continue, further improving our industry-leading cost structure. 
Our balance sheet remains extremely strong, with over $500 million of cash on hand and a net debt to EBITDAX ratio of only 1.8x at quarter-end. Based on our current forecast, we anticipate delevering between now and year-end, while our current liquidity of $2.2 billion should continue to improve given our outlook for positive free cash flow in the second half of the year. This financial flexibility will serve us well as we formulate our plans for 2017 and beyond. 
In the Marcellus, we continue to operate one drilling rig, and as mentioned, have recently added a second frac crew to accelerate the completion of our DUC inventory, which will allow for an acceleration of production in the first quarter of 2017. 
During the quarter, we drilled 7 wells, completed 8 wells, and placed 12 wells on production. The average lateral length for the 7 wells drilled during the second quarter was approximately 7,000 feet. However, given that all of the wells, 100% of the wells we placed on production year-to-date, were drilled in '15, and the average lateral length was a little bit shorter and closer to 6,000 feet. The good news is that we should continue improvements in capital efficiency in 2017 as we've began placing all production on the longer lateral wells from this year program. 
On the production front, we averaged approximately 1.54 Bcf per day of net production for the Marcellus during the quarter, which was slightly below the midpoint of our expectations due to unscheduled downtime related to infrastructure maintenance in the region. Had we not experienced this downtime, we would have eclipsed the high end of our production guidance range for the quarter. Unfortunately, July production volumes have also been impacted somewhat by outages on Transco for the majority of the month. However, we are confident that we'll be able to keep production levels flat for the second quarter based on our plans on placing 12 wells on production during the third quarter. 
On the operations front, our drilling team continues to capture more efficiency gains, which was evident by new record for drilling days during the quarter of approximately 9 days for spud to TD and 13 days for spud to spud. We also drilled our longest Marcellus well to date with a total measured depth of over 18,000 feet and a lateral length of over 10,000 feet, which is scheduled to be completed in 2017.
A brief comment on our Eagle Ford shale. Despite a significant reduction in our Eagle Ford operating activity, including no wells drilled and only 3 wells completed during the quarter, our oil volumes for the second quarter exceeded our guidance due to outperformance from the newer wells that were placed on production. Given that our last Eagle Ford well was placed on production in May, we are not placing any wells on production during the third quarter. We are forecasting declines in our oil production volumes for the remainder of the year, which is in line with our original plan. At this point in time, based on our current outlook on oil prices, our plan is to continue to allocate a minimal amount of capital to our Eagle Ford assets, and instead, focus on arresting base declines, meeting our leasehold obligations and waiting for a slightly higher oil price environment before allocating any additional capital to this asset. 
I would highlight that even in today's prices, our returns in Eagle Ford far exceed our cost of capital. But given the much higher returns we see in the Marcellus, we believe the best place for additional capital today is in Susquehanna County. 
As you may all be aware, Cabot is directly involved with multiple pipeline ventures that focus on our growth opportunities over the next several years. I would like to provide a few updates and comments on the progress of these important infrastructure projects since our last call. 
Regarding Constitution, our initial appellant brief was filed on July 12, 2016 with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, including -- included in this brief is a very comprehensive summary of the issues we found regarding the New York DEC water quality application process, and additionally outlines the schedule for the appeal process. Together, this brief should answer the majority of your questions concerning Constitution. 
We have made progress as well with Atlantic Sunrise during early March. The FERC issued a scheduling notice for Atlantic Sunrise, and on May 5, 2016, issued the draft environmental impact statement. Our expectations are to receive the final environmental impact statement during October, and to remain on schedule for a late 2017 in-service. 
For the Tennessee gas pipeline Orion project, the FERC also issued their scheduling notice for environmental review during June and indicated that the final environmental assessment would be issued by mid August, 2016. This $135 million per day project remains on schedule for a June 18 in-service date. 
Also of note was the recent issuance of the draft environmental impact statement by the FERC on the 1 Bcf a day PennEast project. The final EIS is scheduled for mid-December, and this project remains on schedule for late '18. As a reminder, Cabot has $150 million a day committed to the PennEast project. 
Moving on to our recent announcements of Lackawanna Energy Center power facility. We are very excited to be the exclusive provider of up to 240 million cubic foot a day to Pennsylvania's largest natural gas facility and one of the most efficient power plants in the U.S. Together with our previous announcement to provide 100% of the natural gas requirements to the Moxie Freedom plan, Cabot will be providing more than 400 million cubic foot a day to local demand projects. Both facilities are essentially tied into our gathering system, eliminating the need to commit to expensive long-term FT agreements. 
And our pricing terms, although confidential, provide very attractive rates of returns with netbacks that are expected to be materially better than our anticipated netbacks in the local region. Assuming a gross exit rate for this year of approximately 2 Bcf per day, we have line of sight to double our production to over 4 Bcf per day, assuming all of the announced projects are approved and built. 
For all the Constitution naysayers out there, while we're still extremely confident that the project is ultimately constructed even without Constitution volumes, we still have direct line of sight to have the ability to produce over 3.5 Bcf per day by the end of 2018, which is effectively double the production levels we average during the second quarter. Not to mention, our marketing team continues to evaluate additional projects that would all be incremental to the numbers I just discussed.
And our outlook comment. As a result of continued efficiency gains and incremental cost savings, the company plans to complete an additional 15 to 20 Marcellus wells during the second half of the year and will also incur an additional $20 million of capital. The production impact of accelerated Marcellus completions will not be realized until early 2017, therefore, we're leaving our current '16 production guidance unchanged. 
While our plan for '17 are still being evaluated and our official budget will not be announced until October, I can say that measured growth in the 5% to 10% range in '17 is a prudent and reasonable assumption. And based on today's outlook, we would generate even more positive free cash flow next year than we will this year. 
When you look at Cabot's story over the next several years, I see a company with a strong balance sheet that continues to get better, best-in-class economics that continue to improve, cash margins that are expected to almost double by 2018 at this current strip, a growth outlook that allows for a doubling of Marcellus production volumes once the majority of our infrastructure is in service and a significant level of free cash flow accumulated during the period of time, providing optionality for program acceleration, dividend enhancement, share buyback, balance sheet management, et cetera. 
Needless to say, the outlook for Cabot is certainly bright, and I look forward to providing more details about our long-term plans in October. 
Ericson, with that brief statement, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

And then we also look at the available opportunities out there and also just our own internal ideas of what we might be able to do different to enhance long-term shareholder value. And that's a continuing discussion we have in our board meeting, not only in every board meeting, but we also have an off-site meeting, many are aware, in September. That is a strategic discussion at the 30,000-foot level, the macro market, the movements in the market, strengths of the market, opportunities in the market to see how we can continue to enhance shareholder value. So we have not been an acquisitive company, but we have been a company that continues to evaluate the opportunities that are out there and the asset basis and/or, in some cases, the corporate companies that have possible needs and their future to do something different. So we haven't made any decisions, but we do evaluate the market."

We have, I think, demonstrated with our plan, how we're running the company and what we have done and trying to rationalize our growth and measured growth is what we have provided. We do that because we are trying to maximize our return in a soft commodity price environment, and we're certainly trying to look at the market in a macro sense to determine what we think best -- our input into the market and how we think that would best maintain the margins and strength of Cabot. So when you look at the M&A market, diversity is one of those areas that we discuss, not only geographic diversity, but also commodity diversity. We look at that in a way that compares what we have in our organic program, the risk of execution of our organic program and how we might be able to enhance the valuations, the return profile in our program if, in fact, we had a bolt-on, we had a new greenfield operation or we had a merge opportunity out there. And to your point, what we receive on a term profile with every dollar that Cabot invests, it does challenge us to look at the market out there, to look at other assets and to be able to say that we are prepared to displace any capital allocated to our Marcellus and allocate elsewhere. And when we don't get comfortable with that, in essence, dilution of that investment in that context, we do look at the infrastructure build-out, we know we have a significant growth profile coming for Cabot, and it's just around the corner. It's now not measured really in years. It's measured in months of when we're going to see that. So our focus is more internally, right now, to get our program lined up and to be prepared to grow into that market, double our production or greater and do that as efficiently as we can."

The volumes are more to our liking. The durations are more to our liking. And so we're watching this capacity release market very closely. And as we get further into the year, we find that there's more producers -- or I should call them producers/shippers that aren't using their capacity. And it's quite dynamic, but it's something that we think, at some point, we will pick up some additional capacity that just bridges the cap -- excuse me, bridges the gap over to -- closer to 2018.

And we have -- we're -- first of all, we're very, very happy to be with our partners in the power generation business. Diversifying our commodity a little bit more to power from gas, and being in the local PJM area, as you mentioned, it's our benefit to link some power pricing to our gas prices. So the benefit of these 2 particular projects are unique in that, as Dan mentioned in the speech, that we -- literally, no FT that we had to buy to get there. So we're all of a sudden, out of the gate, we're $0.50 to $0.60 better than having to purchase long-term liability FT to get to these power plants. That said, the pricing for the power plants -- a small portion of each one of these plants is local pricing because power plants, generally, just buy gas, daily gas. So a small percentage of that load is related to local gas, daily pricing. However, what we've done is set arbitrary floors and caps under the agreement that protect Cabot and also protect the power generator, and we fluctuate between those floors and caps based on day forward power prices or at least a percent of day forward power price. And that enables, essentially, the generator and for Cabot to win. And it's just a -- that's a great structure for everyone."

And if you think about that, you say real quick, it's not that difficult. I have Phil Stalnaker sitting over here beside me, and he squirms every day when we look out at the end of '18, which is not that far out in front of us. And it's his group that is less than 100 people out there and -- but with some excellent rock, his job is to manage the economic growth of our operation out there and to build into this infrastructure. Now ideally, we were hoping what happen is Constitution would have come on by now, and as everybody knows the pains of that process. But we've stacked these other infrastructure projects in line now. But the good news is they're all going to happen, but they're going to happen kind of on top of each other and contemporaneous, which does require us to start out ahead of that ramp-up in a way that would have some of the decisions we're making today in preparation for what we expect to be able to build into as these projects come online. So we like the dynamics of where the market is, and we certainly like the better pricing we see. For example, to your point, in the first quarter of '17, that's all good. And certainly, we'll be in that space to benefit from it, but we were looking at more of a long-term build and getting up to the 3.5, 4 Bcf production range towards the end of '18."

The Atlantic Sunrise project is a big project in anyone's eyes. The scope is large, and the good news there is 850,000 a day of new capacity with a brand-new pipe coming into our backyard, but also 100% on the 850,000 a day of gas is sold and sold to 2 very good markets in -- to Cove Point LNG with Sumitomo, and of course Washington Gas Light in the D.C. area. So absolutely, that's a standout project for us. As we move down the list, it's interesting that the next 4 projects that we have, and in total, these all add up to about 1.5 Bcf a day. Just make one comment, the good news is, on the 1.5, all the 50,000 a day is already placed and sold to very good markets. So in terms of ranking or just how excited we are about these projects over the next 18 months, both power plant facilities are way up there on the list: good markets, no transport, ratable burns. I mean, it's very exciting. The TGP Orion project of 135,000 a day, again, 100% of that gas is sold. And it's going to South Jersey to a power plant that they're going to operate in the southern part of New Jersey. Great pricing there. And then the PennEast Pipeline, that pipeline is 1 Bcf a day, and we have 100,000 sold already and 50,000 of capacity. But keep in mind, the impact of a PennEast or the impact of Atlantic Sunrise, what that's going to do to basis differentials on Transco? As you start moving, a lot of gas off that pipe, a lot of gas out of our supplier, where our expectations are that pricing raises differentials both on Tennessee and on Transco are going to improve. I mean, there's just -- there is no doubt in my mind. So not only do we have all these projects take away to the region, and you know a rising tide lifts all ships. And in this case, we expect an upgrade to local pricing on -- connected to all these projects."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Trust that everyone has had the opportunity to review our press release",2276,"Thank you, Gary, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Trust that everyone has had the opportunity to review our press release from this morning. Additionally, we have posted a presentation to our website, something new, that I will directly reference on the call this morning. This presentation highlights our financial and operational results from the quarter, as well as provide an updated outlook for the company's plans for 2017 and beyond. 
However, before we get started, I'd first like to move to Slide 2 of the presentation, which addresses our forward-looking statements. Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectation this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in both the earnings release and this presentation.
Moving on to the third quarter financial highlights on Page 3. Cabot once again generated positive free cash flow for the quarter, while growing equivalent production 6% year-over-year, despite our production being impacted by downstream maintenance projects and unplanned upstream gathering downtime during the quarter. We remain committed to generating return-focused measured growth within cash flow. And this quarter, we successfully executed on this plan. While much has been made recently about a widening of regional differentials, we actually recorded our best pre-hedged natural gas realization since the first quarter of 2015 when the average NYMEX price was $0.17 higher than this past quarter. Our pre-hedge realization of $1.80 per MCF were 7% better than the comparable quarter last year and 16% higher sequentially relative to the second quarter. 
Our cost structure continued to improve during the quarter with cash costs, operating costs declining 13% year-over-year. We expect this trend to continue over the next few years as we leverage our operational scale to further improve our cost structure. Our financial position remains strong with over $500 million of cash on hand, approximately $1.7 billion of available commitments on our undrawn credit facility and a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.9x at quarter end.
Moving on to Slide 4, where we have outlined the significant decline in our drilling and completion costs and our LOE, which is a direct impact of efficiency gains our operational teams had accomplished over the past few years. They have done an outstanding job with this. While it is possible that we could see some upward pressure on service costs, I anticipate that we will continue to see a downward trend in our overall cost structure as we become even more efficient in our operations.
On Slide 5, we have outlined the results of a few reduced space pilots that we have been testing in our Marcellus operating area. This is a interesting area for us. The graphs on this slide represent 4 different pads, where we completed 1 well with our Gen 3 completion design and 1 offset well with our Gen 4 completion design. We have experienced overall a 20% uplift in cumulative production from the Gen-4 wells. As a result, we have decided to implement this completion design for all of our wells, going forward, beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. As we typically do each year, we will wait until our year-end reserve audit before making any changes to our EUR. However, as you can see by the numbers, we are very excited about what this could mean for our industry-leading well productivity going forward.
On Slide 6, we have laid out our capital program for 2017, which includes the program-wide implementation of the Gen 4 completion design in the Marcellus. As we alluded to on the second quarter call, we are targeting 5% to 10% production growth in 2017. This is based on total program spending of $625 million, which includes $575 million at the E&P capital, and another $50 million for our equity investments in the Atlantic Sunrise and Constitution pipelines. $535 million or 93% of E&P capital is earmarked for drilling and completion activity associated with the 70 well -- net wells we plan to drill and the 75 net wells we plan to complete next year. 79% of the drill and complete capital will be directed to the Marcellus, and the remaining 21% will be directed to the Eagle Ford, where the program is focused on maintaining leasehold, holding oil the volumes flat and generating a cash flow neutral operating program. We have allocated $225 million for maintenance capital in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, which is the amount of capital needed to hold our anticipated 2016 exit production flat throughout 2017, and also allows us to meet all our obligatory operating commitments to maintain our leasehold.
This flat production profile for the year would imply growth at the low end of our production growth guidance range. The remaining capital for the year provides the productive capacity needed to meet or exceed the high end of our 2017 guidance range, assuming price realizations are at levels that generate strong return for Cabot, while also allowing us to build the backlog necessary to meet our production targets in '18, when we anticipate a significant amount of new takeaway capacity being placed in service.
Slide 7 highlights the well level economics on the average well we plan to drill in 2017. Even in a low price environment, both our assets generate strong returns. However, from a capital allocation perspective, you can see why the Marcellus continues to receive the lion's share of capital. At a $2 realized price, our wells generate a rate of return over 100%, highlighting the world-class asset we have in Northeast Pennsylvania. I would also highlight that the well cost on this slide includes facility costs, and also reflects our current view of the service cost environment for 2017. Additionally, the Marcellus well costs include the incremental stages and the corresponding increase in well cost for the Gen 4 completion design.
Moving on to Slide 8. We have highlighted our natural gas price exposure by index for 2017, while it is no surprise that we have a significant amount of exposure to in-basin pricing during '17. [ph] As we await the addition of new takeaway project in 2018, we have taken numerous steps to mitigate the potential for downside pricing risk next year. We have about 12% of our natural gas production tied to NYMEX, and we have hedged the majority of that exposure at an average floor price of approximately $3.10 per Mcf. We have also locked in another 21% of our volumes with fixed-price contracts at an average price of $2.15. The majority of these volumes would typically be tied to the Northeast PA index that have seen significantly worse pricing over the last few years. As a result, we believe fixing these volumes at prices that generate the high returns we highlighted on the previous slide is a prudent decision.
Regarding our balance sheet. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have an extremely strong financial position with a significant amount of flexibility given our cash on cash and availability under our credit facility. You'll notice that our highest cost debt matures in 2018, leaving us with a much lower weighted average interest rate subsequent to those maturities.
Okay, moving to Slide 9. In light of all of the recent news flow regarding Atlantic Sunrise and other infrastructure projects in Appalachia, on Slide 9, we have provided a brief update on all the projects that we are participating in over the next few years. For today's call, I plan only to specifically address a few of the projects, however, all of these projects are important steps towards realizing our long-term initiatives and value creation from our Marcellus assets. Our 2 infrastructure projects in the power market, the Moxie Freedom power plant and the Lackawanna Energy Center power plant, are currently under full scale construction. Both facilities are on track to be completed by June 2018, with the Lackawanna project phasing in between June and December 2018. I remind everyone that this new local demand of approximately 400 million cubic foot per day is essentially tied to our gathering system, and eliminates the need to commit to expensive [ph] long-term firm transportation agreements.
Overall, we anticipate the net backs on these volumes to be some of the best in our portfolio. Tennessee Orien project, in which we are a sole supplier, recently received a favorable environmental assessment from the FERC, and is slated to begin construction in January 2017. We have approximately 135 million per day on this project, and anticipate the netbacks will be accretive to in-basin netbacks.
Moving on to Atlantic Sunrise. As you're aware, we recently had a slight setback with the FERC moving the timing of the issuance of the final environmental impact statement from October to December in order to accommodate comments from landowners regarding 2 minor route alternatives, totaling 1.4 miles. While disappointed that this decision has resulted in a delay of in-service date to mid-2018, we believe the decision was prudent, and that at the end of the day, the Atlantic Sunrise route will ultimately be ensured of a full and complete record. And as you're all aware, in this environment, we simply want to get it done right, particularly concerning the route. You will notice that all these projects have the potential to be placed in service during 2018, highlighting what an inflection year 2018 can be for Cabot.
Not only do we believe that 2018 is going to be a strong year for us, but also additional infrastructure is needed for PA and the nation, and I'd refer you to the Pennsylvania Governor will [ph] support that position referenced in Williams' press release this morning.
Moving to Slide 10, highlights the cumulative impact of all the projects we have highlighted on the previous slide, allowing us to potentially double our gross production out of the Marcellus to 4 BCF per day. Clearly, there has been a lot of questions around constitution, given the ongoing appeal process. But even if you exclude constitution from the conversation, we would be able to produce 3.5 Bcf per day with these existing projects that are on the slate once all the new projects are online. We remain optimistic that Constitution will be built and that will -- we will continue to assess new outlets that enable us to grow our production higher than the levels outlined on the slide. However, even if we were able to hold the production flat at 3.5 Bcf per day, we believe a highly capital efficient asset base provides a unique value proposition via the free cash flow yield.
At a range of realized prices between $2.50 and $3 per Mcf, our standalone Marcellus asset generates between $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion pretax free cash flow, and we will have the inventory to hold production flat at those levels until 2037.
Slide 11 illustrates the change in how our market -- Marcellus production between now and 4Q 2018, which is when we expect to have the majority of this new infrastructure online. As you can see that our exposure in the Northeast PA price point, Leidy, Tennessee, Millennium, reduces significantly, while our exposure to NYMEX, the D.C. market area and the newbuild power generation facilities increases significantly. While we fully believe that in-price -- in-basin pricing will improve dramatically during this period, as major projects like Atlantic Sunrise and PennEast are built, even if you assume there are no changes in NYMEX or regional basis differentials between Q4 '16 and Q4 '18, the addition of our new takeaway capacity would improve realized prices by greater than $0.50 per Mcf on all of our volumes. Based on the midpoint of our expectation of Q4 2018 production range, a $0.50 uplift in realized prices would represent over $450 million uplift in cash flows on an annualized basis. 
Moving to Slide 12. Slide 12 highlights our planned production growth through 2018 and some of the anticipated byproducts of this plan based on current strip pricing. As I already highlighted earlier on the call, we plan to generate 5% to 10% production growth in 2017. And based on today's strip, we will generate a meaningful amount of free cash flow even after accounting for pipeline investments and dividends. You can also see that we expect to delever by 1 term, resulting in year-end 2017 target leverage ratio of 1x.
We also highlighted a preliminary 2018 production growth range of 15% to 25%, based on a program that also generates positive free cash flow at today's strip. Ultimately, where we land within that range will be a function of the timing of the in-service of the takeaway projects we highlighted previously and what the expectations are for in-basin prices during this period of time. However, based on the target in-service date we laid out on Slide 9 and our current expectations of where our local prices will be in 2018, we feel very comfortable that we will be able to deliver on production growth within the range, while generating free cash flow, delevering, reducing cash costs and increasing cash margins.
While we have not included 2019 growth expectations at this time, given the lineup of new takeaway projects slated for mid- to late-2018 in-service date, it is reasonable to assume 2019 will be another year of robust growth for Cabot Oil & Gas.
And Gary, with that, I will now open the lines up for Q&A."

All -",566,"Well, great question, and I can just make a macro comment in regard to the latter part, Jeffrey. And I'll comment, then I'll turn it to Jeff to get some color on the Constitution on the 2 courts. But we're faced with a challenge on the energy space. All -- not just Atlantic Sunrise, Constitution but access and other pipelines that are -- and infrastructure that are going to be challenged by activists that, quiet frankly, just don't want to have carbon in the energy mix. I think it's clear that hydrocarbons are going to be part of the energy mix and without a solution for many decades to come. So the argument in the fight today is real to those activists. But from a practicality standpoint, we're going to need the infrastructure to service the demand needs and the demand growth that is perceived in all of these communities. FERC is certainly challenged with the regulatory side and the legal battles that are in front of it on a regular basis. We've seen in their decision process additional caution that they have implemented in their review process. I think it's prudent for that review process. But to your point about moving forward and moving the country forward with a need and the public need is also part of their fiduciary role also, and I think they take that very seriously. So we're getting better as an industry to be able to answer in advance all the challenges that are being placed before us by the antis and those that want to stop the pipelines and infrastructures. We'll continue to get better on the front end to answer all the questions. And hopefully answering those questions on the front end will mitigate some of the delays we've seen in some of these projects as we move forward. I will -- just before I turn it to Jeff, I will make one distinction. When you look at access pipeline and some of the protests that are going on out there, it challenges the local authorities to challenge the rule of law on what is being implemented and what is being actually allowed to take place up there. And looking at Atlantic Sunrise, Atlantic Sunrise is a Pennsylvania pipeline. Atlantic Sunrise is a pipeline that, for particularly [indiscernible] position, we see a need on the other hand of Atlantic Sunrise once it is constructed. But more importantly, there are areas in the -- in Northeast Pennsylvania that wealthy owners in Northeast Pennsylvania are getting virtually no return for the royalties because the differentials have been so punitive up there in that particular part of the area. When that happens, the state of Pennsylvania certainly does not see any return to the coppers in the form of revenue and taxes because of the significant punities that have been in that area because of the gas-on-gas competition. So in referencing Governor's Will letter, I think he recognizes that getting an infrastructure, particularly something as near term and as impactful as Atlantic Sunrise, has a significant value to Pennsylvania and its constituents to be able to help its shortfall in its budget process. So we think all of that is part of the equation and another reason why Constitution -- excuse me, Atlantic Sunrise should move forward. Long-winded, Jeffrey, but I'll turn it to Jeff to make a comment on Constitution."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Trust that everyone has had the opportunity to review our press release",2276,"Thank you, Gary, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Trust that everyone has had the opportunity to review our press release from this morning. Additionally, we have posted a presentation to our website, something new, that I will directly reference on the call this morning. This presentation highlights our financial and operational results from the quarter, as well as provide an updated outlook for the company's plans for 2017 and beyond. 
However, before we get started, I'd first like to move to Slide 2 of the presentation, which addresses our forward-looking statements. Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectation this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in both the earnings release and this presentation.
Moving on to the third quarter financial highlights on Page 3. Cabot once again generated positive free cash flow for the quarter, while growing equivalent production 6% year-over-year, despite our production being impacted by downstream maintenance projects and unplanned upstream gathering downtime during the quarter. We remain committed to generating return-focused measured growth within cash flow. And this quarter, we successfully executed on this plan. While much has been made recently about a widening of regional differentials, we actually recorded our best pre-hedged natural gas realization since the first quarter of 2015 when the average NYMEX price was $0.17 higher than this past quarter. Our pre-hedge realization of $1.80 per MCF were 7% better than the comparable quarter last year and 16% higher sequentially relative to the second quarter. 
Our cost structure continued to improve during the quarter with cash costs, operating costs declining 13% year-over-year. We expect this trend to continue over the next few years as we leverage our operational scale to further improve our cost structure. Our financial position remains strong with over $500 million of cash on hand, approximately $1.7 billion of available commitments on our undrawn credit facility and a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.9x at quarter end.
Moving on to Slide 4, where we have outlined the significant decline in our drilling and completion costs and our LOE, which is a direct impact of efficiency gains our operational teams had accomplished over the past few years. They have done an outstanding job with this. While it is possible that we could see some upward pressure on service costs, I anticipate that we will continue to see a downward trend in our overall cost structure as we become even more efficient in our operations.
On Slide 5, we have outlined the results of a few reduced space pilots that we have been testing in our Marcellus operating area. This is a interesting area for us. The graphs on this slide represent 4 different pads, where we completed 1 well with our Gen 3 completion design and 1 offset well with our Gen 4 completion design. We have experienced overall a 20% uplift in cumulative production from the Gen-4 wells. As a result, we have decided to implement this completion design for all of our wells, going forward, beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. As we typically do each year, we will wait until our year-end reserve audit before making any changes to our EUR. However, as you can see by the numbers, we are very excited about what this could mean for our industry-leading well productivity going forward.
On Slide 6, we have laid out our capital program for 2017, which includes the program-wide implementation of the Gen 4 completion design in the Marcellus. As we alluded to on the second quarter call, we are targeting 5% to 10% production growth in 2017. This is based on total program spending of $625 million, which includes $575 million at the E&P capital, and another $50 million for our equity investments in the Atlantic Sunrise and Constitution pipelines. $535 million or 93% of E&P capital is earmarked for drilling and completion activity associated with the 70 well -- net wells we plan to drill and the 75 net wells we plan to complete next year. 79% of the drill and complete capital will be directed to the Marcellus, and the remaining 21% will be directed to the Eagle Ford, where the program is focused on maintaining leasehold, holding oil the volumes flat and generating a cash flow neutral operating program. We have allocated $225 million for maintenance capital in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, which is the amount of capital needed to hold our anticipated 2016 exit production flat throughout 2017, and also allows us to meet all our obligatory operating commitments to maintain our leasehold.
This flat production profile for the year would imply growth at the low end of our production growth guidance range. The remaining capital for the year provides the productive capacity needed to meet or exceed the high end of our 2017 guidance range, assuming price realizations are at levels that generate strong return for Cabot, while also allowing us to build the backlog necessary to meet our production targets in '18, when we anticipate a significant amount of new takeaway capacity being placed in service.
Slide 7 highlights the well level economics on the average well we plan to drill in 2017. Even in a low price environment, both our assets generate strong returns. However, from a capital allocation perspective, you can see why the Marcellus continues to receive the lion's share of capital. At a $2 realized price, our wells generate a rate of return over 100%, highlighting the world-class asset we have in Northeast Pennsylvania. I would also highlight that the well cost on this slide includes facility costs, and also reflects our current view of the service cost environment for 2017. Additionally, the Marcellus well costs include the incremental stages and the corresponding increase in well cost for the Gen 4 completion design.
Moving on to Slide 8. We have highlighted our natural gas price exposure by index for 2017, while it is no surprise that we have a significant amount of exposure to in-basin pricing during '17. [ph] As we await the addition of new takeaway project in 2018, we have taken numerous steps to mitigate the potential for downside pricing risk next year. We have about 12% of our natural gas production tied to NYMEX, and we have hedged the majority of that exposure at an average floor price of approximately $3.10 per Mcf. We have also locked in another 21% of our volumes with fixed-price contracts at an average price of $2.15. The majority of these volumes would typically be tied to the Northeast PA index that have seen significantly worse pricing over the last few years. As a result, we believe fixing these volumes at prices that generate the high returns we highlighted on the previous slide is a prudent decision.
Regarding our balance sheet. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have an extremely strong financial position with a significant amount of flexibility given our cash on cash and availability under our credit facility. You'll notice that our highest cost debt matures in 2018, leaving us with a much lower weighted average interest rate subsequent to those maturities.
Okay, moving to Slide 9. In light of all of the recent news flow regarding Atlantic Sunrise and other infrastructure projects in Appalachia, on Slide 9, we have provided a brief update on all the projects that we are participating in over the next few years. For today's call, I plan only to specifically address a few of the projects, however, all of these projects are important steps towards realizing our long-term initiatives and value creation from our Marcellus assets. Our 2 infrastructure projects in the power market, the Moxie Freedom power plant and the Lackawanna Energy Center power plant, are currently under full scale construction. Both facilities are on track to be completed by June 2018, with the Lackawanna project phasing in between June and December 2018. I remind everyone that this new local demand of approximately 400 million cubic foot per day is essentially tied to our gathering system, and eliminates the need to commit to expensive [ph] long-term firm transportation agreements.
Overall, we anticipate the net backs on these volumes to be some of the best in our portfolio. Tennessee Orien project, in which we are a sole supplier, recently received a favorable environmental assessment from the FERC, and is slated to begin construction in January 2017. We have approximately 135 million per day on this project, and anticipate the netbacks will be accretive to in-basin netbacks.
Moving on to Atlantic Sunrise. As you're aware, we recently had a slight setback with the FERC moving the timing of the issuance of the final environmental impact statement from October to December in order to accommodate comments from landowners regarding 2 minor route alternatives, totaling 1.4 miles. While disappointed that this decision has resulted in a delay of in-service date to mid-2018, we believe the decision was prudent, and that at the end of the day, the Atlantic Sunrise route will ultimately be ensured of a full and complete record. And as you're all aware, in this environment, we simply want to get it done right, particularly concerning the route. You will notice that all these projects have the potential to be placed in service during 2018, highlighting what an inflection year 2018 can be for Cabot.
Not only do we believe that 2018 is going to be a strong year for us, but also additional infrastructure is needed for PA and the nation, and I'd refer you to the Pennsylvania Governor will [ph] support that position referenced in Williams' press release this morning.
Moving to Slide 10, highlights the cumulative impact of all the projects we have highlighted on the previous slide, allowing us to potentially double our gross production out of the Marcellus to 4 BCF per day. Clearly, there has been a lot of questions around constitution, given the ongoing appeal process. But even if you exclude constitution from the conversation, we would be able to produce 3.5 Bcf per day with these existing projects that are on the slate once all the new projects are online. We remain optimistic that Constitution will be built and that will -- we will continue to assess new outlets that enable us to grow our production higher than the levels outlined on the slide. However, even if we were able to hold the production flat at 3.5 Bcf per day, we believe a highly capital efficient asset base provides a unique value proposition via the free cash flow yield.
At a range of realized prices between $2.50 and $3 per Mcf, our standalone Marcellus asset generates between $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion pretax free cash flow, and we will have the inventory to hold production flat at those levels until 2037.
Slide 11 illustrates the change in how our market -- Marcellus production between now and 4Q 2018, which is when we expect to have the majority of this new infrastructure online. As you can see that our exposure in the Northeast PA price point, Leidy, Tennessee, Millennium, reduces significantly, while our exposure to NYMEX, the D.C. market area and the newbuild power generation facilities increases significantly. While we fully believe that in-price -- in-basin pricing will improve dramatically during this period, as major projects like Atlantic Sunrise and PennEast are built, even if you assume there are no changes in NYMEX or regional basis differentials between Q4 '16 and Q4 '18, the addition of our new takeaway capacity would improve realized prices by greater than $0.50 per Mcf on all of our volumes. Based on the midpoint of our expectation of Q4 2018 production range, a $0.50 uplift in realized prices would represent over $450 million uplift in cash flows on an annualized basis. 
Moving to Slide 12. Slide 12 highlights our planned production growth through 2018 and some of the anticipated byproducts of this plan based on current strip pricing. As I already highlighted earlier on the call, we plan to generate 5% to 10% production growth in 2017. And based on today's strip, we will generate a meaningful amount of free cash flow even after accounting for pipeline investments and dividends. You can also see that we expect to delever by 1 term, resulting in year-end 2017 target leverage ratio of 1x.
We also highlighted a preliminary 2018 production growth range of 15% to 25%, based on a program that also generates positive free cash flow at today's strip. Ultimately, where we land within that range will be a function of the timing of the in-service of the takeaway projects we highlighted previously and what the expectations are for in-basin prices during this period of time. However, based on the target in-service date we laid out on Slide 9 and our current expectations of where our local prices will be in 2018, we feel very comfortable that we will be able to deliver on production growth within the range, while generating free cash flow, delevering, reducing cash costs and increasing cash margins.
While we have not included 2019 growth expectations at this time, given the lineup of new takeaway projects slated for mid- to late-2018 in-service date, it is reasonable to assume 2019 will be another year of robust growth for Cabot Oil & Gas.
And Gary, with that, I will now open the lines up for Q&A."

And keep in mind, early on, when we were doing these completions, the cost of completion was higher early on. So you had to be certain early on that you were getting and efficiency uplift in the completions before you were going to spend the money to go forward. And what we've -- a couple of things have happened now. Not only has the costs gone down on the completions, which yields even better return profile, but as you can see on these slides that as you go -- you're growing out into -- deeper into the amount of days on production, you're actually seeing a widening in the type curve that we have for Gen 3 and the type curve we're realizing on the Gen 4 wells, which is a very good positive."

And I'll comment, then I'll turn it to Jeff to get some color on the Constitution on the 2 courts. But we're faced with a challenge on the energy space. All -- not just Atlantic Sunrise, Constitution but access and other pipelines that are -- and infrastructure that are going to be challenged by activists that, quiet frankly, just don't want to have carbon in the energy mix. I think it's clear that hydrocarbons are going to be part of the energy mix and without a solution for many decades to come. So the argument in the fight today is real to those activists. But from a practicality standpoint, we're going to need the infrastructure to service the demand needs and the demand growth that is perceived in all of these communities. FERC is certainly challenged with the regulatory side and the legal battles that are in front of it on a regular basis. We've seen in their decision process additional caution that they have implemented in their review process. I think it's prudent for that review process. But to your point about moving forward and moving the country forward with a need and the public need is also part of their fiduciary role also, and I think they take that very seriously. So we're getting better as an industry to be able to answer in advance all the challenges that are being placed before us by the antis and those that want to stop the pipelines and infrastructures. We'll continue to get better on the front end to answer all the questions. And hopefully answering those questions on the front end will mitigate some of the delays we've seen in some of these projects as we move forward. I will -- just before I turn it to Jeff, I will make one distinction. When you look at access pipeline and some of the protests that are going on out there, it challenges the local authorities to challenge the rule of law on what is being implemented and what is being actually allowed to take place up there. And looking at Atlantic Sunrise, Atlantic Sunrise is a Pennsylvania pipeline. Atlantic Sunrise is a pipeline that, for particularly [indiscernible] position, we see a need on the other hand of Atlantic Sunrise once it is constructed. But more importantly, there are areas in the -- in Northeast Pennsylvania that wealthy owners in Northeast Pennsylvania are getting virtually no return for the royalties because the differentials have been so punitive up there in that particular part of the area. When that happens, the state of Pennsylvania certainly does not see any return to the coppers in the form of revenue and taxes because of the significant punities that have been in that area because of the gas-on-gas competition. So in referencing Governor's Will letter, I think he recognizes that getting an infrastructure, particularly something as near term and as impactful as Atlantic Sunrise, has a significant value to Pennsylvania and its constituents to be able to help its shortfall in its budget process. So we think all of that is part of the equation and another reason why Constitution -- excuse me, Atlantic Sunrise should move forward. Long-winded, Jeffrey, but I'll turn it to Jeff to make a comment on Constitution."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Trust that everyone has had the opportunity to review our press release",2273,"Thank you, Gary, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Trust that everyone has had the opportunity to review our press release from this morning. Additionally, we have posted a presentation to our website, something new, that I will directly reference on the call this morning. This presentation highlights our financial and operational results from the quarter, as well as provide an updated outlook for the company's plans for 2017 and beyond. 
However, before we get started, I'd first like to move to Slide 2 of the presentation, which addresses our forward-looking statements. Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectation this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in both the earnings release and this presentation.
Moving on to the third quarter financial highlights on Page 3. Cabot once again generated positive free cash flow for the quarter, while growing equivalent production 6% year-over-year, despite our production being impacted by downstream maintenance projects and unplanned upstream gathering downtime during the quarter. We remain committed to generating return-focused measured growth within cash flow. And this quarter, we successfully executed on this plan. While much has been made recently about a widening of regional differentials, we actually recorded our best pre-hedged natural gas realization since the first quarter of 2015 when the average NYMEX price was $0.17 higher than this past quarter. Our pre-hedge realization of $1.80 per MCF were 7% better than the comparable quarter last year and 16% higher sequentially relative to the second quarter. 
Our cost structure continued to improve during the quarter with cash costs, operating costs declining 13% year-over-year. We expect this trend to continue over the next few years as we leverage our operational scale to further improve our cost structure. Our financial position remains strong with over $500 million of cash on hand, approximately $1.7 billion of available commitments on our undrawn credit facility and a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.9x at quarter end.
Moving on to Slide 4, where we have outlined the significant decline in our drilling and completion costs and our LOE, which is a direct impact of efficiency gains our operational teams had accomplished over the past few years. They have done an outstanding job with this. While it is possible that we could see some upward pressure on service costs, I anticipate that we will continue to see a downward trend in our overall cost structure as we become even more efficient in our operations.
On Slide 5, we have outlined the results of a few reduced space pilots that we have been testing in our Marcellus operating area. This is a interesting area for us. The graphs on this slide represent 4 different pads, where we completed 1 well with our Gen 3 completion design and 1 offset well with our Gen 4 completion design. We have experienced overall a 20% uplift in cumulative production from the Gen-4 wells. As a result, we have decided to implement this completion design for all of our wells, going forward, beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. As we typically do each year, we will wait until our year-end reserve audit before making any changes to our EUR. However, as you can see by the numbers, we are very excited about what this could mean for our industry-leading well productivity going forward.
On Slide 6, we have laid out our capital program for 2017, which includes the program-wide implementation of the Gen 4 completion design in the Marcellus. As we alluded to on the second quarter call, we are targeting 5% to 10% production growth in 2017. This is based on total program spending of $625 million, which includes $575 million at the E&P capital, and another $50 million for our equity investments in the Atlantic Sunrise and Constitution pipelines. $535 million or 93% of E&P capital is earmarked for drilling and completion activity associated with the 70 well -- net wells we plan to drill and the 75 net wells we plan to complete next year. 79% of the drill and complete capital will be directed to the Marcellus, and the remaining 21% will be directed to the Eagle Ford, where the program is focused on maintaining leasehold, holding oil the volumes flat and generating a cash flow neutral operating program. We have allocated $225 million for maintenance capital in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, which is the amount of capital needed to hold our anticipated 2016 exit production flat throughout 2017, and also allows us to meet all our obligatory operating commitments to maintain our leasehold.
This flat production profile for the year would imply growth at the low end of our production growth guidance range. The remaining capital for the year provides the productive capacity needed to meet or exceed the high end of our 2017 guidance range, assuming price realizations are at levels that generate strong return for Cabot, while also allowing us to build the backlog necessary to meet our production targets in '18, when we anticipate a significant amount of new takeaway capacity being placed in service.
Slide 7 highlights the well level economics on the average well we plan to drill in 2017. Even in a low price environment, both our assets generate strong returns. However, from a capital allocation perspective, you can see why the Marcellus continues to receive the lion's share of capital. At a $2 realized price, our wells generate a rate of return over 100%, highlighting the world-class asset we have in Northeast Pennsylvania. I would also highlight that the well cost on this slide includes facility costs, and also reflects our current view of the service cost environment for 2017. Additionally, the Marcellus well costs include the incremental stages and the corresponding increase in well cost for the Gen 4 completion design.
Moving on to Slide 8. We have highlighted our natural gas price exposure by index for 2017, while it is no surprise that we have a significant amount of exposure to in-basin pricing during '17. As we await the addition of new takeaway project in 2018, we have taken numerous steps to mitigate the potential for downside pricing risk next year. We have about 12% of our natural gas production tied to NYMEX, and we have hedged the majority of that exposure at an average floor price of approximately $3.10 per Mcf. We have also locked in another 21% of our volumes with fixed-price contracts at an average price of $2.15. The majority of these volumes would typically be tied to the Northeast PA index that have seen significantly worse pricing over the last few years. As a result, we believe fixing these volumes at prices that generate the high returns we highlighted on the previous slide is a prudent decision.
Regarding our balance sheet. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have an extremely strong financial position with a significant amount of flexibility given our cash on cash and availability under our credit facility. You'll notice that our highest cost debt matures in 2018, leaving us with a much lower weighted average interest rate subsequent to those maturities.
Okay, moving to Slide 9. In light of all of the recent news flow regarding Atlantic Sunrise and other infrastructure projects in Appalachia, on Slide 9, we have provided a brief update on all the projects that we are participating in over the next few years. For today's call, I plan only to specifically address a few of the projects, however, all of these projects are important steps towards realizing our long-term initiatives and value creation from our Marcellus assets. Our 2 infrastructure projects in the power market, the Moxie Freedom power plant and the Lackawanna Energy Center power plant, are currently under full scale construction. Both facilities are on track to be completed by June 2018, with the Lackawanna project phasing in between June and December 2018. I remind everyone that this new local demand of approximately 400 million cubic foot per day is essentially tied to our gathering system, and eliminates the need to commit to extensive long-term firm transportation agreements.
Overall, we anticipate the net backs on these volumes to be some of the best in our portfolio. Tennessee Orion Project, in which we are a sole supplier, recently received a favorable environmental assessment from the FERC, and is slated to begin construction in January 2017. We have approximately 135 million per day on this project, and anticipate the netbacks will be accretive to in-basin netbacks.
Moving on to Atlantic Sunrise. As you're aware, we recently had a slight setback with the FERC moving the timing of the issuance of the final environmental impact statement from October to December in order to accommodate comments from landowners regarding 2 minor route alternatives, totaling 1.4 miles. While disappointed that this decision has resulted in a delay of in-service date to mid-2018, we believe the decision was prudent, and that at the end of the day, the Atlantic Sunrise route will ultimately be ensured of a full and complete record. And as you're all aware, in this environment, we simply want to get it done right, particularly concerning the route. You will notice that all these projects have the potential to be placed in service during 2018, highlighting what an inflection year 2018 can be for Cabot.
Not only do we believe that 2018 is going to be a strong year for us, but also additional infrastructure is needed for PA and the nation, and I'd refer you to the Pennsylvania Governor Wolfe support that position referenced in Williams' press release this morning.
Moving to Slide 10, highlights the cumulative impact of all the projects we have highlighted on the previous slide, allowing us to potentially double our gross production out of the Marcellus to 4 BCF per day. Clearly, there has been a lot of questions around Constitution, given the ongoing appeal process. But even if you exclude Constitution from the conversation, we would be able to produce 3.5 Bcf per day with these existing projects that are on the slate once all the new projects are online. We remain optimistic that Constitution will be built and that will -- we will continue to assess new outlets that enable us to grow our production higher than the levels outlined on the slide. However, even if we were able to hold the production flat at 3.5 Bcf per day, we believe a highly capital efficient asset base provides a unique value proposition via the free cash flow yield.
At a range of realized prices between $2.50 and $3 per Mcf, our standalone Marcellus asset generates between $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion pretax free cash flow, and we will have the inventory to hold production flat at those levels until 2037.
Slide 11 illustrates the change in how our market -- Marcellus production between now and 4Q 2018, which is when we expect to have the majority of this new infrastructure online. As you can see that our exposure in the Northeast PA price point, Leidy, Tennessee, Millennium, reduces significantly, while our exposure to NYMEX, the D.C. market area and the newbuild power generation facilities increases significantly. While we fully believe that in-price -- in-basin pricing will improve dramatically during this period, as major projects like Atlantic Sunrise and PennEast are built, even if you assume there are no changes in NYMEX or regional basis differentials between Q4 '16 and Q4 '18, the addition of our new takeaway capacity would improve realized prices by greater than $0.50 per Mcf on all of our volumes. Based on the midpoint of our expectation of Q4 2018 production range, a $0.50 uplift in realized prices would represent over $450 million uplift in cash flows on an annualized basis. 
Moving to Slide 12. Slide 12 highlights our planned production growth through 2018 and some of the anticipated byproducts of this plan based on current strip pricing. As I already highlighted earlier on the call, we plan to generate 5% to 10% production growth in 2017. And based on today's strip, we will generate a meaningful amount of free cash flow even after accounting for pipeline investments and dividends. You can also see that we expect to delever by 1 term, resulting in year-end 2017 target leverage ratio of 1x.
We also highlighted a preliminary 2018 production growth range of 15% to 25%, based on a program that also generates positive free cash flow at today's strip. Ultimately, where we land within that range will be a function of the timing of the in-service of the takeaway projects we highlighted previously and what the expectations are for in-basin prices during this period of time. However, based on the target in-service date we laid out on Slide 9 and our current expectations of where our local prices will be in 2018, we feel very comfortable that we will be able to deliver on production growth within the range, while generating free cash flow, delevering, reducing cash costs and increasing cash margins.
While we have not included 2019 growth expectations at this time, given the lineup of new takeaway projects slated for mid- to late-2018 in-service date, it is reasonable to assume 2019 will be another year of robust growth for Cabot Oil & Gas.
And Gary, with that, I will now open the lines up for Q&A."

And then finally, if I could just ask kind of a higher level question regarding Constitution, you actually have 2 actions going. You've got the appeal on the Second Circuit and then you got a separate action in the Northern District. I was just curious, so are you any more confident in one approach than the other? And ultimately, and I know this is a tough question, but it's germane seemingly to every pipeline resistance that we're getting these days. Ultimately, if the actions are somehow unsuccessful, is there any indication that FERC is going to step it up and finally exercise its regulatory authority?"

I think it's clear that hydrocarbons are going to be part of the energy mix and without a solution for many decades to come. So the argument in the fight today is real to those activists. But from a practicality standpoint, we're going to need the infrastructure to service the demand needs and the demand growth that is perceived in all of these communities. FERC is certainly challenged with the regulatory side and the legal battles that are in front of it on a regular basis. We've seen in their decision process additional caution that they have implemented in their review process. I think it's prudent for that review process. But to your point about moving forward and moving the country forward with a need and the public need is also part of their fiduciary role also, and I think they take that very seriously. So we're getting better as an industry to be able to answer in advance all the challenges that are being placed before us by the antis and those that want to stop the pipelines and infrastructures. We'll continue to get better on the front end to answer all the questions. And hopefully answering those questions on the front end will mitigate some of the delays we've seen in some of these projects as we move forward. I will -- just before I turn it to Jeff, I will make one distinction. When you look at access pipeline and some of the protests that are going on up there, it challenges the local authorities to challenge the rule of law on what is being implemented and what is being actually allowed to take place up there. And looking at Atlantic Sunrise, Atlantic Sunrise is a Pennsylvania pipeline. Atlantic Sunrise is a pipeline that, for particularly, Cabot's position, we see a need on the other end of Atlantic Sunrise once it is constructed. But more importantly, there are areas in the -- in Northeast Pennsylvania that royalty owners in Northeast Pennsylvania are getting virtually no return for the royalties because the differentials have been so punitive up there in that particular part of the area. When that happens, the state of Pennsylvania certainly does not see any return to the coppers in the form of revenue and taxes because of the significant punities that have been in that area because of gas-on-gas competition. So in referencing Governor's Wolf letter, I think he recognizes that getting an infrastructure, and particularly something as near term and as impactful as Atlantic Sunrise, has a significant value to Pennsylvania and its constituents to be able to help its shortfall in its budget process. So we think all of that is part of the equation and another reason why Constitution -- excuse me, Atlantic Sunrise should move forward. Long-winded, Jeffrey, but I'll turn it to Jeff to make a comment on Constitution."

We remain very excited about the company's future and the opportunity set that lies ahead of us for generating long-term shareholder value. While the last few years have been extremely frustrating, not being able to get the infrastructure in the ground, we continue to work through ongoing delays in the infrastructure buildout in Appalachia, and we do remain confident that better days are ahead of us, and particularly in 2018 and certainly beyond. Despite the low commodity price environment and the forecast that we've given, we think we will manage through the differentials, and we think that we will continue to be able to generate strong returns, grow production, while maintaining our balance sheet, grow proved reserves at an all-time-low binding cost and certainly significantly reduce our cost structure through the efficiency gains. So thank you to all the shareholders that we have out there, particularly to our long-term shareholders, for their continued patience, and I look forward to speaking with the group again in February.

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Trust that everyone has had the opportunity to review our press release",2274,"Thank you, Gary, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Trust that everyone has had the opportunity to review our press release from this morning. Additionally, we have posted a presentation to our website, something new, that I will directly reference on the call this morning. This presentation highlights our financial and operational results from the quarter, as well as provide an updated outlook for the company's plans for 2017 and beyond. 
However, before we get started, I'd first like to move to Slide 2 of the presentation, which addresses our forward-looking statements. Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectation this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in both the earnings release and this presentation.
Moving on to the third quarter financial highlights on Page 3. Cabot once again generated positive free cash flow for the quarter, while growing equivalent production 6% year-over-year, despite our production being impacted by downstream maintenance projects and unplanned upstream gathering downtime during the quarter. We remain committed to generating return-focused measured growth within cash flow. And this quarter, we successfully executed on this plan. While much has been made recently about a widening of regional differentials, we actually recorded our best pre-hedged natural gas realization since the first quarter of 2015 when the average NYMEX price was $0.17 higher than this past quarter. Our pre-hedge realization of $1.80 per MCF were 7% better than the comparable quarter last year and 16% higher sequentially relative to the second quarter. 
Our cost structure continued to improve during the quarter with cash costs, operating costs declining 13% year-over-year. We expect this trend to continue over the next few years as we leverage our operational scale to further improve our cost structure. Our financial position remains strong with over $500 million of cash on hand, approximately $1.7 billion of available commitments on our undrawn credit facility and a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.9x at quarter end.
Moving on to Slide 4, where we have outlined the significant decline in our drilling and completion costs and our LOE, which is a direct impact of efficiency gains our operational teams have accomplished over the past few years. They have done an outstanding job with this. While it is possible that we could see some upward pressure on service costs, I anticipate that we will continue to see a downward trend in our overall cost structure as we become even more efficient in our operations.
On Slide 5, we have outlined the results of a few reduced space pilots that we have been testing in our Marcellus operating area. This is an interesting area for us. The graphs on this slide represent 4 different pads, where we completed 1 well with our Gen 3 completion design and 1 offset well with our Gen 4 completion design. We have experienced overall a 20% uplift in cumulative production from the Gen-4 wells. As a result, we have decided to implement this completion design for all of our wells, going forward, beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. As we typically do each year, we will wait until our year-end reserve audit before making any changes to our EUR. However, as you can see by the numbers, we are very excited about what this could mean for our industry-leading well productivity going forward.
On Slide 6, we have laid out our capital program for 2017, which includes the program-wide implementation of the Gen 4 completion design in the Marcellus. As we alluded to on the second quarter call, we are targeting 5% to 10% production growth in 2017. This is based on total program spending of $625 million, which includes $575 million at the E&P capital, and another $50 million for our equity investments in the Atlantic Sunrise and Constitution pipelines. $535 million or 93% of E&P capital is earmarked for drilling and completion activity associated with the 70 well -- net wells we plan to drill and the 75 net wells we plan to complete next year. 79% of the drill and complete capital will be directed to the Marcellus, and the remaining 21% will be directed to the Eagle Ford, where the program is focused on maintaining leasehold, holding oil volumes flat and generating a cash flow neutral operating program. We have allocated $225 million for maintenance capital in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, which is the amount of capital needed to hold our anticipated 2016 exit production flat throughout 2017, and also allows us to meet all our obligatory operating commitments to maintain our leasehold.
This flat production profile for the year would imply growth at the low end of our production growth guidance range. The remaining capital for the year provides the productive capacity needed to meet or exceed the high end of our 2017 guidance range, assuming price realizations are at levels that generate strong return for Cabot, while also allowing us to build the backlog necessary to meet our production targets in '18, when we anticipate a significant amount of new takeaway capacity being placed in service.
Slide 7 highlights the well level economics on the average well we plan to drill in 2017. Even in a low price environment, both our assets generate strong returns. However, from a capital allocation perspective, you can see why the Marcellus continues to receive the lion's share of capital. At a $2 realized price, our wells generate a rate of return over 100%, highlighting the world-class asset we have in Northeast Pennsylvania. I would also highlight that the well cost on this slide includes facility costs, and also reflects our current view of the service cost environment for 2017. Additionally, the Marcellus well costs include the incremental stages and the corresponding increase in well cost for the Gen 4 completion design.
Moving on to Slide 8. We have highlighted our natural gas price exposure by index for 2017, while it is no surprise that we have a significant amount of exposure to in-basin pricing during '17. As we await the addition of new takeaway projects in 2018, we have taken numerous steps to mitigate the potential for downside pricing risk next year. We have about 12% of our natural gas production tied to NYMEX, and we have hedged the majority of that exposure at an average floor price of approximately $3.10 per Mcf. We have also locked in another 21% of our volumes with fixed-price contracts at an average price of $2.15. The majority of these volumes would typically be tied to the Northeast PA index that have seen significantly worse pricing over the last few years. As a result, we believe fixing these volumes at prices that generate the high returns we highlighted on the previous slide is a prudent decision.
Regarding our balance sheet. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have an extremely strong financial position with a significant amount of flexibility given our cash on cash and availability under our credit facility. You'll notice that our highest cost debt matures in 2018, leaving us with a much lower weighted average interest rate subsequent to those maturities.
Okay, moving to Slide 9. In light of all of the recent news flow regarding Atlantic Sunrise and other infrastructure projects in Appalachia, on Slide 9, we have provided a brief update on all the projects that we are participating in over the next few years. For today's call, I plan only to specifically address a few of the projects, however, all of these projects are important steps towards realizing our long-term initiatives and value creation from our Marcellus assets. Our 2 infrastructure projects in the power market, the Moxie Freedom power plant and the Lackawanna Energy Center power plant, are currently under full scale construction. Both facilities are on track to be completed by June 2018, with the Lackawanna project phasing in between June and December 2018. I remind everyone that this new local demand of approximately 400 million cubic foot per day is essentially tied to our gathering system, and eliminates the need to commit to extensive long-term firm transportation agreements.
Overall, we anticipate the net backs on these volumes to be some of the best in our portfolio. Tennessee Orion Project, in which we are a sole supplier, recently received a favorable environmental assessment from the FERC, and is slated to begin construction in January 2017. We have approximately 135 million per day on this project, and anticipate the netbacks will be accretive to in-basin netbacks.
Moving on to Atlantic Sunrise. As you're aware, we recently had a slight setback with the FERC moving the timing of the issuance of the final environmental impact statement from October to December in order to accommodate comments from landowners regarding 2 minor route alternatives, totaling 1.4 miles. While disappointed that this decision has resulted in a delay of in-service date to mid-2018, we believe the decision was prudent, and that at the end of the day, the Atlantic Sunrise route will ultimately be ensured of a full and complete record. And as you're all aware, in this environment, we simply want to get it done right, particularly concerning the route. You will notice that all these projects have the potential to be placed in service during 2018, highlighting what an inflection year 2018 can be for Cabot.
Not only do we believe that 2018 is going to be a strong year for us, but also additional infrastructure is needed for PA and the nation, and I'd refer you to the -- Pennsylvania Governor Wolf's support that position referenced in Williams' press release this morning.
Moving to Slide 10, highlights the cumulative impact of all the projects we have highlighted on the previous slide, allowing us to potentially double our gross production out of the Marcellus to 4 BcF per day. Clearly, there has been a lot of questions around Constitution, given the ongoing appeal process. But even if you exclude Constitution from the conversation, we would be able to produce 3.5 Bcf per day with these existing projects that are on the slate once all the new projects are online. We remain optimistic that Constitution will be built and that will -- we will continue to assess new outlets that enable us to grow our production higher than the levels outlined on the slide. However, even if we were able to hold the production flat at 3.5 Bcf per day, we believe a highly capital efficient asset base provides a unique value proposition via the free cash flow yield.
At a range of realized prices between $2.50 and $3 per Mcf, our standalone Marcellus asset generates between $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion pretax, tax-free [ph] cash flow, and we will have the inventory to hold production flat at those levels until 2037.
Slide 11 illustrates the change in how our market -- Marcellus production between now and 4Q 2018, which is when we expect to have the majority of this new infrastructure online. As you can see that our exposure in the Northeast PA price point, Leidy, Tennessee, Millennium, reduces significantly, while our exposure to NYMEX, the D.C. market area and the newbuild power generation facilities increases significantly. While we fully believe that in-price -- in-basin pricing will improve dramatically during this period, as major projects like Atlantic Sunrise and PennEast are built, even if you assume there are no changes in NYMEX or regional basis differentials between Q4 '16 and Q4 '18, the addition of our new takeaway capacity would improve realized prices by greater than $0.50 per Mcf on all of our volumes. Based on the midpoint of our expectation of Q4 2018 production range, a $0.50 uplift in realized prices would represent over $450 million uplift in cash flows on an annualized basis. 
Moving to Slide 12. Slide 12 highlights our planned production growth through 2018 and some of the anticipated byproducts of this plan based on current strip pricing. As I already highlighted earlier on the call, we plan to generate 5% to 10% production growth in 2017. And based on today's strip, we will generate a meaningful amount of free cash flow even after accounting for pipeline investments and dividends. You can also see that we expect to delever by 1 term, resulting in year-end 2017 target leverage ratio of 1x.
We also highlighted a preliminary 2018 production growth range of 15% to 25%, based on a program that also generates positive free cash flow at today's strip. Ultimately, where we land within that range will be a function of the timing of the in-service of the takeaway projects we highlighted previously and what the expectations are for in-basin prices during this period of time. However, based on the target in-service date we laid out on Slide 9 and our current expectations of where our local prices will be in 2018, we feel very comfortable that we will be able to deliver on production growth within the range, while generating free cash flow, delevering, reducing cash costs and increasing cash margins.
While we have not included 2019 growth expectations at this time, given the lineup of new takeaway projects slated for mid- to late-2018 in-service date, it is reasonable to assume 2019 will be another year of robust growth for Cabot Oil & Gas.
And Gary, with that, I will now open the lines up for Q&A."

So you had to be certain early on that you were getting an efficiency uplift in the completions before you were going to spend the money to go forward.

I think it's clear that hydrocarbons are going to be part of the energy mix and without a solution for many decades to come. So the argument in the fight today is real to those activists. But from a practicality standpoint, we're going to need the infrastructure to service the demand needs and the demand growth that is perceived in all of these communities. FERC is certainly challenged with the regulatory side and the legal battles that are in front of it on a regular basis. We've seen in their decision process additional caution that they have implemented in their review process. I think it's prudent for that review process. But to your point about moving forward and moving the country forward with a need and the public need is also part of their fiduciary role also, and I think they take that very seriously. So we're getting better as an industry to be able to answer in advance all the challenges that are being placed before us by the antis and those that want to stop the pipelines and infrastructures. We'll continue to get better on the front end to answer all the questions. And hopefully answering those questions on the front end will mitigate some of the delays we've seen in some of these projects as we move forward. I will -- just before I turn it to Jeff, I will make one distinction. When you look at Access Pipeline and some of the protests that are going on up there, it challenges the local authorities to challenge the rule of law on what is being implemented and what is being actually allowed to take place up there. And looking at Atlantic Sunrise, Atlantic Sunrise is a Pennsylvania pipeline. Atlantic Sunrise is a pipeline that, for particularly, Cabot's position, we see a need on the other end of Atlantic Sunrise once it is constructed. But more importantly, there are areas in the -- in Northeast Pennsylvania that royalty owners in Northeast Pennsylvania are getting virtually no return for the royalties because the differentials have been so punitive up there in that particular part of the area. When that happens, the state of Pennsylvania certainly does not see any return to the coppers in the form of revenue and taxes because of the significant impunities that have been in that area because of gas-on-gas competition. So in referencing Governor's Wolf letter, I think he recognizes that getting an infrastructure, and particularly something as near term and as impactful as Atlantic Sunrise, has a significant value to Pennsylvania and its constituents to be able to help its shortfall in its budget process. So we think all of that is part of the equation and another reason why Constitution -- excuse me, Atlantic Sunrise should move forward. Long-winded, Jeffrey, but I'll turn it to Jeff to make a comment on Constitution."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of Cabot's executive management team.

With me today are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Trust that everyone has had the opportunity to review our press release from this morning. Additionally, we have posted a presentation to our website, something new, that I will directly reference on the call this morning. This presentation highlights our financial and operational results from the quarter, as well as provide an updated outlook for the company's plans for 2017 and beyond. 
However, before we get started, I'd first like to move to Slide 2 of the presentation, which addresses our forward-looking statements. Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectation this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in both the earnings release and this presentation.
Moving on to the third quarter financial highlights on Page 3. Cabot once again generated positive free cash flow for the quarter, while growing equivalent production 6% year-over-year, despite our production being impacted by downstream maintenance projects and unplanned upstream gathering downtime during the quarter. We remain committed to generating return-focused measured growth within cash flow. And this quarter, we successfully executed on this plan. While much has been made recently about a widening of regional differentials, we actually recorded our best pre-hedged natural gas realization since the first quarter of 2015 when the average NYMEX price was $0.17 higher than this past quarter. Our pre-hedge realization of $1.80 per MCF were 7% better than the comparable quarter last year and 16% higher sequentially relative to the second quarter. 
Our cost structure continued to improve during the quarter with cash costs, operating costs declining 13% year-over-year. We expect this trend to continue over the next few years as we leverage our operational scale to further improve our cost structure. Our financial position remains strong with over $500 million of cash on hand, approximately $1.7 billion of available commitments on our undrawn credit facility and a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.9x at quarter end.
Moving on to Slide 4, where we have outlined the significant decline in our drilling and completion costs and our LOE, which is a direct impact of efficiency gains our operational teams have accomplished over the past few years. They have done an outstanding job with this. While it is possible that we could see some upward pressure on service costs, I anticipate that we will continue to see a downward trend in our overall cost structure as we become even more efficient in our operations.
On Slide 5, we have outlined the results of a few reduced space pilots that we have been testing in our Marcellus operating area. This is an interesting area for us. The graphs on this slide represent 4 different pads, where we completed 1 well with our Gen 3 completion design and 1 offset well with our Gen 4 completion design. We have experienced overall a 20% uplift in cumulative production from the Gen-4 wells. As a result, we have decided to implement this completion design for all of our wells, going forward, beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. As we typically do each year, we will wait until our year-end reserve audit before making any changes to our EUR. However, as you can see by the numbers, we are very excited about what this could mean for our industry-leading well productivity going forward.
On Slide 6, we have laid out our capital program for 2017, which includes the program-wide implementation of the Gen 4 completion design in the Marcellus. As we alluded to on the second quarter call, we are targeting 5% to 10% production growth in 2017. This is based on total program spending of $625 million, which includes $575 million at the E&P capital, and another $50 million for our equity investments in the Atlantic Sunrise and Constitution pipelines. $535 million or 93% of E&P capital is earmarked for drilling and completion activity associated with the 70 well -- net wells we plan to drill and the 75 net wells we plan to complete next year. 79% of the drill and complete capital will be directed to the Marcellus, and the remaining 21% will be directed to the Eagle Ford, where the program is focused on maintaining leasehold, holding oil volumes flat and generating a cash flow neutral operating program. We have allocated $225 million for maintenance capital in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, which is the amount of capital needed to hold our anticipated 2016 exit production flat throughout 2017, and also allows us to meet all our obligatory operating commitments to maintain our leasehold.
This flat production profile for the year would imply growth at the low end of our production growth guidance range. The remaining capital for the year provides the productive capacity needed to meet or exceed the high end of our 2017 guidance range, assuming price realizations are at levels that generate strong return for Cabot, while also allowing us to build the backlog necessary to meet our production targets in '18, when we anticipate a significant amount of new takeaway capacity being placed in service.
Slide 7 highlights the well level economics on the average well we plan to drill in 2017. Even in a low price environment, both our assets generate strong returns. However, from a capital allocation perspective, you can see why the Marcellus continues to receive the lion's share of capital. At a $2 realized price, our wells generate a rate of return over 100%, highlighting the world-class asset we have in Northeast Pennsylvania. I would also highlight that the well cost on this slide includes facility costs, and also reflects our current view of the service cost environment for 2017. Additionally, the Marcellus well costs include the incremental stages and the corresponding increase in well cost for the Gen 4 completion design.
Moving on to Slide 8. We have highlighted our natural gas price exposure by index for 2017, while it is no surprise that we have a significant amount of exposure to in-basin pricing during '17. As we await the addition of new takeaway projects in 2018, we have taken numerous steps to mitigate the potential for downside pricing risk next year. We have about 12% of our natural gas production tied to NYMEX, and we have hedged the majority of that exposure at an average floor price of approximately $3.10 per Mcf. We have also locked in another 21% of our volumes with fixed-price contracts at an average price of $2.15. The majority of these volumes would typically be tied to the Northeast PA index that have seen significantly worse pricing over the last few years. As a result, we believe fixing these volumes at prices that generate the high returns we highlighted on the previous slide is a prudent decision.
Regarding our balance sheet. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have an extremely strong financial position with a significant amount of flexibility given our cash on cash and availability under our credit facility. You'll notice that our highest cost debt matures in 2018, leaving us with a much lower weighted average interest rate subsequent to those maturities.
Okay, moving to Slide 9. In light of all of the recent news flow regarding Atlantic Sunrise and other infrastructure projects in Appalachia, on Slide 9, we have provided a brief update on all the projects that we are participating in over the next few years. For today's call, I plan only to specifically address a few of the projects, however, all of these projects are important steps towards realizing our long-term initiatives and value creation from our Marcellus assets. Our 2 infrastructure projects in the power market, the Moxie Freedom power plant and the Lackawanna Energy Center power plant, are currently under full scale construction. Both facilities are on track to be completed by June 2018, with the Lackawanna project phasing in between June and December 2018. I remind everyone that this new local demand of approximately 400 million cubic foot per day is essentially tied to our gathering system, and eliminates the need to commit to extensive long-term firm transportation agreements.
Overall, we anticipate the netbacks on these volumes to be some of the best in our portfolio. Tennessee Orion Project, in which we are a sole supplier, recently received a favorable environmental assessment from the FERC, and is slated to begin construction in January 2017. We have approximately 135 million per day on this project, and anticipate the netbacks will be accretive to in-basin netbacks.
Moving on to Atlantic Sunrise. As you're aware, we recently had a slight setback with the FERC moving the timing of the issuance of the final environmental impact statement from October to December in order to accommodate comments from landowners regarding 2 minor route alternatives, totaling 1.4 miles. While disappointed that this decision has resulted in a delay of in-service date to mid-2018, we believe the decision was prudent, and that at the end of the day, the Atlantic Sunrise route will ultimately be ensured of a full and complete record. And as you're all aware, in this environment, we simply want to get it done right, particularly concerning the route. You will notice that all these projects have the potential to be placed in service during 2018, highlighting what an inflection year 2018 can be for Cabot.
Not only do we believe that 2018 is going to be a strong year for us, but also additional infrastructure is needed for PA and the nation, and I'd refer you to the -- Pennsylvania Governor Wolf's support that position referenced in Williams' press release this morning.
Moving to Slide 10, highlights the cumulative impact of all the projects we have highlighted on the previous slide, allowing us to potentially double our gross production out of the Marcellus to 4 BcF per day. Clearly, there has been a lot of questions around Constitution, given the ongoing appeal process. But even if you exclude Constitution from the conversation, we would be able to produce 3.5 Bcf per day with these existing projects that are on the slate once all the new projects are online. We remain optimistic that Constitution will be built and that will -- we will continue to assess new outlets that enable us to grow our production higher than the levels outlined on the slide. However, even if we were able to hold the production flat at 3.5 Bcf per day, we believe a highly capital efficient asset base provides a unique value proposition via the free cash flow yield.
At a range of realized prices between $2.50 and $3 per Mcf, our standalone Marcellus asset generates between $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion pretax, tax-free [ph] cash flow, and we will have the inventory to hold production flat at those levels until 2037.
Slide 11 illustrates the change in how our market -- Marcellus production between now and 4Q 2018, which is when we expect to have the majority of this new infrastructure online. As you can see that our exposure in the Northeast PA price point, Leidy, Tennessee, Millennium, reduces significantly, while our exposure to NYMEX, the D.C. market area and the newbuild power generation facilities increases significantly. While we fully believe that in-price -- in-basin pricing will improve dramatically during this period, as major projects like Atlantic Sunrise and PennEast are built, even if you assume there are no changes in NYMEX or regional basis differentials between Q4 '16 and Q4 '18, the addition of our new takeaway capacity would improve realized prices by greater than $0.50 per Mcf on all of our volumes. Based on the midpoint of our expectation of Q4 2018 production range, a $0.50 uplift in realized prices would represent over $450 million uplift in cash flows on an annualized basis. 
Moving to Slide 12. Slide 12 highlights our planned production growth through 2018 and some of the anticipated byproducts of this plan based on current strip pricing. As I already highlighted earlier on the call, we plan to generate 5% to 10% production growth in 2017. And based on today's strip, we will generate a meaningful amount of free cash flow even after accounting for pipeline investments and dividends. You can also see that we expect to delever by 1 term, resulting in year-end 2017 target leverage ratio of 1x.
We also highlighted a preliminary 2018 production growth range of 15% to 25%, based on a program that also generates positive free cash flow at today's strip. Ultimately, where we land within that range will be a function of the timing of the in-service of the takeaway projects we highlighted previously and what the expectations are for in-basin prices during this period of time. However, based on the target in-service date we laid out on Slide 9 and our current expectations of where our local prices will be in 2018, we feel very comfortable that we will be able to deliver on production growth within the range, while generating free cash flow, delevering, reducing cash costs and increasing cash margins.
While we have not included 2019 growth expectations at this time, given the lineup of new takeaway projects slated for mid- to late-2018 in-service date, it is reasonable to assume 2019 will be another year of robust growth for Cabot Oil & Gas.
And Gary, with that, I will now open the lines up for Q&A."

I think it's clear that hydrocarbons are going to be part of the energy mix and without a solution for many decades to come. So the argument in the fight today is real to those activists. But from a practicality standpoint, we're going to need the infrastructure to service the demand needs and the demand growth that is perceived in all of these communities. FERC is certainly challenged with the regulatory side and the legal battles that are in front of it on a regular basis. We've seen in their decision process additional caution that they have implemented in their review process. I think it's prudent for that review process. But to your point about moving forward and moving the country forward with a need and the public need is also part of their fiduciary role also, and I think they take that very seriously. So we're getting better as an industry to be able to answer in advance all the challenges that are being placed before us by the antis and those that want to stop the pipelines and infrastructures. We'll continue to get better on the front end to answer all the questions. And hopefully answering those questions on the front end will mitigate some of the delays we've seen in some of these projects as we move forward. I will -- just before I turn it to Jeff, I will make one distinction. When you look at Access Pipeline and some of the protests that are going on up there, it challenges the local authorities to challenge the rule of law on what is being implemented and what is being actually allowed to take place up there. And looking at Atlantic Sunrise, Atlantic Sunrise is a Pennsylvania pipeline. Atlantic Sunrise is a pipeline that, for particularly, Cabot's position, we see a need on the other end of Atlantic Sunrise once it is constructed. But more importantly, there are areas in the -- in Northeast Pennsylvania that royalty owners in Northeast Pennsylvania are getting virtually no return for the royalties because the differentials have been so punitive up there in that particular part of the area. When that happens, the state of Pennsylvania certainly does not see any return to the coppers in the form of revenue and taxes because of the significant impunities that have been in that area because of gas-on-gas competition. So in referencing Governor's Wolf letter, I think he recognizes that getting an infrastructure, and particularly something as near term and as impactful as Atlantic Sunrise, has a significant value to Pennsylvania and its constituents to be able to help its shortfall in its budget process. So we think all of that is part of the equation and another reason why Constitution -- excuse me, Atlantic Sunrise should move forward. Long-winded, Jeffrey, but I'll turn it to Jeff to make a comment on Constitution."

The available capacity reaches the points that our production can access, the price is just not what it used to be. So we're seeing a deterioration of prices at [indiscernible] and into the West as well. So in that respect, it's just not worth spending the money to get additional capacity in this marketplace until we see some strengthening in some basis in other areas."

We remain very excited about the company's future and the opportunity set that lies ahead of us for generating long-term shareholder value. While the last few years have been extremely frustrating, not being able to get infrastructure in the ground, we continue to work through ongoing delays in the infrastructure buildout in Appalachia, and we do remain confident that better days are ahead of us, and particularly in 2018 and certainly beyond. Despite the low commodity price environment and the forecast that we've given, we think we will manage through the differentials, and we think that we will continue to be able to generate strong returns, grow production, while maintaining our balance sheet, grow proved reserves at an all-time-low binding cost and certainly significantly reduce our cost structure through the efficiency gains. So thank you to all the shareholders that we have out there, particularly to our long-term shareholders, for their continued patience, and I look forward to speaking with the group again in February. So with that, Gary, that concludes my remarks."
