After my remarks, I'll turn the call over to John and James, and then we'll take your questions. 
Despite some near-term challenges, most specifically due to foreign exchange and disappointing results at our Film division, we are making good progress on our objectives across the group. The core growth strategies that will move our business forward over the long term, building powerful brands that offer great value to our customers, delivering great storytelling, must-have news and sports, and integrating and advertising and packaging are delivering real results for the business. 
Domestic affiliate revenues increased strongly in the quarter. This predictable revenue underpins our financial position. Even in an environment with an increasing number of viewing options, our affiliate revenues continued to grow. This underscores the strong demand for and the value of our brands. Developing these brands has been a key strategic priority for us. We believe the work we have done and the investments we have made render our portfolio indispensable for any broad consumer offering, whether established or emerging. The expansion of our National Geographic partnership is an important milestone in the execution of this strategy. 
Our overall domestic multichannel subscribers continue to grow, increasing in aggregate by 1% over the prior-year quarter, this despite the fact that the average fully distributed channels in the MVPD universe lost around 2% of very subscribers over the time period. And we are seeing strong momentum in high-growth international markets like at STAR in India, where we continue to expand our customer base and our offerings. 
While foreign currency headwinds are creating short-term issues, they reflect the size and scale of our international businesses, which are increasingly well positioned. The strength of our global brands is, of course, a direct result of our success in creating unique and compelling creative content. 
Our distinction in this area was recognized last month with 8 Golden Globe awards across our film and Television businesses, more than any of our peers. Twenty-First Century Fox film not only led the industry with Golden Globe wins, but currently dominates the competition for this year's Academy Awards with a total of 30 nominations, double our nearest competitor. 
The success in the content production business can be tough to deliver consistently, and this year, we have seen mixed results at our film studio. Financial results in The Martian were strong, but they were more than offset by less-than-anticipated results from several of our other releases. While our Film business is running and our financial expectations, we feel good about our releases moving forward. The Revenant and Kung Fu Panda 3 are currently performing well. Deadpool and [indiscernible] are slated for later this year and X-Men: Apocalypse and ID 4: Resurgence for resurgence for the fourth quarter. 
At our Television Production business, there is also good momentum. We are producing 36 scripted series this forecast season, including 20 returning and 16 new series. Many of the new shows are supporting the turnaround at the FOX Network, including the X-Files, which audience of over 21 million people surpassing the original series' most-watched season ever. Globally, the X-Files reached an impressive audience of more than 50 million viewers across our international network of FOX-owned channels. 
Developing and producing our own shows, which, in turn, drive enhanced ratings a number on platforms is a priority for us. 
Just this last week, one of our productions, The People versus O.J. Simpson, premiered to the highest ratings ever on FX, that is in all the key demos and in total people. 
What I have just described is at the core of our long-term value that we drive for shareholders, namely our ability to create, own and monetize the content that powers our global brands. 
Overall, we are pleased with the momentum at the majority of our  business. Our focus on building powerful brands, creating compelling content for consumers and driving advertising innovation continues to create meaningful long-term value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'd like to call our -- hand the call over to John."

To start out, I'll remind you that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky in November of 2014, our comparative reported financial results for the second quarter are not like-to-like. So as we've don",1134,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. To start out, I'll remind you that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky in November of 2014, our comparative reported financial results for the second quarter are not like-to-like. So as we've done in the past, we are providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in the prior period, and most my comments will follow on this adjusted basis. 
In the second quarter, adjusted revenues of $7.4 billion declined slightly from the year-ago quarter, as higher revenues at both our Cable Network and Television segments were offset by lower revenues at our Film business. Note that adverse foreign currency movements, combined with the absence of Shine, negatively impacted quarterly revenue comparisons by approximately $340 million in the aggregate. Absent these factors, our second quarter adjusted revenues would have increased 4% over the prior year.
Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.73 billion, a 2% increase over a year ago. This increase was led by the Cable Network segment and was partially offset by slightly lower results at our Television and Film segments. Overall, this quarter's EBITDA results include an approximate $110 million negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency movements, which reduced our comparative reported results in both our Cable Networks and Film segments. Absent this impact, our overall quarterly EBITDA growth rate would be 8.5%. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $674 million or $0.34 per share. Excluding the net income effects in both years of other net and equity earnings adjustments, primarily related to Sky's acquisitions and dispositions, second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.44 this year versus a comparable $0.53 a year ago. But as a reminder, last year's net income included the recognition of certain nonrecurring tax benefits of approximately $250 million or $0.12 per share.
So now let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the second quarter, and we'll start with the Cable Network segment, where total segment EBITDA of $1.25 billion was up 8% on segment revenue growth of 9%. Domestic revenues increased 11% in total, led by affiliate fee growth of 10% and advertising increases of 3%. Fox News and our domestic sports channels led the advertising world, posting double-digit increases, but this is partially offset by lower revenues at FX due to reduced ratings against the year-ago comp that included the final season of Sons of Anarchy. 
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher regional and national sports writes costs. Also note that the inclusion of the National Geographic Partners businesses that were acquired in November added approximately $70 million to quarterly other revenues and about the same to expenses. Those acquired businesses were not significant to second quarter EBITDA. 
Second quarter reported international cable revenues grew 6%, driven by a 15% increase in advertising revenues, with strong growth at both STAR and the Fox International Channels. Reported international affiliate revenues were essentially flat against the prior year, as low double-digit organic growth, led by FIC, was offset by negative foreign currency movements. Reported international channel EBITDA contributions increased 8% over the prior year period from strong local currency growth at both STAR and the Fox International Channels, which was partially offset by an approximate $60 million negative impact in foreign exchange. 
Turning to our Television segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $279 million, $11 million lower than a year ago. Revenues increased 6%, overall led by low double-digit ad revenue growth at the FOX Network and higher retransmission consent revenues. This overall revenue increase was achieved despite the cyclically lower political advertising revenues at the stations due to last year's midterm elections and 2 fewer World Series games this year versus last. The revenue gain was offset by increased programming expenses, principally from contractual step-ups in our NFL and MLB rates. 
At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA was $302 million, down $34 million versus last year. This quarter's higher contributions from the film studio, owing largely to the successful theatrical release of The Martian, were more than offset by lower TV production contributions. And those reduced contributions were from the substantial increase in the number of new first year series delivered and their related initial deficits as well as lower contributions from Sons of Anarchy, which aired its final season last year. 
Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted this quarter's segment EBITDA by approximately $50 million. Revenues decreased 14%, primarily reflecting both difficult home entertainment comparisons to last year's very successful releases, including X-Men: Days of Future Past and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes as well as the absence of revenues from China. 
Shifting over to capital management. From July 1 through today, we have repurchased approximately $3.5 billion worth of FOXA shares, of which approximately $3 billion has been against our buyback authorization of $5 billion. During the second quarter, we also completed our planned investments in National Geographic Partners and TV channels at STAR. In addition, in the quarter, we issued $1 billion of new debt, repaid $200 million in maturities and approximately $500 million of future maturities over the next year. 
At this halfway point in our fiscal year, there are a couple of obvious headwinds that will impact our full year performance outlook. First, we continue to be unfavorably impacted by foreign currency rate comparisons in our sizable international and cable -- international cable and film operations. While the local currency performance of these businesses is strong, the converted U.S. dollar amounts continue to be affected by the strengthened  dollar. Just for perspective, last August, when we gave full year guidance for fiscal 2016 earnings, we estimated that currency changes would negatively impact our growth rate by 3 percentage points or approximately $200 million based on exchange rates at that time. 
So far, in fiscal '16, currency rate movements have already adversely impacted the 6-month EBITDA results by approximately $220 million. And based on where exchange rates are today, the full year impact from currency movements will be approximately $350 million or nearly a 6 percentage point impact on our EBITDA growth. 
Additionally, it's clear that our content production businesses have underperformed our original plans, largely from the theatrical releases of most of our films so far despite the success of The Martian. 
So based on these principal factors and all of the assumptions inherent in our current outlook, we now expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2016 will be in the range of flat to up low single digits, above the $6.49 billion we reported for fiscal 2015. 
With that, let me turn it over to James."

As Lachlan said earlier, we're confident that the business is really on track to support our long-term objectives. However, 2 main factors, continued currency movement against us and disappointed commercial results in the Film business are simply too significant for us to offset over the next 6 months to hit our original near-term target. 
But if our only goal is to hit short-term targets, we'd pursue efforts like cutting programming costs at the expense of building future profits. That's not our approach. We think shareholder value is better built through long-term investment in growth. Our near-term outlook should not attract from the fact that in the first half of the year, we've accomplished much. We renegotiate or negotiated multi-year agreements with 2 of our largest U.S. distributors, successfully achieving pricing and revenue goals as well as providing for better products for customers. 
FBC had its highest in 4 years, and Fox News is at #1 across all cable channels. We completed the National Geographic Partners transaction and the acquisition of the broadcast business of [indiscernible] TV in India. We reorganized our international channels business as well as made significant strides in cost management across the company, as we reshape the company to best compete in the future. And as we start our second half, we're delivering our outstanding new content across our markets, including the X-Files, Lucifer, American Idol and Graceland at NBC, to name a few, The People versus OJ Simpson; American Crime Story and baskets and FX; a new season of commodity at start; and a strong postseason at the NFL, capping the second-most NFL season on FOX ever. 
At FBC, we're encouraged by the clear turnaround underway. Broadcast season to date primetime ratings are stabilized, and overall ad revenues to the network were up in the quarter. 
While linear ratings at FOX show much improvement, the more meaningful measure of video consumption is 30-day multiplatform viewing, which is up mid-single-digits season-to-date. Whether the show is being watched on a linear broadcast or a time-shifted basis, all viewers are alive, so all live viewers need to be measured. And in order to better monetize that viewing, we've been focused on innovation with new ad products and packaging options that are showing clear results. There's a sizable opportunity to monetize this audience, and its one that we're determined to seize. 
That said, the bulk of our broadcast revenue today is from linear advertising, and in the quarter, performance was strong. National scatter is up a 20% premium versus upfront, and local station markets were up 3% to 4% in the second quarter, excluding political spending. 
Lachlan commented earlier on the production businesses. And while we've fallen behind our earlier expectations, we continue to invest in developing and producing the creative assets that will drive the business in the future. 
At our nonconsolidated businesses, we're making good progress, too. In fact, SKY recently reported first half fiscal 2016 earnings the 10% earnings-per-share growth, driven by the addition of 337,000 new customers in the December quarter. And Hulu also continues to grow, deepening its content offering and adding customers. Hulu is an important platform for us to roll out our targeted and interacted at capabilities and new ad-free packaging for customers, initiatives that are off to a great start. 
So our team is much work to do, the progress we've made in the quarter against our long-term goal has been good. And we think the key fundamentals to our long-term success are in place. Investments in our brands are reaping rewards. Our international portfolio continues to flourish, particularly at STAR in India. Our sports and news audiences are expanding. Our U.S. broadcast businesses are stabilizing, and we're implementing solutions to improve monetization. And while short-term film performance is obviously a disappointment, the business is fundamentally sound. And the Twenty-First Century Fox Television strength in several new series will add considerable value for years to come. 
As I said at the outset, shareholder value is built through long-term investment in growth, and we, in this exciting time for our company and industry, are confident we have the right assets and strategies in place to achieve that goal. 
With that, we're very happy to take your questions."

I think Hulu is going to continue develop and we are very focused that Hulu is there a focus in how to continue to innovate in terms of products and packaging to expand its offerings and growth to larger segments. So I think as an distributor of our programming, we think it is reported we think we are, we're really happy to push it forward. With that said, we're also very focused on distributing in products and our programs through our other clients and other distributors, the MVPs and others. And with respect to stacking rights with respect to all of the set of construct of the SVOD windows, we are very, very focused on, first and foremost, creating a customer expense run our product is the earlier good, creating ease and discoverability, if you will, so they can find a product and get into the right type. We are interested in having fewer holdbacks outside the SVOD window so that we can actually provide a better product for customers and provide our MVPD and over-the-top distributors with a better ability to deliver great product experience. So I don't think those 2 things are incompatible at all. I think we have to see our distributors, be it on the servitor like Hulu, or a traditional facilities Mr. Sitter like cable company, if intention from our customers perspective, package those products is to be great. Discovered a program in the right way. But we also need to be, as a supplier, able to take a brand for those platforms and have more flexibility with respect to how their product is found, how it's stacked, how it's consumed, more flexibility with respect to how advertising innovation works and what we can do as well as, I think, understanding of did a good abilities, understand was using our products particularly as the streaming element or the time shifted element grows at such a big cliff because that's a really important part. So I don't think those 2 things are mutually exclusive anyway, and we're very excited that Hulu is really set the pace of innovation and a lot of these areas."

With respect to STAR, the landscape for sports rights in the near-term really probably dominated by what happens with the BCCI, the Domestic Board of Control for India and the IPL, the pro Cricket League domestically there. And we have pretty have a chitchat over the next couple of years. I think in the next year, the IPL picture becomes clearer. That's something we don't hold today. But fundamentally, there's nothing that we see out there that we feel would necessitate us for our adjusting our goals for the business. It's a margin perspective an absolute profit perspective over the next 4 to 5 years. The STAR business is going very strong. And while there are some of those lumpy sports rights out there, we're really through the peak investment in those, as we've said before. And with respect to Thursday Night Football, as you would expect, we're a partner of the NFL, and we're very happy partner with NFL. And as all players were -- discussions around Thursday Night Football, ultimately, the NFL and NBC and CBS were able to get a deal on there. We're very happy with where we are with NFL. Our Sunday package is something that's very, very strong. As I said in my comments earlier, this NFL season with our second best ever, and we feel very strong going forward with those rights well into the next decade."

Our first half of the year is always a big working capital investment period. We got the biggest billings for the NFL for our fall season, and in this year, for a particularly large number of releases that were in the last 2 quarters of the calendar year. So it's just traditional for us to have a big, big receivable and working capital investment. It also is that our inventory, as you know, we make all of the NFL payments, as an example, before the end of the calendar year, with the biggest games happening really after the calendar year of postseason, et cetera. So looking at this period, it's not unusual at all as against our working capital buildup would be in any 6-month -- December period. For the year, we're still at the same place. Working capital level, we expect to be about the same as the year ago. So we're consistent in that regard from what I said back in August. To remind you, our targets were to have a $2 billion to $3 billion cash balance and 2.5 to 3x leverage, gross leverage on our balance sheet. And as we look through the year, to the end of the fiscal year, we'll start approaching those levels there or thereabouts in the next -- around that time or 6 months after that. And then as far as the -- story, as far as the credit markets, we continue to have long-dated bonds. We look at maturities.

The key thing for us is how do we invest in the capabilities to monetize that viewing, measure it and monetize it the right way. And I think we would look at investing to create those capabilities as we have, for example, with the formation of our advanced ad products, scoop, et cetera, which is making a headway in streaming. I think if you look at the mobile piece for us really just part of the overall streaming landscape as opposed to brand-new types of content for us, et cetera. First the priority is how we execute whatever grade of asset today as well as we can, make the more available not less to customers and how do we really innovate and get better capabilities in terms of how we then monetize that platform going forward. And then in discrete places, whether there's a real big opportunity, we would start a new business. If we look at something like in India, the hot STAR business is a mobile Internet-only video platform, which we launched early this year, I should say, early last year, which has really gotten off to a good start. And that's sports and entertainment platform that is growing very, very rapidly from a mobile consumption point of the in India. And we would look at individual brands being able to embrace those kinds of opportunities going forward."

So how do you feel about your need to invest in your own technological expertise to compete with them on that front? And then second, on the regional sports networks, you've talk about how you like the tribal element. The investor concern seems to be around everybody paying for the RSNs at a certain price.

And we've also been investing in our capabilities, which are improving around domestically here in the U.S., direct-to-customer distribution with our authenticated apps, for example, and other platform. So we think that's an investment that ongoing, and it will continue. And around the world, we're we are heavier in direct-to-customer business and product-oriented businesses, for example, the guys business, it's very heavy investment in technology that we actually bears real fruit in terms of creating a product for customers that they really like the mustard investment technology referred to believe has a bearing on their production and are accretive assets and getting into original production. I think that's kind of a different issue.  We feel very good about our ability to do that. I think, in the future, as we do today, we're going to see a continued competition for talent, continued competition for storytellers and a continued real appetite for various players to invest. And there'll be multiple Internet TV companies doing that, including our own. So I don't think the investment technology necessarily has a bearing on that creative output. Or the competitive dynamic that you mentioned, but clearly does have a bearing on the product set for consumers, how they are and how you can monetize there as well. And to your second question with the RSNs, I think, at this point, we feel pretty good about RSN pricing. Where we are anyway, I can't speak with the overall market. And as I said in the renewal of recent institution agreements earlier, we're able to achieve our goal there. For example, pricing in elasticity for the hard-core fan is something that probably is some pricing elasticity there. There's a pay a lot. But I think you have to remember that the RSNs are very broad. They're not just for super fans. The RSNs in many of our markets are the #1 rated broadcast platforms in their market, particularly in baseball season, where you see markets like St. Louis for example beating all broadcast networks on those game nights. So I think it's a very, very broad offering and one that we try to price and that there is me that we can that provides both, returns for our partners, the teams  in those businesses but also a fair price for distributed that they can pass on to consumers the right way."

After my remarks, I'll turn the call over to John and James, and then we'll take your questions. 
Despite some near-term challenges, most specifically due to foreign exchange and disappointing results at our Film division, we are making good progress on our objectives across the group. The core growth strategies that will move our business forward over the long term, building powerful brands that offer great value to our customers, delivering great storytelling, must-have news and sports and innovating in advertising and packaging are delivering real results for the business. 
Domestic affiliate revenues increased strongly in the quarter. This predictable revenue underpins our financial position. Even in an environment with an increasing number of viewing options, our affiliate revenues continued to grow. This underscores the strong demand for and the value of our brands. Developing these brands has been a key strategic priority for us. We believe the work we have done and the investments we have made render our portfolio indispensable for any broad consumer offering, whether established or emerging. The expansion of our National Geographic partnership is an important milestone in the execution of this strategy. 
Our overall domestic multichannel subscribers continue to grow, increasing in aggregate by 1% over the prior year quarter, this despite the fact that the average fully distributed channel in the MVPD universe lost around 2% of their subscribers over the same period. And we are seeing strong momentum in high-growth international markets like of STAR in India, where we continue to expand our customer base and our offerings. 
While foreign currency headwinds are creating short-term issues, they reflect the size and scale of our international businesses, which are increasingly well positioned. The strength of our global brands is, of course, a direct result of our success in creating unique and compelling creative content. 
Our distinction in this area was recognized last month with 8 Golden Globe awards across our Film and Television businesses, more than any of our peers. 20th Century Fox Film not only led the industry with Golden Globe wins, but currently dominates the competition for this year's Academy Awards with a total of 30 nominations, double our nearest competitor.
But success in the content production business can be tough to deliver consistently, and this year, we have seen mixed results at our film studio. Financial results in The Martian were strong, but they were more than offset by less-than-anticipated results from several of our other releases. While our Film business is running behind our financial expectations, we feel good about our releases moving forward. The Revenant and Kung Fu Panda 3 are currently performing well. Deadpool and Eddie the Eagle are slated for later this year, and X-Men: Apocalypse and ID 4: Resurgence for the fourth quarter. 
At our television production business, there was also good momentum. We are producing 36 scripted series this forecast season, including 20 returning and 16 new series. Many of the new shows are supporting the turnaround at the FOX Network, including the X-Files, which drew an audience of over 21 million people surpassing the original series' most-watched season ever. Globally, the X-Files reached an impressive audience of more than 50 million viewers across our international network of FOX-owned channels. 
Developing and producing our own shows, which in turn drive enhanced ratings on our platforms, is a priority for us. Just this last week, one of our productions, The People v. O.J. Simpson, premiered to the highest ratings ever on FX. That is in all the key demos and in total people. 
What I have just described is at the core of our long-term value that we drive for shareholders, namely our ability to create, own and monetize hit content that powers our global brands. 
Overall, we are pleased with the momentum at the majority of our  business. Our focus on building powerful brands, creating compelling content for consumers and driving advertising innovation continues to create meaningful long-term value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'd like to call our -- hand the call over to John."

So as we've don",1141,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. To start out, I'll remind you that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky in November of 2014, our comparative reported financial results for the second quarter are not like-to-like. So as we've done in the past, we're providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in the prior period, and most of my comments that follow will be on this adjusted basis.
In the second quarter, adjusted revenues of $7.4 billion declined slightly from the year ago quarter, as higher revenues at both our Cable Network and Television segments were offset by lower revenues at our Film business. Note that adverse foreign currency movements, combined with the absence of Shine, negatively impacted quarterly revenue comparisons by approximately $340 million in the aggregate. Absent these factors, our second quarter adjusted revenues would have increased 4% over the prior year.
Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.73 billion, a 2% increase over a year ago. This increase was led by the Cable Network segment and was partially offset by slightly lower results at our Television and Film segments. Overall, this quarter's EBITDA results include an approximate $110 million negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency movements, which reduced our comparative reported results in both our Cable Networks and Film segments. Absent this impact, our overall quarterly EBITDA growth rate would be 8.5%. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $674 million or $0.34 per share. Excluding the net income effects in both years of other net and equity earnings adjustments, primarily related to Sky's acquisitions and dispositions, second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.44 this year versus a comparable $0.53 a year ago. But as a reminder, last year's net income included the recognition of certain non-recurring tax benefits of approximately $250 million or $0.12 per share.
So now let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the second quarter, and we'll start with the Cable Network segment, where total segment EBITDA of $1.25 billion was up 8% on segment revenue growth of 9%. Domestic revenues increased 11% in total, led by affiliate fee growth of 10% and advertising increases of 3%. Fox News and our domestic sports channels led the advertising growth, posting double-digit increases, but this is partially offset by lower revenues at FX due to reduced ratings against a year-ago comp that included the final season of Sons of Anarchy. 
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher regional and national sports rights costs. Also note that the inclusion of the National Geographic Partners businesses that were acquired in November added approximately $70 million to quarterly other revenues and about the same to expenses. So those acquired businesses were not significant to second quarter EBITDA. 
Second quarter reported international cable revenues grew 6%, driven by a 15% increase in advertising revenues, with strong growth at both STAR and the Fox International Channels. Reported international affiliate revenues were essentially flat against the prior year, as low double-digit organic growth, led by FIC, was offset by negative foreign currency movements. Reported international channel EBITDA contributions increased 8% over the prior year period from strong local currency growth at both STAR and the Fox International Channels, which was partially offset by an approximate $60 million negative impact in foreign exchange. 
Turning to our Television segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $279 million, $11 million lower than a year ago. Revenues increased 6%, overall led by low double-digit ad revenue growth at the FOX Network and higher retransmission consent revenues. This overall revenue increase was achieved despite the cyclically lower political advertising revenues at the stations due to last year's mid-term elections and 2 fewer World Series games this year versus last. The revenue gain was offset by increased programming expenses, principally from contractual step-ups in our NFL and MLB rates. 
At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA was $302 million, down $34 million versus last year. This quarter's higher contributions from the film studio, owing largely to the successful theatrical release of The Martian, were more than offset by lower TV production contributions. And those reduced contributions were from the substantial increase in the number of new first year series delivered and their related initial deficits as well as lower contributions from Sons of Anarchy, which aired its final season last year. 
Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted this quarter's segment EBITDA by approximately $50 million. Revenues decreased 14%, primarily reflecting both difficult home entertainment comparisons to last year's very successful releases, including X-Men: Days of Future Past and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes as well as the absence of revenues from Shine. 
Shifting over to capital management. From July 1 through today, we've repurchased approximately $3.5 billion worth of FOX A shares, of which approximately $3 billion has been against our buyback authorization of $5 billion.
During the second quarter, we also completed our planned investments in National Geographic Partners and the MAA TV channels at STAR. In addition, in the quarter, we issued $1 billion of new debt, repaid $200 million in maturities and of approximately $500 million of future maturities over the next year. 
At this halfway point in our fiscal year, there are a couple of obvious headwinds that will impact our full year performance outlook. First, we continue to be unfavorably impacted by foreign currency rate comparisons in our sizable international and cable -- international cable and film operations. While the local currency performance of these businesses is strong, the converted U.S. dollar amounts continue to be affected by the strengthened  dollar. Just for perspective, last August, when we gave full year guidance for fiscal 2016 earnings, we estimated that currency changes would negatively impact our growth rate by 3 percentage points or approximately $200 million based on exchange rates at that time. 
So far, in fiscal '16, currency rate movements have already adversely impacted the 6-month EBITDA results by approximately $220 million. And based on where exchange rates are today, the full year impact from currency movements will be approximately $350 million or nearly a 6 percentage point impact on our EBITDA growth. 
Additionally, it's clear that our content production businesses have underperformed our original plans, largely from the theatrical releases of most of our films so far despite the success of The Martian. 
So based on these principal factors and all of the assumptions inherent in our current outlook, we now expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2016 will be in the range of flat to up low single digits, above the $6.49 billion we reported for fiscal 2015. 
With that, let me turn it over to James."

As Lachlan said earlier, we're confident that the business is really on track to support our long-term objectives. However, 2 main factors, continued currency movement against us and disappointed commercial results in the Film business, are simply too significant for us to offset over the next 6 months to hit our original near-term target. 
But if our only goal is to hit short-term targets, we'd pursue efforts like cutting programming costs at the expense of building future profits. That's not our approach. We think shareholder value is better built through long-term investment in growth. Our near-term outlook should not detract from the fact that in the first half of the year, we've accomplished much. We renegotiate or negotiated multi-year agreements with 2 of our largest U.S. distributors, successfully achieving pricing and revenue goals as well as providing for better products for customers. 
FBC had its highest rated autumn in 4 years, and Fox News is at #1 across all cable channels. We completed the National Geographic Partners transaction and the acquisition of the broadcast business of MAA TV in India. We reorganized our international channels business as well as made significant strides in cost management across the company, as we reshape the company to best compete in the future.
And as we start our second half, we're delivering outstanding new content across our markets, including the X-Files, Lucifer, American Idol and Grease: Live at FBC to name a few. The People v. O.J. Simpson, the American Crime Story, and Baskets at FX; a new season of commodity at STAR; and a strong postseason at the NFL, capping the second-most watch NFL season on FOX ever. 
At FBC, we're encouraged by the clear turnaround underway. Broadcast season to-date primetime ratings are stabilized, and overall ad revenues for the network were up in the quarter. 
While linear ratings at FOX show much improvement, the more meaningful measure of video consumption is 30-day multiplatform viewing, which is up mid-single digits season-to-date. Whether the show is being watched on linear broadcast or a time-shifted basis, all viewers are alive, so all live viewers need to be measured. And in order to better monetize that viewing, we've been focused on innovation with new ad products and packaging options that are showing clear results. There's a sizable opportunity to monetize this audience, and its one that we're determined to seize. 
That said, the bulk of our broadcast revenue today is from linear advertising, and in the quarter, performance was strong. National scatter is up a 20% premium versus upfront, and local station markets were up 3% to 4% in the second quarter, excluding political spending. 
Lachlan commented earlier on our production businesses. And while we've fallen behind our earlier expectations, we continue to invest in developing and producing the creative assets that will drive the business in the future. 
At our non-consolidated businesses, we're making good progress, too. In fact, SKY recently reported first half fiscal 2016 earnings with 10% earnings per share growth, driven by the addition of 337,000 new customers in the December quarter. And Hulu also continues to grow, deepening its content offering and adding customers. Hulu is an important platform for us to roll out our targeted and interact at capabilities and new ad-free packaging for customers, initiatives that are off to a great start. 
So our team has much work to do. The progress we've made in the quarter against our long-term goals has been good. And we think the key fundamentals to our long-term success are in place. Investments in our brands are reaping rewards. Our international portfolio continues to flourish, particularly at STAR in India. Our sports and news audiences are expanding. Our U.S. broadcast business is stabilizing, and we're implementing solutions to improve monetization. And while short-term film performance is obviously a disappointment, the business is fundamentally sound. And the Twenty-First Century Fox Television, the strength of several new series will add considerable value for years to come. 
As I said at the outset, shareholder value is built through long-term investment in growth, and we, in this exciting time for our company and industry, are confident we have the right assets and strategies in place to achieve that goal. 
With that, we're very happy to take your questions."

Look, I think, as I said, Hulu is an important asset for us, and it's one that we're excited to see the growth, and I think all the partners would say that. And we're excited to see the real innovation that's happening at Hulu in terms of creating new options for customers, both with respect to add innovation, new ways to monetize inventory there as well as these ad-free options, the ad-free tier that actually is going well. I think Hulu is going to continue to develop, and I think we're very focused and Hulu is very focused on how it continues to innovate in terms of products and packaging to expand its offerings and grow into larger segments. So I think as a distributor of our programming, we think Hulu is very important and we think it's a good distributor of our programming, and we're really happy to push it forward. With that said, we're also very focused on distributing our products and our programs through our other clients and other distributors, the MVPDs and others. And with respect to stacking rights with respect to all of the set of this construct of the SVOD windows, we're very, very focused on, first and foremost, creating a customer experience around our product that's very, very god. creating an ease of discoverability, if you will, so they can find the product and get it at the right time. We are interested in having fewer holdbacks outside the SVOD window so that we can actually provide a better product for customers and provide our MVPD and over-the-top distributors with a better ability to deliver a good product experience. So I don't think those 2 things are incompatible at all, and I think we have to see our distributors, be it an online distributor like Hulu, or a traditional facilities-based distributor, like the cable company. I think actually from a customers' perspective, the package of those products just needs to be great, maybe able to discover the programs in the right way. But we also need to be, as a supplier, able to take our brands to those platforms and have more flexibility with respect to how their product is found, how it's stacked, how it's consumed, more flexibility with respect to how advertising innovation works and what we can do as well as, I think, an understanding of data capabilities to understand who's using our products particularly as the streaming element or the time-shifted element grows at such a big cliff because that's a really important part. So I don't think those 2 things are mutually exclusive in anyway, and we're very excited that Hulu is able to really set pace the in terms of innovation and a lot of these areas."

With respect to the whole question of overall affiliate universe and the subscriber universe of the MVPDs, as John mentioned in his comments, obviously, the total universe for extended basic for those MVPDs has contracted. We continue to see growth. Our networks are distributed at different levels, each one different to another. Some of them were young like Fox Sports 1, some of the Nat Geo brands. And some are more fully distributed. So we have pretty good visibility on reasonable growth going forward. And I think the things like minimum distribution guarantees, et cetera, haven't been really impacted, at least in our latest negotiations and latest renewals, and we think that's encouraging."

I think you had said similar this year to last year, but you're running, I believe, quite a bit above that in the first 6 months. And I didn't know if what's happened in the marketplace on the credit market front had changed the company's perspective on leverage or cash balance. Just maybe you could remind us on that. And then one unrelated since you've called out Film performance this year being less than expected. [indiscernible] to ask about whether there's an update on Avatar timing. What that looks like at this point?"
91031,323348679,928676,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2016",2016-02-08,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Okay, Ben, thanks. I'll handle the cash pieces of it. Our first half of the year is always a big working capital investment period. We got the biggest billings for the NFL for our fall season, and in this year, for a particularly large number of releases",290,"Okay, Ben, thanks. I'll handle the cash pieces of it. Our first half of the year is always a big working capital investment period. We got the biggest billings for the NFL for our fall season, and in this year, for a particularly large number of releases that were in the last 2 quarters of the calendar year. So it's just traditional for us to have a big, big receivable and working capital investment. It also is it require inventory because as you know, we make all of the NFL payments, as an example, before the end of the calendar year, with the biggest games happening really after the calendar year with postseason, et cetera. So looking at this period, it's not unusual at all as against where our working capital buildup would be in any 6-month -- December period. For the year, we're still at the same place. Working capital level, we expect to be about the same as the year ago. So we're consistent in that regard from what I said back in August. To remind you, our targets were to have a $2 billion to $3 billion cash balance and 2.5 to 3x leverage, gross leverage on our balance sheet. And as we look through the year, to the end of the fiscal year, we'll start approaching those levels there or thereabouts in the next -- around that time or 6 months after that. And then as far as the -- sorry, as far as the credit markets, we continue to have long-dated bonds. We look at our maturities. And unless we have a capital need, which isn't present right now, we're not accessing the capital markets in any unusual way, given where they are right now."

I think, first of all, I would just say that what we're really focused on is making our programming, the creative assets that we make available and as wide a way as possible, and mobile is increasingly an important part of that as we look at TV Everywhere-type applications like Sky Go in Europe, for example, increasingly consumed on mobile phones and tablets, as well as consumption in the U.S. growing of video entertainment or audiovisual entertainment on mobile platforms. The key thing for us is how do we invest in the capabilities to monetize that viewing, measure it and monetize it the right way. And I think we would look at investing to create those capabilities as we have, for example, with the formation of our advanced ad products, scoop, et cetera, which is making a headway in streaming. I think that I would like at the mobile piece for us really just part of the overall streaming landscape as opposed to brand-new types of content for us, et cetera. First the priority is how we execute without creative assets today as well as we can, make the more available not less to customers and how do we really innovate and get better capabilities in terms of how we then monetize that platform going forward. And then in discrete places, whether there's a real big opportunity, we would start a new business. If we look at something like in India, the hotstar business is a mobile Internet-only video platform, which we launched early this year or, I should say, early last year, which has really gotten off to a good start. And that's a sports and entertainment platform that is growing very, very rapidly from a mobile consumption point of view in India. And we would look at individual brands really being able to embrace those kinds of opportunities going forward."

So how do you feel about your need to invest in your own technological expertise to compete with them on that front? And then second, on the regional sports networks, you've talked about how you like the tribal element. The investor concern seems to be around everybody paying for the RSNs at a certain price. But maybe from your perspective, how do you look at the price elasticity's there for the true fan who wants that network?

Look, with respect to investment in technology, we invest constantly in the technology around delivering a better product to customers where we can. We've definitely been doing that with respect to advertising innovation, investing in that creating new capabilitiesthere. And we've also been investing in our capabilities, which are improving around domestically here in the U.S., direct-to-customer distribution with our authenticated apps, for example, and other platform. So we think there is an investment in technology that's ongoing, and it will continue. And then around the world, where we are -- where we're heavier in direct-to-customer businesses and product-oriented businesses, for example, of the Sky businesses, it's very heavy investment in technology that we actually bears real fruit in terms of creating products for customers that they really like. I'm not sure that the investment in technology referred to believe has a bearing on the production of creative assets and getting into original production. I think that's kind of a different issue.  We feel very good about our ability to do that. I think, in the future, as we did today, we're going to see a continued competition for talent, continued competition for storytellers and a continued real appetite for various players to invest. And there'll be multiple Internet TV companies doing that, including our own. So I don't think the investment in technology necessarily has a bearing on that creative output. Or the competitive dynamic that you mentioned, but it clearly does have a bearing on the product set for consumers, how they are and how you can monetize there as well. And as to your second question with the RSNs, I think, at this point, we feel pretty good about RSN pricing, where we are anyway, I can't speak with the overall market. And as I said in the renewal of recent distribution agreements earlier, we're able to achieve our goals there. For example, pricing in elasticity for the hard-core fan is something that there probably is some price inelasticity there. There's a stand [ph] that would pay a lot. But I think you have to remember that the RSNs are very broad. They're not just for super fans. The RSNs in many of our markets are the #1 rated broadcast platforms in their market, particularly in baseball season, where you see markets like St. Louis for example beating all broadcast networks on those game nights. So I think it's a very, very broad offering and one that we try to price in the fairest way that we can that provides both returns for our partners, the teams in those businesses but also a fair price for the distributors that they can pass on to consumers in the right way."

After my remarks, I'll turn the call over to John and James, and then we'll take your questions. 
Despite some near-term challenges, most specifically due to foreign exchange and disappointing results at our Film division, we are making good progress on our objectives across the group. The core growth strategies that will move our business forward over the long term, building powerful brands that offer great value to our customers, delivering great storytelling, must-have news and sports and innovating in advertising and packaging are delivering real results for the business. 
Domestic affiliate revenues increased strongly in the quarter. This predictable revenue underpins our financial position. Even in an environment with an increasing number of viewing options, our affiliate revenues continued to grow. This underscores the strong demand for and the value of our brands. Developing these brands has been a key strategic priority for us. We believe the work we have done and the investments we have made render our portfolio indispensable for any broad consumer offering, whether established or emerging. The expansion of our National Geographic partnership is an important milestone in the execution of this strategy. 
Our overall domestic multichannel subscribers continue to grow, increasing in aggregate by 1% over the prior year quarter, this despite the fact that the average fully distributed channel in the MVPD universe lost around 2% of their subscribers over the same period. And we are seeing strong momentum in high-growth international markets, like of STAR in India, where we continue to expand our customer base and our offerings. 
While foreign currency headwinds are creating short-term issues, they reflect the size and scale of our international businesses, which are increasingly well positioned. The strength of our global brands is, of course, a direct result of our success in creating unique and compelling creative content. 
Our distinction in this area was recognized last month with 8 Golden Globe awards across our Film and Television businesses, more than any of our peers. 20th Century Fox Film not only led the industry with Golden Globe wins, but currently dominates the competition for this year's Academy Awards with a total of 30 nominations, double our nearest competitor.
But success in the content production business can be tough to deliver consistently, and this year, we have seen mixed results at our film studio. Financial results in The Martian were strong, but they were more than offset by less-than-anticipated results from several of our other releases. While our Film business is running behind our financial expectations, we feel good about our releases moving forward. The Revenant and Kung Fu Panda 3 are currently performing well. Deadpool and Eddie the Eagle are slated for later this quarter, and X-Men: Apocalypse and ID 4: Resurgence for the fourth quarter. 
At our television production business, there was also good momentum. We are producing 36 scripted series this broadcast season, including 20 returning and 16 new series. Many of the new shows are supporting the turnaround at the FOX Network, including the X-Files, which drew an audience of over 21 million, people surpassing the original series' most-watched season ever. Globally, the X-Files reached an impressive audience of more than 50 million viewers across our international network of FOX-owned channels. 
Developing and producing our own shows, which in turn drive enhanced ratings on our platforms, is a priority for us. Just this last week, one of our productions, The People v. O.J. Simpson, premiered to the highest ratings ever on FX. That is in all the key demos and in total people. 
What I have just described is at the core of our long-term value that we drive for shareholders, namely our ability to create, own and monetize hit content that powers our global brands. 
Overall, we are pleased with the momentum at the majority of our businesses. Our focus on building powerful brands, creating compelling content for consumers and driving advertising innovation continues to create meaningful long-term value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'd like to call our -- hand the call over to John."
91031,323348679,928705,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2016",2016-02-08,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. To start out, I'll remind you that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky in November of 2014, our comparative reported financial results for the second quarter are not like-to-like. So as we've don",1142,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. To start out, I'll remind you that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky in November of 2014, our comparative reported financial results for the second quarter are not like-to-like. So as we've done in the past, we're providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in the prior period, and most of my comments that follow will be on this adjusted basis.
In the second quarter, adjusted revenues of $7.4 billion declined slightly from the year ago quarter, as higher revenues at both our Cable Network and Television segments were offset by lower revenues at our Film business. Note that adverse foreign currency movements, combined with the absence of Shine, negatively impacted quarterly revenue comparisons by approximately $340 million in the aggregate. Absent these factors, our second quarter adjusted revenues would have increased 4% over the prior year.
Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.73 billion, a 2% increase over a year ago. This increase was led by the Cable Network segment and was partially offset by slightly lower results at our Television and Film segments. Overall, this quarter's EBITDA results include an approximate $110 million negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency movements, which reduced our comparative reported results in both our Cable Networks and Film segments. Absent this impact, our overall quarterly EBITDA growth rate would be 8.5%. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $674 million or $0.34 per share. Excluding the net income effects in both years of other net and equity earnings adjustments, primarily related to Sky's acquisitions and dispositions, second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.44 this year versus a comparable $0.53 a year ago. But as a reminder, last year's net income included the recognition of certain non-recurring tax benefits of approximately $250 million or $0.12 per share.
So now let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the second quarter, and we'll start with the Cable Network segment, where total segment EBITDA of $1.25 billion was up 8% on segment revenue growth of 9%. Domestic revenues increased 11% in total, led by affiliate fee growth of 10% and advertising increases of 3%. Fox News and our domestic sports channels led the advertising growth, posting double-digit percentage increases, but this is partially offset by lower revenues at FX due to reduced ratings against a year-ago comp that included the final season of Sons of Anarchy. 
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher regional and national sports rights costs. Also note that the inclusion of the National Geographic Partners businesses that were acquired in November added approximately $70 million to quarterly other revenues and about the same to expenses. So those acquired businesses were not significant to second quarter EBITDA. 
Second quarter reported international cable revenues grew 6%, driven by a 15% increase in advertising revenues, with strong growth at both STAR and the Fox International Channels. Reported international affiliate revenues were essentially flat against the prior year, as low double-digit organic growth, led by FIC, was offset by negative foreign currency movements. Reported international channel EBITDA contributions increased 8% over the prior year period from strong local currency growth at both STAR and the Fox International Channels, which was partially offset by an approximate $60 million negative impact in foreign exchange. 
Turning to our Television segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $279 million, $11 million lower than a year ago. Revenues increased 6%, overall led by low double-digit ad revenue growth at the FOX Network and higher retransmission consent revenues. This overall revenue increase was achieved despite the cyclically lower political advertising revenues at the stations due to last year's mid-term elections and 2 fewer World Series games this year versus last. The revenue gain was offset by increased programming expenses, principally from contractual step-ups in our NFL and MLB rates. 
At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA was $302 million, down $34 million versus last year. This quarter's higher contributions from the film studio, owing largely to the successful theatrical release of The Martian, were more than offset by lower TV production contributions. And those reduced contributions were from the substantial increase in the number of new first year series delivered and their related initial deficits as well as lower contributions from Sons of Anarchy, which aired its final season last year. 
Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted this quarter's segment EBITDA by approximately $50 million. Revenues decreased 14%, primarily reflecting both difficult home entertainment comparisons to last year's very successful releases, including X-Men: Days of Future Past and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes as well as the absence of revenues from Shine. 
Shifting over to capital management. From July 1 through today, we've repurchased approximately $3.5 billion worth of FOX A shares, of which approximately $3 billion has been against our buyback authorization of $5 billion.
During the second quarter, we also completed our planned investments in National Geographic Partners and the MAA TV channels at STAR. In addition, in the quarter, we issued $1 billion of new debt, repaid $200 million in maturities and have approximately $500 million of future maturities over the next year. 
At this halfway point in our fiscal year, there are a couple of obvious headwinds that will impact our full year performance outlook. First, we continue to be unfavorably impacted by foreign currency rate comparisons in our sizable international and cable -- international cable and film operations. While the local currency performance of these businesses is strong, the converted U.S. dollar amounts continue to be affected by the strengthened  dollar. Just for perspective, last August, when we gave full year guidance for fiscal 2016 earnings, we estimated that currency changes would negatively impact our growth rate by 3 percentage points or approximately $200 million based on exchange rates at that time. 
So far, in fiscal '16, currency rate movements have already adversely impacted the 6-month EBITDA results by approximately $220 million. And based on where exchange rates are today, the full year impact from currency movements will be approximately $350 million or nearly a 6 percentage point impact on our EBITDA growth. 
Additionally, it's clear that our content production businesses have underperformed our original plans, largely from the theatrical releases of most of our films so far despite the success of The Martian. 
So based on these principal factors and all of the assumptions inherent in our current outlook, we now expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2016 will be in the range of flat to up low single digits, above the $6.49 billion we reported for fiscal 2015. 
With that, let me turn it over to James."

As Lachlan said earlier, we're confident that the business is really on track to support our long-term objectives. However, 2 main factors, continued currency movement against us and disappointing commercial results",715,"Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone. As Lachlan said earlier, we're confident that the business is really on track to support our long-term objectives. However, 2 main factors, continued currency movement against us and disappointing commercial results in the Film business, are simply too significant for us to offset over the next 6 months to hit our original near-term target. 
But if our only goal is to hit short-term targets, we'd pursue efforts like cutting programming costs at the expense of building future profits. That's not our approach. We think shareholder value is better built through long-term investment in growth. Our near-term outlook should not detract from the fact that in the first half of the year, we've accomplished much. We renegotiated or negotiated multi-year agreements with 2 of our largest U.S. distributors, successfully achieving pricing and revenue goals as well as providing for better products for customers. 
FBC had its highest rated autumn in 4 years, and Fox News is ranked #1 across all cable channels. We completed the National Geographic Partners transaction and the acquisition of the broadcast business of MAA TV in India. We reorganized our international channels business as well as made significant strides in cost management across the company, as we reshape the company to best compete in the future.
And as we start our second half, we're delivering outstanding new content across our markets, including the X-Files, Lucifer, American Idol and Grease: Live at FBC to name a few. The People v. O.J. Simpson, the American Crime Story, and Baskets at FX; a new season of Kabaddi at STAR; and a strong postseason at the NFL, capping the second-most watched NFL season on FOX ever. 
At FBC, we're encouraged by the clear turnaround underway. Broadcast season to-date primetime ratings are stabilized, and overall ad revenues for the network were up in the quarter. 
While linear ratings at FOX show much improvement, the more meaningful measure of video consumption is 30-day multiplatform viewing, which is up mid-single digits season-to-date. Whether the show is being watched on linear broadcast or a time-shifted basis, all viewers are alive, so all live viewers need to be measured. And in order to better monetize that viewing, we've been focused on innovation with new ad products and packaging options that are showing clear results. There's a sizable opportunity to monetize this audience, and it's one that we're determined to seize. 
That said, the bulk of our broadcast revenue today is from linear advertising, and in the quarter, performance was strong. National scatter is up a 20% premium versus upfronts, and local station markets were up 3% to 4% in the second quarter, excluding political spending. 
Lachlan commented earlier on our production businesses. And while we've fallen behind our earlier expectations, we continue to invest in developing and producing the creative assets that will drive the business in the future. 
At our non-consolidated businesses, we're making good progress, too. In fact, SKY recently reported first half fiscal 2016 earnings with 10% earnings per share growth, driven by the addition of 337,000 new customers in the December quarter. And Hulu also continues to grow, deepening its content offering and adding customers. Hulu is an important platform for us to roll out our targeted and interactive ad capabilities and new ad-free packaging for customers, initiatives that are off to a great start. 
So our team has much work to do. The progress we've made in the quarter against our long-term goals has been good. And we think the key fundamentals to our long-term success are in place. Investments in our brands are reaping rewards. Our international portfolio continues to flourish, particularly at STAR in India. Our sports and news audiences are expanding. Our U.S. broadcast business is stabilizing, and we're implementing solutions to improve monetization. And while short-term film performance is obviously a disappointment, the business is fundamentally sound. And the Twenty-First Century Fox Television, the strength of several new series will add considerable value for years to come. 
As I said at the outset, shareholder value is built through long-term investment in growth, and we, in this exciting time for our company and industry, are confident we have the right assets and strategies in place to achieve that goal. 
With that, we're very happy to take your questions."

Look, I think, as I said, Hulu is an important asset for us, and it's one that we're excited to see the growth, and I think all the partners would say that. And we're excited to see the real innovation that's happening at Hulu in terms of creating new options for customers, both with respect to ad innovation, new ways to monetize inventory there as well as these ad-free options, the ad-free tier that actually is going well. I think Hulu is going to continue to develop, and I think we're very focused and Hulu is very focused on how it continues to innovate in terms of products and packaging to expand its offerings and grow into larger segments. So I think as a distributor of our programming, we think Hulu is very important and we think it's a good distributor of our programming, and we're really happy to push it forward. With that said, we're also very focused on distributing our products and our programs through our other clients and other distributors, the MVPDs and others. And with respect to stacking rights, with respect to all of the set of this construct of the SVOD windows, we're very, very focused on, first and foremost, creating a customer experience around our product that's very, very good, creating an ease of discoverability, if you will, so they can find the product and get it at the right time. We are interested in having fewer holdbacks outside the SVOD window so that we can actually provide a better product for customers and provide our MVPD and over-the-top distributors with a better ability to deliver a good product experience. So I don't think those 2 things are incompatible at all, and I think we have to see our distributors, be it an online distributor like Hulu, or a traditional facilities-based distributor, like the cable company. I think actually from a customers' perspective, the package of those products just needs to be great, and need to be able to discover the programs in the right way. But we also need to be, as a supplier, able to take our brands to those platforms and have more flexibility with respect to how their product is found, how it's stacked, how it's consumed, more flexibility with respect to how advertising innovation works and what we can do as well as, I think, an understanding of data capabilities to understand who's using our products particularly as the streaming element or the time-shifted element grows at such a big clip because that's a really important part. So I don't think those 2 things are mutually exclusive in anyway, and we're very excited that Hulu is able to really set pace the in terms of innovation in a lot of these areas."

Look, I think on a relationship with our distributors or the MVPDs, some of our distributors, I would say actually there is -- first of all, they're pretty good. As I mentioned in my comments, we've renewed 2 important large affiliate agreements in the last quarter that we felt both sides were really able to achieve their goals. We haven't seen any material change in the distribution requirements or minimum distribution requirements in any of those agreements. And I think the strategy that we've laid out and that we've executed over the last few years of really investing in these brands, investing in the rights around these brands and being able to offer something that really matters for our distributors' customers has borne fruit for us with respect to pricing and distribution gains. With respect to the whole question of overall affiliate universe and the subscriber universe of the MVPDs, as John mentioned in his comments, obviously, the total universe for extended basic for those MVPDs has contracted. We continue to see growth. Our networks are distributed at different levels, each one different to another. Some of them were young like Fox Sports 1, some of the Nat Geo brands. And some are more fully distributed. So we have pretty good visibility on reasonable growth going forward. And I think the things like minimum distribution guarantees, et cetera, haven't been really impacted, at least in our latest negotiations and latest renewals, and we think that's encouraging."

With respect to STAR, the landscape for sports rights in the near-term really probably dominated by what happens with the BCCI, the domestic Board of Control for Cricket India and the IPL, the pro cricket league domestically there.

But fundamentally, there's nothing that we see out there that we feel would necessitate us our adjusting our goals for the business both from a margin perspective and absolute profit perspective over the next 4 to 5 years.

It also is big for our inventory because as you know, we make all of the NFL payments, as an example, before the end of the calendar year, with the biggest games happening really after the calendar year with postseason, et cetera. So looking at this period, it's not unusual at all as against where our working capital buildup would be in any 6-month -- December period. For the year, we're still at the same place. Working capital level, we expect to be about the same as the year ago. So we're consistent in that regard from what I said back in August.

I think, first of all, I would just say that what we're really focused on is making our programming, the creative assets that we make available in as wide a way as possible, and mobile is increasingly an important part of that as we look at TV Everywhere-type applications like Sky Go in Europe, for example, increasingly consumed on mobile phones and tablets, as well as consumption in the U.S. growing of video entertainment or audiovisual entertainment on mobile platforms. The key thing for us is how do we invest in the capabilities to monetize that viewing, measure it and monetize it the right way. And I think we would look at investing to create those capabilities as we have, for example, with the formation of our advanced ad products group, et cetera, which is making a lot of headway in streaming. I think that I would like at the mobile piece for us really just part of the overall streaming landscape as opposed to brand-new types of content for us, et cetera. First the priority is how we execute with our creative assets today as well as we can, make them more available not less to customers and how do we really innovate and get better capabilities in terms of how we then monetize that platform going forward. And then in discrete places, whether there's a real big opportunity, we would start a new business. If we look at something like in India, the hotstar business is a mobile Internet-only video platform, which we launched early this year or, I should say, early last year, which has really gotten off to a good start. And that's a sports and entertainment platform that is growing very, very rapidly from a mobile consumption point of view in India. And we would look at individual brands really being able to embrace those kinds of opportunities going forward."

First, I'm hoping you could talk a little bit about your competitive position relative to Netflix, especially as it pertains to technology? And what I mean is Netflix is spending a lot on technology, hundreds of millions of dollars a year. And they used to sort of only be a distributor, and now they're, I would say, infringing on your sort of content territory by launching their own content. So how do you feel about your need to invest in your own technological expertise to compete with them on that front? And then second, on the regional sports networks, you've talked about how you like the tribal element. The investor concern seems to be around everybody paying for the RSNs at a certain price. But maybe from your perspective, how do you look at the price inelasticity there for the true fan who wants that network? And do you think maybe that's underappreciated by those who are concerned about the dollar sense?"

Look, with respect to investment in technology, we invest constantly in the technology around delivering a better product to customers where we can. We've definitely been doing that with respect to advertising innovation, investing in that creating new capabilities there. And we've also been investing in our capabilities, which are improving around domestically here in the U.S., direct-to-customer distribution with our authenticated apps, for example, and other platform. So we think there is an investment in technology that's ongoing, and it will continue. And then around the world, where we are -- where we're heavier in direct-to-customer businesses and product-oriented businesses, for example, of the Sky businesses, it's very heavy investment in technology that we actually -- bears real fruit in terms of creating products for customers that they really like. I'm not sure that the investment in technology referred to really has a bearing on the production of creative assets and getting into original production. I think that's kind of a different issue.  We feel very good about our ability to do that. I think, in the future, as we did today, we're going to see a continued competition for talent, continued competition for storytellers and a continued real appetite for various players to invest. And there'll be multiple Internet TV companies doing that, including our own. So I don't think the investment in technology necessarily has a bearing on that creative output. Or the competitive dynamic that you mentioned, but it clearly does have a bearing on the product set for consumers, how good they are and how you can monetize there as well. And as to your second question with the RSNs, I think, at this point, we feel pretty good about RSN pricing, where we are anyway, I can't speak with the overall market. And as I said in the renewal of recent distribution agreements earlier, we're able to achieve our goals there. For example, pricing inelasticity for the hard-core fan is something that there probably is some price inelasticity there. There's fans that would pay a lot. But I think you have to remember that the RSNs are very broad. They're not just for super fans. The RSNs in many of our markets are the #1 rated broadcast platforms in their market, particularly in baseball season, where you see markets like St. Louis for example beating all broadcast networks on those game nights. So I think it's a very, very broad offering and one that we try to price in the fairest way that we can that provides both returns for our partners, the teams in those businesses but also a fair price for the distributors that they can pass on to consumers in the right way."

Over the past few quarters on these calls, we've talked about the strength of our core brands and their value to both existing and emerging distribution platforms. In this quarter, we've seen some positive tangible results of the work we've been doing in this area, which all of us here are pretty excited about. In a few minutes, James will take you through our thinking and the early milestones we've achieved. But first, I'll briefly address the highlights of a good quarter for us. 
We continue to be focused on building powerful brands, making compelling content and driving advertising innovation, all of which create meaningful long-term value for stockholders. This past quarter's results, financial and operational, demonstrates good progress against these objectives. The quarter itself reflected underlying strength, led by double-digit EBITDA growth at the Cable businesses, the second highest quarterly EBITDA ever at the Film studio and further program momentum at the network at our international cable channels. 
Affiliate revenues grew by 7% in the quarter across our global Television business and by 10% excluding currency impacts. This growth is supported by our investment across our entertainment, news and sports brands. 
FOX broadcast network has the #1 broadcast series with Empire, the #1 new series with X-Files and the #1 scripted special with Greece Live. 
FOX News Network outranked all of basic cable for the first time on the strength of primetime ratings that were up 35% in the quarter. 
FX continued to define high-quality, culture-defining storytelling, the People versus O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story is cable's most-watched new primetime series, and Baskets is cable's most-watched new primetime scripted comedy. 
And Nat Geo earned its highest rating ever with its recent docu series, Story of God with Morgan Freeman. 
Ad revenues grew by 4% in the quarter. This strength was fueled in part by a 20-plus percent increase in domestic scatter pricing and also reflects the particularly strong FOX News viewership and STAR's continued solid games. 
Market has recognized the power of premium programming to win the attention of consumers. While the value of our broad reach for brand markets is clear, we continue to move toward a more efficient and effective and targeted model that is enabled by streaming distribution. 
At Filmed Entertainment, the company delivered the highest gross in R-rated film of all time with Deadpool, which has earned more than $760 million in global box office receipts against a modest production budget. It is also the highest grossing film ever for a first-time director, Tim Miller, a distinction we're equally proud of. 
Looking ahead, we have the highly anticipated theatrical release of X-Men: Apocalypse and of Independence Day Resurgence in our fourth quarter and Ice Age 5 in July. And although it's a ways off, we have also announced that James Cameron is well underway developing 4 Avatar sequels. 
At our Television production business, we produced 3 of the top 4 broadcast series of the current season: Empire, X-Files and Modern Family and the #1 new comedy, Life in -- the #1 new comedy, Life in Pieces. In addition, we produced the absolutely fantastic The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story. Looking forward, the studio has 3 new Fox series in development as well as 15 broadcast pilots, all of them for FOX.
And it is clear that in the world where more people are accessing more screens across multiple technologies and platforms, the demand for such premium content will continue to grow. It's why we are excited to be offering our portfolio of brands to new consumer-driven platforms like Hulu and Sling. And that's why we believe we are well-positioned at this dynamic time in our industry. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to John."

Third quarter revenu",712,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. You will have seen in today's earnings release that we reported very strong financial results in the quarter, underpinned by a 12% increase in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Third quarter revenues increased 6% over the prior year as growth at both our Cable Network and Television segments was partially offset by a slight decline at our Film segment. Absent the negative impact of foreign exchange, third quarter revenues increased 9% over last year. 
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.88 billion, a 12% increase over a year ago, reflecting double-digit growth at our Film and Cable Network segments and slightly lower results at the Television segment. Overall, unfavorable foreign exchange movements reduced the quarter's EBITDA growth rate by 7 percentage points. 
From a bottom-line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $844 million or $0.44 per share, while adjusted EPS was $0.47 this year, up 12% versus a comparable $0.42 a year ago. 
Looking forward, with the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year now behind us and based on all the assumptions inherent in our current outlook, we are comfortable with the fiscal 2016 EBITDA growth guidance that we provided to you on our last earnings call, specifically, flat to low single-digit percentage growth above the $6.49 billion we reported for fiscal 2015 excluding the DBS businesses.
Now let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the third quarter, starting with the Cable Network segment. Overall, total Cable segment revenues increased 10% and EBITDA grew 12%. Excluding an approximate $60 million negative impact from currency rates, EBITDA grew 16% in the quarter. Note that this years' results included the consolidation of the National Geographic nonchannels businesses that were acquired in our second quarter, which increased both revenues and expenses in the segment by approximately $90 million. 
Domestic cable revenues increased 11% in total with affiliate fees up 7% and advertising up 17%. As expected, our domestic affiliate revenue growth decelerated slightly in the quarter, primarily reflecting the timing of affiliate contract renewals. Our expectation is that affiliate fee growth will step up as we begin the next calendar year, consistent with the timetable for upcoming contract renewals. 
Domestic advertising growth was led by higher ratings at Fox News, the continued strength of local sports or the RSNs as well as the consolidation of the acquired National Geographic businesses. 
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher political coverage costs at FOX News and increased content and marketing spend at FX, driven by 2 new original series led by The People v. O.J. Simpson. 
At our international cable channels, reported affiliate and advertising revenues both grew 6% versus last year. But on a local currency like-to-like basis, affiliate revenues increased 20% and advertising revenues were up around 9%, driven by strong growth at STAR's entertainment channels and at the FOX Network international channels. 
Reported international channel EBITDA increased 67% over the prior year even after reflecting the $60 million negative foreign currency effect. This EBITDA growth reflects the higher revenues as well as lower sports rights costs at STAR due to the absence of last year's broadcast of the ICC Cricket World Cup.
Turning to our Television segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $125 million, $16 million lower than a year ago. Total revenues increased 5%, led by higher retransmission consent revenues and higher political advertising revenues at the stations. This revenue gain was absorbed by increased sports programming costs, principally for NASCAR and NFL, in the quarter. 
At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA increased $88 million versus last year. Higher contributions from the film studio, reflecting the successful theatrical release of Deadpool, were partially offset by reduced TV production earnings, primarily from lower contributions from Glee, which had its final network season last year. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted the segment's EBITDA this quarter by approximately $50 million. 
And finally, regarding capital allocation, from July through today, we've repurchased approximately $4.2 billion worth of FOXA shares, of which approximately $3.7 billion has been against our $5 billion buyback authorization. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to James."

Welcome, everyone. So as you've seen, it was a solid quarter. Now there's a lot we'll talk and hopefully we can cover a lot of ground in Q&A, but I wanted to first highlight some of the objectives of the business more broadly and the progress we are making towards them and in particular, talk a little bit about our digital business and plans. 
Over the long term, but approaching quickly, all video entertainment will be consumed over IP streaming networks. That means that what we create and produce is released into an incredibly competitive environment in which the customer can choose at any minute and on any device any entertainment that has ever been made. So first and foremost, we need to be making better things all the time. We are immensely proud of the creative achievements of the business recently and the momentum that we have at each of our brands. We're in a better place in almost all of our businesses creatively. This is driven by the investments v made in our brands over the last number of years. We are positioning for success in this environment, where it's not worth making the distinction between linear and digital anymore, just as the worlds between cable and broadcast melted away years ago. We are building a business that has real scale and streaming distribution and monetization capability. Here, too, we've made a lot of progress. We're very focused on the philosophy we need to be at and even with some progress depending heavily on counterparties, these last 3 quarters have seen a marked step-up in pace. 
Last month, we announced  our participation in Sling's new multistream digital video service with all of our entertainment and sports brands forming a core part of the new all-digital product, priced well below the fully bundled MVPD offering that some customers find hard to digest. 
And this week, we can confirm as well that we're working with Hulu to participate in the reimagined digital video service later this year that combines the current and live affiliate distribution model with an expansive and attractive SVOD window. We think this breaking down of licensing Windows into a simpler and more straightforward set of rules is going to be very attractive for customers and, therefore, for downstream video retailers as well. We want to make our programming more available, not less. And we want to be able to innovate in the way we can monetize that programming on digital platforms. This presidential move with Hulu is we can now license similar consumer services and products to new entrants or established MVPDs, encouraging and enabling innovation downstream, creating a distribution infrastructure that allows us to monetize more effectively and, all the while, grow our direct-to-consumer capability. 
Our work on this front has not been limited to the U.S. In India, STAR's groundbreaking hotstar mobile video product recently crossed 60 million downloads and just launched a premium subscription tier, leveraging our exclusive rights for HBO originals films and the FOX Library. And over the next few months, the service will also include a premium sports offering. 
In Europe, Sky Go and Now TV at our 40% owned affiliates guy continue to grow strongly. And the launch of the Sky queue is off to a strong start. 
And in Latin America, FOX plus, our premium digital On Demand service, is growing well and is now available to over 4 million subscribers. This progress we are making puts us on strong footing. And as we look across our global portfolio, we feel good about where we are and that we have the right strategies, assets and brands to see significant opportunities, both in mature and developing markets. The next decade is one of really immense opportunity for all of us at 21CF, and we are very focused on seizing it. 
So with that, we're happy to take your questions."

It's available to many, many millions of MVPD customers on an authenticated basis. And it's something that as you've soon as we've restructured and created our digital direct to Consumer Group, it's something that we're just very focused on building. We think it's the right thing to do to grow the audience in the streaming environment, where we can innovate and monetize better in terms of data and analytics, in terms of how we create new ad product and monetize them, pricing we're achieving there. And that's true as well with Hulu, where pricing in Hulu from an advertiser perspective is very, very attractive for us. And we think that's a mix between Hulu, our owned and operated apps, as well as VOD platforms belonging to the extent MVPDs, where we are seeing really market marked growth. And I would say what we're seeing decline in terms of multiplatform usage is really in DVRs and that streaming availability comes forward and as much, much better and creates a better customer expense, DVR usage seems to be defining or is declining on a percentage basis pretty dramatically. And that's something that is, a, good, and b, something that we want to encourage. But we need to make great products available for customers and make sure that we are putting together good product and working closely with our MVPD partners in terms of making sure the authentication pathways are as smooth and easy as possible, which as we all know, there's a lot of work to be done to improve that and improve that part of the user experience. And your second question, with respect to the Hulu and the competitive response, I think our view is that we'd like to make our programming more available, not less. We'd like to take our brands and the customer experience around our brands to new entrants in the downstream distribution market be they over-the-top or new products and services developed by the MVPDs. And that's just as I mentioned in the remarks earlier, licensing the Sling, for example, it's a core part of their multistream digital video service or licensing to Hulu as it develops its plans for this next generation video service for customers across the country. And I think really, the strategy for us is to create these products with simple Windows, things like better in series stacks, better customer experience and make that available to MVPDs generally. So it's not really a question of some heightened competitive dynamic, it's always been a competitive environment downstream. And just as licensing to satellite and telcos was seen as controversial at the time, we didn't leave new entrants paying a fair price putting together a great product for customers is one that's actually going to spur growth in the overall universe of video customers but also as one that's going to make a better user experience driven by those competitive dynamics, and we are very keen to play a part of that and be a catalyst for making that happen."

We think all of the networks are in really good shape creatively. And as Lachlan mentioned in his comments, scatter pricing has been really strong, it's been a strong market. So it's really a great moment to go right into upfront, and we're very excited about that. I think also, your point about the changing components on how we sell advertising, we're really focused here on how do we sell a total audience, how do we sell a total audience and how do we really market to our advertising partners to other brands, attention of that audience. I think we're driving incredible engagements in our audience, both in linear as well as in digital platforms. You may want to add that up and really create some valuable partners for those big. It is a more complicated process right now just because we have varying measurements, techniques, and we have to really add all of that up and have a more broad conversation with advertisers. But it's one that they've been extremely focused on and excited about. So I think the engagement with all the big brands we work with has been strong. I think in upfront you see a bigger component of digital obviously. And sticking together all of this multiplatform audience to create one platform for video consumption, it makes sense for people. And I think it's going to be a trend that's going to continue. But ultimately, we have to think of it less as a slice and dice different commercial Windows and more about a total audience across all of these platforms, which sometimes is current programming, sometimes it's a month old programming, and we continue to add cumulative audience and engagement over time in ways that is really exciting in terms of the overall audience growth and overall inventory growth."

And then with respect to pricing for new entrants, I would go back to looking at whenever we've seen new entrants come into the marketplace, we see an increased competition and we increases the value programming upstream. Not only do we continue to invest in that programming and make it better for customers, but also the value of that increases the more competition we have at the downstream retail level. So we're very confident that we're going to continue to be able to grow the value of our programming in these brands. In the downstream retail environment, it's more competitive, not less. More innovative, not less. And that's a real shift. So we really like to see, everyone would like to see, where we think these new entrants can be a catalyst for, hopefully there'll be more of them, is growth in the total video consumption universe downstream as well as into the broadband only households as well as a placement products for some customers, but also continued pricing strength as that competition increases.

That matters for our distributors, and we think we can get a fair price with that approach."

I mean one of the great debates I think we're going to continue to have with this virtual MVPDs will be optimizing subscriptions and customer experience versus the desire to generate advertising revenue, and you touched on the potential for lower ad loads. Has your experience with Sling or any of your surveys or studies given you a sense of what the right ad load is going to be for these virtual MVPDs? And if your ad load on VOD online for streaming ends up quite a bit lower, will we see your live ad load harmonize with that over time?"

I would say the experience we have is that, a, the advertising loads are highly relevant to the customer experience, no question about that. There's no question that we invest a lot in programming and we invest a lot in kind of the suspension of achieving a suspension of disbelief amongst our customers as we create these cinematic kind of experiences for them. And then we kind of jerk them out of that environment to show them advertising. That's necessary economically in many cases, but I'd say the kind of biggest lesson we've learned and interesting is with the Hulu ad free option, where customers can opt in to pay a premium to buy out essentially their own time, to buy their own engagement, many have chosen to do so but certainly not all of them. So customers are smart, and they understand the value kind of equation here. So we think some will pay a premium in that environment to have no ad load. Some will value the lower ad load that exists on Hulu today, for example, than in the broadcast environment. And I think in the streaming environment, the real opportunity here is to have better pricing and more targeting across the piece which allows us to continue to reduce the ad load as more video shifts and more consumption shifts to the IP streaming platform."

Look, it's really going to be for Hulu to comment on their customer numbers and expectation specifically, so I won't really get into that. But I would say that we'd look at the proliferation of new MVPDs, new virtual MVPDs or the existing MVPDs innovating, creating new over the top products and improving their own product experience. I mean the opportunity is very large and one that is very much worth pursuing and very much worth trying to get catalyst to create. But I think the specific subscriber goals, et cetera, better left do those distributors. With respect to India, I don't think we're really focused at this point on incremental rights. But in all of our sports businesses, not just India, we always seek a balance, and we have to see when new rights become available, how do they fit, how can they be monetized, are other rights things that you would give it to pay for those and you have to create a balance of investment in there that you think is delivering the right value for customers and the right value for the distributors. So I don't think I certainly don't think given the performance of the business, there's any necessity to have incremental rights on top of where we are today. But from time to time, we may invest in new rights and let other rights go or find ways to monetize new rights so that it's not necessarily an incremental investment. But we love the sports business. The Cricket business is strong, I mentioned earlier. From a monetization point of view, it's very strong right now for STAR. And it's a sport that we're obviously very committed to."

So we already do include sports in the hotstar business, but not live. It's on a delayed basis. So the premium sports becoming later this year, and we think it's going to be a tractive. But the business, the peaks and usage come not just from sports but also from the availability of new scripted series as well. So I pretty broad-based usage across that and something that's pretty encouraging and reasonably long session times. The key issue in India around over-the-top services, mobile video in particular, is really the tariff structure and meter tariff in terms of data from the telcos. So a lot of the consumption is bigger on WiFi when people are home or in Internet café, et cetera and until we can get until you get larger data caps or a flat pricing, et cetera, I think that's going to continue to be a dynamic. And that does put the constraint on pricing. That's why the core business in hotstar is Street. It's just something that people can download and use, because it becomes quite expensive given the data tariffs. And then with respect to the premium subscription service that we just launched, I think it's more squarely in the competitive dynamic with the Netflix which just launched there, et cetera, can view we have a very, very an attractive price for people so it's priced underneath some of the other competitors are but with some of the best premium international television in the world. For example, from HBO, from FX, from places like that, so it's a really attractive service. But it's too early to comment on what scale it's going to be, what we think the growth because we really just launched it a few weeks ago, so it's premium service. So that's where that is.

Over the past few quarters on these calls, we've talked about the strength of our core brands and their value to both existing and emerging distribution platforms. In this quarter, we've seen some positive tangible results of the work we've been doing in this area, which all of us here are pretty excited about. In a few minutes, James will take you through our thinking and the early milestones we've achieved. But first, I'll briefly address the highlights of a good quarter for us. 
We continue to be focused on building powerful brands, making compelling content and driving advertising innovation, all of which create meaningful long-term value for stockholders. This past quarter's results, financial and operational, demonstrates good progress against these objectives. The quarter itself reflected underlying strength, led by double-digit EBITDA growth at the Cable businesses, the second highest quarterly EBITDA ever at the film studio and further program momentum at the network at our international cable channels. 
Affiliate revenues grew by 7% in the quarter across our global television business and by 10% excluding currency impacts. This growth is supported by our investment across our entertainment, news and sports brands. 
FOX Broadcast Network has the #1 broadcast series with Empire, the #1 new series with X-Files and the #1 scripted special with Grease Live. 
FOX News Network outranked all of basic cable for the first time on the strength of primetime ratings that were up 35% in the quarter. 
FX continued to define high-quality, culture-defining storytelling. The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story is cable's most-watched new primetime series, and Baskets is cable's most watched new primetime scripted comedy. 
And Nat Geo earned its highest rating ever with its recent docu series, Story of God with Morgan Freeman. 
Ad revenues grew by 4% in the quarter. This strength was fueled in part by a 20-plus percent increase in domestic scattered pricing and also reflects the particularly strong Fox News viewership and STAR's continued solid games. 
The market has recognized the power of premium programming to win the attention of consumers. While the value of our broad reach for brand marketers is clear, we continue to move toward a more efficient and effective targeted model that is enabled by streaming distribution. 
At Filmed Entertainment, the company delivered the highest grossing R-rated film of all time with Deadpool, which has earned more than $760 million in global box office receipts against a modest production budget. It is also the highest grossing film ever for a first-time director, Tim Miller, a distinction we're equally proud of. 
Looking ahead, we have the highly anticipated theatrical release of X-Men: Apocalypse and of Independence Day Resurgence in our fourth quarter and Ice Age 5 in July. And although it's a ways off, we have also announced that James Cameron is well underway developing 4 Avatar sequels. 
At our television production business, we've produced 3 of the top 4 broadcast series of the current season: Empire, X-Files and Modern Family, and the #1 new comedy, Life in Pieces -- sorry, the #1 new comedy, Life in Pieces. In addition, we produced the absolutely fantastic The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story. Looking forward, the studio has 3 new FOX series in development as well as 15 broadcast pilots, all of them for FOX.
And it is clear that in a world where more people are accessing more screens across multiple technologies and platforms, the demand for such premium content will continue to grow. It's why we are excited to be offering our portfolio of brands to new consumer-driven platforms like Hulu and Sling. And that's why we believe we are well positioned at this dynamic time in our industry. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to John."

You will have seen in today's earnings release that we reported very strong financial results in the quarter, underpinned by a 12% increase in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Third quarter revenu",713,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. You will have seen in today's earnings release that we reported very strong financial results in the quarter, underpinned by a 12% increase in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Third quarter revenues increased 6% over the prior year as growth at both our Cable Network and Television segments was partially offset by a slight decline at our Film segment absent the negative impact of foreign exchange, third quarter revenues increased 9% over last year. 
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.88 billion, a 12% increase over a year ago, reflecting double-digit growth at our Film and Cable Network segments and slightly lower results at the Television segment. Overall, unfavorable foreign exchange movements reduced the quarter's EBITDA growth rate by 7 percentage points. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $844 million or $0.44 per share, while adjusted EPS was $0.47 this year, up 12% versus a comparable $0.42 a year ago. 
Looking forward, with the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year now behind us and based on all the assumptions inherent in our current outlook, we're comfortable with the fiscal 2016 EBITDA growth guidance that we provided to you on our last earnings call, specifically, flat to low single-digit percentage growth above the $6.49 billion we reported for fiscal 2015 excluding the DBS businesses.
Now let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the third quarter, starting with the Cable Network segment. Overall, total Cable segment revenues increased 10% and EBITDA grew 12%. Excluding an approximate $60 million negative impact from currency rates, EBITDA grew 16% in the quarter. Note that this year's results included the consolidation of the National Geographic non-channels businesses that were acquired in our second quarter, which increased both revenues and expenses in the segment by approximately $90 million. 
Domestic cable revenues increased 11% in total, with affiliate fees up 7% and advertising up 17%. As expected, our domestic affiliate revenue growth decelerated slightly in the quarter, primarily reflecting the timing of affiliate contract renewals. Our expectation is that affiliate fee growth will step up as we begin the next calendar year, consistent with the timetable for upcoming contract renewals. 
Domestic advertising growth was led by higher ratings at Fox News, the continued strength of local sports of the RSNs as well as the consolidation of the acquired National Geographic businesses. 
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher political coverage costs at Fox News and increased content and marketing spend at FX, driven by 2 new original series led by The People v. O.J. Simpson. 
At our international cable channels, reported affiliate and advertising revenues both grew 6% versus last year. But on a local currency like-to-like basis, affiliate revenues increased 20% and advertising revenues were up around 9%, driven by strong growth at STAR's entertainment channels and at the FOX Networks' international channels. 
Reported international channel EBITDA increased 67% over the prior year even after reflecting the $60 million negative foreign currency effect. This EBITDA growth reflects the higher revenues as well as lower sports rights costs at STAR due to the absence of last year's broadcast of the ICC Cricket World Cup.
Turning to our Television segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $125 million, $16 million lower than a year ago. Total revenues increased 5%, led by higher retransmission consent revenues and higher political advertising revenues at the stations. This revenue gain was absorbed by increased sports programming costs, principally for NASCAR and NFL, in the quarter. 
At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA increased $88 million versus last year. Higher contributions from the film studio, reflecting the successful theatrical release of Deadpool, were partially offset by reduced TV production earnings, primarily from lower contributions from Glee, which had its final network season last year. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted the segment's EBITDA this quarter by approximately $50 million. 
And finally, regarding capital allocation, from July 1 through today, we've repurchased approximately $4.2 billion worth of FOXA shares, of which approximately $3.7 billion has been against our $5 billion buyback authorization. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to James."

Now there's a lot we'll talk about, and hopefully, we can cover a lot of ground in Q&A. But I wanted to first highlight some of the objectives of the business more broadly and the progress we are making towards them and in particular, talk a little bit about our digital business and plans. 
Over the long term, but approaching quickly, all video entertainment will be consumed over IP streaming networks. That means that what we create and produce is released into an incredibly competitive environment in which the customer can choose at any minute and on any device, any entertainment that has ever been made. So first and foremost, we need to be making better things all the time. We're immensely proud of the creative achievements of the business recently and of the moment that we -- and of the momentum that we have at each of our brands. We're in a better place in almost all of our businesses creatively. This is driven by the investments we've made in our brands over the last number of years. We're positioning for success in this environment, where it's not worth making the distinction between linear and digital anymore, just as the walls between cable and broadcast melted away years ago. We're building a business that has real scale and streaming distribution and monetization capability. Here, too, we've made a lot of progress. We're very focused on the velocity we need to be at, and even with some progress depending heavily on counterparties, these last 3 quarters have seen a marked step-up in pace. 
Last month, we announced  our participation in Sling's new multi-stream digital video service, with all of our entertainment and sports brands forming a core part of ,a new all-digital product, priced well below the fully bundled MVPD offering that some customers find hard to digest. 
And this week, we can confirm as well that we're working with Hulu to participate in a reimagined digital video service later this year that combines a current and live affiliate distribution model with an expansive and attractive SVOD window. We think this breaking down of licensing windows into a simpler and more straightforward set of rules is going to be very attractive for customers and, therefore, for downstream video retailers as well. We want to make our programming more available, not less. And we want to be able to innovate in a way we can monetize that programming on digital platforms. This precedential move with Hulu means we can now license similar consumer services and products to new entrants or established MVPDs, encouraging and enabling innovation downstream, creating a distribution infrastructure that allows us to monetize more effectively, and all the while, grow our direct-to-consumer capability. 
Our work on this front has not been limited to the U.S. In India, STAR's groundbreaking hotstar mobile video product recently crossed 60 million downloads and just launched a premium subscription tier, leveraging our exclusive rights for HBO originals, films and the Fox Library. And over the next few months, this service will also include a premium sports offering. 
In Europe, Sky Go and NOW TV at our 40% owned affiliate, Sky, continue to grow strongly. And the launch of Sky Q is off to a strong start. 
And in Latin America, Fox Plus, our premium digital on-demand service, is growing well and is now available to over 4 million subscribers. This progress we're making puts us on a strong footing. And as we look across our global portfolio, we feel good about where we are and what we have -- and that we have the right strategies, assets and brands to see significant opportunities, both in mature and developing markets. The next decade is one of really immense opportunity for all of us at 21CF, and we're very focused on seizing it. 
So with that, we're happy to take your questions."

Look, on the first one, I don't want to get into specific numbers on FXNOW usage. But one thing that we're very focused on is growing consumption on our kind of we call our owned and operated apps, be it FOX NOW, or FXNOW or FOX Sports GO, and we're seeing good growth there. And you're right, we have been marketing that more on our air. Because we think it's a really good consumer experience. We think it's a great way for customers to access the programming. It's available to many, many millions of MVPD customers on an authenticated basis. And it's something that, as you've soon, as we've restructured and created our digital direct-to-consumer group, it's something that we're just very focused on building. We think it's the right thing to do to grow the audience in the streaming environment, where we can innovate and monetize better in terms of data and analytics, in terms of how we create new ad products and monetize them, the pricing we're achieving there. And that's true as well with Hulu, where pricing in Hulu from an advertiser perspective is very, very attractive for us. And we think that's a mix between Hulu, our owned and operated apps, as well as VOD platforms belonging to the existing MVPDs, where we're seeing really marked growth. And I would say that where we're seeing decline in terms of multi-platform usage is really in DVRs. And as streaming availability comes forward and it's much, much better and creates a better customer expense, DVR usage seems to be declining or is declining on a percentage basis pretty dramatically, and that's something that is, a, good, and b, is something that we want to encourage. But we need to make great products available for customers and make sure that we're putting together good product and working closely with our MVPD partners in terms of making sure the authentication pathways are as smooth and easy as possible, which, as we all know, there's a lot of work to be done to improve that and improve that part of the user experience. And your second question, with respect to the Hulu and the competitive response, I think our view is that we'd like to make our programming more available, not less. We'd like to take our brands and the customer experience around our brands to new entrants in the downstream distribution Market, be they over-the-top or new products and services developed by the MVPDs. And that's just as, I mentioned in the remarks earlier, indiscernible] licensing the Sling, for example, and it's a core part of their multi-stream digital video service or licensing to Hulu as it develops its plans for this next generation video service for customers across the country. And I think really, the strategy for us is to create these products with simpler windows, things like better in-series stacks, better customer experience and make that available to MVPDs, generally. So it's not really a question of some heightened competitive dynamic. It's always been a competitive environment downstream. And just as licensing the satellite and telcos was seen as controversial at the time, we didn't leave new entrants paying a fair price. Putting together a great product for customers is one that's actually going to spur growth in the overall universe of video customers, but also is one that's going to make a better user experience driven by those competitive dynamics, and we're very keen to play a part in that and be a catalyst for making that happen."

It is a more complicated process right now just because we have various -- varying measurements, techniques, and we have to really add all of that up and have a more broad conversation with advertisers. But it's one that they've been extremely focused on and excited about. So I think the engagement with all the big brands we work with has been strong. And I think in upfront you see a bigger component of digital, obviously. And sticking together all of this multi-platform audience to create one platform for video consumption that makes sense for people. And I think that's going to be a trend that's going to continue. But ultimately, we have to think of it less as a sort of slice-and-dice different commercial Windows and more about a total audience across all of these platforms, which sometimes is current programming, sometimes it's a month old programming, and we continue to add cumulative audience and engagement over time in ways that is really exciting in terms of the overall audience growth and overall inventory growth."

And we're really talking about total audience, plus 30, plus 60, whatever. As I said I think on these calls before, all viewers are alive. So all of the viewing should be counted as live viewing, and it's a question of establishing the currency that people can buy easily and get their head around, and that's the negotiation that you have. But certainly, there's an appetite to really follow where the viewers and where the engagement is, and that is multi-platform and it is across a longer period of time."

We're extremely pleased with how the sports investment is going, particularly with Kabaddi and Cricket, the 2 kind of biggest there. Kabaddi is a new sport that's growing very well. We will be investing and expanding that season and growing that sport. But also, our monetization of Cricket rights is actually getting much, much stronger as well with a -- for a variety of reasons. So I think we're happy with how that investment has gone. And in the hotstar side, in digital, with 16 million-plus downloads of the app and increasing consumption of a pretty substantial length. These aren't really short-form videos. People are watching soaps, they're watching, dramas, they're watching sports. We think it's a very, very exciting new platform for us. So we're pleased with the investment and how it's gone. And going forward, we're very confident that the growth in terms of EBITDA from the STAR business will be in line with the target that we've laid out in the past, which is getting towards $0.5 billion of EBITDA within a few years in '18 and towards $1 billion around the end of the decade."

And then with respect to sort of pricing for new entrants, I would go back to looking at -- whenever we've seen new entrants come into the marketplace, we see an increased competition and we've seen that really increases the value programming upstream. Not only do we continue to invest in that programming and make it better for customers, but also the value of that increases the more competition we have at the downstream retail level. So we're very confident that we're going to continue to be able to grow the value of our programming in these brands. In the downstream retail environment, it's more competitive, not less. More innovative, not less. And that's a real shift. So what we really like to see, I think everyone would like to see, where we think these new entrants can be a catalyst for, and hopefully there'll be more of them, is growth in the total video consumption universe downstream as well as into the broadband-only households as well as a placement products for some customers, but also continued pricing strength as that competition increases. Ultimately, it's up to us to make products that are distinctive, that are great, that customers really care about, and that's why we are so focused on these brands that we've been investing in and simplifying our investment around to make things that ultimately matter for customers. That matters for our distributors, and we think we can get a fair price with that approach."

I would say the experience we have is that, a, the advertising loads are highly relevant to the customer experience, there's no question about that. There's no question that we invest a lot in programming and we invest a lot in kind of the suspension of achieving a suspension of disbelief amongst our customers as we create these cinematic kind of experiences for them. And then we kind of jerk them out of that environment to show them advertising. That's obviously necessary economically in many cases, but I'd say the kind of biggest lesson we've learned is what's interesting is with the Hulu ad free option, where customers can opt in to pay a premium to buy out essentially their own time, to buy their own engagement, many have chosen to do so, but certainly not all of them. So customers are smart, and they understand the value kind of equation here. So we think some will pay a premium in that environment to have no ad load. Some will value the lower ad load that exists on Hulu today, for example, than in the broadcast environment. And I think in the streaming environment, the real opportunity here is to have better pricing and more targeting across the piece, which allows us to continue to reduce the ad load as more video shifts and more consumption shifts to the IP streaming platform."

But I think the specific subscriber goals, et cetera, better left to those distributors. With respect to India, I don't think we're really focused at this point on incremental rights. But in all of our sports businesses, not just India, we always seek a balance, and we have to see when new rights become available, how do they fit, how can they be monetized, are other rights, things that you would give it to pay for those and you have to create a balance of investment there that you think is delivering the right value for customers and the right value for the distributors. So I don't think -- I certainly don't think, given the performance of the business, there's any necessity to have incremental rights on top of where we are today.

So we already do include sports in the hotstar business, but not live. It's on a delayed basis. So the premium sports will be coming later this year, and we think it's going to be attractive. But the business, the peaks and usage come not just from sports but also from the availability of new scripted series as well. So actually, I think pretty broad-based usage across that and something that's pretty encouraging and reasonably long session times. The key issue in India around the over-the-top services, the mobile video, in particular, is really the tariff structure and metered tariff in terms of data from the telcos. So a lot of the consumption is bigger on WiFi when people are at home or in an Internet café, et cetera and until we can get -- until you get larger data caps or a flat pricing, et cetera, I think that's going to continue to be a dynamic. And that does put the constraint on pricing. That's why the hotstar -- the core business in hotstar is free. It's just something that people can download and use because it becomes quite expensive given the data tariffs. And then with respect to the premium subscription service that we've just launched, I think it's more squarely in the competitive dynamic with the Netflix, which just launched there, et cetera, which you can view that we wanted to have a very, very -- an attractive price for people, so it's priced underneath where some of the other competitors are, but with some of the best premium international television in the world. For example, from HBO, from FX, from places like that. So it's a really attractive service, but it's too early to comment on what scale it's going to be, what we think of the growth because we really just launched it a few weeks ago, so it's the premium service. So that's where that is. Was there another part of your question? I don't think so.
I think we have time for one more question."

Over the past few quarters on these calls, we've talked about the strength of our core brands and their value to both existing and emerging distribution platforms. In this quarter, we've seen some positive tangible results of the work we've been doing in this area, which all of us here are pretty excited about. In a few minutes, James will take you through our thinking and the early milestones we've achieved. But first, I'll briefly address the highlights of a good quarter for us. 
We continue to be focused on building powerful brands, making compelling content and driving advertising innovation, all of which create meaningful long-term value for stockholders. This past quarter's results, financial and operational, demonstrates good progress against these objectives. The quarter itself reflected underlying strength, led by double-digit EBITDA growth at the Cable businesses, the second highest quarterly EBITDA ever at the film studio and further program momentum at the network at our international cable channels. 
Affiliate revenues grew by 7% in the quarter across our global television business and by 10% excluding currency impacts. This growth is supported by our investment across our entertainment, news and sports brands. 
FOX Broadcast Network has the #1 broadcast series with Empire, the #1 new series with X-Files and the #1 scripted special with Grease Live. 
FOX News Network outranked all of basic cable for the first time on the strength of primetime ratings that were up 35% in the quarter. 
FX continued to define high-quality, culture-defining storytelling. The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story is cable's most-watched new primetime series, and Baskets is cable's most watched new primetime scripted comedy. 
And Nat Geo earned its highest rating ever with its recent docu series, Story of God with Morgan Freeman. 
Ad revenues grew by 4% in the quarter. This strength was fueled in part by a 20-plus percent increase in domestic scattered pricing and also reflects the particularly strong Fox News viewership and STAR's continued solid games. 
The market has recognized the power of premium programming to win the attention of consumers. While the value of our broad reach for brand marketers is clear, we continue to move toward a more efficient and effective targeted model that is enabled by streaming distribution. 
At Filmed Entertainment, the company delivered the highest grossing R-rated film of all time with Deadpool, which has earned more than $760 million in global box office receipts against a modest production budget. It is also the highest grossing film ever for a first-time director, Tim Miller, a distinction we're equally proud of. 
Looking ahead, we have the highly anticipated theatrical release of X-Men: Apocalypse and of Independence Day Resurgence in our fourth quarter and Ice Age 5 in July. And although it's a ways off, we have also announced that James Cameron is well underway developing 4 Avatar sequels. 
At our television production business, we've produced 3 of the top 4 broadcast series of the current season: Empire, X-Files and Modern Family, and a #1 new comedy, Life in Pieces -- sorry, the #1 new comedy, Life in Pieces. In addition, we produced the absolutely fantastic The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story. Looking forward, the studio has 3 new FOX series in development as well as 15 broadcast pilots, all of them for FOX.
And it is clear that in a world where more people are accessing more screens across multiple technologies and platforms, the demand for such premium content will continue to grow. It's why we are excited to be offering our portfolio of brands to new consumer-driven platforms like Hulu and Sling. And that's why we believe we are well positioned at this dynamic time in our industry. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to John."

You will have seen in today's earnings release that we reported very strong financial results in the quarter, underpinned by a 12% increase in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Third quarter revenu",713,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. You will have seen in today's earnings release that we reported very strong financial results in the quarter, underpinned by a 12% increase in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Third quarter revenues increased 6% over the prior year as growth at both our Cable Network and Television segments was partially offset by a slight decline at our Film segment absent the negative impact of foreign exchange, third quarter revenues increased 9% over last year. 
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.88 billion, a 12% increase over a year ago, reflecting double-digit growth at our Film and Cable Network segments and slightly lower results at the Television segment. Overall, unfavorable foreign exchange movements reduced the quarter's EBITDA growth rate by 7 percentage points. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $844 million or $0.44 per share, while adjusted EPS was $0.47 this year, up 12% versus a comparable $0.42 a year ago. 
Looking forward, with the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year now behind us and based on all the assumptions inherent in our current outlook, we're comfortable with the fiscal 2016 EBITDA growth guidance that we provided to you on our last earnings call, specifically, flat to low single-digit percentage growth above the $6.49 billion we reported for fiscal 2015 excluding the DBS businesses.
Now let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the third quarter, starting with the Cable Network segment. Overall, total Cable segment revenues increased 10% and EBITDA grew 12%. Excluding an approximate $60 million negative impact from currency rates, EBITDA grew 16% in the quarter. Note that this year's results included the consolidation of the National Geographic non-channels businesses that were acquired in our second quarter, which increased both revenues and expenses in the segment by approximately $90 million. 
Domestic cable revenues increased 11% in total, with affiliate fees up 7% and advertising up 17%. As expected, our domestic affiliate revenue growth decelerated slightly in the quarter, primarily reflecting the timing of affiliate contract renewals. Our expectation is that affiliate fee growth will step up as we begin the next calendar year, consistent with the timetable for upcoming contract renewals. 
Domestic advertising growth was led by higher ratings at Fox News, the continued strength of local sports of the RSNs as well as the consolidation of the acquired National Geographic businesses. 
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher political coverage costs at Fox News and increased content and marketing spend at FX, driven by 2 new original series led by The People v. O.J. Simpson. 
At our international cable channels, reported affiliate and advertising revenues both grew 6% versus last year. But on a local currency like-to-like basis, affiliate revenues increased 20% and advertising revenues were up around 9%, driven by strong growth at STAR's entertainment channels and at the FOX Networks' international channels. 
Reported international channel EBITDA increased 67% over the prior year even after reflecting the $60 million negative foreign currency effect. This EBITDA growth reflects the higher revenues as well as lower sports rights costs at STAR due to the absence of last year's broadcast of the ICC Cricket World Cup.
Turning to our Television segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $125 million, $16 million lower than a year ago. Total revenues increased 5%, led by higher retransmission consent revenues and higher political advertising revenues at the stations. This revenue gain was absorbed by increased sports programming costs, principally for NASCAR and NFL, in the quarter. 
At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA increased $88 million versus last year. Higher contributions from the film studio, reflecting the successful theatrical release of Deadpool, were partially offset by reduced TV production earnings, primarily from lower contributions from Glee, which had its final network season last year. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted the segment's EBITDA this quarter by approximately $50 million. 
And finally, regarding capital allocation, from July 1 through today, we've repurchased approximately $4.2 billion worth of FOXA shares, of which approximately $3.7 billion has been against our $5 billion buyback authorization. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to James."

Now there's a lot we'll talk about, and hopefully, we can cover a lot of ground in Q&A. But I wanted to first highlight some of the objectives of the business more broadly and the progress we are making towards them and in particular, talk a little bit about our digital business and plans. 
Over the long term, but approaching quickly, all video entertainment will be consumed over IP streaming networks. That means that what we create and produce is released into an incredibly competitive environment in which the customer can choose at any minute and on any device, any entertainment that has ever been made. So first and foremost, we need to be making better things all the time. We're immensely proud of the creative achievements of the business recently and of the moment that we -- and of the momentum that we have at each of our brands. We're in a better place in almost all of our businesses creatively. This is driven by the investments we've made in our brands over the last number of years. We're positioning for success in this environment, where it's not worth making the distinction between linear and digital anymore, just as the walls between cable and broadcast melted away years ago. We're building a business that has real scale and streaming distribution and monetization capability. Here, too, we've made a lot of progress. We're very focused on the velocity we need to be at, and even with some progress depending heavily on counterparties, these last 3 quarters have seen a marked step-up in pace. 
Last month, we announced  our participation in Sling's new multi-stream digital video service, with all of our entertainment and sports brands forming a core part of a new all-digital product, priced well below the fully bundled MVPD offering that some customers find hard to digest. 
And this week, we can confirm as well that we're working with Hulu to participate in a reimagined digital video service later this year that combines a current and live affiliate distribution model with an expansive and attractive SVOD window. We think this breaking down of licensing windows into a simpler and more straightforward set of rules is going to be very attractive for customers and, therefore, for downstream video retailers as well. We want to make our programming more available, not less. And we want to be able to innovate in the way we can monetize that programming on digital platforms. This precedential move with Hulu means we can now license similar consumer services and products to new entrants or established MVPDs, encouraging and enabling innovation downstream, creating a distribution infrastructure that allows us to monetize more effectively, and all the while, grow our direct-to-consumer capability. 
Our work on this front has not been limited to the U.S. In India, STAR's groundbreaking hotstar mobile video product recently crossed 60 million downloads and just launched a premium subscription tier, leveraging our exclusive rights for HBO originals, films and the Fox Library. And over the next few months, this service will also include a premium sports offering. 
In Europe, Sky Go and NOW TV at our 40% owned affiliate, Sky, continue to grow strongly. And the launch of Sky Q is off to a strong start. 
And in Latin America, Fox Plus, our premium digital on-demand service, is growing well and is now available to over 4 million subscribers. This progress we're making puts us on a strong footing. And as we look across our global portfolio, we feel good about where we are and what we have -- and that we have the right strategies, assets and brands to see significant opportunities, both in mature and developing markets. The next decade is one of really immense opportunity for all of us at 21CF, and we're very focused on seizing it. 
So with that, we're happy to take your questions."

Look, on the first one, I don't want to get into specific numbers on FXNOW usage. But one thing that we're very focused on is growing consumption on our kind of we call our owned and operated apps, be it FOX NOW, or FXNOW or FOX Sports GO, and we're seeing good growth there. And you're right, we have been marketing that more on our air. Because we think it's a really good consumer experience. We think it's a great way for customers to access the programming. It's available to many, many millions of MVPD customers on an authenticated basis. And it's something that, as you've seen, as we've restructured and created our digital direct-to-consumer group, it's something that we're just very focused on building. We think it's the right thing to do to grow the audience in the streaming environment, where we can innovate and monetize better in terms of data and analytics, in terms of how we create new ad products and monetize them, the pricing we're achieving there. And that's true as well with Hulu, where pricing on Hulu from an advertiser perspective is very, very attractive for us. And we think that's a mix between Hulu, our owned and operated apps, as well as VOD platforms belonging to the existing MVPDs, where we're seeing really marked growth. And I would say that where we're seeing decline in terms of multi-platform usage is really in DVRs. And as streaming availability comes forward and is much, much better and creates a better customer expense, DVR usage seems to be declining or is declining on a percentage basis pretty dramatically, and that's something that is, a, good, and b, is something that we want to encourage. But we need to make great products available for customers and make sure that we're putting together good product and working closely with our MVPD partners in terms of making sure the authentication pathways are as smooth and easy as possible, which, as we all know, there's a lot of work to be done to improve that and improve that part of the user experience. And your second question, with respect to the -- Hulu and the competitive response, I think our view is that we'd like to make our programming more available, not less. We'd like to take our brands and the customer experience around our brands to new entrants in the downstream distribution Market, be they over-the-top or new products and services developed by the MVPDs. And that's just as, I mentioned in the remarks earlier, and Lachlan did, licensing to Sling, for example, and it's a core part of their new multi-stream digital video service or licensing to Hulu as it develops its plans for this next generation video service for customers across the country. And I think really, the strategy for us is to create these products with simpler windows, things like better in-series stacks, better customer experience and make that available to MVPDs, generally. So it's not really a question of some heightened competitive dynamic. It's always been a competitive environment downstream. And just as licensing to satellite and telcos was seen as controversial at the time, we didn't leave new entrants paying a fair price. Putting together a great product for customers is one that's actually going to spur growth in the overall universe of video customers, but also is one that's going to make a better user experience driven by those competitive dynamics, and we're very keen to play a part in that and be a catalyst for making that happen."

One of their challenges has been -- the past couple of years is that as a network, you've not bought all the rights, and then as a studio, you may not have sold those rights. So can you give us a sense of how your thinking now is evolving on in-season stacking? Is that something you expect for FOX and FX to control, to own? Or would you sell in-season stacking rights to other networks like Modern Family and ABC? So let's talk about rights for a second."

We think that's the best customer experience. We think it's sensible. And I think there's been a little bit of -- it's taken a little while for the industry, if you will, to settle on how to price that and how do you think about those things. I think that's getting more established now. So yes, we're very focused on having in-season -- full season stacks for current seasons and then having a more seamless sort of handoff between that and the later SVOD window. So simplifying those rights in those windows is something that we're focused on, really in an effort to eliminate what are -- can appear to customers as really arbitrary holdbacks driven by business rules that they don't care about. And our focus is on, how do you make a better customer experience. We think the in-season stack is a key part of that."

So we think from an advertising perspective, it can be a superior business.

We think all of the networks are in really good shape creatively. And as Lachlan mentioned in his comments, scattered pricing has been really strong, it's been a strong market. So it's a really great moment to go right into upfronts, and we're very excited about that. I think also, your point about the changing components of how we sell advertising, we're really focused here on how do we sell a total audience, how do we sell a total audience and how do we really market to our advertising partners, to other brands, to the attention of that audience. I think we're driving incredible engagements in our audience, both in linear as well as in digital platforms. You may want to add that up and really create somethings that's very valuable for those advertisers. It is a more complicated process right now just because we have various -- varying measurements, techniques, and we have to really add all of that up and have a more broad conversation with advertisers. But it's one that they've been extremely focused on and excited about. So I think the engagement with all the big brands we work with has been strong. And I think in upfronts you see a bigger component of digital, obviously. And sticking together all of this multi-platform audience to create one platform for video consumption that makes sense for people. And I think that's going to be a trend that's going to continue. But ultimately, we have to think of it less as a sort of slice-and-dice different commercial Windows and more about a total audience across all of these platforms, which sometimes is current programming, sometimes it's a month old programming, and we continue to add cumulative audience and engagement over time in ways that is really exciting in terms of the overall audience growth and overall inventory growth."

So I think we're happy with how that investment has gone. And in the hotstar side, in digital, with 60 million-plus downloads of the app and increasing consumption of a pretty substantial length. These aren't really short-form videos. People are watching soaps, they're watching dramas, they're watching sports. We think it's a very, very exciting new platform for us.

And then with respect to sort of pricing for new entrants, I would go back to looking at -- whenever we've seen new entrants come into the marketplace, we see it increase competition and we see that really increases the value of programming upstream. Not only do we continue to invest in that programming and make it better for customers, but also the value of that increases the more competition we have at the downstream retail level. So we're very confident that we're going to continue to be able to grow the value of our programming in these brands. In a downstream retail environment, it's more competitive, not less. More innovative, not less. And that's a real shift. So what we'd really like to see, I think everyone would like to see, where we think these new entrants can be a catalyst for, and hopefully there'll be more of them, is growth in the total video consumption universe downstream as well as into the broadband-only households as well as placement products for some customers, but also continued pricing strength as that competition increases. Ultimately, it's up to us to make products that are distinctive, that are great, that customers really care about, and that's why we are so focused on these brands that we've been investing in and simplifying our investment around to make things that ultimately matter for customers.

I would say the experience we have is that, a, the advertising loads are highly relevant to the customer experience, there's no question about that. There's no question that we invest a lot in programming and we invest a lot in kind of the suspension of achieving a suspension of disbelief amongst our customers as we create these cinematic kind of experiences for them. And then we kind of jerk them out of that environment to show them advertising. That's obviously necessary economically in many cases, but I'd say the kind of biggest lesson we've learned is what's interesting is with the Hulu ad free option, where customers can opt in to pay a premium to buy out essentially their own time, to buy their own engagement, many have chosen to do so, but certainly not all of them. So customers are smart, and they understand the value kind of equation here. So we think some will pay a premium in that environment to have no ad load. Some will value the lower ad load that exists on Hulu today, for example, than in the broadcast environment. And I think in a streaming environment, the real opportunity here is to have better pricing and more targeting across the piece, which allows us to continue to reduce the ad load as more video shifts and more consumption shifts to the IP streaming platform."

But part of the thought is if you create this new business model, and let's call it new, and it ends up with worse economics to start because ad loads are lower and it's going to take a while to grow the CPMs to where you want them to be or perhaps just because you presume younger customers would prefer lower ad load and won't come into the product without that, but you build a sustainable business that can grow from there, is it worth it to take that step down in economics initially, hoping that ultimately, you can either grow that business from subscriptions or targeted CPM, if that makes sense?"

And just if you add it to the subscribers you expect on the existing Hulu subscription product, kind of what sort of numbers for subscribers might -- should we be thinking about over the next few years? First question. And secondly, I want to ask about STAR India. There's some sports rights of yours that are coming up in a couple of years, I think IPL [ph] rights coming up in '18.

Look, it's really going to be for Hulu to comment on their customer numbers and expectations, specifically, so I won't really get into that. But I would say that when we look at the proliferation of new MVPDs, new virtual MVPDs or the existing MVPDs innovating, creating new over-the-top products and improving their own product experience. I think the opportunity is very large and one that is very much worth pursuing and very much worth trying to be a catalyst to create. But I think the specific subscriber goals, et cetera, better left to those distributors. With respect to India, I don't think we're really focused at this point on incremental rights. But in all of our sports businesses, not just India, we always seek a balance, and we have to see when new rights become available, how do they fit, how can they be monetized, are other rights, things that you would give up to pay for those and you have to create a balance of investment there that you think is delivering the right value for customers and the right value for the distributors. So I don't think -- I certainly don't think, given the performance of the business, there's any necessity to have incremental rights on top of where we are today. But from time to time, we may invest in new rights and let other rights go or find ways to monetize new rights so that it's not necessarily an incremental investment. But we love the sports business. The Cricket business is strong, as I mentioned earlier. From a monetization point of view, it's very strong right now for STAR, and it's a sport that we're obviously very committed to."

So we already do include sports in the hotstar business, but not live. It's on a delayed basis. So the premium sports offer will be coming later this year, and we think it's going to be attractive. But the business, the peaks and usage come not just from sports but also from the availability of new scripted series as well. So we're actually seeing pretty broad-based usage across that and something that's pretty encouraging and reasonably long session times. The key issue in India around the over-the-top services, the mobile video, in particular, is really the tariff structure and metered tariffing in terms of data from the telcos. So a lot of the consumption is bigger on WiFi when people are at home or in an Internet café, et cetera and until we can get -- until you get larger data caps or a flat pricing, et cetera, I think that's going to continue to be a dynamic. And that does put the constraint on pricing. That's why the hotstar -- the core business in hotstar is free. It's just something that people can download and use because it becomes quite expensive given the data tariffs. And then with respect to the premium subscription service that we've just launched, I think it's more squarely in the competitive dynamic with the Netflix, which just launched there, et cetera, which you can view that we wanted to have a very, very -- an attractive price for people, so it's priced underneath where some of the other competitors are, but with some of the best premium international television in the world. For example, from HBO, from FX, from places like that. So it's a really attractive service, but it's too early to comment on what scale it's going to be, what we think of the growth because we really just launched it a few weeks ago, so it's the premium service. So that's where that is. Was there another part of your question? I don't think so.
I think we have time for one more question."

As you can see from today's earnings release, we delivered a solid fiscal year performance, driven by increases in affiliate revenues national businesses, as well as gains in advertising revenue. Despite continued foreign exchange headwinds and a particularly difficult Film comparison, we have grown our adjusted EBITDA and revenues for the year. 
But before James and I provide further commentary on our financial results, let me first say a few words about Fox News, which has been the news of the recent weeks. Two weeks ago we received and accepted Roger Ailes resignation as the CEO of the business. And our father took up the responsibility of leading Fox News as Chairman and Acting CEO. Throughout this process, we have moved quickly and decisively to protect the business, to protect its employees and to protect the unique and important voice Fox News broadcasts. There is no one more dedicated or more able to transition Fox News to new leadership than its founder. As acting CEO, he joins an existing team that is extraordinarily strong and equally devoted to its success. The Fox News channel is on track to have its highest rated year ever and has led all of basic cable in both primetime and total day for 3 full months this calendar year. 
In fact, 2016 has been a pivotal year for the entire company. We executed well against our strategic objectives, delivering standout creative output, advancing innovation for customers and further driving improvements in how we monetize our content. We have managed succession at both the top of the company and in our divisions, allowing us to drive fundamental changes throughout the business. From the film studio to the network, from National Geographic to STAR TV, across all our businesses, we are intensely focused on capturing the valuable opportunities that new technologies and emerging mediums present us. And these opportunities are significant. Downstream innovation has meaningfully increased both choice and consumption for consumers. Demand for premium content, including live sports new and scripted entertainment has never been stronger. In this environment, value will continue to accrue to the strongest video brands and to the distinctive storytelling that defines FOX. 
The strengthening of our channel brands has been at the center of our strategy. Over the last couple of years, increased programming investment across our portfolio, as well as the launches of FXX, Fox Sports 1 and STAR Sports are now bearing fruit. The dividend these investments are yielding are clear, as our core brands are fundamental to emerging streaming services like Sony and Sling TV, as well as Hulu's forthcoming DMVPD service, which we expect will launch early next year. These services understand and value the emergence of the core bundle that our brands underpin. These and other emerging platforms will aggregate the best channels at reduced costs, offering unsurpassed user experience and economics to the consumer, while substantially increasing the number of distributors competing for our content. 
And today, we are excited to welcome Time Warner to Hulu as a shareholder. Since developing [indiscernible] Hulu 10 years ago, Hulu has grown from strength to strength and now serves over 11 million subscribers. Time Warner's investment is a testament to all that the Hulu business has achieved, and we are confident Time Warner's brands will play an important role in Hulu's ongoing success. 
The handful of content creators with the breadth and scale that we have clearly have the advantage in a world where technological innovation is opening the door for new distribution. In 2016, we once again demonstrated our ability to consistently create content that delivers audiences and acclaim. For example, our Film studios set on a first-time director broke a box office record with Deadpool which grossed $760 million on a modest production budget. Our television studio delivered 3 of the season's top 4 broadcast series, and we were recognized with a total of 144 Emmy nominations across primetime and sports. 
But I'd be remiss if I didn't also recognize that while you need to measure the Film business over a multiyear cycle, the recent 3 sequels we released clearly fell short of the expectations we had going into them. It is our goal to be far more consistent with this output. 
As I said earlier, the opportunities ahead of us are significant. And pursuing and participating in these opportunities we view our balance sheet, underpinned by our strong credit rating to be a strategic asset of the company to be deployed towards the highest long-term return initiatives. 
With that in mind, today, we announced a 20% increase to our annualized dividend and an additional buyback authorization of $3 billion. However, we will be highly selective on the deployment of capital towards this authorization over the next 12 months. Our priority in how we annually allocate our capital will be to invest in accretive, long-term growth opportunities, to investing in our existing businesses, new initiatives or acquisitions with both financial and strategic benefits. We are very focused on using our capital toward sustained long-term growth. But to the extent that opportunities do not emerge, we have the flexibility to use excess cash towards buybacks, as we did with the $8 billion we received from the sale of the SKY businesses. 
I'll now turn it over to John."

Let me start with a full year financial results, focusing on total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes in the prior year the DBS businesses result of the SKY. 
For the full year, total adjusted revenues were $27.3 billion, up 1% over last year and up 4%, excluding the negative impact from foreign exchange. These increases were from higher revenues at both our Cable Networks and Television segments, partially offset by reductions at our Film business. 
Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $6.6 billion, a 2% increase over a year ago, led by the cable network segment, partially offset by lower results at our Film segment. 
Overall, unfavorable foreign currency rates reduced our EBITDA results by approximately $380 million and reduced our growth rate by 6 percentage points. 
Reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders this year was $2.8 billion or $1.42 per share, while adjusted EPS was $1.73 this year, compared to last year's $1.72. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter results. Revenues increased 7% over last year, and were up 9% excluding foreign exchange, led by double-digit growth at our Cable Network segment. 
Total segment EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.45 billion, a 6% decline from a year ago, which primarily reflects the expected lower contributions from our Film segment and an approximate $50 million negative impact from foreign exchange, which contributed over half of the quarterly decline. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported EPS of $0.30 in the fourth quarter, while adjusted EPS was $0.45, up $0.15 from a comparable $0.39 last year. Included in this year's adjusted result is a $0.07 per share tax benefit resulting from a ruling we received. 
So now, let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the fourth quarter, starting with the Cable Network segment. The total segment EBITDA of $1.2 billion was basically even with last year on revenue growth of 10%. Excluding an approximate $40 million negative impact from currency rates, segment EBITDA grew 3% in the quarter. 
Domestic cable revenues increased 10% in total from affiliate fee growth of 6% and 13% advertising growth. The advertising growth reflects higher ratings and pricing at Fox News and our national sports channels, as well as a 2 percentage point benefit from this year's consolidation of the acquired National Geographic businesses. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7%, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by contractual sports right increases and streaming rights costs at the RSNs, higher political costs at Fox News and the inclusion of approximately $25 million of EBITDA losses in the recently acquired Nat Geo businesses, principally resulting from acquisition-related items recorded during this quarter. 
Fourth quarter reported international cable revenues grew 10%, driven by a 9% increase in reported affiliate revenues, which were up 19%, excluding currency impacts. Reported international advertising revenues were 6% lower than last year, as negative foreign currency movements more than offset low-single-digit local advertising growth. Additionally, content revenues doubled, reflecting the syndication of soccer rights and the Outkast series outside of our markets. 
Reported international EBITDA decreased 25% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenue, offset by costs from new sports rights, digital expansion initiatives and increased marketing. The international EBITDA decline reduces by half when factoring out the negative impact of currency movements. 
Turning to our Television segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $31 million above last year, largely reflecting a 9% increase i n the FOX Broadcast Network's entertainment advertising revenues from higher pricing, as well as increased nonlinear and retransmission consent revenues. These revenue gains were partially offset by increased entertainment programming and marketing expenses. 
At the Film segment, we reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $164 million, $105 million below last year. This anticipated decline was primarily driven by the inclusion of significant releasing costs for the newest X-Men, Independence Day and Ice Age theatrical releases, as well as Mike and Dave. 
From a capital standpoint, we ended the fiscal year with $4.4 billion in cash and approximately $19.7 billion in debt. 
During the fiscal year, we delivered $5.5 billion in capital returns to shareholders. And as of today, we completed slightly over 90% of our $5 billion share repurchase authorization. We expect to complete the balance of this authorization over the year. The absolute level of capital returns to shareholders has been robust over the last 3 years, well exceeding our annual cash flow generation and has us now sitting at the upper limit of our stated gross debt target of 2.5x to 3x. 
So as we look to fiscal 2017, we have a few items worth drawing attention to on which we have visibility. At our Cable networks, we have 15% to 20% of our domestic subscriber base coming up for renewal annually over the next couple of years, with the next round of renewals scheduled for early calendar 2017. Therefore, the pace of our domestic affiliate fee rate growth should accelerate in the back half of our fiscal year. 
On the Cable Networks cost side, while we don't have any major new sports rights kicking in next year, we'll have the extra 5 months of expenses from the acquired Nat Geo businesses, and as James will discuss, we'll invest around $200 million towards the refresh of the Nat Geo global programming and the expansion original series at FX. 
Turning to the Television segment, the upcoming year's revenue and costs will be influenced by 2 main factors:  Our broadcast of Super Bowl 51 and the election cycle. Excluding the Super Bowl, segment expenses are anticipated to increase in the mid-single-digit range, led by planned increases, international sports contracts and by slightly higher marketing investments at the FOX Network to support a higher volume of new series. Aggregate retransmission revenues are expected to continue to grow at a low double digit annual phase. 
Additionally, as of today, except for Sterling, spot rates for the major currencies that we operate in are roughly similar to the average exchange rates we experienced for the entirety of fiscal 2016. On its face, if these rates hold for the full year, that would suggest a nominal impact from foreign exchange on our fiscal '17 full year EBITDA results. At the moment, the most significant impact to our results from the decline in sterling would be our translation of SKY's equity earnings. 
So 2 final items to call out. First, our reported tax rate is expected to approach the full U.S. statutory rate next year; and second, as Lachlan mentioned, today, we increased our dividend and announced a new buyback authorization of $3 billion, which is open ended as to its time frame, and we'll be very selective in deploying capital toward this over the next 12 months. 
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

We've made a lot of progress over the last year, but much remains to be done. I want to just highlight a few key things and give you a sense of what we're super focused on, and then we can cover whatever you want in the Q&A after. 
First of all, as I said last quarter, we want to make our programming and products more available, not less. And we want to grow our capabilities in monetizing these brands and programs with our partners. And we want to enable a customer experience for our viewers that is truly simple and great. Our work with Hulu is a key part of this, as is our licensing to other MVPDs over-the-top or otherwise. We want to be flexible in our approach though to deliver the best experience to customers and the most value to our partners and shareholders. Our progress this last year puts us in a strong position in this regard. Our focus on product innovation and on ensuring our brands and content are core to new services as they proliferate are drivers of future growth. But it's fair to say that across the board, from our organization structure to our commercial capability, from creative investment to talent recruitment, we are moving at a fast pace today and are focused on improving our operations worldwide. We've restructured the leadership team at FOX Networks group, embarked on leadership transition at the film studio, streamlined the cost base across the business, completed the integration of the 3 SKYs, completed the integration of the newly acquired National Geographic businesses, completed the acquisition and integration of MAA TV and completed and integrated Shine into the new Endemol Shine group. 
Now this past year, we've seen a flurry of M&A activity in the sector, and I want to be clear, please pay attention to what we've chosen and choose not to do. While we never rule out opportunities to invest in organically, we've set a high bar with respect to how we intend to use capital, and that bar will remain high. 
In this coming year, while we certainly have challenges, we couldn't be more excited about where these businesses are and what they can achieve. Fox Sports is looking forward to one of its best years ever. We start the year with strong ratings for baseball at the RSNs, and we expect this NFL season including Super Bowl 51 on Fox to be as good as ever. And Fox Sports 1 already having overtaken ESPN2 in prime across all demos, including total viewers, is just starting to hit its stride. 
A full revamp of the National Geographic Channel's creative output, starting in earnest with Mars this autumn, and continuing with mega- documentary 1 strange rock and scripted programming like the upcoming genius. Earlier response from advertisers and critics couldn't be more enthusiastic as we start to see what a fully aligned business, organized around a global super brand, like National Geographic, is capable of. 
At FX, we're expanding from 15 to 18 original scripted series. This included Atlanta from Donald Glover, Taboo with Tom Hardy, Legion which is set in the X-Men universe and is created by Fargo show runner [indiscernible] Holly; and Trust, from the slum dog millionaire team of Danny Boyle, Simon [indiscernible] and Christian Colson. 
It's clear, we have work to do at the film studio. Some of our major releases, as Lachlan said, did not meet expectations, and that means we're starting the year with a bit of a hill to climb. So we're energized about our upcoming pipeline, with releases such as Ms. Peregrine School for Peculiar Children, War of the Planet of the Apes, Kingsma 2, Assasin's Creed, Hidden Figures and Birth of a Nation, all in the next 12 months. Just as work has accelerated on a much-anticipated next installment of Jim Cameron's Avatar. 
Profit growth at Star in India is accelerating. The business is in good health and the peak investment years are behind us, as profitability towards our target progresses. 
We'll continue to invest in hotstar, our over-the-top mobile video service. With over 50 million active users currently, we see this as a key opportunity to achieve real leadership in an important category. In addition, we plan to expand its service beyond India this year, targeting the global South Asian diaspora. 
SKY, in its 3 European markets is making great progress as the business broadens, opens up new customer segments and develops more products and services, growing its customer base revenues and profits. 
And domestically, Hulu's velocity is picking up, too, with over 11 million paying subs and exiting new live and on-demand service set to launch in early '17. With Disney, Time Warner, Fox and more to come, participating in this groundbreaking new product, we're very excited about Hulu's future. 
And we also saw strong advertising demand in this year's upfront, with revenue growth driven by healthy pricing and volume increases across broadcast and cable. We also expect to build upon last year's momentum in nonlinear advertising gains. 
So in summary, it's an exciting time. A vibrant downstream market is emerging, which will help drive affiliate income and advertising innovation in the future. The overall TV advertising picture is healthy. Our creative output is strong, notwithstanding some disappointments in the film company. And lastly, though most importantly, the talent inside the businesses is tremendous and focused on delivering growth. In an era of constant change, our disdain for the status quo is our greatest strength. 
Now we'd like to take your questions."

Look, fiscal '16 was very strong, actually, as you know, in the previous year, we invested 100% of the profits of the business of the entertainment business into the growth of the sports business. But that's really turned now. So for this last fiscal year, the STAR business overall, inclusive of sports, delivered just north of $200 million of EBITDA, and we think that puts us in a really good pace for our '18 and 20 targets. So we're really pleased with that performance. And I think as we see the investments really start to pay off there and the velocity of the business continue. It's on track. And, with respect to the film studio, I think one of the things that Lachlan said in his remarks about consistency is really important, it's about consistency of creative output. It's about really focusing on having the best partners we can have. And then -- and the process in terms of the decisions on production starts, on new projects, et cetera, really functioning more consistently and better. And I think, as I mentioned earlier, we've embarked on leadership transition there. There are changes in the future that we want to make. But fundamentally, as you said, it's a hit driven business. We need to be really -- we need to be more consistently great in a marketplace as competitive as it is, when it's hard to get a family off the couch and out to the theater. So we had some great success in the year. If I look back at The Martian or Deadpool or things like that, things that are distinctive that -- where we can take risks, where we're doing things that maybe other studios aren't doing and provide something different in the marketplace. I think the slate coming up is very promising, but it's really tough, it's going to be tough to judge the film studio in any one quarter. It's really over a period of time."

We think we've got a great set of partners in this business, and we are very excited about it. So I think over the next number of months, as we see as complete some of the supply agreements, you'll see more detail around the content offering and the full breadth of it, which we think is exciting. I think it's important to note that we do think that in this rebundling that's going on, there's significant demand for great television, there's significant to my for great customer experience. And we want to be able to deliver it at the lowest price that we can. Fundamentally, that limits Hulu's ability, right? To just go and pay anything for a lot of program. We have to focus on what's the programming that really, really matters and what's going to drive consumption and what people are going to love. So I think it will be, as I described it before, kind of a core, a core package, a core bundle there, that we want to have a great entry point for customers to come in. That's not to say that premium offerings will be there, Hulu has been a very successful seller of Showtime as a premium add-on to its SVOD product today, and we would expect agreements like that to continue to be announced as well."

And then at STAR, we definitely had sort of change in the marketplace there a little bit where the some of the e-commerce money that we're spending very heavily in the comparison quarters in the year before notably flipped that snap deal really reduced their spending quite dramatically. So they have grown to be one of the top sectors in advertising there and just went away. In e-commerce, many to continue to be spent was in Amazon and that was really spread more around sports asset, so we didn't get the full benefit of that.

So I think it's consistent with our practice, and it's always benefited us and benefited customers fundamentally to have more competition downstream.

As you can see from today's earnings release, we have delivered a solid fiscal year performance, driven by increases in affiliate revenues, national businesses as well as gains in advertising revenue. Despite continued foreign exchange headwinds and a particularly difficult Film comparison, we have grown our adjusted EBITDA and revenues for the year.
But before James and I provide further commentary on our financial results, let me first say a few words about Fox News, which has been the news over recent weeks. Two weeks ago, we received and accepted Roger Ailes' resignation as the CEO of the business, and our father took up the responsibility of leading Fox News as Chairman and acting CEO. Throughout this process, we have moved quickly and decisively to protect the business, to protect its employees and to protect the unique and important voice Fox News broadcasts. There is no one more dedicated or more able to transition Fox News to new leadership than its founder. As acting CEO, he joins an existing team that is extraordinarily strong and equally devoted to its success. The Fox News channel is on track to have its highest rated year ever and has led all of basic cable in both primetime and total day for 3 full months this calendar year.
In fact, 2016 has been a pivotal year for the entire company. We executed well against our strategic objectives, delivering standout creative output, advancing innovation for customers and further driving improvements in how we monetize our content. We have managed succession at both the top of the company and in our divisions, allowing us to drive fundamental changes throughout the business. From the Film studio to the network, from National Geographic to STAR TV, across all our businesses, we are intensely focused on capturing the valuable opportunities that new technologies and emerging mediums present us.
And these opportunities are significant. Downstream innovation has meaningfully increased both choice and consumption for consumers. Demand for premium content, including live sports, news and scripted entertainment, has never been stronger. In this environment, value will continue to accrue to the strongest video brands and to the distinctive storytelling that defines FOX.
The strengthening of our channel brands has been at the center of our strategy. Over the last couple of years, increased programming investment across our portfolio as well as the launches of FXX, Fox Sports 1 and STAR Sports are now bearing fruit. The dividend these investments are yielding are clear as our core brands are fundamental to emerging streaming services like Sony and Sling TV as well as Hulu's forthcoming DMVPD service, which we expect will launch early next year. These services understand and value the emergence of the core bundle that our brands underpin. These and other emerging platforms will aggregate the best channels at reduced cost, offering unsurpassed user experience and economics to the consumer, while substantially increasing the number of distributors competing for our content.
And today, we are excited to welcome Time Warner to Hulu as a shareholder. Since developing that year of Hulu 10 years ago, Hulu has grown from strength to strength and now serves over 11 million subscribers. Time Warner's investment is a testament to all that the Hulu business have achieved. And we are confident Time Warner's brands will play an important role in Hulu's ongoing success.
The handful of content creators, with the breadth and scale that we have, clearly have the advantage in a world where technological innovation is opening the door for new distribution. In 2016, we once again demonstrated our ability to consistently create content that delivers audiences and acclaim.
For example, our Film studio set, on a first-time director, broke a box office record with Deadpool, which grossed $760 million on a modest production budget. Our Television studio delivered 3 of the season's top 4 broadcast series, and we were recognized with a total of 144 Emmy nominations across primetime and sports. But I'd be remiss if I didn't also recognize that while you need to measure the Film business over a multiyear cycle, the recent 3 sequels we released clearly fell short of the expectations we had going into them. It is our goal to be far more consistent with this output.
As I said earlier, the opportunities ahead of us are significant. And in pursuing and participating in these opportunities, we view our balance sheet, underpinned by our strong credit rating, to be a strategic asset of the company to be deployed towards the highest long-term return initiatives.
With that in mind, today, we announced a 20% increase to our annualized dividend and an additional buyback authorization of $3 billion. However, we will be highly selective on the deployment of capital towards this authorization over the next 12 months. Our priority in how we annually allocate our capital will be to invest in accretive, long-term growth opportunities, to investing in our existing businesses, new initiatives or acquisitions with both financial and strategic benefits. We are very focused on using our capital toward sustained long-term growth. But to the extent that opportunities do not emerge, we have the flexibility to use excess cash towards buybacks, as we did with the $8 billion we received from the sale of the Sky businesses.
I'll now turn it over to John."
91031,378253045,1024242,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with the full year financial results, focusing on total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes in the prior year the DBS businesses results of Sky.For the full year, total adjusted",1142,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with the full year financial results, focusing on total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes in the prior year the DBS businesses results of Sky.
For the full year, total adjusted revenues were $27.3 billion, up 1% over last year and up 4%, excluding the negative impact from foreign exchange. These increases were from higher revenues at both our Cable Networks and Television segments, partially offset by reductions at our Film business.
Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $6.6 billion, a 2% increase over a year ago, led by the Cable Network segment, partially offset by lower results at our Film segment. Overall, unfavorable foreign currency rates reduced our EBITDA results by approximately $380 million and reduced our growth rate by 6 percentage points.
Reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders this year was $2.8 billion or $1.42 per share, while adjusted EPS was $1.73 this year compared to last year's $1.72.
Now turning to the fourth quarter results. Revenues increased 7% over last year and were up 9%, excluding foreign exchange, led by double-digit growth at our Cable Network segment.
Total segment EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.45 billion, a 6% decline from a year ago, which primarily reflects the expected lower contributions from our Film segment and an approximate $50 million negative impact from foreign exchange, which contributed over half of the quarterly decline.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported EPS of $0.30 in the fourth quarter, while adjusted EPS was $0.45, up $0.15 from a comparable $0.39 last year. Included in this year's adjusted result is a $0.07 per share tax benefit resulting from a ruling we received.
So now let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the fourth quarter. Starting with the Cable Network segment, the total segment EBITDA of $1.2 billion was basically even with last year on revenue growth of 10%. Excluding an approximate $40 million negative impact from currency rates, segment EBITDA grew 3% in the quarter.
Domestic cable revenues increased 10% in total from affiliate fee growth of 6% and 13% advertising growth. The advertising growth reflects higher ratings and pricing at Fox News and our national sports channels as well as a 2 percentage point benefit from this year's consolidation of the acquired National Geographic businesses.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7%, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by contractual sports right increases and streaming rights costs at the RSNs, higher political costs at Fox News and the inclusion of approximately $25 million of EBITDA losses from the recently acquired Nat Geo businesses, principally resulting from acquisition-related items recorded during this quarter.
Fourth quarter reported international cable revenues grew 10%, driven by a 9% increase in reported affiliate revenues, which were up 19%, excluding currency impacts. Reported international advertising revenues were 6% lower than last year as negative foreign currency movements more than offset low-single-digit local advertising growth. Additionally, content revenues doubled, reflecting the syndication of soccer rights and the Outcast series outside of our markets.
Reported international EBITDA decreased 25% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenue, offset by costs from new sports rights, digital expansion initiatives and increased marketing. The international EBITDA decline reduces by half when factoring out the negative impact of currency movements.
Turning to our Television segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $31 million above last year, largely reflecting a 9% increase in the FOX Broadcast Network's entertainment advertising revenues from higher pricing as well as increased nonlinear and retransmission consent revenues. These revenue gains were partially offset by increased entertainment programming and marketing expenses.
At the Film segment, we reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $164 million, $105 million below last year. This anticipated decline was primarily driven by the inclusion of significant releasing costs for the newest X-Men, Independence Day and Ice Age theatrical releases as well as Mike and Dave.
From a capital standpoint, we ended the fiscal year with $4.4 billion in cash and approximately $19.7 billion in debt.
During the fiscal year, we delivered $5.5 billion in capital returns to shareholders. And as of today, we completed slightly over 90% of our $5 billion share repurchase authorization. We expect to complete the balance of this authorization over the year. The absolute level of capital returns to shareholders has been robust over the last 3 years, well exceeding our annual cash flow generation and has us now sitting at the upper limit of our stated gross debt target of 2.5x to 3x.
So as we look to fiscal 2017, there were a few items worth drawing attention to on which we have visibility. At our Cable Networks, we have 15% to 20% of our domestic subscriber base coming up for renewal annually over the next couple of years, with the next round of renewals scheduled for early calendar 2017. Therefore, the pace of our domestic affiliate fee rate growth should accelerate in the back half of our fiscal year.
On the Cable Networks cost side, while we don't have any major new sports rights kicking in next year, we'll have the extra 5 months of expenses from the acquired Nat Geo businesses and, as James will discuss, we'll invest around $200 million toward the refresh of the Nat Geo global programming and the expansion of original series at FX.
Turning to the Television segment. The upcoming year's revenues and costs will be influenced by 2 main factors: Our broadcast of Super Bowl 51 and the election cycle. Excluding the Super Bowl, segment expenses are anticipated to increase in the mid-single-digit range, led by planned increases, international sports contracts and by slightly higher marketing investments at the FOX Network to support a higher volume of new series. Aggregate retransmission revenues are expected to continue to grow at a low double-digit annual phase.
Additionally, as of today, except for sterling, spot rates for the major currencies that we operate in are roughly similar to the average exchange rates we experienced for the entirety of fiscal 2016. On its face, if these rates hold for the full year, that would suggest a nominal impact from foreign exchange on our fiscal '17 full year EBITDA results. At the moment, the most significant impact to our results from the decline in sterling would be our translation of Sky's equity earnings.
So 2 final items to call out: First, our reported tax rate is expected to approach the full U.S. statutory rate next year; and second, as Lachlan mentioned, today, we increased our dividend and announced a new buyback authorization of $3 billion, which is open-ended as to its time frame, and we'll be very selective in deploying capital toward this over the next 12 months.
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

We've made a lot of progress over the last year, but much remains to be done. I want to just highlight a few key things and give you a sense of what we're super focused on, and then we can cover whatever you want in the Q&A after.
First of all, as I said last quarter, we want to make our programming and products more available, not less, and we want to grow our capabilities in monetizing these brands and programs with our partners. And we want to enable a customer experience for our viewers that is truly simple and great. Our work with Hulu is a key part of this, as is our licensing to other MVPDs, over-the-top or otherwise. We want to be flexible in our approach though to deliver the best experience to customers and the most value to our partners and shareholders.
Our progress this last year puts us in a strong position in this regard. Our focus on product innovation and on ensuring our brands and content are core to new services as they proliferate are drivers of future growth. But it's fair to say that, across the board, from our organization structure to our commercial capability, from creative investment to talent recruitment, we're moving at a fast pace today and are focused on improving our operations worldwide. We've restructured the leadership team at FOX Networks group, embarked on leadership transition at the Film studio, streamlined the cost base across the business, completed the integration of the 3 Skys, completed the integration of the newly acquired National Geographic businesses, completed the acquisition and integration of MAA TV and completed and integrated Shine into the new Endemol Shine Group.
Now this past year, we've seen a flurry of M&A activity in the sector. And I want to be clear, please pay attention to what we've chosen and choose not to do. While we never rule out opportunities to invest inorganically, we've set a high bar with respect to how we intend to use capital, and that bar will remain high.
In this coming year, while we certainly have challenges, we couldn't be more excited about where these businesses are and what they can achieve. Fox Sports is looking forward to one of its best years ever. We start the year with strong ratings for baseball at the RSNs; and we expect this NFL season, including Super Bowl 51 on FOX, to be as good as ever. And Fox Sports 1, already having overtaken ESPN2 in prime across all demos, including total viewers, is just starting to hit its stride.
A full revamp of the National Geographic Channel's creative output, starting in earnest with Mars this autumn, and continuing with mega-documentary One Strange Rock and scripted programming like the upcoming Genius. Early response from advertisers and critics couldn't be more enthusiastic as we start to see what a fully aligned business, organized around a global super brand like National Geographic, is capable of.
At FX, we're expanding from 15 to 18 original scripted series. These include Atlanta from Donald Glover; Taboo with Tom Hardy; Legion, which is set in the X-Men universe and is created by Fargo show runner, Noah Hawley; and Trust, from the Slumdog Millionaire team of Danny Boyle, Simon Beaufoy and Christian Colson.
It's clear we have work to do at the Film studio. Some of our major releases, as Lachlan said, did not meet expectations and that means we're starting the year with a bit of a hill to climb. But we're energized about our upcoming pipeline, with releases such as Miss Peregrine's School for Peculiar Children, War of the Planet of the Apes, Kingsman  2, Assassin's Creed, Hidden Figures and Birth of a Nation all in the next 12 months; just as work has accelerated on a much-anticipated next installment of Jim Cameron's Avatar.
Profit growth at STAR in India is accelerating. The business is in rude health and the peak investment years are behind us as profitability towards our target progresses. We'll continue to invest in hotstar, our over-the-top mobile video service. With over 50 million active users currently, we see this as a key opportunity to achieve real leadership in an important category. In addition, we plan to expand its service beyond India this year, targeting the global South Asian diaspora.
Sky, in its 3 European markets, is making great progress as the business broadens, opens up new customer segments and develops more products and services, growing its customer base, revenues and profits.
And domestically, Hulu's velocity is picking up, too, with over 11 million paying subs and exciting new live and on-demand service set to launch in early '17. With Disney, Time Warner, Fox and more to come participating in this groundbreaking new product, we're very excited about Hulu's future.
And we also saw strong advertising demand in this year's upfront, with revenue growth driven by healthy pricing and volume increases across broadcast and cable. We also expect to build upon last year's momentum in nonlinear advertising gains.
So, in summary, it's an exciting time. A vibrant downstream market is emerging, which will help drive affiliate income and advertising innovation in the future. The overall TV advertising picture is healthy. Our creative output is strong, notwithstanding some disappointments at the Film company. And lastly, though most importantly, the talent inside the businesses is tremendous and focused on delivering growth. In an era of constant change, our disdain for the status quo is our greatest strength.
Now we'd like to take your questions."

And just going back to the Film studio, if you don't mind. I think you guys had your toughest year since '11 in terms of EBITDA contribution.

What are you and the team doing at the studio to try to improve profitability there, acknowledging that obviously it's a hit-driven business and there's a creative element to all this stuff?"

Actually, as you know, in the previous year, we invested really 100% of the profits of the business -- of the entertainment business into the growth of the sports business, but that's really turned now. So for this last fiscal year, the STAR business overall, inclusive of sports, delivered just north of $200 million of EBITDA, and we think that puts us in a really good pace for our '18 and '20 targets. So we're really pleased with that performance. And I think, as we see the investments really start to pay off there and the velocity of the business continue, it's on track.
And with respect to the Film studio, I think one of the things that Lachlan said in his remarks about consistency is really important. It's about consistency of creative output. It's about really focusing on having the best partners we can have. And then -- and the process in terms of the decisions on production starts, on new projects, et cetera, really functioning more consistently and better. And I think, as I mentioned earlier, we've embarked on leadership transition there. There are changes in the future that we want to make. But fundamentally, as you said, it's a hit-driven business. We need to be really -- we need to be more consistently great in a marketplace, as competitive as it is, when it's hard to get a family off the couch and out to the theater. So we had some great success in the year. If I look back at The Martian or Deadpool or things like that, things that are distinctive that -- where we can take risks, where we're doing things that maybe other studios aren't doing and provide something really different in the marketplace. I think the slate coming up is very promising, but it's really tough. It's going to be tough to judge the Film studio in any one quarter. It's really over a period of time."

Hulu is in discussions with a number of those potential providers and suppliers currently. And as those come to completion and we get closer to a launch of the service, I know Hulu will be communicating about that. There are no discussions currently about additional equity investments. We think we've got a great set of partners in this business, and we're very excited about it. So I think, over the next number of months, as we see us complete some of the supply agreements, you'll see more detail around the content offering and the full breadth of it, which we think is exciting. I think it's important to note that we do think that, in this rebundling that's going on, there's significant demand for great television. There's significant demand for a great customer experience. And we want to be able to deliver it at the lowest price that we can. Fundamentally, that limits Hulu's ability, right, to just go and pay anything for a lot of program. We have to focus on what's the programming that really, really matters and what's going to drive consumption and what are people going to love. So I think it will be, as I've described it before, kind of a core package, a core bundle there, and we want to have a great entry point for customers to come in. That's not to say that premium offerings won't be there. Hulu has been a very successful seller of Showtime as a premium add-on to its SVOD product today, and we would expect agreements like that to continue to be announced as well."

At the Hulu Upfront back in May, Mike Hopkins had said that, by the end of the month, that you have over 12 million Hulu subscribers. So just checking, did the number decline from May until now? I'm just wanting to follow up on that."

And without commenting on any particular potential suppliers, I would say that -- you mentioned specifically CBS. Customers have access to an a la carte CBS all-access product, so I don't think that's necessarily -- I think that does have an impact on how you would think about price and what you'd be willing to do to have it there.

In Benelux, for example, the U.K. was okay, but Italy was not, and Turkey was a problem as well. And we have a larger advertising weighting to Turkey, believe it or not, just because of the free-to-air channel there, which is a larger ad business than some of the other international cable channels that's all lumped into that segment. And then, at STAR, we definitely had a sort of change in the marketplace there a little bit, where the -- some of the e-commerce money that we're spending very heavily in the comparison quarters in the year before, notably Flipkart and Snapdeal, really reduced their spending quite dramatically. So they had grown to be one of the top sectors in advertising there and just went away. And the e-commerce money that continued to be spent was at Amazon, and that was really spread out more around sports assets, so we didn't get the full benefit of that. We have some into cricket, but really, the IPL got a lot of Amazon's money as well. So there was just a change there in the marketplace. We don't think it's anything more than that, just comparison with those big spenders ameliorating rating their spending."

And our real goal here is we want to see the most competitive downstream market we can, and we do think great value can be created Hulu, and our investment in that, we're very confident about. But we don't think that any of those things are mutually exclusive. And just as you know, we sell our programming across Europe to multiple MVPDs from, particularly, Liberty Global, KPN and others, et cetera, while the Sky businesses, which we're a major investor in, competes vigorously in a lot of those markets. So I think it's just -- a good example is India, where Tata Sky, we're a significant investor there, but we distribute across all of the MVPDs, satellite, cable and telco. So I think it's consistent with our practice, and it's always benefited us and benefited customers, fundamentally, to have more competition downstream. We saw that when DIRECTV and DISH really started to grow again, but we really grew [ph] properly in the U.S. many years ago. We've definitely seen that across Latin America.

As you can see from today's earnings release, we have delivered a solid fiscal year performance, driven by increases in affiliate revenues, national businesses, as well as gains in advertising revenue. Despite c",891,"Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from today's earnings release, we have delivered a solid fiscal year performance, driven by increases in affiliate revenues, national businesses, as well as gains in advertising revenue. Despite continued foreign exchange headwinds and a particularly difficult Film comparison, we have grown our adjusted EBITDA and revenues for the year.
But before James and I provide further commentary on our financial results, let me first say a few words about Fox News, which has been the news over recent weeks. Two weeks ago, we received and accepted Roger Ailes' resignation as the CEO of the business, and our father took up the responsibility of leading Fox News as Chairman and acting CEO. Throughout this process, we have moved quickly and decisively to protect the business, to protect its employees and to protect the unique and important voice Fox News broadcasts. There is no one more dedicated or more able to transition Fox News to new leadership than its founder. As acting CEO, he joins an existing team that is extraordinarily strong and equally devoted to its success. The Fox News channel is on track to have its highest rated year ever and has led all of basic cable in both primetime and total day for 3 full months this calendar year.
In fact, 2016 has been a pivotal year for the entire company. We executed well against our strategic objectives, delivering standout creative output, advancing innovation for customers and further driving improvements in how we monetize our content. We have managed succession at both the top of the company and in our divisions, allowing us to drive fundamental changes throughout the business. From the Film studio to the network, from National Geographic to STAR TV, across all our businesses, we are intensely focused on capturing the valuable opportunities that new technologies and emerging mediums present us.
And these opportunities are significant. Downstream innovation has meaningfully increased both choice and consumption for consumers. Demand for premium content, including live sports, news and scripted entertainment, has never been stronger. In this environment, value will continue to accrue to the strongest video brands and to the distinctive storytelling that defines FOX.
The strengthening of our channel brands has been at the center of our strategy. Over the last couple of years, increased programming investment across our portfolio, as well as the launches of FXX, Fox Sports 1 and STAR Sports are now bearing fruit. The dividends these investments are yielding are clear as our core brands are fundamental to emerging streaming services like Sony and Sling TV as well as Hulu's forthcoming DMVPD service, which we expect will launch early next year. These services understand and value the emergence of the core bundle that our brands underpin. These and other emerging platforms will aggregate the best channels at reduced cost, offering unsurpassed user experience and economics to the consumer, while substantially increasing the number of distributors competing for our content.
And today, we are excited to welcome Time Warner to Hulu as a shareholder. Since developing that year of Hulu 10 years ago, Hulu has grown from strength to strength and now serves over 11 million subscribers. Time Warner's investment is a testament to all that the Hulu business has achieved. And we are confident Time Warner's brands will play an important role in Hulu's ongoing success.
The handful of content creators, with the breadth and scale that we have, clearly have the advantage in a world where technological innovation is opening the door for new distribution. In 2016, we once again demonstrated our ability to consistently create content that delivers audiences and acclaim.
For example, our Film studio set, on a first-time director, broke a box office record with Deadpool, which grossed $760 million on a modest production budget. Our Television studio delivered 3 of the season's top 4 broadcast series, and we were recognized with a total of 144 Emmy nominations across primetime and sports. But I'd be remiss if I didn't also recognize that while you need to measure the Film business over a multiyear cycle, the recent 3 sequels we have released clearly fell short of the expectations we had going into them. It is our goal to be far more consistent with this output.
As I said earlier, the opportunities ahead of us are significant. And in pursuing and participating in these opportunities, we view our balance sheet, underpinned by our strong credit rating, to be a strategic asset of the company to be deployed towards the highest long-term return initiatives.
With that in mind, today, we announced a 20% increase to our annualized dividend and an additional buyback authorization of $3 billion. However, we will be highly selective on the deployment of capital towards this authorization over the next 12 months. Our priority in how we annually allocate our capital will be to invest in accretive, long-term growth opportunities, to investing in our existing businesses, new initiatives or acquisitions with both financial and strategic benefits. We are very focused on using our capital toward sustained long-term growth. But to the extent that opportunities do not emerge, we have the flexibility to use excess cash towards buybacks, as we did with the $8 billion we received from the sale of the Sky businesses.
I'll now turn it over to John."
91031,378253045,1024315,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with the full year financial results, focusing on total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes in the prior year the DBS businesses we sold to Sky.For the full year, total adjusted",1144,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with the full year financial results, focusing on total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes in the prior year the DBS businesses we sold to Sky.
For the full year, total adjusted revenues were $27.3 billion, up 1% over last year and up 4%, excluding the negative impact from foreign exchange. These increases were from higher revenues at both our Cable Networks and Television segments, partially offset by reductions at our Film business.
Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $6.6 billion, a 2% increase over a year ago, led by the Cable Network segment, partially offset by lower results at our Film segment. Overall, unfavorable foreign currency rates reduced our EBITDA results by approximately $380 million and reduced our growth rate by 6 percentage points.
Reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders this year was $2.8 billion or $1.42 per share, while adjusted EPS was $1.73 this year compared to last year's $1.72.
Now turning to the fourth quarter results. Revenues increased 7% over last year and were up 9%, excluding foreign exchange, led by double-digit growth at our Cable Network segment.
Total segment EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.45 billion, a 6% decline from a year ago, which primarily reflects the expected lower contributions from our Film segment and an approximate $50 million negative impact from foreign exchange, which contributed over half of the quarterly decline.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported EPS of $0.30 in the fourth quarter, while adjusted EPS was $0.45, up $0.15 from a comparable $0.39 last year. Included in this year's adjusted result is a $0.07 per share tax benefit resulting from a ruling we received.
So now let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the fourth quarter. Starting with the Cable Network segment, the total segment EBITDA of $1.2 billion was basically even with last year on revenue growth of 10%. Excluding an approximate $40 million negative impact from currency rates, segment EBITDA grew 3% in the quarter.
Domestic cable revenues increased 10% in total from affiliate fee growth of 6% and 13% advertising growth. The advertising growth reflects higher ratings and pricing at Fox News and our national sports channels as well as a 2 percentage point benefit from this year's consolidation of the acquired National Geographic businesses.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7%, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by contractual sports right increases and streaming rights costs at the RSNs, higher political costs at Fox News and the inclusion of approximately $25 million of EBITDA losses from the recently acquired Nat Geo businesses, principally resulting from acquisition-related items recorded during this quarter.
Fourth quarter reported international cable revenues grew 10%, driven by a 9% increase in reported affiliate revenues, which were up 19%, excluding currency impacts. Reported international advertising revenues were 6% lower than last year as negative foreign currency movements more than offset low single-digit local advertising growth. Additionally, content revenues doubled, reflecting the syndication of soccer rights and the Outcast series outside of our markets.
Reported international EBITDA decreased 25% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenue, offset by costs from new sports rights, digital expansion initiatives and increased marketing. The international EBITDA decline reduces by half when factoring out the negative impact of currency movements.
Turning to our Television segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $31 million above last year, largely reflecting a 9% increase in the FOX Broadcast Network's entertainment advertising revenues from higher pricing as well as increased nonlinear and retransmission consent revenues. These revenue gains were partially offset by increased entertainment programming and marketing expenses.
At the Film segment, we reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $164 million, $105 million below last year. This anticipated decline was primarily driven by the inclusion of significant releasing costs for the newest X-Men, Independence Day and Ice Age theatrical releases as well as Mike and Dave.
From a capital standpoint, we ended the fiscal year with $4.4 billion in cash and approximately $19.7 billion in debt.
During the fiscal year, we delivered $5.5 billion in capital returns to shareholders. And as of today, we completed slightly over 90% of our $5 billion share repurchase authorization. We expect to complete the balance of this authorization over the year. The absolute level of capital returns to shareholders has been robust over the last 3 years, well exceeding our annual cash flow generation and has us now sitting at the upper limit of our stated gross debt target of 2.5x to 3x.
So as we look to fiscal 2017, there were a few items worth drawing attention to on which we have visibility. At our Cable Networks, we have 15% to 20% of our domestic subscriber base coming up for renewal annually over the next couple of years, with the next round of renewals scheduled for early calendar 2017. Therefore, the pace of our domestic affiliate fee rate growth should accelerate in the back half of our fiscal year.
On the Cable Networks cost side, while we don't have any major new sports rights kicking in next year, we'll have the extra 5 months of expenses from the acquired Nat Geo businesses and, as James will discuss, we'll invest around $200 million toward a refresh of the Nat Geo global programming and the expansion of original series at FX.
Turning to the Television segment. The upcoming year's revenues and costs will be influenced by 2 main factors: Our broadcast of Super Bowl 51 and the election cycle. Excluding the Super Bowl, segment expenses are anticipated to increase in the mid-single-digit range, led by planned increases, international sports contracts and by slightly higher marketing investments at the FOX Network to support a higher volume of new series. Aggregate retransmission revenues are expected to continue to grow at a low double-digit annual pace.
Additionally, as of today, except for sterling, spot rates for the major currencies that we operate in are roughly similar to the average exchange rates we experienced for the entirety of fiscal 2016. On its face, if these rates hold for the full year, that would suggest a nominal impact from foreign exchange on our fiscal '17 full year EBITDA results. At the moment, the most significant impact to our results from the decline in sterling would be our translation of Sky's equity earnings.
So 2 final items to call out: First, our reported tax rate is expected to approach the full U.S. statutory rate next year; and second, as Lachlan mentioned, today, we increased our dividend and announced a new buyback authorization of $3 billion, which is open-ended as to its time frame, and we'll be very selective in deploying capital toward this over the next 12 months.
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

We've made a lot of progress over the last year, but much remains to be done. I want to just highlight a few key things and give you a sense of what we're super focused on, and then we can cover whatever you want in the Q&A after.
First of all, as I said last quarter, we want to make our programming and products more available, not less, and we want to grow our capabilities in monetizing these brands and programs with our partners. And we want to enable a customer experience for our viewers that is truly simple and great. Our work with Hulu is a key part of this, as is our licensing to other MVPDs, over-the-top or otherwise. We want to be flexible in our approach though to deliver the best experience to customers and the most value to our partners and shareholders.
Our progress this last year puts us in a strong position in this regard. Our focus on product innovation and on ensuring our brands and content are core to new services as they proliferate are drivers of future growth. But it's fair to say that across the board, from our organization structure to our commercial capability, from creative investment to talent recruitment, we're moving at a fast pace today and are focused on improving our operations worldwide. We've restructured the leadership team at FOX Networks group, embarked on leadership transition at the Film studio, streamlined the cost base across the business, completed the integration of the 3 Skys, completed the integration of the newly acquired National Geographic businesses, completed the acquisition and integration of MAA TV and completed and integrated Shine into the new Endemol Shine Group.
Now this past year, we've seen a flurry of M&A activity in the sector. And I want to be clear, please pay attention to what we've chosen and choose not to do. While we never rule out opportunities to invest inorganically, we've set a high bar with respect to how we intend to use capital, and that bar will remain high.
In this coming year, while we certainly have challenges, we couldn't be more excited about where these businesses are and what they can achieve. Fox Sports is looking forward to one of its best years ever. We start the year with strong ratings for baseball at the RSNs; and we expect this NFL season, including Super Bowl 51 on FOX, to be as good as ever. And Fox Sports 1, already having overtaken ESPN2 in prime across all demos, including total viewers, is just starting to hit its stride.
A full revamp of the National Geographic Channel's creative output, starting in earnest with Mars this autumn, and continuing with mega-documentary One Strange Rock and scripted programming like the upcoming Genius. Early response from advertisers and critics couldn't be more enthusiastic as we start to see what a fully aligned business, organized around a global super brand like National Geographic, is capable of.
At FX, we're expanding from 15 to 18 original scripted series. These include Atlanta from Donald Glover; Taboo with Tom Hardy; Legion, which is set in the X-Men universe and is created by Fargo show runner, Noah Hawley; and Trust, from the Slumdog Millionaire team of Danny Boyle, Simon Beaufoy and Christian Colson.
It's clear we have work to do at the Film studio. Some of our major releases, as Lachlan said, did not meet expectations and that means we're starting the year with a bit of a hill to climb. But we're energized about our upcoming pipeline, with releases such as Miss Peregrine's School for Peculiar Children, War of the Planet of the Apes, Kingsman 2, Assassin's Creed, Hidden Figures and Birth of a Nation all in the next 12 months; just as work has accelerated on a much-anticipated next installment of Jim Cameron's Avatar.
Profit growth at STAR in India is accelerating. The business is in rude health and the peak investment years are behind us as profitability towards our target progresses. We'll continue to invest in hotstar, our over-the-top mobile video service. With over 50 million active users currently, we see this as a key opportunity to achieve real leadership in an important category. In addition, we plan to expand its service beyond India this year, targeting the global South Asian diaspora.
Sky, in its 3 European markets, is making great progress as the business broadens, opens up new customer segments and develops more products and services, growing its customer base, revenues and profits.
And domestically, Hulu's velocity is picking up, too, with over 11 million paying subs and exciting new live and on-demand service set to launch in early '17. With Disney, Time Warner, Fox and more to come participating in this groundbreaking new product, we're very excited about Hulu's future.
And we also saw strong advertising demand in this year's upfront, with revenue growth driven by healthy pricing and volume increases across broadcast and cable. We also expect to build upon last year's momentum in nonlinear advertising gains.
So in summary, it's an exciting time. A vibrant downstream market is emerging, which will help drive affiliate income and advertising innovation in the future. The overall TV advertising picture is healthy. Our creative output is strong, notwithstanding some disappointments at the Film company. And lastly, though most importantly, the talent inside the businesses is tremendous and focused on delivering growth. In an era of constant change, our disdain for the status quo is our greatest strength.
Now we'd like to take your questions."

Actually, as you know, in the previous year, we invested really 100% of the profits of the business -- of the entertainment business into the growth of the sports business, but that's really turned now. So for this last fiscal year, the STAR business overall, inclusive of sports, delivered just north of $200 million of EBITDA, and we think that puts us in a really good pace for our '18 and '20 targets. So we're really pleased with that performance. And I think, as we see the investments really start to pay off there and the velocity of the business continue, it's on track. And look, with respect to the Film studio, I think one of the things that Lachlan said in his remarks about consistency is really important. It's about consistency of creative output. It's about really focusing on having the best partners we can have and then -- and the process in terms of the decisions on production starts, on new projects, et cetera, really functioning more consistently and better. And I think, as I mentioned earlier, we've embarked on leadership transition there. There are changes in the future that we want to make. But fundamentally, as you said, it's a hit-driven business. We need to be really -- we need to be more consistently great in a marketplace, as competitive as it is, when it's hard to get a family off the couch and out to the theater. So we had some great success in the year. If I look back at The Martian or Deadpool or things like that, things that are distinctive that are where we can take risks, where we're doing things that maybe other studios aren't doing and provide something really different in the marketplace. I think the slate coming up is very promising, but it's really tough. It's going to be tough to judge the Film studio in any one quarter. It's really over a period of time."

We think we've got a great set of partners in this business, and we're very excited about it. So I think, over the next number of months, as we see us complete some of the supply agreements, you'll see more detail around the content offering and the full breadth of it, which we think is exciting. I think it's important to note that we do think that in this rebundling that's going on, there's significant demand for great television. There's significant demand for a great customer experience. And we want to be able to deliver it at the lowest price that we can. Fundamentally, that limits Hulu's ability, right, to just go and pay anything for a lot of program. We have to focus on what's the programming that really, really matters and what's going to drive consumption and what are people going to love. So I think it will be, as I've described it before, kind of a core package, a core bundle there, and we want to have a great entry point for customers to come in. That's not to say that premium offerings won't be there. Hulu has been a very successful seller of Showtime as a premium add-on to its SVOD product today, and we would expect agreements like that to continue to be announced as well."

Look, as I mentioned in my remarks before, we do want to be flexible in terms of our approach to licensing, and we want to do something that makes sense. The recent American Crime Story agreement with Netflix, we thought it just made a lot of sense. It's an anthology series, so sequential stacking of multiple seasons is less crucial because it's not serialized across seasons. But we were able to secure the current season full stack and avoid -- or not be -- not give up the kind of holdbacks that are -- have been characterizing some of these agreements in the past. So we think it makes a lot of sense for customers watching American Crime Story on FX or on FXNOW. And that's -- so you have the full in-season stack for the current seasons. And it was just a very, very attractive agreement for subsequent seasons for us and for our partners in the show. So you think you don't want to be too orthodox about it, but I think the important thing here was this preserves, really, the customer experience that we're seeking to deliver. And for an anthology series like this, we thought it was just a great deal for the company and for shareholders."

Look, these are channels and brands that absolutely are enormously successful from a viewing perspective in their markets. If I look at all of the MLB teams in the first half of the season so far, I think 10 MLB teams were rated #1 in prime time in their markets on nights that they play, and half of those teams are our Fox RSNs. So when we combine that with streaming opportunities, when we combine that with what we're able to do in a sort of TV-everywhere-type environment, we think that's one of their core value propositions to our MVPD partners, both existing MVPDs and future MVPDs."

And we have a larger advertising weighting to Turkey, believe it or not, just because of the free-to-air channel there, which is a larger ad business than some of the other international cable channels that's all lumped into that segment. And then, at STAR, we definitely had a sort of change in the marketplace there a little bit, where the -- some of the e-commerce money that we're spending very heavily in the comparison quarters in the year before, notably Flipkart and Snapdeal, really reduced their spending quite dramatically. So they had grown to be one of the top sectors in advertising there and just went away. And the e-commerce money that continued to be spent was at Amazon, and that was really spread out more around sports assets, so we didn't get the full benefit of that.

And we make that just -- we make that call kind of on an ongoing basis. I would say that where we see dramatically lower ad loads is in the streaming environment, and the CPM increases are substantial. And it makes abundant sense to do that where we can target things better, where we can be -- where we can really innovate in terms of those things. But I think, generally speaking, for a lot of customers and for more -- I do think more -- some of our competitors out there, when I look at the -- across the overall kind of dial for cable choices, I think ad loads have been pretty high on a lot of channels, and they're probably right to have reduced them.

As you can see from today's earnings release, we have delivered a solid fiscal year performance, driven by increases in affiliate revenues, national businesses, as well as gains in advertising revenue. Despite c",891,"Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from today's earnings release, we have delivered a solid fiscal year performance, driven by increases in affiliate revenues, national businesses, as well as gains in advertising revenue. Despite continued foreign exchange headwinds and a particularly difficult Film comparison, we have grown our adjusted EBITDA and revenues for the year.
But before James and I provide further commentary on our financial results, let me first say a few words about Fox News, which has been the news over recent weeks. Two weeks ago, we received and accepted Roger Ailes' resignation as the CEO of the business, and our father took up the responsibility of leading Fox News as Chairman and acting CEO. Throughout this process, we have moved quickly and decisively to protect the business, to protect its employees and to protect the unique and important voice Fox News broadcasts. There is no one more dedicated or more able to transition Fox News to new leadership than its founder. As acting CEO, he joins an existing team that is extraordinarily strong and equally devoted to its success. The Fox News channel is on track to have its highest rated year ever and has led all of basic cable in both primetime and total day for 3 full months this calendar year.
In fact, 2016 has been a pivotal year for the entire company. We executed well against our strategic objectives, delivering standout creative output, advancing innovation for customers and further driving improvements in how we monetize our content. We have managed succession at both the top of the company and in our divisions, allowing us to drive fundamental changes throughout the business. From the Film studio to the network, from National Geographic to STAR TV, across all our businesses, we are intensely focused on capturing the valuable opportunities that new technologies and emerging mediums present us.
And these opportunities are significant. Downstream innovation has meaningfully increased both choice and consumption for consumers. Demand for premium content, including live sports, news and scripted entertainment, has never been stronger. In this environment, value will continue to accrue to the strongest video brands and to the distinctive storytelling that defines FOX.
The strengthening of our channel brands has been at the center of our strategy. Over the last couple of years, increased programming investment across our portfolio, as well as the launches of FXX, Fox Sports 1 and STAR Sports are now bearing fruit. The dividends these investments are yielding are clear as our core brands are fundamental to emerging streaming services like Sony and Sling TV as well as Hulu's forthcoming DMVPD service, which we expect will launch early next year. These services understand and value the emergence of the core bundle that our brands underpin. These and other emerging platforms will aggregate the best channels at reduced cost, offering unsurpassed user experience and economics to the consumer, while substantially increasing the number of distributors competing for our content.
And today, we are excited to welcome Time Warner to Hulu as a shareholder. Since developing that year of Hulu 10 years ago, Hulu has grown from strength to strength and now serves over 11 million subscribers. Time Warner's investment is a testament to all that the Hulu business has achieved. And we are confident Time Warner's brands will play an important role in Hulu's ongoing success.
The handful of content creators, with the breadth and scale that we have, clearly have the advantage in a world where technological innovation is opening the door for new distribution. In 2016, we once again demonstrated our ability to consistently create content that delivers audiences and acclaim.
For example, our Film studio set, on a first-time director, broke a box office record with Deadpool, which grossed $760 million on a modest production budget. Our Television studio delivered 3 of the season's top 4 broadcast series, and we were recognized with a total of 144 Emmy nominations across primetime and sports. But I'd be remiss if I didn't also recognize that while you need to measure the Film business over a multiyear cycle, the recent 3 sequels we have released clearly fell short of the expectations we had going into them. It is our goal to be far more consistent with this output.
As I said earlier, the opportunities ahead of us are significant. And in pursuing and participating in these opportunities, we view our balance sheet, underpinned by our strong credit rating, to be a strategic asset of the company to be deployed towards the highest long-term return initiatives.
With that in mind, today, we announced a 20% increase to our annualized dividend and an additional buyback authorization of $3 billion. However, we will be highly selective on the deployment of capital towards this authorization over the next 12 months. Our priority in how we annually allocate our capital will be to invest in accretive, long-term growth opportunities, to investing in our existing businesses, new initiatives or acquisitions with both financial and strategic benefits. We are very focused on using our capital toward sustained long-term growth. But to the extent that opportunities do not emerge, we have the flexibility to use excess cash towards buybacks, as we did with the $8 billion we received from the sale of the Sky businesses.
I'll now turn it over to John."
91031,378253045,1024509,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with the full year financial results, focusing on total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes in the prior year the DBS businesses we sold to Sky.For the full year, total adjusted",1144,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with the full year financial results, focusing on total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes in the prior year the DBS businesses we sold to Sky.
For the full year, total adjusted revenues were $27.3 billion, up 1% over last year and up 4%, excluding the negative impact from foreign exchange. These increases were from higher revenues at both our Cable Networks and Television segments, partially offset by reductions at our Film business.
Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $6.6 billion, a 2% increase over a year ago, led by the Cable Network segment, partially offset by lower results at our Film segment. Overall, unfavorable foreign currency rates reduced our EBITDA results by approximately $380 million and reduced our growth rate by 6 percentage points.
Reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders this year was $2.8 billion or $1.42 per share, while adjusted EPS was $1.73 this year compared to last year's $1.72.
Now turning to the fourth quarter results. Revenues increased 7% over last year and were up 9%, excluding foreign exchange, led by double-digit growth at our Cable Network segment.
Total segment EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.45 billion, a 6% decline from a year ago, which primarily reflects the expected lower contributions from our Film segment and an approximate $50 million negative impact from foreign exchange, which contributed over half of the quarterly decline.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported EPS of $0.30 in the fourth quarter, while adjusted EPS was $0.45, up $0.15 from a comparable $0.39 last year. Included in this year's adjusted result is a $0.07 per share tax benefit resulting from a ruling we received.
So now let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the fourth quarter. Starting with the Cable Network segment, the total segment EBITDA of $1.2 billion was basically even with last year on revenue growth of 10%. Excluding an approximate $40 million negative impact from currency rates, segment EBITDA grew 3% in the quarter.
Domestic cable revenues increased 10% in total from affiliate fee growth of 6% and 13% advertising growth. The advertising growth reflects higher ratings and pricing at Fox News and our national sports channels as well as a 2 percentage point benefit from this year's consolidation of the acquired National Geographic businesses.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7%, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by contractual sports right increases and streaming rights costs at the RSNs, higher political costs at Fox News and the inclusion of approximately $25 million of EBITDA losses from the recently acquired Nat Geo businesses, principally resulting from acquisition-related items recorded during this quarter.
Fourth quarter reported international cable revenues grew 10%, driven by a 9% increase in reported affiliate revenues, which were up 19%, excluding currency impacts. Reported international advertising revenues were 6% lower than last year as negative foreign currency movements more than offset low single-digit local advertising growth. Additionally, content revenues doubled, reflecting the syndication of soccer rights and the Outcast series outside of our markets.
Reported international EBITDA decreased 25% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenue, offset by costs from new sports rights, digital expansion initiatives and increased marketing. The international EBITDA decline reduces by half when factoring out the negative impact of currency movements.
Turning to our Television segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $31 million above last year, largely reflecting a 9% increase in the FOX Broadcast Network's entertainment advertising revenues from higher pricing as well as increased nonlinear and retransmission consent revenues. These revenue gains were partially offset by increased entertainment programming and marketing expenses.
At the Film segment, we reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $164 million, $105 million below last year. This anticipated decline was primarily driven by the inclusion of significant releasing costs for the newest X-Men, Independence Day and Ice Age theatrical releases as well as Mike and Dave.
From a capital standpoint, we ended the fiscal year with $4.4 billion in cash and approximately $19.7 billion in debt.
During the fiscal year, we delivered $5.5 billion in capital returns to shareholders. And as of today, we completed slightly over 90% of our $5 billion share repurchase authorization. We expect to complete the balance of this authorization over the year. The absolute level of capital returns to shareholders has been robust over the last 3 years, well exceeding our annual cash flow generation and has us now sitting at the upper limit of our stated gross debt target of 2.5x to 3x.
So as we look to fiscal 2017, there were a few items worth drawing attention to on which we have visibility. At our Cable Networks, we have 15% to 20% of our domestic subscriber base coming up for renewal annually over the next couple of years, with the next round of renewals scheduled for early calendar 2017. Therefore, the pace of our domestic affiliate fee rate growth should accelerate in the back half of our fiscal year.
On the Cable Networks cost side, while we don't have any major new sports rights kicking in next year, we'll have the extra 5 months of expenses from the acquired Nat Geo businesses and, as James will discuss, we'll invest around $200 million toward a refresh of the Nat Geo global programming and the expansion of original series at FX.
Turning to the Television segment. The upcoming year's revenues and costs will be influenced by 2 main factors: Our broadcast of Super Bowl 51 and the election cycle. Excluding the Super Bowl, segment expenses are anticipated to increase in the mid-single-digit range, led by planned increases, international sports contracts and by slightly higher marketing investments at the FOX Network to support a higher volume of new series. Aggregate retransmission revenues are expected to continue to grow at a low double-digit annual pace.
Additionally, as of today, except for sterling, spot rates for the major currencies that we operate in are roughly similar to the average exchange rates we experienced for the entirety of fiscal 2016. On its face, if these rates hold for the full year, that would suggest a nominal impact from foreign exchange on our fiscal '17 full year EBITDA results. At the moment, the most significant impact to our results from the decline in sterling would be our translation of Sky's equity earnings.
So 2 final items to call out: First, our reported tax rate is expected to approach the full U.S. statutory rate next year; and second, as Lachlan mentioned, today, we increased our dividend and announced a new buyback authorization of $3 billion, which is open-ended as to its time frame, and we'll be very selective in deploying capital toward this over the next 12 months.
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

We've made a lot of progress over the last year, but much remains to be done. I want to just highlight a few key things and give you a sense of what we're super focused on, and then we can cover whatever you want in the Q&A after.
First of all, as I said last quarter, we want to make our programming and products more available, not less, and we want to grow our capabilities in monetizing these brands and programs with our partners. And we want to enable a customer experience for our viewers that is truly simple and great. Our work with Hulu is a key part of this, as is our licensing to other MVPDs, over-the-top or otherwise. We want to be flexible in our approach though to deliver the best experience to customers and the most value to our partners and shareholders.
Our progress this last year puts us in a strong position in this regard. Our focus on product innovation and on ensuring our brands and content are core to new services as they proliferate are drivers of future growth. But it's fair to say that across the board, from our organization structure to our commercial capability, from creative investment to talent recruitment, we're moving at a fast pace today and are focused on improving our operations worldwide. We've restructured the leadership team at FOX Networks group, embarked on leadership transition at the Film studio, streamlined the cost base across the business, completed the integration of the 3 Skys, completed the integration of the newly acquired National Geographic businesses, completed the acquisition and integration of MAA TV and completed and integrated Shine into the new Endemol Shine Group.
Now this past year, we've seen a flurry of M&A activity in the sector. And I want to be clear, please pay attention to what we've chosen and choose not to do. While we never rule out opportunities to invest inorganically, we've set a high bar with respect to how we intend to use capital, and that bar will remain high.
In this coming year, while we certainly have challenges, we couldn't be more excited about where these businesses are and what they can achieve. Fox Sports is looking forward to one of its best years ever. We start the year with strong ratings for baseball at the RSNs; and we expect this NFL season, including Super Bowl 51 on FOX, to be as good as ever. And Fox Sports 1, already having overtaken ESPN2 in prime across all demos, including total viewers, is just starting to hit its stride.
A full revamp of the National Geographic Channel's creative output, starting in earnest with Mars this autumn, and continuing with mega-documentary One Strange Rock and scripted programming like the upcoming Genius. Early response from advertisers and critics couldn't be more enthusiastic as we start to see what a fully aligned business, organized around a global super brand like National Geographic, is capable of.
At FX, we're expanding from 15 to 18 original scripted series. These include Atlanta from Donald Glover; Taboo with Tom Hardy; Legion, which is set in the X-Men universe and is created by Fargo show runner, Noah Hawley; and Trust, from the Slumdog Millionaire team of Danny Boyle, Simon Beaufoy and Christian Colson.
It's clear we have work to do at the Film studio. Some of our major releases, as Lachlan said, did not meet expectations and that means we're starting the year with a bit of a hill to climb. But we're energized about our upcoming pipeline, with releases such as Miss Peregrine's School for Peculiar Children, War of the Planet of the Apes, Kingsman 2, Assassin's Creed, Hidden Figures and Birth of a Nation all in the next 12 months; just as work has accelerated on a much-anticipated next installment of Jim Cameron's Avatar.
Profit growth at STAR in India is accelerating. The business is in rude health and the peak investment years are behind us as profitability towards our target progresses. We'll continue to invest in hotstar, our over-the-top mobile video service. With over 50 million active users currently, we see this as a key opportunity to achieve real leadership in an important category. In addition, we plan to expand its service beyond India this year, targeting the global South Asian diaspora.
Sky, in its 3 European markets, is making great progress as the business broadens, opens up new customer segments and develops more products and services, growing its customer base, revenues and profits.
And domestically, Hulu's velocity is picking up, too, with over 11 million paying subs and exciting new live and on-demand service set to launch in early '17. With Disney, Time Warner, Fox and more to come participating in this groundbreaking new product, we're very excited about Hulu's future.
And we also saw strong advertising demand in this year's upfront, with revenue growth driven by healthy pricing and volume increases across broadcast and cable. We also expect to build upon last year's momentum in nonlinear advertising gains.
So in summary, it's an exciting time. A vibrant downstream market is emerging, which will help drive affiliate income and advertising innovation in the future. The overall TV advertising picture is healthy. Our creative output is strong, notwithstanding some disappointments at the Film company. And lastly, though most importantly, the talent inside the businesses is tremendous and focused on delivering growth. In an era of constant change, our disdain for the status quo is our greatest strength.
Now we'd like to take your questions."

So for this last fiscal year, the STAR business overall, inclusive of sports, delivered just north of $200 million of EBITDA, and we think that puts us in a really good pace for our '18 and '20 targets. So we're really pleased with that performance. And I think, as we see the investments really start to pay off there and the velocity of the business continue, it's on track. And look, with respect to the Film studio, I think one of the things that Lachlan said in his remarks about consistency is really important. It's about consistency of creative output. It's about really focusing on having the best partners we can have and then -- and the process in terms of the decisions on production starts, on new projects, et cetera, really functioning more consistently and better. And I think, as I mentioned earlier, we've embarked on leadership transition there. There are changes in the future that we want to make. But fundamentally, as you said, it's a hit-driven business. We need to be really -- we need to be more consistently great in a marketplace, as competitive as it is, when it's hard to get a family off the couch and out to the theater. So we had some great success in the year. If I look back at The Martian or Deadpool or things like that, things that are distinctive that are where we can take risks, where we're doing things that maybe other studios aren't doing and provide something really different in the marketplace. I think the slate coming up is very promising, but it's really tough. It's going to be tough to judge the Film studio in any one quarter. It's really over a period of time."

We think we've got a great set of partners in this business, and we're very excited about it. So I think, over the next number of months, as we see us complete some of the supply agreements, you'll see more detail around the content offering and the full breadth of it, which we think is exciting. I think it's important to note that we do think that in this rebundling that's going on, there's significant demand for great television. There's significant demand for a great customer experience. And we want to be able to deliver it at the lowest price that we can. Fundamentally, that limits Hulu's ability, right, to just go and pay anything for a lot of program. We have to focus on what's the programming that really, really matters and what's going to drive consumption and what are people going to love. So I think it will be, as I've described it before, kind of a core package, a core bundle there, and we want to have a great entry point for customers to come in. That's not to say that premium offerings won't be there.

We -- in the beginning, we saw pretty severe sort of volatility and spikes, largely around sports viewership on the hotstar platform, so when there was a big cricket tournament or something like that. But gradually, over the last year, what's really built and gotten much more momentum is scripted programming. It's Indian scripted programming in multiple languages. And that's really driving -- that's been the most gratifying, to see more consistent viewership of that, and that's really -- that's really a big, big part of the volume now, and it's the fastest-growing part of the volume on a consistent basis is local Indian scripted programming at a very high volume.

Look, as I mentioned in my remarks before, we do want to be flexible in terms of our approach to licensing, and we want to do something that makes sense. The recent American Crime Story agreement with Netflix, we thought it just made a lot of sense. It's an anthology series, so sequential stacking of multiple seasons is less crucial because it's not serialized across seasons. But we were able to secure the current season full stack and avoid -- or not be -- not give up the kind of holdbacks that are -- have been characterizing some of these agreements in the past. So we think it makes a lot of sense for customers watching American Crime Story on FX or on FXNOW. And that's -- so you have the full in-season stack for the current seasons. And it was just a very, very attractive agreement for subsequent seasons for us and for our partners in the show. So you think you don't want to be too orthodox about it, but I think the important thing here was this preserves, really, the customer experience that we're seeking to deliver.

And then, at STAR, we definitely had a sort of change in the marketplace there a little bit, where the -- some of the e-commerce money that we're spending very heavily in the comparison quarters in the year before, notably Flipkart and Snapdeal, really reduced their spending quite dramatically. So they had grown to be one of the top sectors in advertising there and just went away. And the e-commerce money that continued to be spent was at Amazon, and that was really spread out more around sports assets, so we didn't get the full benefit of that.

And just as you know, we sell our programming across Europe to multiple MVPDs from, particularly, Liberty Global, KPN and others, et cetera, while the Sky businesses, which we're a major investor in, competes vigorously in a lot of those markets. So I think it's just -- a good example is India, where at Tata Sky, we're a significant investor there, but we distribute across all of the MVPDs, satellite, cable and telco. So I think it's consistent with our practice, and it's always benefited us and benefited customers, fundamentally, to have more competition downstream. We saw that when DIRECTV and DISH really started to grow again, where we really grew properly in the U.S. many years ago. We've definitely seen that across Latin America. We saw it with the telcos expanding the market. And we think the digital MVPD kind of universe is going to expand the market again. So we're -- we feel pretty good about that."

We are pleased to have delivered a strong quarter from both top and bottom line earnings. The progress we made against our earnings objectives is broad-based, representing improvements across business segments and geographies. It reflects operational momentum across our businesses, driven by our focus on creative excellence and by our efforts to enhance the consumer experience whilst better monetizing our content.
A number of key factors contributed to a 17% year-on-year EBITDA growth from a 7% increase in growth. Our Film segment more than doubled its quarterly earnings contribution, thanks to key film releases as well as the sale of some television SVOD rights. Summer releases Independence Day Resurgence and X-Men: Apocalypse were key contributors. Our recently released Tim Burton film, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, had a strong opening, which will primarily benefit the current December quarter. 
Under the leadership of Stacey Snider, the Film studio had bolstered its team by attracting key senior executive talent spanning marketing, international distribution, business affairs and licensing, and together, they're well focused on starting the studio's future course.
In the short term, there's lot to do. Our forward slate is strong, with Assassin's Creed, Jackie, Hidden Figures and Logan, all released in the balance of this fiscal year. It's a diverse and high-quality slate that we have solid expectations about.
Our Cable Networks earnings improvement was driven by 10% revenue growth on solid gains in both affiliate and advertising revenues, both domestically and internationally.
Of course, Fox News has never been stronger amidst an intense election season. It just marked its 59th consecutive quarter as the #1 in cable news and just finished October as the #1 network in both primetime and all day across all of cable. Last month also marked the first time that Fox News anchor moderated a general election presidential debate. We have to give a shout at the Chris Wallace's superb debate performance, which notably received kudos on both sides of the aisle.
Overall in the cable world, and of particular note, we added overall domestic pay TV subscribers this past quarter. We're particularly excited by all the new DMVPD services that are emerging in the marketplace. Hulu is executing against its development plan and is on track to launch its new DMVPD service early next year, as we have discussed previously.
Our major brands are included in every DMVPD service that has emerged, with affiliate fees that are absolutely on par with the per sub-affiliate fees we get from traditional pay-TV distributors.
Importantly, the strategic focus we put on our brands across our leadership in entertainment, news and sports positions us well for the transition to IP delivery. We are product focused that is as intense as it is unique and we're seeing the benefits of all our efforts and investments in that area.
Fundamentally, breakout content is what drives up the value of our brands. This is at the center of our growth strategy. A review of the businesses, highlights -- business highlights underscores our momentum in this regard, and I'll turn it over now to John and James to provide more details."
91031,408163525,1070739,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased with the strong financial results we reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. First quarter rev",672,"Thank you, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased with the strong financial results we reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. 
First quarter revenues increased 7% to $6.5 billion, led by double-digit revenue growth at the Cable Network segment and solid increases at the Film segment.
Total segment EBITDA was $1.79 billion, a 17% increase from the prior year, reflecting strong growth from the Film and Cable segments. This quarter's results included an approximate $40 million negative impact from foreign currency rates. And absent this impact, our overall EBITDA growth rate would be nearly 20%. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $827 million or $0.44 per share. Excluding the net income effects in both years of other net and of equity earnings adjustments from Sky and the Shine Group, adjusted EPS was $0.51 this quarter, which is a 34% increase over the comparable $0.38 reported a year ago. And while our tax rate in the quarter was below 30%, we expect the effective tax rate for the full year to be closer to the low to mid-30% range.
With that, I'll provide some added comments on the performance at our operating segments, starting with the Cable Networks, where total segment EBITDA of $1.38 billion was up 6% on 10% revenue growth. Overall, Cable Segment expenses increased 12%, but excluding the impact of the consolidation of Nat Geo partners, they were up 8%. Domestic Cable Network revenues increased 10% with affiliate fee growth of 8% and 6% advertising increases. The affiliate fee increase primarily reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brands as well as subscriber additions at some of our still expanding networks.
First quarter advertising revenue growth was driven by the ratings strength at Fox News and also reflects a 2 percentage point benefit from the consolidation of the Nat Geo businesses we acquired last November. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 9% over the prior year, reflecting the revenue growth, partially offset by higher baseball cost at the RSNs, higher entertainment programming cost at the FX channels and the inclusion of the expenses related to the acquired National Geographic businesses.
First quarter reported international cable revenues grew 9%, driven by an 8% increase in reported affiliate revenues, which were up 16% on a local currency basis. Reported advertising revenues increased 6% over the prior year on local currency growth of 11%, led by STAR in India. 
International channel EBITDA contributions on a reported basis decreased 7%, but excluding the effects of foreign exchange, primarily from Latin America, would have increased by 6%.
As expected, international channel expenses increased, largely reflecting higher sports cost from our broadcast of the Summer Olympics in both India and Latin America during the quarter. 
At our Television segment, EBITDA was $191 million versus the $196 million reported in the prior year. This slight year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower advertising revenues, largely from the absence of the prior-year broadcast of both the Emmy's and the FIFA Women's World Cup final as well as the market shift of advertising dollars towards the Summer Olympics. The advertising revenue declines were largely offset by continued retransmission consent revenue growth and higher content revenues led by Hulu.
At the Film segment, EBITDA of $311 million was more than double the amount we reported in the prior year. The current quarter results were driven by the as SVOD licensing of Homeland, lower theatrical releasing costs as well as higher profits from this year's summer film releases, including Independence Day Resurgence as compared to last year's slate, which included the release of Fantastic Four.
Shifting over to capital management, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately $410 million in FOXA shares, reducing total shares outstanding compared to a year ago by 10%. We now have approximately $3.2 billion remaining on our overall repurchase authorizations.
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

Good afternoon, everyone. So as you've heard, the fiscal year started well, so I just like to spend a minute on some highlights and then some things to focus on going forward.
First, I want to reiterate that our strategy, a focus on big brands that matter for customers, an investment on screen that clearly differentiates and earns attention and a program of work to make our programming and products more available, not less, is paying dividends.
Furthermore, the changes we've made to the organization are delivering a leaner and more capable company and the team continues to move at a very fast pace. 
Creatively, the business is in good health. FX set a new industry record for basic cable wins at the Emmy's this year, and our original series, American Horror Story Roanoke, launched as the highest rated cable TV series and our new series, Atlanta, ranks #2 in comedies behind to only South Park.
National Geographic's new programming strategy is just now kicking in, within the November 14 premiere of its first global event series, Mars, which begins its new premium programming push.
And on the broadcast television side, we've got real traction at the start of the season, with a number of new series, including Lethal Weapon, Pitch, The Exorcist and Son of Zoran. Currently, network entertainment advertising is pacing ahead of last year after a summer that saw a lot of demand absorbed by the Olympics broadcast on NBC. As a television studio, we're excited that we have 3 of the top 4 scripted series on broadcast television today, with Empire, This Is Us and Modern Family.
FOX Sports 1 recently marked its third anniversary and its highest viewership ever. In fact, the last 2 weeks marked its most watched and highest rated weeks in the networks interesting, beating ESPN around the clock for the first time ever. In addition to the strength in live events, Fox Sports 1's focus on pre- and post-game programming is paying dividends and the studio shows from skip and Shine to the herb and garbage in Fox Sports Live are surging and hitting ratings highs.
As for broadcast sports, the World Series has delivered the largest live baseball audience in over a decade, generating a huge amount of interest from advertisers and pricing accordingly. We're also pleased with how Fox is doing with its NFL programming. Where there's a lot of noise about declining NFL ratings, Fox's game day viewership on Sunday is holding up well and is within 4 percentage points of last year. Meanwhile, our NFL game of the week continues to be Television's highest rated and most watched show in any daypart, averaging over 25 million viewers. And from an advertising perspective, we continue a strong pace over where we were last year at this time, with year-to-year NFL ad pricing increases in the high single digits.
Our regional sports networks continue to excel. We had a great baseball season with 5 of our RSNs ranking #1 in their markets among all broadcast and cable on game nights.
STAR India's advertising revenues return to double digit year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis and we continue to see exceptional growth of our mobile video platform, hotstar. Between June and October, average watched time doubled on the platform and minutes viewed is currently more than double all the mainstream competitors combined and more than 10x the watch time of Netflix, which launched in India earlier this year.
Our Fox and National Geographic brands are also showing strong growth in almost every region. On a global and x U.S. basis, revenue growth is in the teens on a constant currency basis. 
The Sky business, our largest affiliate, is also making great strides as the strength and breadth of the platform continues to drive accelerated growth, both in subscribers but also in the tremendous content business that comprises so much of the company's portfolio.
In closing, it's an exciting time for us. As we look across the business, we feel good about where we are. 
We'll turn it over to questions now and we're happy to be as helpful as we can be. Reed?"

And I think seeing an early growth now in these new DMVPD entrants that we see in this quarter, we really think it's an exciting moment of growth over the next number of years as the downstream competition really increases with lower barriers to entry for these players and at price points, I think that do make a difference for customers. To your second question around the -- around those price points and the inclusion of different brands, all of our MVPD contracts have certain provisions for penetration rates, for packaging, et cetera, so there is an amount of flexibility that our partners have, but we would certainly expect all of our brands to be available to the customers of those DMVPDs. But the packaging, much of the packaging is really to come. You leave the packaging absolutely up to the DMVPDs themselves, and end of the pricing, how they choose the price and differentiate themselves with their customers. I think the key thing for us is that we're monetizing our content in exactly the same way as we are with the traditional MVPDs, so we're not out-of-pocket regardless of how they package or choose the package."

And we look at, you mentioned Sky's across Europe and what the business there has been able to do with creating a user experience that is really second to none, I think, globally, but also, our affiliate, Hulu, being able to [indiscernible] Multiplatform viewing, if I look at entertainment network, for example, on Hulu and our own and operated apps on an authenticated basis, we're almost 20% of our primetime viewing now and we think that's a really encouraging start. So it's not just to say that direct-to-consumer or user experience means you have to be an independently priced sort of offering out there. It's also something through the authentication process and through new partners, like these DMVPDs, where we can do quite a lot. One of the most exciting things is at innovation, so having that closer relationship with customers or working with partners like the DMVPD's or -- and Hulu going forward, where we can innovate in terms of advertising, we can reduce loads, we have more -- much more capability there. We think it's a real positive for the business. So I don't think it's a -- I don't think you have to necessarily say that an independently priced, a la carte or otherwise kind of direct-to-consumer offering is necessary. But where it's appropriate and where we think we can do something really interesting, we will. For example, in India with hotstar, which is growing gangbusters and we really saw an opportunity in mobile video to do something around the content that we create there, and that's been a great success and we think it's going to be a huge platform going forward. So I think it's a mix depending on the region, but there's no question that user experience is really important in terms of how people discover our programming, how they interact with it and then how we can monetize it in the best way possible."

We monetize streams, for example, on our owned and operated apps, where we have some ability to target and we can actually put new ad products in place at a much, much higher rate than we do on cable VOD services. And that's something that I think the MVPDs have to address and that's -- and I think we put a better user experience together there. So I think those things will level up as competition increases.

We are pleased to have delivered a strong quarter from both top and bottom line earnings. The progress we've made against our earnings objectives is broad based, representing improvements across business segments and geographies. It reflects operational momentum across our businesses, driven by our focus on creative excellence and by our efforts to enhance the consumer experience whilst better monetizing our content.
A number of key factors contributed to a 17% year-on-year EBITDA growth from a 7% increase in revenue. Our Film segment more than doubled its quarterly earnings contribution, thanks to key film releases as well as the sale of some television SVOD rights. Summer releases Independence Day Resurgence and X-Men: Apocalypse were key contributors. Our recently released Tim Burton film, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, had a strong opening, which will primarily benefit the current December quarter.
Under the leadership of Stacey Snider, the Film studio had bolstered its team by attracting key senior executive talent spanning marketing, international distribution, business affairs and licensing. And together, they're well focused on showering the studio's future course.
In the short term, there's lot to do. Our forward slate is strong, with Why Him?, Assassin's Creed, Jackie, Hidden Figures and Logan, all released in the balance of this fiscal year. It's a diverse and high-quality slate that we have solid expectations of.
Our Cable Networks earnings improvement was driven by 10% revenue growth on solid gains in both affiliate and advertising revenues, both domestically and internationally.
Of course, Fox News has never been stronger amidst an intense election season. It just marked its 59th consecutive quarter as the #1 in cable news and just finished October as the #1 network in both prime-time and all-day across all of cable. Last month also marked the first time a Fox News anchor moderated a general election presidential debate. We have to give a shout-out to Chris Wallace's superb debate performance, which notably received kudos on both sides of the aisle.
Overall in the cable world and of particular note, we added overall domestic pay TV subscribers this past quarter. We're particularly excited by all the new DMVPD services that are emerging in the marketplace. Hulu is executing against its development plan and is on track to launch its new DMVPD service early next year, as we have discussed previously.
Our major brands are included in every DMVPD service that has emerged, with affiliate fees that are absolutely on par with the per subaffiliate fees we get from traditional pay-TV distributors.
Importantly, the strategic focus we put on our brands across our leadership in entertainment, news and sports positions us well for the transition to IP delivery. We were product focused that is as intense as it is unique, and we're seeing the benefits of all our efforts and investments in that area.
Fundamentally, breakout content is what drives up the value of our brands. This is at the center of our growth strategy. A review of the businesses highlights -- business highlights underscores our momentum in this regard.
And I'll turn it over now to John and James to provide more details."
91031,408163525,1071035,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased with the strong financial results we reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. First quarter rev",674,"Thank you, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased with the strong financial results we reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. 
First quarter revenues increased 7% to $6.5 billion, led by double-digit revenue growth at the Cable Network segment and solid increases at the Film segment.
Total segment EBITDA was $1.79 billion, a 17% increase from the prior year, reflecting strong growth from the Film and Cable segments. This quarter's results included an approximate $40 million negative impact from foreign currency rates. And absent this impact, our overall EBITDA growth rate would be nearly 20%. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $827 million or $0.44 per share. Excluding the net income effects in both years of other net and of equity earnings adjustments from Sky and the Endemol Shine Group, adjusted EPS was $0.51 this quarter, which is a 34% increase over the comparable $0.38 reported a year ago. And while our tax rate in the quarter was below 30%, we expect the effective tax rate for the full year to be closer to the low to mid-30% range.
With that, I'll provide some added comments on the performance at our operating segments, starting with the Cable Networks, where total segment EBITDA of $1.38 billion was up 6% on 10% revenue growth. Overall, cable segment expenses increased 12%, but excluding the impact of the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners, they were up 8%. Domestic Cable Network revenues increased 10% with affiliate fee growth of 8% and 6% advertising increases. The affiliate fee increase primarily reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brands as well as subscriber additions at some of our still expanding networks.
First quarter advertising revenue growth was driven by the ratings strength at Fox News and also reflects a 2 percentage point benefit from the consolidation of the Nat Geo businesses we acquired last November. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 9% over the prior year, reflecting the revenue growth, partially offset by higher baseball cost at the RSNs, higher entertainment programming cost at the FX channels and the inclusion of the expenses related to the acquired National Geographic businesses.
First quarter reported international cable revenues grew 9%, driven by an 8% increase in reported affiliate revenues, which were up 16% on a local currency basis. Reported advertising revenues increased 6% over the prior year on local currency growth of 11%, led by STAR in India. 
International channel EBITDA contributions on a reported basis decreased 7%, but excluding the effects of foreign exchange, primarily from Latin America, would have increased by 6%.
As expected, international channel expenses increased, largely reflecting higher sports cost from our broadcast of the Summer Olympics in both India and Latin America during the quarter. 
At our Television segment, EBITDA was $191 million versus the $196 million reported in the prior year. This slight year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower advertising revenues, largely from the absence of the prior year broadcast of both the Emmy's and the FIFA Women's World Cup final as well as the market shift of advertising dollars towards the Summer Olympics. The advertising revenue declines were largely offset by continued retransmission consent revenue growth and higher content revenues led by Hulu.
At the Film segment, EBITDA of $311 million was more than double the amount we reported in the prior year. The current quarter results were driven by the as SVOD licensing of Homeland, lower theatrical releasing costs as well as higher profits from this year's summer film releases, including Independence Day Resurgence as compared to last year's slate, which included the release of Fantastic Four.
Shifting over to capital management. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $410 million in FOXA shares, reducing total shares outstanding compared to a year ago by 10%. We now have approximately $3.2 billion remaining on our overall repurchase authorizations.
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

Good afternoon, everyone. So as you've heard, the fiscal year started well. So I just like to spend a minute on some highlights and then some things to focus on going forward.
First, I want to reiterate that our strategy, our focus on big brands that matter for customers, an investment on screen that clearly differentiates and earns attention and a program of work to make our programming and products more available, not less, is paying dividends. Furthermore, the changes we've made to the organization are delivering a leaner and more capable company, and the team continues to move at a very fast pace. 
Creatively, the business is in good health. FX set a new industry record for basic cable wins at the Emmy's this year. And our original series, American Horror Story: Roanoke, launched as the highest rated cable TV series; and our new series, Atlanta, ranks #2 in comedies behind only South Park.
National Geographic's new programming strategy is just now kicking in, within the November 14 premiere of its first global event series, Mars, which begins its new premium programming push.
And on the broadcast television side, we've got real traction at the start of the new season, with a number of new series, including Lethal Weapon, Pitch, The Exorcist and Son of Zorn. Currently, network entertainment advertising is pacing ahead of last year after a summer that saw a lot of demand absorbed by the Olympics broadcast on NBC. At the television studio, we're excited that we have 3 of the top 4 scripted series on broadcast television today, with Empire, This Is Us and Modern Family.
Fox Sports 1 recently marked its third anniversary and its highest viewership ever. In fact, the last 2 weeks marked its most watched and highest rated weeks in the network's interesting, beating ESPN around the clock for the first time ever. In addition to the strength in live events, FS1's focus on building its pre- and post-game programming is paying dividends, and the studio shows from Skip and Shannon to the [indiscernible] Garbage Time and Fox Sports Live are surging and hitting ratings highs.
As for broadcast sports, the World Series has delivered the largest live baseball audience in over a decade, generating a huge amount of interest from advertisers and pricing accordingly. We're also pleased with how well Fox is doing with its NFL programming. While there's a lot of noise about declining NFL ratings, Fox's game day viewership on Sunday is holding up well and is within 4 percentage points of last year. Meanwhile, our NFL game of the week continues to be television's highest rated and most watched show in any daypart, averaging over 25 million viewers. And from an advertising perspective, we continue a strong pace over where we were last year at this time, with year-to-year NFL ad pricing increases in the high single digits.
Our regional sports networks continue to excel. We had a great baseball season with 5 of our RSNs ranking #1 in their markets among all broadcast and cable on game nights.
STAR India's advertising revenues returned to double digit year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis and we continue to see exceptional growth of our mobile video platform, hotstar. Between June and October, average watch time doubled on the platform and minutes viewed is currently more than double all the mainstream competitors combined and more than 10x the watch time of Netflix, which launched in India earlier this year.
Our Fox and National Geographic brands are also showing strong growth in almost every region. On a global x U.S. basis, revenue growth is in the teens on a constant currency basis. 
The Sky business, our largest affiliate, is also making great strides as the strength and breadth of the platform continues to drive accelerated growth, both in subscribers but also in the tremendous content business that comprises so much of the company's portfolio.
In closing, it's an exciting time for us. As we look across the business, we feel good about where we are. 
We'll turn it over to questions now, and we're happy to be as helpful as we can be. Reed?"

I think -- so there's no heightened appetite for any inorganic activities [indiscernible] the recent activity. And I would say as I said, I think, the last quarter, we really try to be very, very disciplined about this. We have a very high hurdle in terms of how we think about investment and how we think about doing things. We've clearly passed on a lot of opportunities that we thought were -- the price was just not going to deliver the value for shareholders that we think we want to deliver. So I don't think there's really any change there with respect to our own posture. I would say, though, that our business is growing really well, and this investment in these brands, this investment in the content and programming, this investment in the capabilities around the business from a user experience perspective and a monetization perspective are really getting traction.

And I think seeing an early growth now in these new DMVPD entrants that we see in this quarter, we really think it's an exciting moment of growth over the next number of years as the downstream competition really increases with lower barriers to entry for these players and at price points, I think that do make a difference for customers. To your second question around the -- around those price points and the inclusion of different brands, all of our MVPD contracts have certain provisions for penetration rates, for packaging, et cetera. So there is an amount of flexibility that our partners have, but we would certainly expect all of our brands to be available to the customers of those DMVPDs. But the packaging, much of the packaging is really to come. You leave the packaging absolutely up to the DMVPDs themselves, and end of the pricing, how they choose the price and differentiate themselves with their customers. I think the key thing for us is that we're monetizing our content in exactly the same way as we are with the traditional MVPDs. So we're not out-of-pocket regardless of how they package or choose to package."

And we look at, you mentioned Sky's across Europe and what the business there has been able to do with creating a user experience that's really second to none, I think, globally, but also, our affiliate, Hulu, being able to hear. I would say that multiplatform viewing, if I look at entertainment network, for example, on Hulu and our owned and operated apps on an authenticated basis, we're almost 20% of our primetime viewing now and we think that's a really encouraging start. So it's not just to say that direct-to-consumer or user experience means you have to be an independently priced sort of offering out there. It's also something through the authentication process and through new partners, like these DMVPDs, where we can do quite a lot. One of the most exciting things is at innovation, so having that closer relationship with customers or working with partners like the DMVPDs or -- and Hulu going forward, where we can innovate in terms of advertising, we can reduce loads, we have more -- much more capability there. We think it's a real positive for the business. So I don't think it's a -- I don't think you have to necessarily say that an independently priced, a la carte or otherwise kind of direct-to-consumer offering is necessary. But where it's appropriate and where we think we can do something really interesting, we will. For example, in India with hotstar, which is growing gangbusters and we really saw an opportunity in mobile video to do something around the content that we create there, and that's been a great success, and we think it's going to be a huge platform going forward. So I think it's a mix depending on the region, but there's no question that user experience is really important in terms of how people discover our programming, how they interact with it and then how we can monetize it in the best way possible."

We monetize streams, for example, on our owned and operated apps, where we have some ability to target and we can actually put new ad products in place at a much, much higher rate than we do on cable VOD services. And that's something that I think the MVPDs have to address and that's -- and I think we put a better user experience together there. So I think those things will level up as competition increases.

So it's really a broad-based business there and new rights have come up, we always will have a look at. There's nothing at this point that I can see in the outcomes of those things that would deter us from the medium-term targets that we've laid out for profit growth at STAR, which is -- which we're pacing towards pretty well. So we feel confident about that. And then with respect to the UFC and also, I'd say, with any right packages well, you make choices about these things, and it's really fundamentally about value. I think at Fox Sports 1, we're really trying to broaden the overall rights package as well, the rights offering to customers and the live events offering to customers. And we would look at any renewal or new rights packages coming on to Fox Sports 1 as a -- from a perspective of in value and the perspective of what we think it really can continue to bring to customers. The UFC's been a great partner for us, and we're -- and we've got a little ways to run on that. That's really not until fiscal '19, the impact would be. And we'll take it as it comes.

We are pleased to have delivered a strong quarter from both top and bottom line earnings. The progress we've made against our earnings objectives is broad based, representing improvements across business segments and geographies. It reflects operational momentum across our businesses, driven by our focus on creative excellence and by our efforts to enhance the consumer experience whilst better monetizing our content.
A number of key factors contributed to our 17% year-on-year EBITDA growth from a 7% increase in revenue. Our Film segment more than doubled its quarterly earnings contribution, thanks to key film releases as well as the sale of some television SVOD rights. Summer releases Independence Day Resurgence and X-Men: Apocalypse were key contributors. Our recently released Tim Burton film Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children had a strong opening, which will primarily benefit the current December quarter.
Under the leadership of Stacey Snider, the Film studio had bolstered its team by attracting key senior executive talent spanning marketing, international distribution, business affairs and licensing. And together, they are well focused on showering the studio's future course.
In the short term, there's a lot to do. Our forward slate is strong, with Why Him?, Assassin's Creed, Jackie, Hidden Figures and Logan, all released in the balance of this fiscal year. It's a diverse and high-quality slate that we have solid expectations of.
Our Cable Networks earnings improvement was driven by 10% revenue growth on solid gains in both affiliate and advertising revenues, both domestically and internationally.
Of course, Fox News has never been stronger amidst an intense election season. It just marked its 59th consecutive quarter as the #1 in cable news and just finished October as the #1 network in both prime-time and all-day across all of cable. Last month also marked the first time a Fox News anchor moderated a general election presidential debate. We have to give a shout-out to Chris Wallace's superb debate performance, which notably received kudos on both sides of the aisle.
Overall in the cable world and of particular note, we added overall domestic pay TV subscribers this past quarter. We're particularly excited by all the new DMVPD services that are emerging in the marketplace. Hulu is executing against its development plan and is on track to launch its new DMVPD service early next year, as we have discussed previously.
Our major brands are included in every DMVPD service that has emerged, with affiliate fees that are absolutely on par with the per-sub affiliate fees we get from traditional pay-TV distributors.
Importantly, the strategic focus we put on our brands across our leadership in entertainment, news and sports positions us well for the transition to IP delivery. We have a product focus that is as intense as it is unique, and we're seeing the benefits of all our efforts and investments in that area.
Fundamentally, breakout content is what drives up the value of our brands. This is at the center of our growth strategy. A review of the businesses highlights -- business highlights underscores our momentum in this regard.
And I'll turn it over now to John and James to provide more details."
91031,408163525,1071167,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. We were very pleased with the strong financial results we reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. First quarter re",674,"Thank you, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. We were very pleased with the strong financial results we reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. 
First quarter revenues increased 7% to $6.5 billion, led by double-digit revenue growth at the Cable Network segment and solid increases at the Film segment.
Total segment EBITDA was $1.79 billion, a 17% increase from the prior year, reflecting strong growth from the Film and Cable segments. This quarter's results include an approximate $40 million negative impact from foreign currency rates. And absent this impact, our overall EBITDA growth rate would be nearly 20%. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $827 million or $0.44 per share. Excluding the net income effects in both years of other net and of equity earnings adjustments from Sky and the Endemol Shine Group, adjusted EPS was $0.51 this quarter, which is a 34% increase over the comparable $0.38 reported a year ago. And while our tax rate in the quarter was below 30%, we expect the effective tax rate for the full year to be closer to the low to mid-30% range.
With that, I'll provide some added comments on the performance at our operating segments, starting with the Cable Networks, where total segment EBITDA of $1.38 billion was up 6% on 10% revenue growth. Overall, cable segment expenses increased 12%, but excluding the impact of the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners, they were up 8%. Domestic Cable Network revenues increased 10%, with affiliate fee growth of 8% and 6% advertising increases. The affiliate fee increase primarily reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brands as well as subscriber additions at some of our still expanding networks.
First quarter advertising revenue growth was driven by the ratings strength at Fox News. It also reflects a 2 percentage point benefit from the consolidation of the Nat Geo businesses we acquired last November. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 9% over the prior year, reflecting the revenue growth, partially offset by higher baseball costs at the RSNs, higher entertainment programming cost at the FX channels and the inclusion of the expenses related to the acquired National Geographic businesses.
First quarter reported international cable revenues grew 9%, driven by an 8% increase in reported affiliate revenues, which were up 16% on a local currency basis. Reported advertising revenues increased 6% over the prior year on local currency growth of 11%, led by STAR in India. 
International channel EBITDA contributions on a reported basis decreased 7%, but excluding the effects of foreign exchange, primarily from Latin America, would have increased by 6%.
As expected, international channel expenses increased, largely reflecting higher sports costs from our broadcast of the Summer Olympics in both India and Latin America during the quarter. 
At our Television segment, EBITDA was $191 million versus the $196 million reported in the prior year. This slight year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower advertising revenues, largely from the absence of the prior year broadcast of both the Emmys and the FIFA Women's World Cup final as well as the market shift of advertising dollars towards the Summer Olympics. The advertising revenue declines were largely offset by continued retransmission consent revenue growth and higher content revenues led by Hulu.
At the Film segment, EBITDA of $311 million was more than double the amount we reported in the prior year. The current quarter results were driven by the as SVOD licensing of Homeland, lower theatrical releasing costs as well as higher profits from this year's summer film releases, including Independence Day Resurgence, as compared to last year's slate, which included the release of Fantastic Four.
Shifting over to capital management. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $410 million in FOXA shares, reducing total shares outstanding compared to a year ago by 10%. We now have approximately $3.2 billion remaining on our overall repurchase authorizations.
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

Good afternoon, everyone. So as you've heard, the fiscal year started well. So I'd just like to spend a minute on some highlights and then some things to focus on going forward.
First, I want to reiterate that our strategy, a focus on big brands that matter for customers, an investment on screen that clearly differentiates and earns attention, and a program of work to make our programming and products more available, not less, is paying dividends. Furthermore, the changes we've made to the organization are delivering a leaner and more capable company, and the team continues to move at a very fast pace. 
Creatively, the business is in good health. FX set a new industry record for basic cable wins at the Emmys this year. And our original series American Horror Story: Roanoke launched as the highest rated cable TV series; and our new series, Atlanta, ranks #2 in comedies behind only South Park.
National Geographic's new programming strategy is just now kicking in, with the November 14 premiere of its first global event series, Mars, which begins its new premium programming push.
And on the broadcast television side, we've got real traction at the start of the new season, with a number of new series, including Lethal Weapon, Pitch, The Exorcist and Son of Zorn. Currently, network entertainment advertising is pacing ahead of last year after a summer that saw a lot of demand absorbed by the Olympics broadcast on NBC. At the television studio, we're excited that we have 3 of the top 4 scripted series on broadcast television today, with Empire, This Is Us and Modern Family.
Fox Sports 1 recently marked its third anniversary and its highest viewership ever. In fact, the last 2 weeks marked its most watched and highest rated weeks in the network's interesting, beating ESPN around the clock for the first time ever. In addition to the strength in live events, FS1's focus on building its pre- and post-game programming is paying dividends, and the studio shows from Skip and Shannon to The Herd to Garbage Time and Fox Sports Live are surging and hitting ratings highs.
As for broadcast sports, the World Series has delivered the largest live baseball audience in over a decade, generating a huge amount of interest from advertisers and pricing accordingly. We're also pleased with how well Fox is doing with its NFL programming. While there's a lot of noise about declining NFL ratings, Fox's game day viewership on Sunday is holding up well and is within 4 percentage points of last year. Meanwhile, our NFL game of the week continues to be television's highest rated and most watched show in any daypart, averaging over 25 million viewers. And from an advertising perspective, we continue a strong pace over where we were last year at this time, with year-to-year NFL ad pricing increases in the high single digits.
Our regional sports networks continue to excel. We had a great baseball season, with 5 of our RSNs ranking #1 in their markets among all broadcast and cable on game nights.
STAR India's advertising revenues returned to double digit year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis and we continue to see exceptional growth of our mobile video platform, hotstar. Between June and October, average watch time doubled on the platform and minutes viewed is currently more than double all the mainstream competitors combined and more than 10x the watch time of Netflix, which launched in India earlier this year.
Our Fox and National Geographic brands are also showing strong growth in almost every region. On a global x U.S. basis, revenue growth is in the teens on a constant currency basis. 
The Sky business, our largest affiliate, is also making great strides as the strength and breadth of the platform continues to drive accelerated growth, both in subscribers but also in the tremendous content business that comprises so much of the company's portfolio.
In closing, it's an exciting time for us. As we look across the business, we feel good about where we are. 
We'll turn it over to questions now, and we're happy to be as helpful as we can be. Reed?"

So in terms of scale, look, I think as we've often said, this is an industry and a business that thrives on scale. But at the same time, scale for scale's sake, is not something that we think should be pursued. We really like the business mix that we have. We've really simplified the operating model over the last number of years and invested in these big scale brands that really operate at the top of their games, I think, all over the world. And we feel pretty good about that, and our focus remains execution and operating the business as best we can and growing it as fast as we can. I think -- so there's no heightened appetite for any inorganic activities apropos the recent activity. And I would say, as I said, I think, the last quarter, we really try to be very, very disciplined about this. We have a very high hurdle in terms of how we think about investment and how we think about doing things. We've clearly passed on a lot of opportunities that we thought were -- the price was just not going to deliver the value for shareholders that we think we want to deliver. So I don't think there's really any change there with respect to our own posture. I would say, though, that our business is growing really well, and this investment in these brands, this investment in the content and programming, this investment in the capabilities around the business from a user experience perspective and a monetization perspective are really getting traction. So we feel good about the business mix and the assets that we're operating and are involved in."

And beyond that, I really don't want to go into any particular commercial relationship until they're sort of -- it's more out there, but we certainly anticipate the inclusion of these brands. And that's why we've been investing in these brands; that's why we've really adopted the strategy we have around these brands that matter for customers. And I think seeing an early growth now in these new DMVPD entrants that we see in this quarter, we really think it's an exciting moment of growth over the next number of years as this downstream competition really increases with lower barriers to entry for these players and at price points, I think, that do make a difference for customers. To your second question around the -- around those price points and the inclusion of different brands, all of our MVPD contracts have certain provisions for penetration rates, for packaging, et cetera. So there is an amount of flexibility that our partners have, but we would certainly expect all of our brands to be available to the customers of those DMVPDs. But the packaging, much of the packaging is really to come. You leave the packaging absolutely up to the DMVPDs themselves, and to the pricing, how they choose the price and differentiate themselves with their customers. I think the key thing for us is that we're monetizing our content in exactly the same way as we are with the traditional MVPDs. So we're not out-of-pocket regardless of how they package or choose to package."

And we look at, you mentioned Sky's across Europe and what the business there has been able to do with creating a user experience that's really second to none, I think, globally, but also, our affiliate, Hulu, being able to get here. I would say that multiplatform viewing, if I look at entertainment network, for example, on Hulu and our owned and operated apps on an authenticated basis are almost 20% of our primetime viewing now and we think that's a really encouraging start. So it's not just to say that direct-to-consumer or user experience means you have to be an independently priced sort of offering out there. It's also something through the authentication process and through new partners, like these DMVPDs, where we can do quite a lot. One of the most exciting things is ad innovation, so having that closer relationship with customers or working with partners like the DMVPDs or -- and Hulu going forward, where we can innovate in terms of advertising, we can reduce loads, we have more -- much more capability there. We think it's a real positive for the business. So I don't think it's a -- I don't think you have to necessarily say that an independently priced, a la carte or otherwise kind of direct-to-consumer offering is necessary. But where it's appropriate and where we think we can do something really interesting, we will. For example, in India with hotstar, which is growing gangbusters and we really saw an opportunity in mobile video to do something around the content that we create there, and that's been a great success, and we think it's going to be a huge platform going forward. So I think it's a mix depending on the region, but there's no question the user experience is really important in terms of how people discover our programming, how they interact with it and then how we can monetize it in the best way possible."

And to be very candid with you, we'd like to work more closely with them. Some of that's been challenging in terms of actually getting targeted advertising, dynamic ad insertion, all of those things, access to data can be challenging. We monetize streams, for example, on our owned and operated apps, where we have some ability to target and we can actually put new ad products in place at a much, much higher rate than we do on cable VOD services. And that's something that I think the MVPDs have to address and that's -- and I think we put a better user experience together there. So I think those things will level up as competition increases. But also, across the board, from Hulu to the O&O apps to some of our third-party distributors as well as the DMVPDs emerging, the opportunity for ad innovation is much, much greater than in the legacy infrastructure that's there.

So it's really a broad-based business there and new rights have come up, we always will have a look at. There's nothing at this point that I can see in the outcomes of those things that would deter us from the medium-term targets that we've laid out for profit growth at STAR, which is -- which we're pacing towards pretty well. So we feel confident about that. And then with respect to the UFC and also, I'd say, with any rights packages well, you make choices about these things, and it's really fundamentally about value. I think at Fox Sports 1, we're really trying to broaden the overall rights package as well, the rights offering to customers and the live events offering to customers. And we would look at any renewal or new rights packages coming on to Fox Sports 1 as a -- from a perspective of value and the perspective of what we think it really can continue to bring to customers. The UFC's been a great partner for us, and we're -- and we've got a little ways to run on that. That's really not until fiscal '19, the impact would be. And we'll take it as it comes.

Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call. On the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman; James Murdoch, Chief Executive Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer.
First, we will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. 
This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to Twenty-First Century Fox's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said.

Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such as segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis.

We are pleased to have delivered a strong quarter from both top and bottom line earnings. The progress we've made against our earnings objectives is broad based, representing improvements across business segments and geographies. It reflects operational momentum across our businesses, driven by our focus on creative excellence and by our efforts to enhance the consumer experience whilst better monetizing our content.
A number of key factors contributed to our 17% year-on-year EBITDA growth from a 7% increase in revenue. Our Film segment more than doubled its quarterly earnings contribution, thanks to key film releases as well as the sale of some television SVOD rights. Summer releases Independence Day Resurgence and X-Men: Apocalypse were key contributors. Our recently released Tim Burton film Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children had a strong opening, which will primarily benefit the current December quarter.
Under the leadership of Stacey Snider, the Film studio had bolstered its team by attracting key senior executive talent spanning marketing, international distribution, business affairs and licensing. And together, they are well focused on showering the studio's future course.
In the short term, there's a lot to do. Our forward slate is strong, with Why Him?, Assassin's Creed, Jackie, Hidden Figures and Logan, all released in the balance of this fiscal year. It's a diverse and high-quality slate that we have solid expectations of.
Our Cable Networks earnings improvement was driven by 10% revenue growth on solid gains in both affiliate and advertising revenues, both domestically and internationally.
Of course, Fox News has never been stronger amidst an intense election season. It just marked its 59th consecutive quarter as the #1 in cable news and just finished October as the #1 network in both prime-time and all-day across all of cable. Last month also marked the first time a Fox News anchor moderated a general election presidential debate. We have to give a shout-out to Chris Wallace's superb debate performance, which notably received kudos on both sides of the aisle.
Overall in the cable world and of particular note, we added overall domestic pay TV subscribers this past quarter. We're particularly excited by all the new DMVPD services that are emerging in the marketplace. Hulu is executing against its development plan and is on track to launch its new DMVPD service early next year, as we have discussed previously.
Our major brands are included in every DMVPD service that has emerged, with affiliate fees that are absolutely on par with the per-sub affiliate fees we get from traditional pay-TV distributors.
Importantly, the strategic focus we put on our brands across our leadership in entertainment, news and sports positions us well for the transition to IP delivery. We have a product focus that is as intense as it is unique, and we're seeing the benefits of all our efforts and investments in that area.
Fundamentally, breakout content is what drives up the value of our brands. This is at the center of our growth strategy. A review of the businesses highlights -- business highlights underscores our momentum in this regard.
And I'll turn it over now to John and James to provide more details."

We were very pleased with the strong financial results we reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. First quarter re",674,"Thank you, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. We were very pleased with the strong financial results we reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. 
First quarter revenues increased 7% to $6.5 billion, led by double-digit revenue growth at the Cable Network segment and solid increases at the Film segment.
Total segment EBITDA was $1.79 billion, a 17% increase from the prior year, reflecting strong growth from the Film and Cable segments. This quarter's results include an approximate $40 million negative impact from foreign currency rates. And absent this impact, our overall EBITDA growth rate would be nearly 20%. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $827 million or $0.44 per share. Excluding the net income effects in both years of other net and of equity earnings adjustments from Sky and the Endemol Shine Group, adjusted EPS was $0.51 this quarter, which is a 34% increase over the comparable $0.38 reported a year ago. And while our tax rate in the quarter was below 30%, we expect the effective tax rate for the full year to be closer to the low to mid-30% range.
With that, I'll provide some added comments on the performance at our operating segments, starting with the Cable Networks, where total segment EBITDA of $1.38 billion was up 6% on 10% revenue growth. Overall, cable segment expenses increased 12%, but excluding the impact of the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners, they were up 8%. Domestic Cable Network revenues increased 10%, with affiliate fee growth of 8% and 6% advertising increases. The affiliate fee increase primarily reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brands as well as subscriber additions at some of our still expanding networks.
First quarter advertising revenue growth was driven by the ratings strength at Fox News. It also reflects a 2 percentage point benefit from the consolidation of the Nat Geo businesses we acquired last November. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 9% over the prior year, reflecting the revenue growth, partially offset by higher baseball costs at the RSNs, higher entertainment programming cost at the FX channels and the inclusion of the expenses related to the acquired National Geographic businesses.
First quarter reported international cable revenues grew 9%, driven by an 8% increase in reported affiliate revenues, which were up 16% on a local currency basis. Reported advertising revenues increased 6% over the prior year on local currency growth of 11%, led by STAR in India. 
International channel EBITDA contributions on a reported basis decreased 7%, but excluding the effects of foreign exchange, primarily from Latin America, would have increased by 6%.
As expected, international channel expenses increased, largely reflecting higher sports costs from our broadcast of the Summer Olympics in both India and Latin America during the quarter. 
At our Television segment, EBITDA was $191 million versus the $196 million reported in the prior year. This slight year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower advertising revenues, largely from the absence of the prior year broadcast of both the Emmys and the FIFA Women's World Cup final as well as the market shift of advertising dollars towards the Summer Olympics. The advertising revenue declines were largely offset by continued retransmission consent revenue growth and higher content revenues led by Hulu.
At the Film segment, EBITDA of $311 million was more than double the amount we reported in the prior year. The current quarter results were driven by the as SVOD licensing of Homeland, lower theatrical releasing costs as well as higher profits from this year's summer film releases, including Independence Day Resurgence, as compared to last year's slate, which included the release of Fantastic Four.
Shifting over to capital management. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $410 million in FOXA shares, reducing total shares outstanding compared to a year ago by 10%. We now have approximately $3.2 billion remaining on our overall repurchase authorizations.
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

Good afternoon, everyone. So as you've heard, the fiscal year started well. So I'd just like to spend a minute on some highlights and then some things to focus on going forward.
First, I want to reiterate that our strategy, a focus on big brands that matter for customers, an investment on screen that clearly differentiates and earns attention, and a program of work to make our programming and products more available, not less, is paying dividends. Furthermore, the changes we've made to the organization are delivering a leaner and more capable company, and the team continues to move at a very fast pace. 
Creatively, the business is in good health. FX set a new industry record for basic cable wins at the Emmys this year. And our original series American Horror Story: Roanoke launched as the highest rated cable TV series; and our new series, Atlanta, ranks #2 in comedies behind only South Park.
National Geographic's new programming strategy is just now kicking in, with the November 14 premiere of its first global event series, Mars, which begins its new premium programming push.
And on the broadcast television side, we've got real traction at the start of the new season, with a number of new series, including Lethal Weapon, Pitch, The Exorcist and Son of Zorn. Currently, network entertainment advertising is pacing ahead of last year after a summer that saw a lot of demand absorbed by the Olympics broadcast on NBC. At the television studio, we're excited that we have 3 of the top 4 scripted series on broadcast television today, with Empire, This Is Us and Modern Family.
Fox Sports 1 recently marked its third anniversary and its highest viewership ever. In fact, the last 2 weeks marked its most watched and highest rated weeks in the network's interesting, beating ESPN around the clock for the first time ever. In addition to the strength in live events, FS1's focus on building its pre- and post-game programming is paying dividends, and the studio shows from Skip and Shannon to The Herd to Garbage Time and Fox Sports Live are surging and hitting ratings highs.
As for broadcast sports, the World Series has delivered the largest live baseball audience in over a decade, generating a huge amount of interest from advertisers and pricing accordingly. We're also pleased with how well Fox is doing with its NFL programming. While there's a lot of noise about declining NFL ratings, Fox's game day viewership on Sunday is holding up well and is within 4 percentage points of last year. Meanwhile, our NFL game of the week continues to be television's highest rated and most watched show in any daypart, averaging over 25 million viewers. And from an advertising perspective, we continue a strong pace over where we were last year at this time, with year-to-year NFL ad pricing increases in the high single digits.
Our regional sports networks continue to excel. We had a great baseball season, with 5 of our RSNs ranking #1 in their markets among all broadcast and cable on game nights.
STAR India's advertising revenues returned to double digit year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis and we continue to see exceptional growth of our mobile video platform, hotstar. Between June and October, average watch time doubled on the platform and minutes viewed is currently more than double all the mainstream competitors combined and more than 10x the watch time of Netflix, which launched in India earlier this year.
Our Fox and National Geographic brands are also showing strong growth in almost every region. On a global x U.S. basis, revenue growth is in the teens on a constant currency basis. 
The Sky business, our largest affiliate, is also making great strides as the strength and breadth of the platform continues to drive accelerated growth, both in subscribers but also in the tremendous content business that comprises so much of the company's portfolio.
In closing, it's an exciting time for us. As we look across the business, we feel good about where we are. 
We'll turn it over to questions now, and we're happy to be as helpful as we can be. Reed?"

But at the same time, scale for scale's sake, is not something that we think should be pursued. We really like the business mix that we have. We've really simplified the operating model over the last number of years and invested in these big scale brands that really operate at the top of their games, I think, all over the world. And we feel pretty good about that, and our focus remains execution and operating the business as best we can and growing it as fast as we can. I think -- so there's no heightened appetite for any inorganic activities apropos the recent activity. And I would say, as I said, I think, the last quarter, we really try to be very, very disciplined about this. We have a very high hurdle in terms of how we think about investment and how we think about doing things. We've clearly passed on a lot of opportunities that we thought were -- the price was just not going to deliver the value for shareholders that we think we want to deliver. So I don't think there's really any change there with respect to our own posture. I would say, though, that our business is growing really well, and this investment in these brands, this investment in the content and programming, this investment in the capabilities around the business from a user experience perspective and a monetization perspective are really getting traction. So we feel good about the business mix and the assets that we're operating and are involved in."

And beyond that, I really don't want to go into any particular commercial relationship until they're sort of -- it's more out there, but we certainly anticipate the inclusion of these brands. And that's why we've been investing in these brands; that's why we've really adopted the strategy we have around these brands that matter for customers. And I think seeing an early growth now in these new DMVPD entrants that we see in this quarter, we really think it's an exciting moment of growth over the next number of years as this downstream competition really increases with lower barriers to entry for these players and at price points, I think, that do make a difference for customers. To your second question around the -- around those price points and the inclusion of different brands, all of our MVPD contracts have certain provisions for penetration rates, for packaging, et cetera. So there is an amount of flexibility that our partners have, but we would certainly expect all of our brands to be available to the customers of those DMVPDs. But the packaging, much of the packaging is really to come. You leave the packaging absolutely up to the DMVPDs themselves, and to the pricing, how they choose the price and differentiate themselves with their customers. I think the key thing for us is that we're monetizing our content in exactly the same way as we are with the traditional MVPDs. So we're not out-of-pocket regardless of how they package or choose to package."

And we look at, you mentioned Sky's across Europe and what the business there has been able to do with creating a user experience that's really second to none, I think, globally, but also, our affiliate, Hulu, being able to get here. I would say that multiplatform viewing, if I look at entertainment network, for example, on Hulu and our owned and operated apps on an authenticated basis are almost 20% of our primetime viewing now and we think that's a really encouraging start. So it's not just to say that direct-to-consumer or user experience means you have to be an independently priced sort of offering out there. It's also something through the authentication process and through new partners, like these DMVPDs, where we can do quite a lot. One of the most exciting things is ad innovation, so having that closer relationship with customers or working with partners like the DMVPDs or -- and Hulu going forward, where we can innovate in terms of advertising, we can reduce loads, we have more -- much more capability there. We think it's a real positive for the business. So I don't think it's a -- I don't think you have to necessarily say that an independently priced, a la carte or otherwise kind of direct-to-consumer offering is necessary. But where it's appropriate and where we think we can do something really interesting, we will. For example, in India with hotstar, which is growing gangbusters and we really saw an opportunity in mobile video to do something around the content that we create there, and that's been a great success, and we think it's going to be a huge platform going forward. So I think it's a mix depending on the region, but there's no question the user experience is really important in terms of how people discover our programming, how they interact with it and then how we can monetize it in the best way possible."

So what steps are you taking specifically to kind of drive this targeted advertising across all platforms? I mean, obviously, AT&T and Time Warner talked a lot a bit that on their platform, but that's only one. And you just mentioned Hulu. So what can you do to really drive the addressable advertising across all platforms? And I guess, also on the advertising side, can you just comment on current market conditions, what you're seeing into fiscal Q2?"

So on -- with respect to ad innovation across the piece, clearly, we work with a number of partners, our distributors and downstream distributors. And to be very candid with you, we'd like to work more closely with them. Some of that's been challenging in terms of actually getting targeted advertising, dynamic ad insertion, all of those things, access to data can be challenging. We monetize streams, for example, on our owned and operated apps, where we have some ability to target and we can actually put new ad products in place at a much, much higher rate than we do on cable VOD services. And that's something that I think the MVPDs have to address and that's -- and I think we put a better user experience together there. So I think those things will level up as competition increases. But also, across the board, from Hulu to the O&O apps to some of our third-party distributors as well as the DMVPDs emerging, the opportunity for ad innovation is much, much greater than in the legacy infrastructure that's there. So we think that's really exciting."

Having said that, we are disappointed with the level of political spending that, obviously, we've seen and that we would have expected. But having said that, pacing is up in the low to mid-single digits and scatter pricing is a bit sort of conservative up between 20% and 30% and with significant enough inventory that it's making an impact."

Looks like people are saying, according to the press, Amazon might be interested. I'm sure you guys are interested. Would love to know how that factors into your thinking about the targets for STAR India EBITDA growth and how aggressive you would need to be or not be for that guy? And then, similarly, in the States, on the MMA contracts rights, which are coming up, that's a cornerstone of Fox Sports. One, how you are thinking about what you would do with or without that; and how aggressive you need to bid there. Then a quick one for John, I guess, would just be, can you help us in a situation where you're in a dispute with a big traditional distributor about -- actually, a litigated dispute about the rates -- rate card for your networks. How are you accruing that affiliate to your revenue? Are you accruing at a rate that you believe you should be paid or at the rate that your counterparty believes you should be paid?"

So first of all, to say on the IPO, I think it's well known that there's a -- it's well known that it's very unclear when those rights will come to market There been -- there's been a delay in that process. But I would say, look, with respect to the Indian business, we, obviously, look at different rights packages as they come up. Of the -- we've really grown the breadth of that business in terms of sports with our BCCI domestic cricket contract as well as the growth in kabaddi and the Indian super league. So it's really a broad-based business there and new rights have come up, we always will have a look at. There's nothing at this point that I can see in the outcomes of those things that would deter us from the medium-term targets that we've laid out for profit growth at STAR, which is -- which we're pacing towards pretty well. So we feel confident about that. And then with respect to the UFC and also, I'd say, with any rights packages well, you make choices about these things, and it's really fundamentally about value. I think at Fox Sports 1, we're really trying to broaden the overall rights package as well, the rights offering to customers and the live events offering to customers. And we would look at any renewal or new rights packages coming on to Fox Sports 1 as a -- from a perspective of value and the perspective of what we think it really can continue to bring to customers. The UFC's been a great partner for us, and we're -- and we've got a little ways to run on that. That's really not until fiscal '19, the impact would be. And we'll take it as it comes. And then, I mean -- just on the other question, we booked the fees on the contract rates, and we have a contract with Charter. And we're booking the fees at that level."
