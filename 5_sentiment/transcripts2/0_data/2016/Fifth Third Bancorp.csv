For 2015, we reported full year net income available to common shareholders of $1.6 billion. Our full year earnings growth of 60% reflected significant returns from the sale of a portion of our Vantiv ownership and thoughtful management of our balance sheet, given the uncertain pace of interest rate increases. 2015 was an important year of and results were highlighted by return on assets of 1.22% and return on common equity of 11.3%. Despite the $94 million impact of the deposit product, our net interest income was relatively flat. We invest in our businesses and the talent across the organization strengthened our balance sheet and further enhanced our risk and compliance infrastructure. 
Full year net interest income declined only 1% as growth otherwise offset the lost revenue from the reduction in income related to the deposit advance products. Year-over-year core fee income growth was 3%. As we grow fee income, we will seek to add capital efficient and growth-oriented products and services in order to deepen client relationships. 
Our intention is to reduce our dependency on more volatile spread income or complementing an already rich menu of products that we offer our clients. Along these lines, you may have seen our recent announcement regarding the hiring of a long-tenured insurance executive who have successfully grown and run and integrated bank-owned insurance program. We are excited about this business and we will explore other areas of opportunity for expansion of products and services we offer today. 
As we are maintaining our focus on revenue growth, we are keeping operating leverage on the top of our priority list. While expenses were up this year, we are confident in our ability to return to positive operating leverage once the increases in our risk and compliance areas begin to flatten, which we believe will happen later this year. As we said on many occasions, we will continue to invest in our businesses while we look to partially fund those investments through savings in our core operations and investments in our future capabilities. Tayfun will cover some additional details of our investments so you can get a better idea of the impact and trajectory we are looking at. 
We are committed to achieving positive operating leverage, and we believe we have the right plans in place to make that happen. 
For 2015, average core deposits were up 6% for the year, while average loan balances were up 2%, resulting in a core deposit-to-loan ratio of 106%. Balance sheet strength is a core focus for me and my team, as our goal is to be a top performer across the business cycle with lower volatility of earnings. 
We continue to reposition the loan portfolio for consistent performance through the cycle as we focus on higher quality relationships. This is a path we were pursuing for the last several years, as you can see in the average of our commercial book that we've discussed in our some of our presentations over the last year. 
More recently, we have taken actions to reduce exposure to certain sectors in order to reduce the sources of some of our early earnings volatility. Tayfun will discuss some of our efforts in this commentary. 
Looking beyond some of the discreet items in 2015, underlying performance and metrics continue to improve as NPAs and delinquencies remain at levels that we have not seen since before the crisis. Our intention is to operate a business model with better credit performance predictability. With our focus on operating metrics, we also made significant progress on our strategic plans throughout the year. We announced plans to rationalize parts of our branch network, which will save $60 million annually. We closed or sold 41 branches last year and we have 2 transactions that are scheduled to close near the end of the first quarter that included additional 34 branches. In total, we're about 2/3 of the way through the project and we expect the remaining 32 branches to be closed by June 30. 
Also during the year, we concluded 3 significant legal settlements and reduced the size of our Vantiv position. I know I've covered many of these items before, but I think it's important for us to highlight the pattern of active, disciplined decision making we've demonstrated as we continue to reposition the company for future success. Vantiv continues to be a source of significant returns for our shareholders, and the year was capped by a number of transactions related to our ownership. We have taken important steps towards reducing our direct ownership stake in Vantiv in the best interest of our stakeholders, while reducing a significant amount of volatility associated with our warrant position. 
During the fourth quarter, we sold approximately 8 million shares, sold or settled 2/3 of the warrant and sold a portion of future TRA payments, which unlock nearly $0.5 billion of value. Vantiv continues to perform well, and we are happy to participate in our success. 
To maximize returns to our shareholders, we executed in a well-planned manner on all 3 pieces of our financial interest namely; the TRA, warrants and direct ownership. We still hold a significant ownership stake in the company, which we believe will result in healthy returns for our shareholders. 
For the third consecutive year, we returned more than 75% of our earnings back to shareholders. We expect that would rank us near the top of our peers. In 2015, we returned 40% of earnings via share buybacks, which reduced our share count by 39 million shares. Dividends represent 30% of earnings, and combined, we achieved a core payout ratio of 72%. In addition to our core payout ratio, the Vantiv proceeds were used to repurchase an additional 9.25 million shares of our common stock. In aggregate, we've returned 78% of our earnings back to shareholders. 
So now, a few comments about the fourth quarter. We reported net income to common shareholders of $634 million in earnings per diluted share of $0.79, including $0.38 of volumes that Tayfun will go over in more detail. The largest impact on the quarter was the monetization of a portion of our ownership in Vantiv that I just mentioned. 
Core fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations. We view the fed December rate move as a positive first step towards a normalized environment, but there is uncertainty around the extend and timing of the feature rate decisions. Our loan growth was impacted by larger-than-normal pay-downs and payoffs. However, we are starting the year with a strong origination activity, and our outlook for 2016 remains in line with the now lower GDP outlook. Fourth quarter reflects the efforts to position ourselves for growth. We are refocusing our resources on businesses with higher growth return potential that will enable us to achieve our objective of outperformance through the cycle. 
In addition to that, we are making investments in infrastructure, designed to improve our service delivery and efficiency. 
Our fee business has produced stable results, despite lower levels of capital markets activity. We are pleased with the low level charge-offs of 34 basis points. We are closely managing our expenses, with a sharp focus on extracting efficiencies from our day-to-day operations. 
Our noninterest expense in the fourth quarter was up 2%, driven by risk management technology investments and a substantial contribution to our charitable foundation. Credit results reflect the ongoing benign environment. We are cognizant of global volatilities that are creating anxiety in the markets, but we believe that our exposures are conservatively underwritten and we have limited aggregate exposures in the more volatile sectors. 
We view 2016 as an important transition year, as it position our company to achieve operating leverage in a sustainable manner, regardless of the rate environment. 
In 2015, we have taken important steps in that direction, and we'll continue our efforts in 2016. We are working on long-term revenue growth, as well as efficiencies to achieve our goal. We have taken actions to reduce run rate expenses in order to partially fund strategic investments, and we expect expenses related to our risk and compliance infrastructure to peak in 2016. We will continue to reallocate resources to improve profitability with reduce volatility. We are committed to achieving the industry leading level of operational results that you have historically seen from us. 
Our 18,000 employees are our most important asset, and I'm extremely proud of what they accomplished in 2015. They did a great job in taking care of our customers and driving shareholder value. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication in 2015, and I look forward to their contributions to our success in 2016. Thank you. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our fourth quarter operating results and our outlook for the remainder of the year."
270961,318753206,919831,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 3 of the presentation. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $634 million or $0.79 per diluted share. There were a",3757,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 3 of the presentation. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $634 million or $0.79 per diluted share. There were a number of items that affected earnings in the quarter, as Greg mentioned. These items can be found on Page 2 of our release, and the net impact was a benefit of $0.38 per share. We've been patient and deliberate in our actions related to our Vantiv ownership, and we have delivered significant value to our shareholders. The benefits of the transactions are sufficiently self evident. 
With that, let's move to the average balance sheet on Page 4 of the presentation. Average portfolio balances were $221 million higher than the third quarter, and the period end balances were down about $1 billion as payoffs and pay-downs, especially in December, impacted our net growth. The payoffs were higher than expected, especially in commercial real estate, which reached almost $1 billion this quarter as construction projects refinanced into permanent financing. 
During the quarter, we maintained our strategy of keeping a shorter duration in our commercial real estate portfolio. Some of these payoffs were slated for the first quarter, and as such, it was a timing issue as they exited the portfolio earlier than expected. In addition, we have actively reduced exposures in certain segments of the portfolio, such as commodity trading, in line with our goal to reduce volatility, especially in the current environment. 
I would like to point out that although the market sensitivity to the economic environment increased over the last few weeks, we discussed our rather cautious perspective on the economic environment with you in October and indicated that our actions reflect views on the overall economic conditions and the age of the current credit cycle. 
As some of the production also shifted from the fourth quarter into the first, we are starting the year with a healthy amount of activity. New production coupons have remained stable, but the credits spread widening, seen in the high-yield market, has not yet reached bank loan credit spreads. Consumer loans were flat with last quarter and continue to display similar trends to recent quarters. Average investment securities increased by $700 million in the fourth quarter or 2% sequentially. Average core deposits increased $1 billion from the third quarter, driven by higher demand deposit and money market account balances. Our ratio was 115% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving to NII on Page 5 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $2 million sequentially to $904 million, primarily driven by the full quarter impact of the $2.4 billion of wholesale debt issuances in the third quarter and our auto loan securitization completed in November. The net interest margin was 285 basis points, down 4 basis points from the third quarter, driven by the impact of those debt issuances, slower prepayments reducing net discount accretion on the investment portfolio and an increased short-term cash position during the quarter. 
Our margin for the second half of the year was 2.87%. The results related to NII and NIM were very much in line with our expectations and guidance. 
Shifting to fees on Page 6 of the presentation. Fourth quarter noninterest income was $1.1 billion compared with $713 million in the third quarter. Results included a net $490 million of pre-tax Vantiv items we've already discussed. We show fee income, adjusted for primarily Vantiv-related items on Slide 6 of $623 million, an increase of $32 million or 5% sequentially. This growth included the annual payment under our tax receivable agreement with Vantiv, which was $31 million this quarter. 
Corporate banking fees of $104 million were flat sequentially. The volatility towards the end of the year clearly impacted our client activity in capital markets. It is no surprise that the gap was more pronounced in loan syndications as the slowdown in those markets have been widely publicized. 
Mortgage banking net revenue of $74 million was up $3 million sequentially. Originations were at  $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, with 49% purchase volume. 80% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels and 20% from the corresponding channels. Gain on sale margins were up 6 basis points sequentially. 
Net servicing asset valuation adjustments, which include amortization and valuation adjustments, were negative $16 million this quarter versus negative $29 million last quarter. Deposit service charges decreased 1% from the third quarter and increased 1% relative to the fourth quarter of 2014. Deposit service charges this quarter were impacted by a 3% reduction in consumer service charges, primarily due to a roll out in the fourth quarter of a more simplified checking product line up. Total investment advisory revenue of $102 million decreased 1% sequentially, primarily due to lower retail brokerage revenues, partially offset by personal asset management and specialty services revenue growth. 
We show noninterest expense on Page 7 of the presentation. Expenses were $963 million compared with $943 million in the third quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to a $10 million contribution to Fifth Third Foundation, technology expenses and higher net occupancy expense, which was partially impacted by the real estate decisions in one of the consumer markets that we are exiting this year. 
Our total employee expenses were up approximately $65 million in 2015. That number included the impact of inflationary adjustments, severance, as well as the change in the composition of our total employee base. Although our year-over-year headcount is down, the reduction is mainly in our retail branch network and the adds are in risk and compliance. By nature of those job functions, the average compensation related to our new employees is higher than those that left the bank. 
During the year, we added 373 people in our risk and compliance functions for an incremental compensation cost of approximately $21 million, and that number will continue to grow in 2016. I will share those details with you shortly. 
As expected, our technology expenses increased this quarter, although somewhat less than we anticipated. Project calendar typically impact our technology expenditures, but in general, the direction is in line with our expectations and guidance. Card and processing expenses were also up, primarily on costs associated with our EMV project. 
We are spending a lot of time on controllable expenses with all of our business lines and will continue to enforce a tight level of control in our operations. 
Turning to credit results on Page 8. Net charge-offs were $80 million or 34 basis points in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, in the third quarter, excluding these unit loan-backed commercial credit, net charge-offs were $86 million or 37 basis points. As expected, we returned to more normalized charge-off levels this quarter. Nonperforming assets, excluding loans held for sale, increased $41 million from the previous quarter to $647 million, bringing the NPL ratio to 55 basis points and the NPA ratio to 70 basis points. 
Within commercial, NPAs increased $49 million from the third quarter, primarily due to an $89 million increase in C&I, partially offset by a $38 million decline in commercial real estate NPAs. Consumer NPAs decreased $8 million from the third quarter to 62 basis points, primarily driven by a $5 million decline in Residential Mortgage and a $5 million decline in home equity NPAs. 
Our consumer loan portfolio has continued to show steady improvement throughout the year, reflective of the high credit quality standards that we are maintaining in our underwriting. The allowance for loan and lease losses increased $11 million. The resulting reserve coverage is at 1.37% of loans and leases, compared with 1.35% last quarter and 252% of NPLs. 
As we discussed last quarter, we are cognizant of where we are in the credit cycle. The global concerns associated with a diverse set of factors reaching from geopolitical to fundamental economic performance are well known. Although we are a predominantly domestic bank, it is difficult to take comfort purely around the health of the U.S. economy relative to the rest of the world. In this environment, and in light of the absolute low levels of our credit metrics, we need to point out that these levels made is subject to potential volatility from time to time. 
As an added element of credit discussion, given the global economic weakness and volatility, certain segments in commercial lending are appropriately getting more attention and we would like to review our portfolio work closely with you with respect to these industries on Slide 9. In isolation and in aggregate, our exposures in these 3 sectors are small, both relative to our total capital as well as relative to our total loans. 
Our energy portfolio outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.7 billion, relatively small at 2% of the portfolio. Of this amount, just under half are in senior secured reserved-based loans. Outstandings in the energy portfolio increased $107 million from the third quarter, with growth in the midstream sector. At current forward strip prices, we continue to remain appropriate secured, preserving our previous statements about our loss given the default exposures on the RBL secured portfolio. So far, we had no exposures to any of the companies that have filed for bankruptcy. The outstanding balances of roughly $300 million in oilfield services have a higher propensity for loss given default. 
In the fourth quarter, $22 million of the increase in NPLs came from the oilfield services sector within the energy portfolio. We are monitoring our energy portfolio very closely, including stress testing the portfolio for lower oil price scenarios. Should lower oil prices persist through 2017, we will see continued reserve bill and increased credit cost over that same period. 
We discussed our commodity trading exposure with you last quarter and during that conversation, we indicated our intent to effectively exit a large majority of our relationships. We are now reporting to you that our outstandings have declined to approximately $300 million, down by 34% since the second quarter. Furthermore, the credit distribution of the remaining outstandings is indicative of the quality of the portfolio, as we will continue to wind it down. To repeat what we said before, this is a short-term portfolio and we will execute the planned exits with no expected losses. Our proactive efforts here demonstrate our willingness to act decisively. 
In commercial real estate, while our growth in the last 2 years has been strong, it should be viewed in the context of a low starting point after being less active for a few years. The third portfolio is one of the smallest percentages of total loans among our peers. Our current expectations for credit performance are based upon disciplined client selection, underwriting with an established conservative policies, guidelines and concentration limits, that include product and geographic concentrations. Disciplined client selection relies on targeting proven experienced developers, investors and sponsors with strong balance sheets, diversified sources of cash flow, and access to capital with demonstrated through the cycle. Furthermore, our underwriting standards emphasize conservative cash flows, and we focus on upfront cash equity contributions relative to cost versus loan to values that can be inflated by historically low cap rates. 
For each market, we conduct our own dilution analysis and focus on markets with multiple demand drivers and lower volatility. Specific to multifamily, we are sensitive not only to market demands and household generation, but also affordability, as in some markets rents are rising faster than wages as the housing market returns. This has caused us to back off in certain markets. In short, we feel very comfortable with our commercial real estate exposure, albeit a small percentage of loans. 
Looking at capital on Slide 10. Capital levels continue to be strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 9.8% from 9.4%, a very strong quarterly move, especially given the impact of buybacks associated with Vantiv gains. In addition to the level of income, the reduction in the size of the warrant position, which reduced our risk-weighted assets contributed to the increase in the ratio. At the end of the fourth quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately $10 million. During the quarter, we announced the common stock repurchase of $215 million from Vantiv proceeds, which settled on the 14th of January, and reduced the fourth quarter share count by 9.25 million shares. 
As Greg mentioned, our payout ratio was very healthy at above 75% this year. In light of our discussions about the ongoing investments in our risk and compliance infrastructure, as well as other strategic investments, we have provided more details on the nature of some of these investments, as well as our financial expectations. These details are provided on Slide 11 and 12. 
We are going through a period of higher investments and added expenses related to the enhancements in our risk and compliance infrastructure. These expenses are mostly related to headcount in compliance in the other areas in risk management, including operational risk. But in additional to higher compensation expense, we are also investing in technology. 
As you can see on Slide 11, the incremental expenses that have a significant impact on our run rate in 2015 and will impact the run rate in 2016 as well. While we added 373 employees in risk and compliance, we reduced the total employee count in other areas by 464 in 2015, resulting in a net decrease of 91. As we have shared with you in the past, we expect the rate of increase in our compensation expense in risk and compliance to peak this year. As such, we don't expect to see a repeat of this picture in 2017. We also don't expect to see a similar increase in technology expenses associated with our risk and compliance infrastructure beyond 2016. 
On Slide 12, we wanted to give a perspective on the nature of some of these investments in our retail and consumer businesses and also provide you with our expectations on the level and timing of the financial returns. As you know, we have already taken significant steps by focusing on optimizing branch staffing through both job-family redesign and headcount reductions, while at the same time, reengineering our branch operating model and network. By reinvesting a portion of these savings in the business, we believe that we have a significant opportunity to accelerate our digital capabilities, to reap the benefits of increased customer satisfaction, revenue growth and continued operational efficiency. Specifically, the investment in our integrated customer experience and branch digitization infrastructure is a critical component of our consumer bank strategy. Our omni channel approach, one that truly integrates all of our customer's touch points across our physical, virtual and digital channels, reflects the changes in customer demographics, as well as the broader shift in customer behavior. These investments will enable our customers to connect with the banks seamlessly from activities that range from how they obtain advice, to open accounts, to complete simple transactions. In addition to improved revenue prospects of all products, we expect significant cost savings, specially when combined with our investments in branch digitization and back-office automation. 
Although we are in the middle of executing our branch optimization strategy, our investments here could potentially provide other opportunities, which will depend on our future success in execution and the timing and extent of our change in our customer's behavior. The financial returns associated with these investments are very attractive and not based on aggressive assumptions about the overall economic conditions. As such, we are not delaying the timing, even in the current low growth environment. The payback periods are short and are meaningfully contributive to income going forward. The financial returns are expected to be even higher as a result of improved customer service quality. We believe that our shareholders will be rewarded well with these investments. 
In combination, we will incur higher expenses in both risk and compliance and strategic investments in 2016, which will elevate the expense growth this year. As our outlook for the year will show you, we are funding a portion of these investments with savings in our operations. For example, we expect our total compensation expenses this year to increase by roughly the same amount as the increase in risk and compliance-related compensation, which means that we are expecting no additional increase in total compensation and other areas, excluding one some expenses, despite merit increases and other inflationary factors. The positive year-over-year impact on revenues associated with our strategic investments beyond 2016 and the beneficial impact of flattening expenses combine for a positive -- for a very positive impact of operating leverage in earnings. 
Turning to the outlook. Our basic economic outlook is based on recent consensus market expectation of 2% to 3% real U.S. GDP growth with low inflation. On average, we should expect our industry to achieve overall loan growth approximating GDP growth. 
In commercial lending, we expect our loan growth to exceed 3%, supported partially by our strategic investments. We expect to see a decline in consumer loan portfolio, including the impact of the loan sales associated with our exit from St. Louis and Pittsburgh markets in the first half of this year, which is approximately $270 million. 
Outside the asset sales, the largest impact will come from our auto loan portfolio where we expect no improvement in market conditions to increase the shareholder returns. With the LCR-related investments largely behind us, our portfolio investments will be opportunistic in this environment. We expect to increase the size of the portfolio, but the timing will be dependent on rates and other balance sheet dynamics. 
In our outlook, we have 2 rate increases in 2016, one in June and one in September. In that scenario, based upon our outlook for loan growth, we expect a roughly 2% to 3% increase in NII on a year-over-year basis. NIM should also expand 3 to 4 basis points in from the fourth quarter 2015 level as the benefit of future rate hikes, is partially offset by loan yield compression and potential funding actions. If there are no further rate increases in 2016, and including the impact of the dividend reduction on fed stockholdings, we would expect a slightly higher NII and a stable NIM compared with full year 2015 levels, given a more conservative outlook on loan growth, based on the economic environment that would lead to feds in action. 
While recognizing the challenges in the current environment, specially in the oil and gas sector, at this point, in our base case outlook, we still expect our credit performance to remain relatively stable. We expect our provision to exceed charge-offs in 2016. The currently expect our noninterest income to increase between 4% and 5%, excluding the impact of 2015 Vantiv-related gains. 
Moving to expenses. As we just discussed, 2016 is an important transition year in our company. It is a year in which we will start executing a number of strategic investments, which will lead to accelerated revenue growth, expense savings, as well as operational excellence company-wide with a reasonably short payback period. As we also just discussed, we expect to see the slope of our risk and compliance-related expenses to flatten this year. 
When combined with our run rate earnings growth, this picture bodes very well for our outlook beyond 2016, with an improved earnings trajectory. More importantly, we are going through the transition as we continue to grow our revenues and achieve solid return on our shareholders' capital in 2016. Except for the increases in compensation related to risk and compliance that I just covered, excluding any one-time items, we expect to keep our total compensation expenses flat this year, including ongoing inflationary adjustments, merit increases and performance-based compensation. We expect roughly a $60 million increase in our technology expenses, as we just discussed. This investments have either very attractive return profile and/or are related to improvements in our infrastructure. 
Our year-over-year total expense growth is expected to be approximately 4.5% to 5% over our reported expenses in 2015, including an estimate for the impact of the proposed change in the FDIC assessment fee and the estimated one-time impact of an early retirement offer that is currently available to eligible employees, which will reduce our run rate expenses going forward. 
The growth is exaggerated, partly due to an increase in the amortization of our low-income housing investments in 2016 and other onetime benefits that we experienced in 2015. Together, these 2 items make up approximately 2% of the increase in total expenses. In addition, as we just a shared with you, that we expect an increase of approximately $75 million in total expenses related to our risk and compliance infrastructure, which is another 2% of our total expense base in 2015. 
Our intent is to show that we are funding all other expense growth, including nonrisk-related strategic investments, with savings elsewhere, as these 2 items add up in dollar terms to a large portion of our entire year-over-year increase. For the first quarter, we expect net interest margin to be up 2 to 3 basis points, as the impact of the rate increase and day count is offset by the loan yield compression and the Fed dividend cut. 
Within NII, the reduction of the Fed dividend rate, loan yield compression and 1 less day in the quarter will slightly more than offset the benefit of the some rate increase and will result in a decline of about $5 million. Total fee income should be similar to last year's first quarter as most fee revenue lines, including deposit fees, card and processing revenue and corporate banking fees tend to be seasonally low -- seasonably low. And we will not have the benefit of the Vantiv TRA payment in the first quarter. We will see higher expenses in the quarter, primarily due to seasonally higher FICA and unemployment expense, much like we saw last year, continued investment in risk management and compliance and the impact from the early retirement offer. We currently expect net charge-offs to be approximately in line with the first quarter 2015 levels. 
We also would like to remind you that the revenue expectations that we shared with you today do not include potential but currently on forecasted items such as Vantiv warrant marks or gains or losses on share sales. Our goal is to solidify our earnings growth trajectory and improve shareholder returns and we have a plans to achieve that. With that, I will turn it over to Greg for closing comments"

First off, our nonperforming assets were up 5 basis points to 70 basis points, and that's still on a low point for us over the past 7 to 8 years, and it compares very favorably to our peers. We're down 12 basis points year-over-year, or $97 million overall. The increases that we saw were a couple of energy credits that are, quite frankly, making their way through the restructuring process, which is to be expected. And then it was really just spread over a number of smaller middle market credits on couple leverage grants, there were starting that jump out express sectors. 
We do look at high-yield spreads. There's clearly a correlation between high yield spreads and future loan losses on the commercial sector, we follow that, they are going up, both on the energy side and outside of the energy side, so we'll continue to monitor and watch that over time. Our performance overall, the core of our middle market booked, the mid-cap market and the large-cap book is still performing very, very well outside of energy, to answer your question, with no really discernible trends, either in geography or products, that are cause for concern at this time. So our is up, just like else. We're looking at a lot of leading indicators, we're managing credit very closely, but at this point, we still feel good overall about our portfolio for the year. 
As you recall, we have one outlier in the third quarter, which was largely student loans that was made back in 2007, that we restructured and rolled off. But if you exclude one large problem loan, our charges for the year for the entire company were very tightly ranged between 34 basis points and 41 basis points. So very predicable. And at this point, we have only $22 million in NPAs and the energy sector, that can change but at this point, it's 1.3% of the energy booked. So I hope that's responsive to your question."

In terms of the low income housing fees, I can tell you that our estimated year-over-year increase in that line item is about $30 million from '15 into '16. So that, we'll update you. And we will see if the activity level and the economics in that portfolio would continue in that direction. It's difficult to estimate that at this point. So as we are exiting 2016, as we look ahead, assuming the 2 rate increases that we built into our forecast on the revenue side, assuming that we hit the noninterest income growth that we shared with you, we would be exiting this year at a lower efficiency ratio compared to the first half of the year.

We have clearly experienced the lower growth rate in the past year or 2, and we're projecting that into 2016 as we are not seeing changes in economic conditions. But in return, we're spending, our retail and consumer loan teams are spending quite a bit of time in moving the direction in home equity loans and credit cards up. And we are confident that several of these strategic and tactical moves will improve growth rates in those 2 portfolios. Now we've always been cautious in terms of guarding the market for loan growth, as we do believe that in general, our sector, over a long period of time, should match GDP growth.

Just over the last few days, I've had event interaction with a number of our clients in the marketplace. So I think this is pretty contemporary feedback. We are seeing a growing sense of caution from our client base. And frankly, that is really across almost all of our businesses. Maybe an exception could be in the health care sector where they continue to have a level of confidence in some of the uncertainty, which taken out in the end of last year. And frankly, we're benefiting from that as we've invested in that, and we continue to see nice growth there. Our goal is going to be obviously to outperform the nominal GDP as we look at 2016 through executing our business model that I think is very well received. And that business model is really one sooner on having industry expertise with some of the best bankers in the marketplace, with very well thought to develop business lines. Now those business lines, like I mentioned in health care, in retail, and a number of other verticals have clearly outperformed. But we haven't stopped there. We're continuing to look for other opportunities to move market share. We've added our gaming and leisure. We're looking at telecom media, telecommunications group, our food, a number of other opportunities there, where we're able to attract some very high quality talent, both on the line and in credit, in order for us to I think outperform the market place. I'd also remind you that we have very attractive geographic markets throughout our footprint. If you look at the core commercial and of middle market businesses in North Carolina, in Chicago, in Florida and other markets on a common quarter basis, we're up over 6% over the past year.

The macro factors is you touched on, the pricing pressures in this low rate environment their production's coming in on the sheet, less than on the paid on pepsin and have them best of the Fed stock dividend reduction. I think those factors are impacting everybody. For Fifth Third specifically, as Lars touched on, you have C&I loan yield compression from this remixing customer focused on disciplined growth and a better credit profile of client and that compression should dissipate in the back half of '16 and then you have for us, also early access, continued as we're not enrolling new customers and in a statement touched on, with the outlook and the auto book production decline, we did about $5 billion this year, we expect that number to be about $3 billion in 2016. And then finally, the funding side, what we baked into our NII outlook is not a pretty dynamic year on the funding side and with about $2.5 billion in maturities, 3-year issuances there are currently around a 1% interest rate, our outlook assumes that we got out a little bit longer-term and better positioned the company from a funding profile for 2017 and beyond. So all of those items are baked in to that NII outlook. And with all that, we still expect NII to grow 3% in 2016."

For 2015, we reported full year net income available to common shareholders of $1.6 billion. Our full year earnings growth of 60% reflected significant returns from the sale of a portion of our Vantiv ownership and thoughtful management of our balance sheet, given the uncertain pace of interest rate increases. 2015 was an important year of accomplishments and results were highlighted by return on assets of 1.22% and return on common equity of 11.3%. Despite the $94 million impact of the deposit advance product, our net interest income was relatively flat. We invest in our businesses and the talent across the organization strengthens our balance sheet and further enhanced our risk and compliance infrastructure.
Full year net interest income declined only 1% as growth otherwise offset the lost revenue from the reduction in income related to the deposit advance product. Year-over-year core fee income growth was 3%. As we grow fee income, we will seek to add capital efficient and growth-oriented products and services in order to deepen client relationships. 
Our intention is to reduce our dependency on more volatile spread income or complementing an already rich menu of products that we offer our clients. Along those lines, you may have seen our recent announcement regarding the hiring of a long-tenured insurance executive, who have successfully grown and run and integrated bank-owned insurance program. We are excited about this business and we will explore other areas of opportunity for expansion of products and services we offer today. 
As we are maintaining our focus on revenue growth, we are keeping operating leverage on the top of our priority list. While expenses were up this year, we are confident in our ability to return to positive operating leverage once the increases in our risk and compliance areas begin to flatten, which we believe will happen later this year. As we said on many occasions, we will continue to invest in our businesses while we look to partially fund those investments through savings in our core operations and investments in our future capabilities. Tayfun will cover some additional details of our investments so you can get a better idea of the impact and trajectory we are looking at.  We are committed to achieving positive operating leverage, and we believe we have the right plans in place to make that happen. 
For 2015, average core deposits were up 6% for the year, while average loan balances were up 2%, resulting in a core deposit-to-loan ratio of 106%. Balance sheet strength is a core focus for me and my team, as our goal is to be a top performer across the business cycle with lower volatility of earnings. 
We continue to reposition the loan portfolio for consistent performance through the cycle as we focus on higher quality relationships. This is a path we were pursuing for the last several years, as you can see in the average PDs of our commercial book that we've discussed in our some of our presentations over the last year.
More recently, we have taken actions to reduce exposure to certain sectors in order to reduce the sources of some of our early earnings volatility. Tayfun will discuss some of our efforts in this commentary. 
Looking beyond some of the street items in 2015, underlying credit performance and metrics continued to improve as NPAs and delinquencies remains at levels that we have not seen since before the crisis. Our intention is to operate a business model with better credit performance predictability. With our focus on operating metrics, we also made significant progress on our strategic plans throughout the year. We announced plans to rationalize parts of our branch network, which will save $60 million annually. We closed or sold 41 branches last year and we have 2 transactions that are scheduled to close near the end of the first quarter that included additional 34 branches. In total, we're about 2/3 of the way through the project and we expect the remaining 32 branches to be closed by June 30.
Also during the year, we concluded 3 significant legal settlements and reduced the size of our Vantiv position. I know I've covered many of these items before, but I think it's important for us to highlight the pattern of active, disciplined decision making we've demonstrated as we continue to reposition the company for future success. Vantiv continues to be a source of significant returns for our shareholders, and the year was capped by a number of transactions related to our ownership. We have taken important steps towards reducing our direct ownership stake in Vantiv in the best interest of our stakeholders, while reducing a significant amount of volatility associated with our warrant position.
During the fourth quarter, we sold approximately 8 million shares, sold or settled 2/3 of the warrant and sold a portion of future TRA payments, which unlock nearly $0.5 billion of value. Vantiv continues to perform well, and we are happy to participate in our success.
To maximize returns to our shareholders, we executed in a well-planned manner on all 3 pieces of our financial interest namely; the TRA, warrants and direct ownership. We still hold a significant ownership stake in the company, which we believe will result in healthy returns for our shareholders. 
For the third consecutive year, we returned more than 75% of our earnings back to shareholders. We expect that would rank us near top of our peers. In 2015, we returned 42% of earnings via share buybacks, which reduced our share count by 39 million shares. Dividends represent 30% of earnings, and combined, we achieved a core payout ratio of 72%. In addition to our core payout ratio, the Vantiv proceeds were used to repurchase an additional 9.25 million shares of our common stock. In aggregate, we've returned 78% of our earnings back to shareholders. 
So now, a few comments about the fourth quarter. We reported net income to common shareholders of $634 million in earnings per diluted share of $0.79, including $0.38 of volumes that Tayfun will go over in more detail. The largest impact on the quarter was the monetization of a portion of our ownership in Vantiv that I just mentioned. 
Core fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations. We view the Fed December rate move as a positive first step towards a normalized environment, but there is uncertainty around the extent and timing of the future rate decisions. Our loan growth was impacted by larger-than-normal pay-downs and payoffs. However, we are starting the year with a strong origination activity, and our outlook for 2016 remains in line with a nominal GDP outlook. 
Fourth quarter reflects the efforts to position ourselves for growth. We are refocusing our resources on businesses with higher growth return potential that will enable us to achieve our objective of outperformance through the cycle.  In addition to that, we are making investments in infrastructure, designed to improve our service delivery and efficiency. 
Our fee businesses produced stable results, despite lower levels of capital markets activity. We are pleased with the low level charge-offs of 34 basis points. We are closely managing our expenses with a sharp focus on extracting efficiencies from our day-to-day operations. 
Our noninterest expense in the fourth quarter was up 2%, driven by risk management technology investments and a substantial contribution to our charitable foundation. Credit results reflect the ongoing benign environment. We are cognizant of global volatilities that are creating anxiety in the markets, but we believe that our exposures are conservatively underwritten and we have limited aggregate exposures in the more volatile sectors. 
We view 2016 as an important transition year, as it position our company to achieve operating leverage in a sustainable manner, regardless of the rate environment. 
In 2015, we have taken important steps in that direction, and we'll continue our efforts in 2016. We are working on long-term revenue growth as well as expense efficiencies to achieve our goal. We have taken actions to reduce run rate expenses in order to partially fund strategic investments, and we expect expenses related to our risk and compliance infrastructure to peak in 2016. We will continue to reallocate resources to improve profitability with reduced volatility. We are committed to achieving the industry leading level of operational results that you have historically seen from us.
Our 18,000 employees are our most important asset, and I'm extremely proud of what they accomplished in 2015. They did a great job in taking care of our customers and driving shareholder value. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication in 2015, and I look forward to their contributions to our success in 2016. Thank you. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our fourth quarter operating results and our outlook for remainder of the year."
270961,318753206,919943,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 3 of the presentation. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $634 million or $0.79 per diluted share. There were a",3756,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 3 of the presentation. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $634 million or $0.79 per diluted share. There were a number of items that affected earnings in the quarter, as Greg mentioned. These items can be found on Page 2 of our release, and the net impact was a benefit of $0.38 per share. We've been patient and deliberate in our actions related to our Vantiv ownership, and we have delivered significant value to our shareholders. The benefits of the transactions are sufficiently self evident.
With that, let's move to the average balance sheet on Page 4 of the presentation. Average portfolio balances were $221 million higher than the third quarter, and the period-end balances were down about $1 billion as payoffs and pay-downs, especially in December, impacted our net growth. The payoffs were higher than expected, especially in commercial real estate, which reached almost $1 billion this quarter as construction projects refinanced into permanent financing.
During the quarter, we maintained our strategy of keeping a shorter duration in our commercial real estate portfolio. Some of these payoffs were slated for the first quarter, and as such, it was a timing issue as they exited the portfolio earlier than expected. In addition, we have actively reduced exposures in certain segments of the portfolio, such as commodity trading, in line with our goal to reduce volatility, especially in the current environment.
I would like to point out that although the market sensitivity to the economic environment increased over the last few weeks, we discussed our rather cautious perspective on the economic environment with you in October and indicated that our actions reflected our views on the overall economic conditions and the age of the current credit cycle. 
As some of the production also shifted from the fourth quarter into the first, we are starting the year with a healthy amount of activity. New production coupons have remained stable, but the credit spread widening seen in the high-yield market has not yet reached bank loan credit spreads. Consumer loans were flat with last quarter and continued to display similar trends to recent quarters. Average investment securities increased by $700 million in the fourth quarter or 2% sequentially. Average core deposits increased $1 billion from the third quarter, driven by higher demand deposit and money market account balances. Our LCR ratio was 115% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving to NII on Page 5 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $2 million sequentially to $904 million, primarily driven by the full quarter impact of the $2.4 billion of wholesale debt issuances in the third quarter and our auto loan securitization completed in November. The net interest margin was 285 basis points, down 4 basis points from the third quarter, driven by the impact of those debt issuances, slower prepayments reducing net discount accretion on the investment portfolio and an increased short-term cash position during the quarter.  Our margin for the second half of the year was 2.87%. The results related to NII and NIM were very much in line with our expectations and guidance. 
Shifting to fees on Page 6 of the presentation. Fourth quarter noninterest income was $1.1 billion compared with $713 million in the third quarter. Results included a net $490 million of pre-tax Vantiv items we've already discussed. We show fee income, adjusted for primarily Vantiv-related items on Slide 6 of $623 million, an increase of $32 million or 5% sequentially. This growth included the annual payment under our tax receivable agreement with Vantiv, which was $31 million this quarter. 
Corporate banking fees of $104 million were flat sequentially. The volatility towards the end of the year clearly impacted our client activity in capital markets. It is no surprise that the gap was more pronounced in loan syndications as the slowdown in those markets have been widely publicized. 
Mortgage banking net revenue of $74 million was up $3 million sequentially. Originations were at  $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, with 49% purchase volume. 80% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels and 20% from the corresponding channels. Gain on sale margins were up 6 basis points sequentially.
Net servicing asset valuation adjustments, which include amortization and valuation adjustments, were negative $16 million this quarter versus negative $29 million last quarter. Deposit service charges decreased 1% from the third quarter and increased 1% relative to the fourth quarter of 2014. Deposit service charges this quarter were impacted by a 3% reduction in consumer service charges, primarily due to a roll out in the fourth quarter of a more simplified checking product line up.  Total investment advisory revenue of $102 million decreased 1% sequentially, primarily due to lower retail brokerage revenues, partially offset by personal asset management and specialty services revenue growth.
We show noninterest expense on Page 7 of the presentation. Expenses were $963 million compared with $943 million in the third quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to a $10 million contribution to Fifth Third Foundation, technology expenses and higher net occupancy expense, which was partially impacted by the real estate decisions in one of the consumer markets that we are exiting this year. 
Our total employee expenses were up approximately $65 million in 2015. That number included the impact of inflationary adjustments, severance as well as the change in the composition of our total employee base. Although our year-over-year headcount is down, the reduction is mainly in our retail branch network and the adds are in risk and compliance. By nature of those job functions, the average compensation related to our new employees is higher than those that left the bank.  During the year, we added 373 people in our risk and compliance functions for an incremental compensation cost of approximately $21 million, and that number will continue to grow in 2016. I will share those details with you shortly. 
As expected, our technology expenses increased this quarter, although somewhat less than we anticipated. Project calendar typically impact our technology expenditures, but in general, the direction is in line with our expectations and guidance. Card and processing expenses were also up, primarily on costs associated with our EMV project.  We are spending a lot of time on controllable expenses with all of our business lines and will continue to enforce a tight level of control on our operations.
Turning to credit results on Page 8. Net charge-offs were $80 million or 34 basis points in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, in the third quarter, excluding the student loan-backed commercial credit, net charge-offs were $86 million or 37 basis points. As expected, we returned to more normalized charge-off levels this quarter. Nonperforming assets, excluding loans held for sale, increased $41 million from the previous quarter to $647 million, bringing the NPL ratio to 55 basis points and the NPA ratio to 70 basis points. 
Within commercial, NPAs increased $49 million from the third quarter, primarily due to an $89 million increase in C&I, partially offset by a $38 million decline in commercial real estate NPAs. Consumer NPAs decreased $8 million from the third quarter to 62 basis points, primarily driven by a $5 million decline in Residential Mortgage and a $5 million decline in Home Equity NPAs. 
Our consumer loan portfolio has continued to show steady improvement throughout the year, reflective of the high credit quality standards that we are maintaining in our underwriting. The allowance for loan and lease losses increased $11 million. The resulting reserve coverage is at 1.37% of loans and leases, compared with 1.35% last quarter and 252% of NPLs.
As we discussed last quarter, we are cognizant of where we are in the credit cycle. The global concerns associated with a diverse set of factors reaching from geopolitical to fundamental economic performance are well known. Although we are a predominantly domestic bank, it is difficult to take comfort purely around the health of the U.S. economy relative to the rest of the world. In this environment, and in light of the absolute low levels of our credit metrics, we need to point out that these levels maybe subject to potential volatility from time to time. 
As an added element of credit discussion, given the global economic weakness and volatility, certain segments in commercial lending are appropriately getting more attention and we would like to review our portfolio more closely with you with respect to these industries on Slide 9. In isolation and in aggregate, our exposures in these 3 sectors are small, both relative to our total capital as well as relative to our total loans.
Our energy portfolio outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.7 billion, relatively small at 2% of the portfolio. Of this amount, just under half are in senior secured reserved-based loans. Outstandings in the energy portfolio increased $107 million from the third quarter, with growth in the midstream sector. At current forward strip oil prices, we continue to remain appropriately secured preserving our previous statements about our loss given default exposures on the RBL secured portfolio. So far, we had no exposures to any of the E&P companies that have filed for bankruptcy. The outstanding balances of roughly $300 million in oilfield services have a higher propensity for loss given default. 
In the fourth quarter, $22 million of the increase in NPLs came from the oilfield services sector within the energy portfolio. We are monitoring our energy portfolio very closely, including stress testing the portfolio for lower oil price scenarios. Should low oil prices persist through 2017, we will see continued reserve bill and increased credit costs over that same period.
We discussed our commodity trading exposure with you last quarter and during that conversation, we indicated our intent to effectively exit a large majority of our relationships. We are now reporting to you that our outstandings have declined to approximately $300 million, down by 34% since the second quarter. Furthermore, the credit distribution of the remaining outstandings is indicative of the quality of the portfolio, as we will continue to wind it down. To repeat what we said before, this is a short-term portfolio and we will execute the planned exits with no expected losses. Our proactive efforts here demonstrate our willingness to act decisively. 
In commercial real estate, while our growth in the last 2 years has been strong, it should be viewed in the context of a low starting point after being less active for a few years. The third portfolio is one of the smallest percentages of total loans among our peers. Our current expectations for credit performance are based upon disciplined client selection, underwriting with an established conservative policies, guidelines and concentration limits, that include product and geographic concentrations. Disciplined client selection relies on targeting proven experienced developers, investors and sponsors with strong balance sheets, diversified sources of cash flow, and access to capital with demonstrated resilience through the cycle. Furthermore, our underwriting standards emphasize conservative cash flows, and we focus on upfront cash equity contributions relative to cost versus loan to values that can be inflated by historically low cap rates.
For each market, we conduct our own dilution analysis and focus on markets with multiple demand drivers and lower volatility. Specific to multifamily, we are sensitive not only to market demand and household generation, but also affordability, as in some markets rents are rising faster than wages as the housing market returns. This has caused us to back off in certain markets. In short, we feel very comfortable with our commercial real estate exposure, albeit a small percentage of loans. 
Looking at capital on Slide 10. Capital levels continued to be strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 9.8% from 9.4%, a very strong quarterly move, especially given the impact of buybacks associated with Vantiv gains. In addition to the level of income, the reduction in the size of the warrant position, which reduced our risk-weighted assets contributed to the increase in the ratio. At the end of the fourth quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately $10 million. During the quarter, we announced a common stock repurchase of $215 million from Vantiv proceeds, which settled on the 14th of January, and reduced the fourth quarter share count by 9.25 million shares.
As Greg mentioned, our payout ratio was very healthy at above 75% this year. In light of our discussions about the ongoing investments in our risk and compliance infrastructure as well as other strategic investments, we have provided more details on the nature of some of these investments as well as our financial expectations. These details are provided on Slides 11 and 12. 
We are going through a period of higher investments and added expenses related to the enhancements in our risk and compliance infrastructure. These expenses are mostly related to headcount in compliance and other areas in risk management, including operational risk. But in addition to higher compensation expense, we are also investing in technology.
As you can see on Slide 11, the incremental expenses has had a significant impact on our run rate in 2015 and will impact the run rate in 2016 as well. While we added 373 employees in risk and compliance, we reduced the total employee count in other areas by 464 in 2015, resulting in a net decrease of 91. As we have shared with you in the past, we expect the rate of increase in our compensation expense in risk and compliance to peak this year. As such, we don't expect to see a repeat of this picture in 2017. We also don't expect to see a similar increase in technology expenses associated with our risk and compliance infrastructure beyond 2016.
On Slide 12, we wanted to give you a perspective on the nature of some of these investments in our retail and consumer businesses and also provide you with our expectations on the level and timing of the financial returns. As you know, we have already taken significant steps by focusing on optimizing branch staffing through both job-family redesign and headcount reductions, while at the same time, reengineering our branch operating model and network. By reinvesting a portion of these savings in the business, we believe that we have a significant opportunity to accelerate our digital capabilities to reap the benefits of increased customer satisfaction, revenue growth and continued operational efficiency. Specifically, the investment in our integrated customer experience and branch digitization infrastructure is a critical component of our consumer bank strategy. Our omni channel approach, one that truly integrates all of our customers' touch points across our physical, virtual and digital channels, reflects the changes in customer demographics as well as the broader shift in customer behavior. These investments will enable our customers to connect with the bank seamlessly from activities that range from how they obtain advice, to open accounts, to complete simple transactions. In addition to improved revenue prospects of all products, we expect significant cost savings, especially when combined with our investments in branch digitization and back-office automation. 
Although we are in the middle of executing our branch optimization strategy, our investments here could potentially provide other opportunities, which will depend on our future success in execution and the timing and extent of our change in our customers' behavior. The financial returns associated with these investments are very attractive and not based on aggressive assumptions about the overall economic conditions. As such, we are not delaying the timing, even in the current low growth environment. The payback periods are short and are meaningfully contributive to income going forward. The financial returns are expected to be even higher as a result of improved customer service quality. We believe that our shareholders will be rewarded well with these investments. 
In combination, we will incur higher expenses in both risk and compliance and strategic investments in 2016, which will elevate the expense growth this year. As our outlook for the year will show you, we are funding a portion of these investments with savings in our operations. For example, we expect our total compensation expenses this year to increase by roughly the same amount as the increase in risk and compliance-related compensation, which means that we are expecting no additional increase in total compensation in her areas, excluding onetime expenses, despite merit increases and other inflationary factors. The positive year-over-year impact on revenues associated with our strategic investments beyond 2016 and the beneficial impact of flattening expenses combine for a positive -- for a very positive impact on operating leverage and earnings.
Turning to the outlook. Our basic economic outlook is based on recent consensus market expectations of 2% to 3% real U.S. GDP growth with low inflation. On average, we should expect our industry to achieve overall loan growth approximating GDP growth.
In commercial lending, we expect our loan growth to exceed 3%, supported partially by our strategic investments. We expect to see a decline in consumer loan portfolio, including the impact of the loan sales associated with our exit from St. Louis and Pittsburgh markets in the first half of this year, which is approximately $270 million. 
Outside the asset sales, the largest impact will come from our auto loan portfolio, where we expect no improvement in market conditions to increase the shareholder returns. With the LCR-related investments largely behind us, our portfolio investments will be opportunistic in this environment. We expect to increase the size of the portfolio, but the timing will be dependent on rates and other balance sheet dynamics. 
In our outlook, we have 2 rate increases in 2016, one in June and one in September. In that scenario, based upon our outlook for loan growth, we expect a roughly 2% to 3% increase in NII on a year-over-year basis. NIM should also expand 3 to 4 basis points in from the fourth quarter 2015 level as the benefit of future rate hikes is partially offset by loan yield compression and potential funding actions. If there are no further rate increases in 2016, and including the impact of the dividend reduction on Fed stockholdings, we would expect a slightly higher NII and a stable NIM compared with full year 2015 levels, given a more conservative outlook on loan growth, based on the economic environment that would lead to Feds in action. 
While recognizing the challenges in the current environment, especially in the oil and gas sector, at this point, in our base case outlook, we still expect our credit performance to remain relatively stable. We expect our provision to exceed charge-offs in 2016. We currently expect our noninterest income to increase between 4% and 5%, excluding the impact of 2015 Vantiv-related gains. 
Moving to expenses. As we just discussed, 2016 is an important transition year in our company. It is a year in which we will start executing a number of strategic investments, which will lead to accelerated revenue growth, expense savings as well as operational excellence company-wide with a reasonably short payback period. As we also just discussed, we expect to see the slope of our risk and compliance-related expenses to flatten this year. 
When combined with our run rate earnings growth, this picture bodes very well for our outlook beyond 2016, with an improved earnings trajectory. More importantly, we are going through this transition as we continue to grow our revenues and achieve solid return on our shareholders' capital in 2016. Except for the increases in compensation related to risk and compliance that I just covered, excluding any onetime items, we expect to keep our total compensation expenses flat this year, including ongoing inflationary adjustments, merit increases and performance-based compensation. We expect roughly a $60 million increase in our technology expenses as we just discussed. These investments have either very attractive return profile and/or are related to improvements in our infrastructure. 
Our year-over-year total expense growth is expected to be approximately 4.5% to 5% over our reported expenses in 2015, including an estimate for the impact of the proposed change in the FDIC assessment fee and the estimated onetime impact of an early retirement offer that is currently available to eligible employees, which will reduce our run rate expenses going forward.
The growth is exaggerated partly due to an increase in the amortization of our low-income housing investments in 2016 and other onetime benefits that we experienced in 2015. Together, these 2 items make up approximately 2% of the increase in total expenses. In addition, as we just shared with you, that we expect an increase of approximately $75 million in total expenses related to our risk and compliance infrastructure, which is another 2% of our total expense base in 2015.
Our intent is to show that we are funding all other expense growth, including nonrisk-related strategic investments, with savings elsewhere, as these 2 items add up in dollar terms to a large portion of our entire year-over-year increase. For the first quarter, we expect net interest margin to be up 2 to 3 basis points, as the impact of the rate increase and day count is offset by the loan yield compression and the Fed dividend cut. 
Within NII, the reduction of the Fed dividend rate, loan yield compression and 1 less day in the quarter will slightly more than offset the benefit of the December rate increase and will result in a decline of about $5 million. Total fee income should be similar to last year's first quarter as most fee revenue lines, including deposit fees, card and processing revenue and corporate banking fees tend to be seasonally low -- seasonably low. And we will not have the benefit of the Vantiv TRA payment in the first quarter. We will see higher expenses in the quarter, primarily due to seasonally higher FICA and unemployment expense, much like we saw last year, continued investments in risk management and compliance and the impact from the early retirement offer. We currently expect net charge-offs to be approximately in line with the first quarter 2015 levels. 
We also would like to remind you that the revenue expectations that we shared with you today do not include potential, but currently unforecasted items such as Vantiv warrant marks or gains or losses on share sales. Our goal is to solidify our earnings growth trajectory and improve shareholder returns and we have a plan to achieve that. With that, I will turn it over to Greg for closing comments."

We're down 12 basis points year-over-year or $97 million overall. The increases that we saw were a couple of energy credits that are quite frankly just making their way through the restructuring process, which is to be expected. And then it was really just spread over a number of smaller middle market credits on a couple of leverage grants, so that there was nothing there that jumped out as far as sectors.  We do look at high-yield spreads. There's clearly a correlation between high-yield spreads and future loan losses on the commercial sector, and we follow that, and they are going up, both on the energy side and outside of the energy side, so we'll continue to monitor and watch that over time. But our performance overall, the core of our middle market booked, the mid-cap booked and the large-cap booked is still performing very, very well outside of energy, to answer your question, with no really discernible trends, either in geography or products, that are cause for concern at this time. So our intent is up, like everybody else. We're looking at a lot of leading indicators, we're managing credit very closely, but at this point, we still feel good overall about our portfolio for the year.  As you recall, we had one outlier in the third quarter, which was a large student loan that was made back in 2007 that we restructured and wrote off. But if you exclude that one large problem loan, our charge-offs for the year for the entire company were very tightly ranged between 34 basis points and 41 basis points. So very predicable. And at this point, we have only $22 million in NPAs and the energy sector, that could change, but at this point, it's 1.3% of the energy booked. So I hope that's responsive to your question."

Our goal is going to be obviously to outperform the nominal GDP as we look at 2016 through executing our business model that I think is very well received. And that business model is really one centered on having industry expertise with some of the best bankers in the marketplace, with very well-thought through developed business lines.

That's been based on fairly stable sources of income. But the larger growth is expected to come from capital markets, and I'll turn it over to Lars for comments on that."

So that's frankly, I think, one of the most exciting opportunities that we've got on a go-forward basis. Now clearly, as you know, capital markets is largely influenced by the overall activity in the overall macroeconomic environment and how that leeches into the U.S. markets. Something to keep in mind today, our capital markets business is certainly heavily centered around the debt capital markets, risk management. And what I'm talking about that is interest rate risk management, commodities and FX. And with the uncertainties in the market, that obviously impacted the fourth quarter. But in a more normalized environment, we've got some really talented bankers with some deep relationships. We're very well positioned. And I would tell you, in our capital markets pipeline, we actually are set up with clients for some nice activity once there's more certainty with our clients as we move into 2016. In addition to that, we're trying to diversify our capital markets platform, build out our M&A advisory platform. And I think that we have some very nice opportunities throughout '16 and '17 on a go-forward basis. And lastly, again, going back to the blocking and tackling, I think we've done a really nice job of building out a really high-quality Wealth Management family practice kind of business as a company. But where we have an opportunity is to further integrate that across our platform, to open up our commercial and corporate bank and really deepen these relationships. And I see some revenue opportunity as well as strengthening long-term relationships, consistent with our long-term strategy. And that's not just in our Wealth Management IA business. That includes our treasury management products where we have a number of specific actions and initiatives that we have underway for 2016 to drive those results."

I would tell you, as Tayfun laid out in his prepared remarks, we certainly have assets into the balance sheet that is benefited by the rate hike in December as well as the future moves we're forecasting. There are a couple of macro factors as well as several idiosyncratic factors that create headwinds for us in that environment. The macro factors, as you touched on, the pricing pressures in this low rate environment, new productions coming on the sheet, less than yields on the paydown and payoffs and then you have the impact of the Fed stock dividend reduction. And I think those factors are impacting everybody. For Fifth Third specifically, as Lars touched on, you have C&I loan yield compression from this remixing as we are focused on disciplined growth and a better credit profile of client. And that compression should dissipate in the back half of '16. And then you have, for us, also early access, continued attrition as we're not enrolling new customers. And then as Tayfun touched on, our outlook on the auto book production declined. We did about $5 billion this year. We expect that number to be around $3 billion in 2016. And then finally, on the funding side, what we baked into our NII outlook is to have a pretty dynamic year on the funding side. And with about $2.5 billion in maturities, 3-year issuances that are currently around a 1% interest rate, our outlook assumes that we go out a little bit longer term and better position the company from a funding profile for 2017 and beyond. So all of those items are baked in to that NII outlook. And with all that said, we still expect NII to grow 2% to 3% in 2016."

For 2015, we reported full year net income available to common shareholders of $1.6 billion. Our full year earnings growth of 60% [ph] reflected significant returns from the sale of a portion of our Vantiv ownership and thoughtful management of our balance sheet, given the uncertain pace of interest rate increases. 2015 was an important year of accomplishments and results were highlighted by a return on assets of 1.22% and a return on common equity of 11.3%. Despite the $94 million impact of the deposit advance product, our net interest income was relatively flat. We invest in our businesses, added talent across the organization, strengthened our balance sheet and further enhanced our risk and compliance infrastructure.
Full year net interest income declined only 1% as growth otherwise offset the lost revenue from the reduction in income related to the deposit advance product. Year-over-year core fee income growth was 3%. As we grow fee income, we will seek to add capital efficient and growth-oriented products and services in order to deepen client relationships. 
Our intention is to reduce our dependency on more volatile spread income while complementing an already rich menu of products that we offer our clients. Along those lines, you may have seen our recent announcement regarding the hiring of a long-tenured insurance executive, who has successfully grown and run an integrated bank-owned insurance program. We are excited about this business and we will explore other areas of opportunity for expansion of products and services we offer today. 
As we are maintaining our focus on revenue growth, we are keeping operating leverage on the top of our priority list. While expenses were up this year, we are confident in our ability to return to positive operating leverage once the increases in our risk and compliance areas begin to flatten, which we believe will happen later this year. As we've said on many occasions, we will continue to invest in our businesses while we look to partially fund those investments through savings in our core operations and investments in our future capabilities. Tayfun will cover some additional details of our investments so you can get a better idea of the impact and trajectory we are looking at.  We are committed to achieving positive operating leverage, and we believe we have the right plans in place to make that happen. 
For 2015, average core deposits were up 6% for the year, while average loan balances were up 2%, resulting in a core deposit-to-loan ratio of 106%. Balance sheet strength is a core focus for me and my team as our goal is to be a top performer across the business cycle with lower volatility of earnings. 
We continue to reposition the loan portfolio for consistent performance through the cycle as we focus on higher quality relationships. This is a path we've been pursuing for the last several years as you can see in the average PDs of our commercial book that we've discussed in our some of our presentations over the last year.
More recently, we have taken actions to reduce exposure to certain sectors in order to reduce the sources of some of our early earnings volatility. Tayfun will discuss some of our efforts in his commentary. 
Looking beyond some of the discrete items in 2015; underlying credit performance and metrics continued to improve as NPAs and delinquencies remains at levels that we have not seen since before the crisis. Our intention is to operate a business model with better credit performance predictability. With our focus on operating metrics, we also made significant progress on our strategic plans throughout the year. We announced plans to rationalize parts of our branch network, which will save $60 million annually. We closed or sold 41 branches last year and we have 2 transactions that are scheduled to close near the end of the first quarter that include an additional 34 branches. In total, we're about 2/3 of the way through the project and we expect the remaining 32 branches to be closed by June 30.
Also during the year, we concluded 3 significant legal settlements and reduced the size of our Vantiv position. I know I've covered many of these items before, but I think it's important for us to highlight the pattern of active, disciplined decision making we've demonstrated as we continue to reposition the company for future success. Vantiv continues to be a source of significant returns for our shareholders, and the year was capped by a number of transactions related to our ownership. We have taken important steps towards reducing our direct ownership stake in Vantiv in the best interest of our stakeholders, while reducing a significant amount of volatility associated with our warrant position.
During the fourth quarter, we sold approximately 8 million shares, sold or settled 2/3 of the warrant and sold a portion of future TRA payments, which unlock nearly $0.5 billion of value. Vantiv continues to perform well and we are happy to participate in our success.
To maximize returns to our shareholders, we executed in a well-planned manner on all 3 pieces of our financial interest namely; the TRA, warrants and direct ownership. We still hold a significant ownership stake in the company, which we believe will result in healthy returns for our shareholders. 
For a third consecutive year, we returned more than 75% of our earnings back to shareholders. We expect that would rank us near the top of our peers. In 2015, we returned 42% of earnings via share buybacks, which reduced our share count by 39 million shares. Dividends represent 30% of earnings, and combined, we achieved a core payout ratio of 72%. In addition to our core payout ratio, the Vantiv proceeds were used to repurchase an additional 9.25 million shares of our common stock. In aggregate, we returned 78% of our earnings back to shareholders. 
So now, a few comments about the fourth quarter. We reported net income to common shareholders of $634 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.79, including $0.38 of volumes that Tayfun will go over in more detail. The largest impact on the quarter was the monetization of a portion of our ownership in Vantiv that I just mentioned. 
Core fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations. We view the Fed December rate move as a positive first step towards a normalized environment, but there is uncertainty around the extent and timing of the future rate decisions. Our loan growth was impacted by larger-than-normal pay-downs and payoffs. However, we are starting the year with a strong origination activity, and our outlook for 2016 remains in line with a nominal GDP outlook. 
The fourth quarter reflects the efforts to position ourselves for growth. We are refocusing our resources on businesses with higher growth return potential that will enable us to achieve our objective of outperformance through the cycle. In addition to that, we are making investments in infrastructure, designed to improve our service delivery and efficiency. 
Our fee businesses produced stable results, despite lower levels of capital markets activity. We are pleased with the low level charge-offs of 34 basis points. We are closely managing our expenses with a sharp focus on extracting efficiencies from our day-to-day operations. 
Our noninterest expense in the fourth quarter was up 2%, driven by risk management technology investments and a substantial contribution to our charitable foundation. Credit results reflect the ongoing benign environment. We are cognizant of the global volatilities that are creating anxiety in the markets, but we believe that our exposures are conservatively underwritten and we have limited aggregate exposures in the more volatile sectors. 
We view 2016 as an important transition year, as we position our company to achieve operating leverage in a sustainable manner, regardless of the rate environment. 
In 2015, we have taken important steps in that direction, and we will continue our efforts in 2016. We are working on long-term revenue growth as well as expense efficiencies to achieve our goal. We have taken actions to reduce run rate expenses in order to partially fund strategic investments, and we expect expenses related to our risk and compliance infrastructure to peak in 2016. We will continue to reallocate resources to improve profitability with reduced volatility. We are committed to achieving the industry leading level of operational results that you have historically seen from us.
Our 18,000 employees are our most important asset, and I'm extremely proud of what they accomplished in 2015. They did a great job at taking care of our customers and driving shareholder value. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication in 2015, and I look forward to their contributions to our success in 2016. Thank you. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our fourth quarter operating results and our outlook for remainder of the year."
270961,318753206,920088,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 3 of the presentation. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $634 million or $0.79 per diluted share. There were a",3753,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 3 of the presentation. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $634 million or $0.79 per diluted share. There were a number of items that affected earnings in the quarter, as Greg mentioned. These items can be found on Page 2 of our release, and the net impact was a benefit of $0.38 per share. We've been patient and deliberate in our actions related to our Vantiv ownership, and we have delivered significant value to our shareholders. The benefits of the transactions are sufficiently self evident.
With that, let's move to the average balance sheet on Page 4 of the presentation. Average portfolio balances were $221 million higher than the third quarter, and the period-end balances were down about $1 billion as payoffs and pay-downs, especially in December, impacted our net growth. The payoffs were higher than expected, especially in commercial real estate, which reached almost $1 billion this quarter as construction projects refinanced into permanent financing.
During the quarter, we maintained our strategy of keeping a shorter duration in our commercial real estate portfolio. Some of these payoffs were slated for the first quarter, and as such, it was a timing issue as they exited the portfolio earlier than expected. In addition, we have actively reduced exposures in certain segments of the portfolio, such as commodity trading, in line with our goal to reduce volatility, especially in the current environment.
I would like to point out that although the market sensitivity to the economic environment increased over the last few weeks, we discussed our rather cautious perspective on the economic environment with you in October and indicated that our actions reflected our views on the overall economic conditions and the age of the current credit cycle. 
As some of the production also shifted from the fourth quarter into the first, we are starting the year with a healthy amount of activity. New production coupons have remained stable, but the credit spread widening seen in the high-yield market has not yet reached bank loan credit spreads. Consumer loans were flat with last quarter and continued to display similar trends to recent quarters. Average investment securities increased by $700 million in the fourth quarter or 2% sequentially. Average core deposits increased $1 billion from the third quarter, driven by higher demand deposit and money market account balances. Our LCR ratio was 115% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving to NII on Page 5 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $2 million sequentially to $904 million, primarily driven by the full quarter impact of the $2.4 billion of wholesale debt issuances in the third quarter and our auto loan securitization completed in November. The net interest margin was 285 basis points, down 4 basis points from the third quarter, driven by the impact of those debt issuances, slower prepayments reducing net discount accretion on the investment portfolio and an increased short-term cash position during the quarter.  Our margin for the second half of the year was 2.87%. The results related to NII and NIM were very much in line with our expectations and guidance. 
Shifting to fees on Page 6 of the presentation. Fourth quarter noninterest income was $1.1 billion compared with $713 million in the third quarter. Results included a net $490 million of pre-tax Vantiv items we've already discussed. We show fee income, adjusted for primarily Vantiv-related items on Slide 6 of $623 million, an increase of $32 million or 5% sequentially. This growth included the annual payment under our tax receivable agreement with Vantiv, which was $31 million this quarter. 
Corporate banking fees of $104 million were flat sequentially. The volatility towards the end of the year clearly impacted our client activity in capital markets. It is no surprise that the gap was more pronounced in loan syndications as the slowdown in those markets has been widely publicized. 
Mortgage banking net revenue of $74 million was up $3 million sequentially. Originations were $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, with 49% purchase volume. 80% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels and 20% from the correspondent channels. Gain on sale margins were up 6 basis points sequentially.
Net servicing asset valuation adjustments, which include amortization and valuation adjustments, were a negative $16 million this quarter versus negative $29 million last quarter. Deposit service charges decreased 1% from the third quarter and increased 1% relative to the fourth quarter of 2014. Deposit service charges this quarter were impacted by a 3% reduction in consumer service charges, primarily due to a roll out in the fourth quarter of a more simplified checking product line up. Total investment advisory revenue of $102 million decreased 1% sequentially, primarily due to lower retail brokerage revenues, partially offset by personal asset management and specialty services revenue growth.
We show noninterest expense on Page 7 of the presentation. Expenses were $963 million compared with $943 million in the third quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to a $10 million contribution to Fifth Third Foundation, technology expenses and higher net occupancy expense, which was partially impacted by the real estate decisions in one of the consumer markets that we are exiting this year. 
Our total employee expenses were up approximately $65 million in 2015. That number included the impact of inflationary adjustments, severance as well as the change in the composition of our total employee base. Although our year-over-year headcount is down, the reduction is mainly in our retail branch network and the adds are in risk and compliance. By nature of those job functions, the average compensation related to our new employees is higher than those that left the bank.  During the year, we added 373 people in our risk and compliance functions for an incremental compensation cost of approximately $21 million, and that number will continue to grow in 2016. I will share those details with you shortly. 
As expected, our technology expenses increased this quarter, although somewhat less than we anticipated. Project calendars typically impact our technology expenditures, but in general, the direction is in line with our expectations and guidance. Card and processing expenses were also up, primarily on costs associated with our EMV project.  We are spending a lot of time on controllable expenses with all of our business lines and will continue to enforce a tight level of control on our operations.
Turning to credit results on Page 8. Net charge-offs were $80 million or 34 basis points in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, in the third quarter, excluding the student loan-backed commercial credit, net charge-offs were $86 million or 37 basis points. As expected, we returned to more normalized charge-off levels this quarter. Nonperforming assets, excluding loans held for sale, increased $41 million from the previous quarter to $647 million, bringing the NPL ratio to 55 basis points and the NPA ratio to 70 basis points. 
Within commercial, NPAs increased $49 million from the third quarter, primarily due to an $89 million increase in C&I, partially offset by a $38 million decline in commercial real estate NPAs. Consumer NPAs decreased $8 million from the third quarter to 62 basis points, primarily driven by a $5 million decline in Residential Mortgage and a $5 million decline in Home Equity NPAs. 
Our consumer loan portfolio has continued to show steady improvement throughout the year, reflective of the high credit quality standards that we are maintaining in our underwriting. The allowance for loan and lease losses increased $11 million. The resulting reserve coverage is at 1.37% of loans and leases, compared with 1.35% last quarter and 252% of NPLs.
As we discussed last quarter, we are cognizant of where we are in the credit cycle. The global concerns associated with a diverse set of factors reaching from geopolitical to fundamental economic performance are well known. Although we are a predominantly domestic bank, it is difficult to take comfort purely around the health of the U.S. economy relative to the rest of the world. In this environment, and in light of the absolute low levels of our credit metrics, we need to point out that these levels may be subject to potential volatility from time to time. 
As an added element of credit discussion, given the global economic weakness and volatility, certain segments in commercial lending are appropriately getting more attention and we would like to review our portfolio more closely with you with respect to these industries on Slide 9. In isolation and in aggregate, our exposures in these 3 sectors are small, both relative to our total capital as well as relative to our total loans.
Our energy portfolio outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.7 billion, relatively small at 2% of the portfolio. Of this amount, just under half are in senior secured reserved-based loans. Outstandings in the energy portfolio increased $107 million from the third quarter, with growth in the midstream sector. At current forward strip oil prices, we continue to remain appropriately secured preserving our previous statements about our loss given default exposures on the RBL secured portfolio. So far, we had no exposures to any of the E&P companies that have filed for bankruptcy. The outstanding balances of roughly $300 million in oilfield services have a higher propensity for loss, given default. 
In the fourth quarter, $22 million of the increase in NPLs came from the oilfield services sector within the energy portfolio. We are monitoring our energy portfolio very closely, including stress testing the portfolio for lower oil price scenarios. Should low oil prices persist through 2017, we will see continued reserve build and increased credit costs over that same period.
We discussed our commodity trading exposure with you last quarter and during that conversation, we indicated our intent to effectively exit a large majority of our relationships. We are now reporting to you that our outstandings have declined to approximately $300 million, down by 34% since the second quarter. Furthermore, the credit distribution of the remaining outstandings is indicative of the quality of the portfolio, as we will continue to wind it down. To repeat what we said before, this is a short-term portfolio and we will execute the planned exits with no expected losses. Our proactive efforts here demonstrate our willingness to act decisively. 
In commercial real estate, while our growth in the last 2 years has been strong, it should be viewed in the context of a low starting point after being less active for a few years. Fifth Third's portfolio is one of the smallest percentages of total loans among our peers. Our current expectations for credit performance are based upon disciplined client selection, underwriting within established conservative policies, guidelines and concentration limits that include product and geographic concentrations. Disciplined client selection relies on targeting proven experienced developers, investors and sponsors with strong balance sheets, diversified sources of cash flow, and access to capital with demonstrated resilience through the cycle. Furthermore, our underwriting standards emphasize conservative cash flows, and we focus on upfront cash equity contributions relative to cost versus loan to values that can be inflated by historically low cap rates.
For each market, we conduct our own dilution analysis and focus on markets with multiple demand drivers and lower volatility. Specific to multifamily, we are sensitive not only to market demand and household generation, but also affordability as in some markets rents are rising faster than wages as the housing market returns. This has caused us to back off in certain markets. In short, we feel very comfortable with our commercial real estate exposure, albeit a small percentage of loans. 
Looking at capital on Slide 10. Capital levels continue to be strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 9.8% from 9.4%, a very strong quarterly move, especially given the impact of buybacks associated with Vantiv gains. In addition to the level of income, the reduction in the size of the warrant position, which reduced our risk-weighted assets contributed to the increase in the ratio. At the end of the fourth quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately $10 million. During the quarter, we announced a common stock repurchase of $215 million from Vantiv proceeds, which settled on the 14th of January, and reduced the fourth quarter share count by 9.25 million shares.
As Greg mentioned, our payout ratio was very healthy at above 75% this year. In light of our discussions about the ongoing investments in our risk and compliance infrastructure as well as other strategic investments, we have provided more details on the nature of some of these investments as well as our financial expectations. These details are provided on Slides 11 and 12. 
We are going through a period of higher investments and added expenses related to the enhancements in our risk and compliance infrastructure. These expenses are mostly related to headcount in compliance and other areas in risk management, including operational risk. But in addition to higher compensation expense, we are also investing in technology.
As you can see on Slide 11, the incremental expenses have had a significant impact on our run rate in 2015 and will impact the run rate in 2016 as well. While we added 373 employees in risk and compliance, we reduced the total employee count in other areas by 464 in 2015, resulting in a net decrease of 91. As we have shared with you in the past, we expect the rate of increase in our compensation expense in risk and compliance to peak this year. As such, we don't expect to see a repeat of this picture in 2017. We also don't expect to see a similar increase in technology expenses associated with our risk and compliance infrastructure beyond 2016.
On Slide 12, we wanted to give you a perspective on the nature of some of these investments in our retail and consumer businesses and also provide you with our expectations on the level and timing of the financial returns. As you know, we have already taken significant steps by focusing on optimizing branch staffing through both job-family redesign and headcount reductions, while at the same time, reengineering our branch operating model and network. By reinvesting a portion of these savings in the business, we believe that we have a significant opportunity to accelerate our digital capabilities to reap the benefits of increased customer satisfaction, revenue growth and continued operational efficiency. Specifically, the investment in our integrated customer experience and branch digitization infrastructure is a critical component of our consumer bank strategy. Our omni channel approach, one that truly integrates all of our customers' touch points across our physical, virtual and digital channels, reflects the changes in customer demographics as well as the broader shift in customer behavior. These investments will enable our customers to connect with the bank seamlessly from activities that range from how they obtain advice, to open accounts, to complete simple transactions. In addition to improved revenue prospects of all products, we expect significant cost savings, especially when combined with our investments in branch digitization and back-office automation. 
Although we are in the middle of executing our branch optimization strategy, our investments here could potentially provide other opportunities, which will depend on our future success in execution and the timing and extent of our change in our customers' behavior. The financial returns associated with these investments are very attractive and not based on aggressive assumptions about the overall economic conditions. As such, we are not delaying the timing, even in the current low growth environment. The payback periods are short and are meaningfully contributive to income going forward. The financial returns are expected to be even higher as a result of improved customer service quality. We believe that our shareholders will be rewarded well with these investments. 
In combination, we will incur higher expenses in both risk and compliance and strategic investments in 2016, which will elevate the expense growth this year. As our outlook for the year will show you, we are funding a portion of these investments with savings in our operations. For example, we expect our total compensation expenses this year to increase by roughly the same amount as the increase in risk and compliance-related compensation, which means that we are expecting no additional increase in total compensation in other areas, excluding onetime expenses, despite merit increases and other inflationary factors. The positive year-over-year impact on revenues associated with our strategic investments beyond 2016 and the beneficial impact of flattening expenses combine for a positive -- for a very positive impact on operating leverage and earnings.
Turning to the outlook. Our basic economic outlook is based on recent consensus market expectations of 2% to 3% real U.S. GDP growth with low inflation. On average, we should expect our industry to achieve overall loan growth approximating GDP growth.
In commercial lending, we expect our loan growth to exceed 3%, supported partially by our strategic investments. We expect to see a declining consumer loan portfolio, including the impact of the loan sales associated with our exit from St. Louis and Pittsburgh markets in the first half of this year, which is approximately $270 million. 
Outside the asset sales, the largest impact will come from our auto loan portfolio, where we expect no improvement in market conditions to increase the shareholder returns. With the LCR-related investments largely behind us, our portfolio investments will be opportunistic in this environment. We expect to increase the size of the portfolio, but the timing will be dependent on rates and other balance sheet dynamics. 
In our outlook, we have 2 rate increases in 2016, one in June and one in September. In that scenario, based upon our outlook for loan growth, we expect a roughly 2% to 3% increase in NII on a year-over-year basis. NIM should also expand 3 to 4 basis points from the fourth quarter 2015 level as the benefit of future rate hikes is partially offset by loan yield compression and potential funding actions. If there are no further rate increases in 2016, and including the impact of the dividend reduction on Fed stockholdings, we would expect a slightly higher NII and a stable NIM compared with full year 2015 levels, given a more conservative outlook on loan growth, based on the economic environment that would lead to Fed's inaction. 
While recognizing the challenges in the current environment, especially in the oil and gas sector, at this point, in our base case outlook, we still expect our credit performance to remain relatively stable. We expect our provision to exceed charge-offs in 2016. We currently expect our noninterest income to increase between 4% and 5%, excluding the impact of 2015 Vantiv-related gains. 
Moving to expenses. As we just discussed, 2016 is an important transition year in our company. It is a year in which we will start executing a number of strategic investments, which will lead to accelerated revenue growth, expense savings as well as operational excellence company-wide with a reasonably short payback period. As we also just discussed, we expect to see the slope of our risk and compliance-related expenses to flatten this year. 
When combined with our run rate earnings growth, this picture bodes very well for our outlook beyond 2016, with an improved earnings trajectory. More importantly, we are going through this transition as we continue to grow our revenues and achieve solid return on our shareholders' capital in 2016. Except for the increases in compensation related to risk and compliance that I just covered, excluding any onetime items, we expect to keep our total compensation expenses flat this year, including ongoing inflationary adjustments, merit increases and performance-based compensation. We expect roughly a $60 million increase in our technology expenses as we just discussed. These investments have either very attractive return profile and/or are related to improvements in our infrastructure. 
Our year-over-year total expense growth is expected to be approximately 4.5% to 5% over our reported expenses in 2015, including an estimate for the impact of the proposed change in the FDIC assessment fee and the estimated onetime impact of an early retirement offer that is currently available to eligible employees, which will reduce our run rate expenses going forward.
The growth is exaggerated partly due to an increase in the amortization of our low-income housing investments in 2016 and other onetime benefits that we experienced in 2015. Together, these 2 items make up approximately 2% of the increase in total expenses. In addition, as we just shared with you, that we expect an increase of approximately $75 million in total expenses related to our risk and compliance infrastructure, which is another 2% of our total expense base in 2015.
Our intent is to show that we are funding all other expense growth, including nonrisk-related strategic investments, with savings elsewhere, as these 2 items add up in dollar terms to a large portion of our entire year-over-year increase. For the first quarter, we expect net interest margin to be up 2 to 3 basis points, as the impact of the rate increase and day count is offset by the loan yield compression and the Fed dividend cut. 
Within NII, the reduction of the Fed dividend rate, loan yield compression and 1 less day in the quarter will slightly more than offset the benefit of the December rate increase and will result in a decline of about $5 million. Total fee income should be similar to last year's first quarter as most fee revenue lines, including deposit fees, card and processing revenue and corporate banking fees tend to be seasonally low -- seasonably [ph] low. And we will not have the benefit of the Vantiv TRA payment in the first quarter. We will see higher expenses in the quarter, primarily due to seasonally higher FICA and unemployment expense, much like we saw last year, continued investments in risk management and compliance and the impact from the early retirement offer. We currently expect net charge-offs to be approximately in line with first quarter 2015 levels. 
We also would like to remind you that the revenue expectations that we shared with you today do not include potential, but currently unforecasted items such as Vantiv warrant marks or gains or losses on share sales. Our goal is to solidify our earnings growth trajectory and improve shareholder returns and we have a plan to achieve that. With that, I will turn it over to Greg for closing comments."

That's still at a low point for us over the past 7 to 8 years, and it compares very favorably to our peers. We're down 12 basis points year-over-year or $97 million overall. The increases that we saw were a couple of energy credits that are, quite frankly, are just making their way through the restructuring process, which is to be expected. And then it was really just spread over a number of smaller middle market credits and a couple of leverage grants. So there was nothing there that jumped out as far as sectors.  We do look at high-yield spreads. There's clearly a correlation between high-yield spreads and future loan losses in the commercial sector, and we follow that, and they are going up, both on the energy side and outside of the energy side, so we'll continue to monitor and watch that over time. But our performance overall, the core of our middle market book, the mid-cap booked and the large-cap booked is still performing very, very well outside of energy, to answer your question, with no really discernible trends, either in geography or products, that are cause for concern at this time. So our antenna is up, like everybody else. We're looking at a lot of leading indicators, we're managing credit very closely, but at this point, we still feel good overall about our portfolio for the year.  As you recall, we had one outlier in the third quarter, which was a large student loan that was made back in 2007 that we restructured and wrote off. But if you exclude that one large problem loan, our charge-offs for the year for the entire company were very tightly ranged between 34 basis points and 41 basis points. So very predicable. And at this point, we have only $22 million in NPAs in the energy sector, that could change, but at this point, it's 1.3% of the energy book. So I hope that's responsive to your question."

But in return, we're spending -- our retail and consumer loan teams are spending quite a bit of time in moving the direction in home equity loans and credit cards up, and we are confident that some of these strategic and tactical moves will improve growth rates in those 2 portfolios. Now we've always been cautious in terms of guiding the market for loan growth, as we do believe that in general our sector over a long period of time should match GDP growth. But clearly, in interim periods, we will have strategic actions to go over that. And so with that, I'm going to turn it over to Lars because I think he has good feedback and color on those actions, what we're thinking about the commercial loan portfolio."

And frankly, as recently as just the last few days, I've had interaction with a number of clients in the marketplace. So I think this is pretty contemporary feedback. We are seeing a growing sense of caution from our client base. And frankly, that is really across almost all of our businesses. Maybe an exception could be in the health care sector where they continue to have a level of confidence, as some of the uncertainty was taken out in the end of last year, there, and frankly, we're benefiting from that as we've invested in that, and we continue to see nice growth there. Our goal is going to be obviously to outperform the nominal GDP as we look at 2016 through executing our business model that I think is very well received. And that business model is really one centered on having industry expertise with some of the best bankers in the marketplace, with very well-thought through developed business lines. Now those business lines, like I mentioned in health care, in retail and in a number of other verticals, have clearly outperformed. But we haven't stopped there. We're continuing to look for other opportunities to move market share. We've added our gaming and leisure. We're looking at our telecom, media, telecommunications group, our food and ag group, a number of other opportunities there, where we're able to attract some very high quality talent both on the line and in credit in order for us to, I think, outperform the marketplace. I'd also remind you that we have very attractive geographic markets throughout our footprint. If you look at the performance of just core commercial kind of middle market businesses in North Carolina, in Chicago, in Florida and other markets on a common quarter basis, we're up over 6% over the past year. We're going to continue to execute in those markets. We have a very well-received value proposition in the marketplace. We're very focused on blocking and tackling and developing deeper relationships. One last thing I would add on to that, this is not just about credit and loans. This is about relationships and relationship returns and building them for the long haul not just for the next quarter, but for years to come, and we're seeing that play out even as we speak. So I have a lot of confidence as we look at '16. However, it is against an uncertain economic backdrop."

So you're looking at basically about a $2.3 billion [ph] base in 2015. So the growth is off of that number. So what we are looking at is growth in capital markets, which I think Lars will provide some color on. With all of our investments and added talents, we are expecting a good amount of growth. I think we are expecting growth in our payments business. Our payments processing should continue to give us added revenues based on our outlook. Mortgage excluding the unpredictable MSR performance and at this point, based upon our interest rate outlook, we have to realize the 10-year is under 2% right now, which may change some of these expectations. But under a more normalized credit outlook, we would be about at the same place we were in 2015. We are expecting growth in our private banking and investment advisory business. We've done very well. That's been based on fairly stable sources of income. But the larger growth is expected to come from capital markets, and I'll turn it over to Lars for comments on that."

Now clearly, as you know, capital markets is largely influenced by the overall activity in the overall macroeconomic environment and how that leeches into the U.S. markets. Something to keep in mind today, our capital markets business is certainly heavily centered around the debt capital markets, risk management. And when I'm talking about that it's interest rate risk management, commodities and FX. And with the uncertainties in the market, that obviously impacted the fourth quarter. But in a more normalized environment, we've got some really talented bankers with some deep relationships. We're very well positioned. And I would tell you, in our capital markets pipeline, we actually are set up with clients for some nice activity once there's more certainty with our clients as we move into 2016. In addition to that, we're trying to diversify our capital markets platform, build out our M&A advisory platform. And I think that we have some very nice opportunities throughout '16 and '17 on a go-forward basis. And lastly, again, going back to the blocking and tackling, I think we've done a really nice job of building out a really high-quality Wealth Management family practice kind of business as a company. But where we have an opportunity is to further integrate that across our platform, to open up our commercial and corporate bank and really deepen these relationships. And I see some revenue opportunity as well as strengthening long-term relationships, consistent with our long-term strategy. And that's not just in our Wealth Management IA business. That includes our treasury management products where we have a number of specific actions and initiatives that we have underway for 2016 to drive those results."

I would tell you, as Tayfun laid out in his prepared remarks, we certainly have an asset sensitive balance sheet that is benefited by the rate hike in December as well as the future moves we're forecasting. There are a couple of macro factors as well as several idiosyncratic factors that create headwinds for us in that environment. The macro factors, as you touched on, the pricing pressures in this low rate environment, new productions coming on the sheet, less than yields on the paydown and payoffs and then you have the impact of the Fed stock dividend reduction. And I think those factors are impacting everybody. For Fifth Third specifically, as Lars touched on, you have C&I loan yield compression from this remixing as we are focused on disciplined growth and a better credit profile of client. And that compression should dissipate in the back half of '16. And then you have, for us, also early access, continued attrition as we're not enrolling new customers. And then as Tayfun touched on, our outlook on the auto book production declined. We did about $5 billion this year. We expect that number to be around $3 billion in 2016. And then finally, on the funding side, what we've baked into our NII outlook is to have a pretty dynamic year on the funding side. And with about $2.5 billion in maturities of 3-year issuances that are currently around a 1% interest rate, our outlook assumes that we go out a little bit longer term and better position the company from a funding profile for 2017 and beyond. So all of those items are baked in to that NII outlook. And with all that said, we still expect NII to grow 2% to 3% in 2016."

Today, we'll report our first quarter and then come to common shareholders of $312 million in earnings per diluted share of $0.40. We have some non-core items that added $0.03 to earnings per share in the quarter. Our Q1 results were solid especially we experienced on the quarter. The income levels, including capital market fees, were stronger despite market assumptions. As you know, we've been building on our capital markets capabilities for last 3 years. We're seeing our investments to pay off. When the quarter we closed on the largest deal in the history of our company. Interest income was also stronger than expected. We benefited from low deposit December rate hike and expect to continue to manage deposit rates Given the outlook for rates, we should continue to benefit from our steady and conscious strategy with respect to rate risk management. 
We remain focused on executing our defined strategies. We closed on the sale of the branch of which resulted in $8 million pretax gain. In addition, we expect to close on the sale of the branches this week. We continue to rationalize our branch network and on track to deliver $60 million annual expense savings related to these reductions. We're in this new proxy and services. Our new Express Banking product, for example, received high accolades from the CFPB. Just we launched this product in November 2015, we were able to move 55,000 new customer accounts. Our ongoing investments in digital technology continued to accelerate our growth rate in mobile banking. 
In 2015, our growth of mobile users exceeded the industry average and accelerated. The rest of our industry experienced the slow down. In the first quarter, over 70% of our deposit transactions were executed via mobile devices and 12% in the first quarter 2012. In addition, we doubled the number of check accounts that were open online from a year ago. During the quarter, we implemented retirement program. This program resulted in a $14 million one-time expense, but will generate $9 million in annual cost savings. We will continue to look for more efficient ways to operate our company. Achieving operating leverage is our top priority. We are making progress with that goal. 
Our expenses at one timers were up 2% sequentially, partly reflecting the seasonal increase in insurance. While we're investing in our company, where very focused on controlled expenses across all of our. We now believe that our expense growth in 2016 will be lower than we had originally expected, but we will find more details in an updated in his comments. 
As we shared with you in January, we are proceeding with several strategic initiatives and improved revenue growth, generating cost efficiencies and improve service quality. We remain on track to share our progress with you as the year continues to unfold. During 2015, we discussed our effots to reduce our risk exposures. As of March 31, our loans to commodity traders were down to $241 million. That's down by more than 50% from the peak. 
On energy, oil prices did rebound outflows, but the second remains distressed. Our balances was stable from the fourth quarter at $1.7 billion. As expected, we saw continued deterioration in the book. Energy NPLs were $168 million higher than the last quarter that they represent the bulk of the total NPA -- NPL increase during the quarter. The loans are moved into the NPL category were predominately reserve-based levels. As these loans are generally we do not expect this similar increase in the charge-offs. 
At the end of the first quarter, we only had $294 million in loans to higher risk oilfield services company. We have reserves of 6.2% against our total energy portfolio, and we believe reserves are more than appropriate. Our capital levels remain strong with common equity Tier 1 of 9.8%. Our earnings contributed to a tangible book value of $16.32 per share, which was up 5% from last quarter and 9% over last year. 
During the quarter, we also announced the share repurchase of $240 million or common stock, which settled on April 11. We retired approximately 14.5 million shares. With that, I'll turn over to Tayfun to discuss our first quarter operating results and our current outlook."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. For the first quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $312 million or $0.40 per diluted share. There was a ne",1927,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. For the first quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $312 million or $0.40 per diluted share. There was a net benefit in the quarter of $0.03 per share resulting from the gains on the and the brand sales offset partially by the cost of the voluntary retirement program. We are pleased with the results, especially given challenging market conditions during the quarter. 
So let's move to the average balance sheet on Page 5 of the presentation. Average commercial loan balances were relatively flat sequentially, but up about 5% year-over-year. Our end of period balances were up by $1.5 billion or 3% sequentially. The decline in average balances was partly due to higher pay downs and delays in closings at the very end of last year. We experienced healthy activity in the latter half of the first quarter. Average consumer loans were down 1% from last quarter and up 1% year-over-year. 
Residential mortgage loans grew by 2% sequentially as we continue to portfolio only jumbled mortgages and ARMs and up 11% year-over-year. Indirect auto loans are down 3% from last quarter and 5% year-over-year in line with our lower origination targets and focus on improving returns in this business. The return profile of our first quarter production was one of the best in the last few years within the super prime market that we mainly focus on. 
Average investment securities increased by $317 million in the first quarter or 1% sequentially. Average core deposits decreased $1 billion from the fourth quarter. This decrease was driven by seasonally lower demand deposits partially offset by higher interest checking balances. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 118% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving to NII on Page 6 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $5 million sequentially to $909 million despite the negative day count impact. The increase was primarily driven by improvement in variable rate loan yields due to the increase in funds rate in December with deposit data remaining at low levels. Quarter-over-quarter, our earning asset yield increased by 8 basis points accompanied by a 3 basis point increase in cost of interest-bearing liabilities. These benefits were partially offset by the effect of a reduced spread stock dividend payment and continued spread compression from the mix shift to the lower yielding, higher quality credits, which we've discussed previously. 
NII also benefited from the timing of the investment in the portfolio as cash flows were invested earlier in the quarter and the late debt issuance during the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our NII growth over last quarter and the 7% growth year-over-year. NIM improved 6 basis points to 2.91% quarter-over-quarter. 
Shifting to fees on Page 7 of the presentation. First quarter noninterest income was $637 million compared with $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Our fee income adjusted primarily for Vantiv-related items and the annual $31 million TRA payment in the fourth quarter was $578 million, a decrease of $14 million or 2% sequentially. 
Despite seasonal headwinds and challenging market conditions, our results were strong. Corporate banking fees of $102 million were relatively flat sequentially, and adjusted for the write-down of the residual lease in the first quarter of 2015 were up 10% year-over-year. 
As we mentioned in January, Corporate Banking fees are seasonally lower in the first quarter and overall market conditions were weak during the quarter. So our performance was strong despite the challenging backdrop. 
Mortgage banking net revenue of $78 million was up $4 million sequentially. Originations were 1.8 billion in the first quarter, with 46% of the mix consisting of purchase volume. About 75% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels and the remainder came through the correspondent channel. Gain on sale margins were up 57 basis points sequentially to 347 basis points, and net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $16 million similar to last quarter. Deposit service charges decreased 5% from the fourth quarter reflecting seasonal trends in consumer deposit fees and increased 1% relative to the first quarter of 2015. 
Total investment advisory revenue of $102 million was flat sequentially, mostly reflecting weaker equity market activity during the quarter. This impact was offset by seasonally higher trust tax-preparation fees. Excluding certain onetime items, our year-over-year revenue growth reached nearly 5%, a very good outcome in a challenging environment. 
Next, I would like to discuss noninterest expense on Page 8 of the presentation. Expenses were $986 million compared with $963 million in the fourth quarter. The sequential increase was partly due to seasonally higher FICA and employment insurance expense and a $14 million expense related to the voluntary early retirement program. The early retirement program was well received by our employees and approximately 160 employees participated. As a result, we expect a $9 million decrease in annual compensation expenses. As Greg said earlier, we continue to look for other similar opportunities to improve our expense run rate. I will provide an update on our expense outlook a little later. 
Turning to credit results on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were $96 million or 42 basis points in the first quarter compared to $80 million and 34 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $91 million and 41 basis points in the first quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was due to a $16 million increase in C&I net charge-offs. All of the total net charge-offs, $9 million were in energy. Nonperforming loans, excluding loans held-for-sale, increased $195 million from the previous quarter to $701 million resulting in an NPL ratio of 75 basis points. 
Commercial NPLs increased $202 million from the fourth quarter, driven by $168 million in energy NPLs. Consumer NPLs declined by $7 million sequentially. Overall credit conditions, excluding energy, remained within our expectations. Consumer credit continues to improve and commercial credit, excluding energy, is stable. Our provision was $23 million higher than the total charge-offs in the first quarter, and our reserve coverage moved up 1 basis point to 1.38% of loans and leases. It is important to note, as Greg mentioned, that an increase in energy NPLs should not necessarily translate into an increase in charge-offs of the same magnitude. This is because the majority of energy NPLs are well collateralized and consist of reserve-based loans. 
On Slide 10, we have provided a breakdown of our energy portfolio. Our energy related loans at the end of the quarter were $1.7 billion with total commitments of $4 billion. As you can see, our loans to oilfield services companies were only $294 million or 17% of our total energy loans outstanding and leaves only $170 million in and used commitments. 
We believe that we are appropriately reserved for losses in the energy portfolio based on detailed stress analysis that our teams continue to update, not only on the oilfield services portfolio, but also on our reserve-based loans. Based on detailed analysis, we believe that our energy reserves, which are currently at 6.2%, up from 4.8% at the end of last year, are adequate. Our stress case scenario over a 9 quarter period assumes that oil prices will be at $20 in 2016 and $25 in 2017.  This stress scenario would add approximately $50 million to $60 million in net charge-offs over and above our current results. 
On Slide 11, we provide a breakdown of our commercial real estate portfolio. It is important to note that our commercial real estate business today is much different than what we had precrisis. At the end of 27, 21% of our total loans and leases were in commercial real estate. Today, we are at 11% below our peer levels. 
At the end of 2007, over 40% of our nonowner occupied exposure was in land and residential developers. Today, that exposure is slightly above 4%. As you can see, our nonperforming assets continue to decrease both within the commercial mortgage and commercial construction portfolios. 
At the end of the first quarter, NPAs in our commercial mortgage portfolio is decreased to 1.84% from 2.56% a year earlier. NPAs in our commercial construction portfolio decreased to 23 basis points from 67 basis points over the same period. During the last 2 years, we significantly upgraded our credit resources in commercial mortgage and construction underwriting, which increased our focus on client selection, geographical diversity and multifactor stress analysis. 
Moving on to capital on Slide 12. Our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.8%, an increase of 30 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the first quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately $15 million. During the quarter, we announced and settled a common stock repurchase of $240 million and reduced the first quarter share count by 14.5 million shares. 
Now moving to outlook. The drivers of our overall outlook remain unchanged. We expect year-over-year commercial loan growth to exceed 3% and the consumer loan portfolio to decline. The decline of our consumer loan portfolio will primarily reflect lower auto loan origination, as we had previously discussed, and includes the impact of sales associated with the St. Louis and Pittsburgh transactions. 
Our interest rate outlook now has only one rate increase in June as supposed to the 2 increases that we had in our original base case. For the second quarter, we would expect relatively stable net interest income compared with the first quarter. But despite 1 late rate increase, we still expect a 2.5% to 3% increase in NII year-over-year. In our base case, we would expect to see a 3 to 4 basis point of NIM decline in the second quarter and then all relatively steady in line with our results in 2015. 
Although deposit betas are expected to remain low, our outlook assumes incremental spread compression due to our continued emphasis on originating higher quality loans. This update improves upon our January guidance, as it includes 1 less rate increase. Without a rate increase, we would expect NII grow around 2%. 
Our overall fee income growth outlook is not changing. We expect to grow our fees between 4% and 5% on the 2015 base of $2.3 billion, which excludes Vantiv share and warrant gains that we had during the year. We are lowering our year-over-year expense outlook from 4.5% to 5% to the 4 to 4.25 range. We believe that our intense focus on expense control will result in an improvement in operating efficiency compared to our January expectations. 
The quarterly run rate will increase from the first quarter levels. And this will reflect seasonality and the timing of implementation of strategic initiatives, but we will have better year-over-year yield results than originally expected. Our second quarter results will also include a one-time approximately $10 million expense as a result of retirement eligibility changes related to long-term incentive compensation. The changes will align our retirement eligibility provisions with our peer group. This is just a change in the timing of the recognition of expenses and would lower our expenses going forward. We continue to monitor our energy exposures closely. It is likely that we will see higher charge-offs in this portfolio, primarily in the oilfield services sector. Given the relatively modest size of our exposure, future credit losses should be manageable. Credit losses ex energy should remain in the range with some potential variability quarter-to-quarter due to the historically low level of current charge-offs. 
With that, let me open the call for questions."

As we reported nonperforming assets are up in the quarter, almost all of that was energy related, 90-plus percent is energy related. tied to reserve-based lending loans, 7 loans, we feel very confident at this point that those loans are protected by the risk adjustment collateral coverage that we have in place. All borrowers in this segment that are on NPL that were just moved are current and that's important. The regulators, you probably heard on earnings call taken a much quicker view on how they are classifying these loans from the accounting perspective. They are looking to cover both the first and the second lien positions on these companies. In our case, we have a super secured first-lien position, and we belong to a very detailed portfolio analysis bottoms up of all of our energy book to ensure that they're from a borrowing perspective, we're well secured. So NPLs are up; however, it's in the segment that's very well protected on a collateral position, but historically, they're based on a current outlook. We could see additional deterioration from an energy perspective in NPL given that in the future is slightly indicated, but we are not changing our outlook on overall credit losses. Beyond that, when you look at the rest of the portfolio now again we talked this morning about commercial real estate, we feel very good about that performance is holding up us very well. We have very little exposure in commercial real estate and the energy state. We have 4 multifamily credits that are in Houston, 2 of which are stabilized, the other 2 are performing under construction according to terms that we set. And we have some exposure in Denver from commercial real estate perspective, but that market is held up very well being in an energy sector. So the overall commercial real estate at this point is performing to our expectations. Our middle market book is performing very well. We're showing very strong performance in our 4 markets. We're are not concerned there. Our leverage book is stable. We have some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter and leverage performing to our expectations as well. I hope that was responsive to your question."

We've seen pretty steady balances on overall basis in that portfolio as we continue to work through with our clients.

Accordingly, utilization rates moved up a little bit. But frankly, we would expect that those overall balances committed and loan balances would come down over a period of time as the clients that we continue to work with very closely continue to sell-off core, noncore assets, access the equity capital and debt capital markets and reduce our profile.

We have a good history of managing expenses in this organization, and we'll continue that history going forward. But we have to invest the platform of our infrastructure, which we're doing and we'll get paid well for that. We're pruning back and leaning back our distribution channels as we mentioned before around branches. We're moving to digital capabilities for our customers, which will reduce our back-office cost, replatforming our retail platform, our mortgage platform, which be specifically more efficient going forward.

Today, we report our first quarter and then come to common shareholders of $312 million in earnings per diluted share of $0.40. We had some noncore items that added $0.03 to earnings per share in the quarter. Our Q1 results were solid, especially concerned of market volatility we experienced during the quarter. The income levels, including capital market fees, were stronger despite market disruptions. As you know, we've been building out our capital markets capabilities for last few years. We're seeing our investments pay off. During the quarter we closed on the largest M&A deal in the history of our company. Net interest income was also stronger than expected. We benefited from low deposit betas, following the December rate hike and expect to continue to manage deposit rates tightly. Given the outlook for rates, we should continue to benefit from our steady and conscious strategy with respect to rate risk management.
We remain focused on executing our defined strategies. We closed on the sale of the branch of the St. Louis, which resulted in $8 million pretax gain. In addition, we expect to close on the sale of the Pittsburgh branch this week. We continue to rationalize our branch network and on track to deliver $60 million annual expense savings related to these reductions.
We're introducing new products and services. Our new Express Banking product, for example, received high accolades directly from the CFPB. Since we launched this product in November 2015, we've added [ph] more than 65,000 new customer accounts. Our ongoing investments in digital technology continue to accelerate our growth rate in mobile banking.
In 2015, the growth of mobile users exceeded the industry average and then accelerated, while the rest of our industry experienced the slow down. In the first quarter, over 70% of our deposit transactions were executed via mobile devices compared with 12% in the first quarter of 2012. In addition, we doubled the number of check accounts that were open online from a year ago. During the quarter, we implemented an early retirement program. This program resulted in a $14 million onetime expense, but will generate $9 million in annual cost savings. We will continue to look for more efficient ways to operate our company. Achieving operating leverage is our top priority. We are making progress with that goal.
Our expenses net of one timers were up 2% sequentially, partly reflecting the seasonal increase in FICA and employment insurance. While we're investing in our company, we are very focused on controlling expenses across all of our operations. We now believe that our expense growth in 2016 will be lower than we had originally expected. Tuzun will provide more details in an update in our outlook in his comments. 
As we shared with you in January, we are proceeding with several strategic initiatives to improve revenue growth, generate cost efficiencies and to improve service quality. We'll remain on track in attempt to share progress with you as the year continues to unfold. During 2015, we discussed our efforts to reduce our risk exposures. As of March 31, our loans to commodity traders were down to $241 million. That's down by more than 50% from the peak.
On energy, oil prices did rebound outflows, but the second remains distressed. Our balances were stable from the fourth quarter at $1.7 billion. As expected, we saw continued deterioration in the book. Energy NPLs were $168 million higher than the last quarter, but they represent the bulk of the total NPA -- NPL increase during the quarter. The loans are moved into the NPL category predominately reserve-based levels. As these loans are generally [indiscernible], we did not expect a similar increase in net charge-offs.
At the end of the first quarter, we only had $294 million in loans to the higher-risk oilfield services companies. We have reserves of 6.2% against our total energy portfolio, and we believe these reserves are more than appropriate. Our capital levels remained strong with common equity Tier 1 of 9.8%. Our earnings contributed to a tangible book value of $16.32 per share, which was up 5% from last quarter and 9% over last year.
During the quarter, we also announced the share repurchase of $240 million of our common stock, which settled on April 11. We retired approximately 14.5 million shares. 
With that, I'll turn over to Tayfun to discuss our first quarter operating results and our current outlook."
270961,328672498,960934,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. For the first quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $312 million or $0.40 per diluted share. There was a ne",1930,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. For the first quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $312 million or $0.40 per diluted share. There was a net benefit in the quarter of $0.03 per share, resulting from the gains on the Vantiv warrants and branch sales, offset partially by the cost of the voluntary retirement program. We are pleased with the results, especially given challenging market conditions during the quarter. 
So let's move to the average balance sheet on Page 5 of the presentation. Average commercial loan balances were relatively flat sequentially, but up about 5% year-over-year. Our end of period balances were up by $1.5 billion or 3% sequentially. The decline in average balances was partly due to higher pay downs and delays in closings at the very end of last year. We experienced healthy activity in the latter half of the first quarter. Average consumer loans were down 1% from last quarter and up 1% year-over-year.
Residential mortgage loans grew by 2% sequentially as we continue to portfolio only jumbo  mortgages and ARMs and up 11% year-over-year. Indirect auto loans are down 3% from last quarter and 5% year-over-year, in line with our lower origination targets and focus on improving returns in this business. The return profile of our first quarter production was one of the best in the last few years within the super-prime market that we mainly focus on. 
Average investment securities increased by $317 million in the first quarter or 1% sequentially. Average core deposits decreased $1 billion from the fourth quarter. This decrease was driven by seasonally lower demand deposits partially offset by higher interest checking balances. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 118% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving to NII on Page 6 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $5 million sequentially to $909 million, despite the negative day count impact. The increase was primarily driven by improvement in variable rate loan yields due to the increase in the fed funds rate in December, with deposit betas remaining at low levels. Quarter-over-quarter, our earning asset yield increased by 8 basis points accompanied by a 3 basis point increase in cost of interest-bearing liabilities. These benefits were partially offset by the effect of a reduced Fed stock dividend payment and continued spread compression from the mix shift to the lower-yielding, higher-quality credits, which we've discussed previously. 
NII also benefited from the timing of the investments in the portfolio, as cash flows were invested earlier in the quarter and the late debt issuance during the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our NII growth over last quarter and the 7% growth year-over-year. NIM improved 6 basis points to 2.91% quarter-over-quarter.
Shifting to fees on Page 7 of the presentation. First quarter noninterest income was $637 million compared with $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Our fee income adjusted primarily for Vantiv-related items, and the annual $31 million TRA payment in the fourth quarter was $578 million, a decrease of $14 million or 2% sequentially. 
Despite seasonal headwinds and challenging market conditions, our results were strong. Corporate banking fees of $102 million were relatively flat sequentially and adjusted for the write-down of a residual lease in the first quarter of 2015 were up 10% year-over-year. 
As we mentioned in January, corporate banking fees are seasonally lower in the first quarter, and overall market conditions were weak during the quarter. So our performance was strong despite the challenging backdrop. 
Mortgage banking net revenue of $78 million was up $4 million sequentially. Originations were 1.8 billion in the first quarter, with 46% of the mix consisting of purchase volume. About 75% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels, and the remainder came through the correspondent channel. Gain on sale margins were up 57 basis points sequentially to 347 basis points, and net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $16 million similar to last quarter. 
Deposit service charges decreased 5% from the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonal trends in consumer deposit fees and increased 1% relative to the first quarter of 2015.
Total investment advisory revenue of $102 million was flat sequentially, mostly reflecting weaker equity market activity during the quarter. This impact was offset by seasonally higher trust tax preparation fees. Excluding certain onetime items, our year-over-year revenue growth reached nearly 5%, a very good outcome in a challenging environment.
Next, I would like to discuss noninterest expense on Page 8 of the presentation. Expenses were $986 million compared with $963 million in the fourth quarter. The sequential increase was partly due to seasonally higher FICA and employment insurance expense and a $14 million expense related to the voluntary early retirement program. The early retirement program was well received by our employees and approximately 160 employees participated. As a result, we expect a $9 million decrease in annual compensation expenses. 
As Greg said earlier, we continue to look for other similar opportunities to improve our expense run rate. I will provide an update on our expense outlook a little later.
Turning to credit results on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were $96 million or 42 basis points in the first quarter compared to $80 million and 34 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $91 million and 41 basis points in the first quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was due to a $16 million increase in C&I net charge-offs. Off the total net charge-offs, $9 million were in energy. Nonperforming loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased $195 million from the previous quarter to $701 million, resulting in an NPL ratio of 75 basis points.
Commercial NPLs increased $202 million from the fourth quarter, driven by $168 million in energy NPLs. Consumer NPLs declined by $7 million sequentially. 
Overall credit conditions, excluding energy, remained within our expectations. Consumer credit continues to improve, and commercial credit, excluding energy, is stable. Our provision was $23 million higher than the total charge-offs in the first quarter, and our reserve coverage moved up 1 basis point to 1.38% of loans and leases. It is important to note, as Greg mentioned, that an increase in energy NPLs should not necessarily translate into an increase in charge-offs of the same magnitude. This is because the majority of energy NPLs are well collateralized and consist of reserve-based loans.
On Slide 10, we have provided a breakdown of our energy portfolio. Our energy related loans at the end of the quarter were $1.7 billion with total commitments of $4 billion. As you can see, our loans to oilfield services companies were only $294 million or 17% of our total energy loans outstanding and leaves only $170 million in the unused commitments. 
We believe that we are appropriately reserved for losses in the energy portfolio based on detailed stress analysis that our teams continue to update not only on the oilfield services portfolio but also on our reserve-based loans. 
Based on detailed analysis, we believe that our energy reserves, which are currently at 6.2%, up from 4.8% at the end of last year, are adequate. Our stress case scenario over a 9 quarter period assumes that oil prices will be at $20 in 2016 and $25 in 2017.  This stress scenario would add approximately $50 million to $60 million in net charge-offs over and above our current results. 
On Slide 11, we provide a breakdown of our commercial real estate portfolio. It is important to note that our commercial real estate business today is much different than what we had precrisis. At the end of 2007, 21% of our total loans and leases were in commercial real estate. Today, we are at 11% below our peer levels.
At the end of 2007, over 40% of our nonowner-occupied exposure was in land and residential developers. Today, that exposure is slightly above 4%. As you can see, our nonperforming assets continue to decrease, both within the commercial mortgage and commercial construction portfolios.
At the end of the first quarter, NPAs in our commercial mortgage portfolio decreased to 1.84% from 2.56% a year earlier. NPAs in our commercial construction portfolio decreased to 23 basis points from 67 basis points over the same period. During the last 2 years, we significantly upgraded our credit resources in commercial mortgage and construction underwriting, which increased our focus on client selection, geographical diversity and multifactor stress analysis.
Moving on to capital on Slide 12. Our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.8%, an increase of 30 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the first quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately $15 million. During the quarter, we announced and settled a common stock repurchase of $240 million and reduced the first quarter's share count by 14.5 million shares.
Now moving to outlook. The drivers of our overall outlook remain unchanged. We expect year-over-year commercial loan growth to exceed 3% and the consumer loan portfolio to decline. The decline of our consumer loan portfolio will primarily reflect lower auto loan origination, as we had previously discussed, and includes the impact of the sales associated with the St. Louis and Pittsburgh transactions. 
Our interest rate outlook now has only one rate increase in June as opposed to the 2 increases that we had in our original base case. For the second quarter, we would expect relatively stable net interest income compared with the first quarter. But despite 1 late -- less rate increase, we still expect a 2.5% to 3% increase in NII year-over-year. In our base case, we would expect to see a 3 to 4 basis point of NIM decline in the second quarter and then hold relatively steady in line with our results in 2015. 
Although deposit betas are expected to remain low, our outlook assumes incremental spread compression due to our continued emphasis on originating higher quality loans. This update improves upon our January guidance as it includes 1 less rate increase. Without a rate increase, we would expect NII grow around 2%.
Our overall fee income growth outlook is not changing. We expect to grow our fees between 4% and 5% on the 2015 base of $2.3 billion, which excludes Vantiv share and warrant gains that we had during the year. We are lowering our year-over-year expense outlook from 4.5% to 5% to the 4% to 4.25% range. We believe that our intense focus on expense control will result in an improvement in operating efficiency compared to our January expectations.
The quarterly run rate will increase from the first quarter levels, and this will reflect seasonality and the timing of implementation of strategic initiatives. But we will have better year-over-year yield results than originally expected. Our second quarter results will also include a onetime approximately $10 million expense as a result of retirement eligibility changes related to long-term incentive compensation. These changes will align our retirement eligibility provisions with our peer group. This is just a change in the timing of the recognition of expenses and would lower our expense going forward. We continue to monitor our energy exposures closely. It is likely that we will see higher charge-offs in this portfolio, primarily in the oilfield services sector. Given the relatively modest size of our exposure, future credit losses should be manageable. Credit losses, ex energy, should remain in the range, with some potential variability quarter-to-quarter due to the historically low level of current charge-offs. 
With that, let me open the call for questions."

As we reported, the nonperforming assets are up in the quarter, almost all of that is energy related -- 90-plus percent is energy related. It's all tied to reserve-based lending loans, settled loans, we feel very confident at this point that those loans are protected by the risk adjustment collateral coverage that we have in place. All borrowers in this segment that are on NPL that were just moved are current, I think that's important. The regulators, as you probably heard on that earnings call, have taken a much stricter view on how they are classifying these loans from the accounting perspective. They are looking to cover both the first and the second lien positions on these companies. In our case, we have a super secured first-lien position, and we belong to a very detailed portfolio analysis that bottoms up of all of our energy book to ensure they're from the  borrowing base perspective, we're well secured. So NPLs are up. However, it's in the segment that's very well protected from a collateral position, but historically, they're based on a current outlook. We could see additional deterioration from an energy perspective in NPL, given that in the future as Tayfun indicated. But we are not changing our outlook on overall credit losses. Beyond that, when you look at the rest of the portfolio now, again, we talked this morning about commercial real estate. We feel very good about that book. The performance is holding up us very well. We have very little exposure in commercial real estate and the energy state. We have 4 multifamily credits that are in Houston, 2 of which are stabilized, the other 2 are performing under construction according to the terms that we've set. And we have some exposure in Denver from a commercial real estate perspective, but that market is held up very well not being in an energy sector. So the overall commercial real estate book at this point is performing to our expectations. Our middle market book is performing very well. We're showing very strong performance in most of our core markets. We're are not concerned there. Our leverage book is stable. We'll have some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter and leverage, but overall it's performing to our expectations as well. I hope that was responsive to your question."

Today, we report our first quarter net income to common shareholders of $312 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.40. We had some noncore items that added $0.03 to earnings per share in the quarter. Our Q1 results were solid, especially considering the market volatility we experienced during the quarter. The income levels, including capital market fees, were stronger despite market disruptions. As you know, we've been building out our capital markets capabilities for last few years. We're seeing our investments pay off. During the quarter we closed on the largest M&A deal in the history of our company. Net interest income was also stronger than expected. We benefited from low deposit betas, following the December rate hike and expect to continue to manage deposit rates tightly. Given the outlook for rates, we should continue to benefit from our steady and cautious strategy with respect to rate risk management.
We remain focused on executing our defined strategies. We closed on the sale of the branch of the St. Louis, which resulted in $8 million pretax gain. In addition, we expect to close on the sale of the Pittsburgh branch this week. We continue to rationalize our branch network and on track to deliver $60 million annual expense savings related to these reductions.
We're introducing new products and services. Our new Express Banking product, for example, received high accolades directly from the CFPB. Since we launched this product in November 2015, we've opened more than 65,000 new customer accounts. Our ongoing investments in digital technology continue to accelerate our growth rate in mobile banking.
In 2015, our growth of mobile users exceeded the industry average and then accelerated, while the rest of our industry experienced a slowdown. In the first quarter, over 70% of our deposit transactions were executed via mobile devices compared with 12% in the first quarter of 2012. In addition, we doubled the number of check accounts that were open online from a year ago. During the quarter, we implemented an early retirement program. This program resulted in a $14 million onetime expense, but will generate $9 million in annual cost savings. We will continue to look for more efficient ways to operate our company. Achieving operating leverage is our top priority. We are making progress with that goal.
Our expenses, net of one-timers, were up 2% sequentially, partly reflecting the seasonal increase in FICA and unemployment insurance. While we're investing in our company, we are very focused on controlling expenses across all of our operations. We now believe that our expense growth in 2016 will be lower than we had originally expected. Tayfun will provide more details in an update in our outlook in his comments. 
As we shared with you in January, we are proceeding with several strategic initiatives to improve revenue growth, generate cost efficiencies and to improve service quality. We'll remain on track and intend to share progress with you as the year continues to unfold. During 2015, we discussed our efforts to reduce our risk exposures. As of March 31, our loans to commodity traders were down to $241 million. That's down by more than 50% from the peak.
On energy, oil prices did rebound off lows, but the sector remains distressed. Our balances were stable from the fourth quarter at $1.7 billion. As expected, we saw continued deterioration in the book. Energy NPLs were $168 million higher from the last quarter, but they represent the bulk of the total NPA -- NPL increase during the quarter. The loans are moved into the NPL category predominately reserve-based loans. As these loans are generally [indiscernible], we do not expect a similar increase in net charge-offs.
At the end of the first quarter, we only had $294 million in loans to higher-risk oilfield services companies. We held reserves of 6.2% against our total energy portfolio, and we believe these reserves are more than appropriate. Our capital levels remained strong with common equity Tier 1 of 9.8%. Our earnings contributed to a tangible book value of $16.32 per share, which was up 5% from last quarter and up 9% over last year.
During the quarter, we also announced the share repurchase of $240 million of our common stock, which settled on April 11. We retired approximately 14.5 million shares. 
With that, I'll turn over to Tayfun to discuss our first quarter operating results and our current outlook."
270961,328672498,961341,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. For the first quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $312 million or $0.40 per diluted share. There was a ne",1929,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. For the first quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $312 million or $0.40 per diluted share. There was a net benefit in the quarter of $0.03 per share, resulting from the gains on the Vantiv warrants and branch sales, offset partially by the cost of the voluntary retirement program. We are pleased with the results, especially given challenging market conditions during the quarter. 
So let's move to the average balance sheet on Page 5 of the presentation. Average commercial loan balances were relatively flat sequentially, but up about 5% year-over-year. Our end of period balances were up by $1.5 billion or 3% sequentially. The decline in average balances was partly due to higher pay downs and delays in closings at the very end of last year. We experienced healthy activity in the latter half of the first quarter. Average consumer loans were down 1% from last quarter and up 1% year-over-year.
Residential mortgage loans grew by 2% sequentially as we continue to portfolio only jumbo mortgages and ARMs and up 11% year-over-year. Indirect auto loans are down 3% from last quarter and 5% year-over-year, in line with our lower origination targets and focus on improving returns in this business. The return profile of our first quarter production was one of the best in the last few years within the super-prime market that we mainly focus on. 
Average investment securities increased by $317 million in the first quarter or 1% sequentially. Average core deposits decreased $1 billion from the fourth quarter. This decrease was driven by seasonally lower demand deposits partially offset by higher interest checking balances. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 118% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving to NII on Page 6 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $5 million sequentially to $909 million, despite the negative day count impact. The increase was primarily driven by improvement in variable rate loan yields due to the increase in the fed funds rate in December, with deposit betas remaining at low levels. Quarter-over-quarter, our earning asset yield increased by 8 basis points accompanied by a 3 basis point increase in cost of interest-bearing liabilities. These benefits were partially offset by the effect of a reduced Fed stock dividend payment and continued spread compression from the mix shift to lower-yielding, higher-quality credits, which we've discussed previously. 
NII also benefited from the timing of the investments in the portfolio, as cash flows were invested earlier in the quarter and the late debt issuance during the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our NII growth over last quarter and the 7% growth year-over-year. NIM improved 6 basis points to 2.91% quarter-over-quarter.
Shifting to fees on Page 7 of the presentation. First quarter noninterest income was $637 million compared with $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Our fee income adjusted primarily for Vantiv-related items, and the annual $31 million TRA payment in the fourth quarter was $578 million, a decrease of $14 million or 2% sequentially. 
Despite seasonal headwinds and challenging market conditions, our results were strong. Corporate banking fees of $102 million were relatively flat sequentially and adjusted for the write-down of a residual lease in the first quarter of 2015 were up 10% year-over-year. 
As we mentioned in January, corporate banking fees are seasonally lower in the first quarter, and overall market conditions were weak during the quarter. So our performance was strong despite the challenging backdrop. 
Mortgage banking net revenue of $78 million was up $4 million sequentially. Originations were $1.8 billion in the first quarter, with 46% of the mix consisting of purchase volume. About 75% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels, and the remainder came through the correspondent channel. Gain on sale margins were up 57 basis points sequentially to 347 basis points, and net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $16 million similar to last quarter. 
Deposit service charges decreased 5% from the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonal trends in consumer deposit fees and increased 1% relative to the first quarter of 2015.
Total investment advisory revenue of $102 million was flat sequentially, mostly reflecting weaker equity market activity during the quarter. This impact was offset by seasonally higher trust tax preparation fees. Excluding certain onetime items, our year-over-year revenue growth reached nearly 5%, a very good outcome in a challenging environment.
Next, I would like to discuss noninterest expense on Page 8 of the presentation. Expenses were $986 million compared with $963 million in the fourth quarter. The sequential increase was partly due to seasonally higher FICA and employment insurance expense and a $14 million expense related to the voluntary early retirement program. The early retirement program was well received by our employees and approximately 160 employees participated. As a result, we expect a $9 million decrease in annual compensation expenses. 
As Greg said earlier, we continue to look for other similar opportunities to improve our expense run rate. I will provide an update on our expense outlook a little later.

Net charge-offs were $96 million or 42 basis points in the first quarter compared to $80 million and 34 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $91 million and 41 basis points in the first quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was due to a $16 million increase in C&I net charge-offs. Of the total net charge-offs, $9 million were in energy. Nonperforming loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased $195 million from the previous quarter to $701 million, resulting in an NPL ratio of 75 basis points.
Commercial NPLs increased $202 million from the fourth quarter, driven by $168 million in energy NPLs. Consumer NPLs declined by $7 million sequentially. 
Overall credit conditions, excluding energy, remained within our expectations. Consumer credit continues to improve, and commercial credit, excluding energy, is stable. Our provision was $23 million higher than the total charge-offs in the first quarter, and our reserve coverage moved up 1 basis point to 1.38% of loans and leases. It is important to note, as Greg mentioned, that an increase in energy NPLs should not necessarily translate into an increase in charge-offs of the same magnitude. This is because the majority of energy NPLs are well collateralized and consist of reserve-based loans.
On Slide 10, we have provided a breakdown of our energy portfolio. Our energy related loans at the end of the quarter were $1.7 billion with total commitments of $4 billion. As you can see, our loans to oilfield services companies were only $294 million or 17% of our total energy loans outstanding and leaves only $170 million in the unused commitments. 
We believe that we are appropriately reserved for losses in the energy portfolio based on detailed stress analysis that our teams continue to update not only on the oilfield services portfolio but also on our reserve-based loans. 
Based on detailed analysis, we believe that our energy reserves, which are currently at 6.2%, up from 4.8% at the end of last year, are adequate. Our stress case scenario over a 9 quarter period assumes that oil prices will be at $20 in 2016 and $25 in 2017.  This stress scenario would add approximately $50 million to $60 million in net charge-offs over and above our current reserves.
On Slide 11, we provide a breakdown of our commercial real estate portfolio. It is important to note that our commercial real estate business today is much different than what we had precrisis. At the end of 2007, 21% of our total loans and leases were in commercial real estate. Today, we are at 11% below our peer levels.
At the end of 2007, over 40% of our nonowner-occupied exposure was in land and residential developers. Today, that exposure is slightly above 4%. As you can see, our nonperforming assets continue to decrease, both within the commercial mortgage and commercial construction portfolios.
At the end of the first quarter, NPAs in our commercial mortgage portfolio decreased to 1.84% from 2.56% a year earlier. NPAs in our commercial construction portfolio decreased to 23 basis points from 67 basis points over the same period. During the last 2 years, we significantly upgraded our credit resources in commercial mortgage and construction underwriting, which increased our focus on client selection, geographical diversity and multifactor stress analysis.
Moving on to capital on Slide 12. Our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.8%, an increase of 30 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the first quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately $15 million. During the quarter, we announced and settled a common stock repurchase of $240 million and reduced the first quarter's share count by 14.5 million shares.
Now moving to outlook. The drivers of our overall outlook remain unchanged. We expect year-over-year commercial loan growth to exceed 3% and the consumer loan portfolio to decline. The decline of our consumer loan portfolio will primarily reflect lower auto loan originations, as we had previously discussed, and includes the impact of the sales associated with the St. Louis and Pittsburgh transactions. 
Our interest rate outlook now has only one rate increase in June as opposed to the 2 increases that we had in our original base case. For the second quarter, we would expect relatively stable net interest income compared with the first quarter. But despite 1 late -- less rate increase, we still expect a 2.5% to 3% increase in NII year-over-year. In our base case, we would expect to see a 3 to 4 basis point of NIM decline in the second quarter and then hold relatively steady in line with our results in 2015. 
Although deposit betas are expected to remain low, our outlook assumes incremental spread compression due to our continued emphasis on originating higher quality loans. This update improves upon our January guidance as it includes 1 less rate increase. Without a rate increase, we would expect NII to grow around 2%.
Our overall fee income growth outlook is not changing. We expect to grow our fees between 4% and 5% on the 2015 base of $2.3 billion, which excludes Vantiv share and warrant gains that we had during the year. We are lowering our year-over-year expense outlook from 4.5% to 5% to the 4% to 4.25% range. We believe that our intense focus on expense control will result in an improvement in operating efficiency compared to our January expectations.
The quarterly run rate will increase from the first quarter levels, and this will reflect seasonality and the timing of implementation of strategic initiatives. But we will have better year-over-year yield results than originally expected. Our second quarter results will also include a onetime approximately $10 million expense as a result of retirement eligibility changes related to long-term incentive compensation. These changes will align our retirement eligibility provisions with our peer group. This is just a change in the timing of the recognition of expenses and would lower our expense going forward. We continue to monitor our energy exposures closely. It is likely that we will see higher charge-offs in this portfolio, primarily in the oilfield services sector. Given the relatively modest size of our exposure, future credit losses should be manageable. Credit losses, ex energy, should remain in range, with some potential variability quarter-to-quarter due to the historically low level of current charge-offs. 
With that, let me open the call for questions."

As we reported, the nonperforming assets are up in the quarter, almost all of that is energy related -- 90-plus percent is energy related. It's all tied to reserve-based lending loans, settled [ph] loans, we feel very confident at this point that those loans are protected by the risk adjustment collateral coverage that we have in place. All borrowers in this segment that are on NPL that were just moved are current, I think that's important. The regulators, as you probably heard on that earnings call, have taken a much stricter view on how they are classifying these loans from the accounting perspective. They are looking to cover both the first and the second lien positions on these companies. In our case, we have a super secured first-lien position, and we've gone through a very detailed portfolio analysis that bottoms up of all of our energy book to ensure they're from a borrowing base perspective, we're well secured. So NPLs are up. However, it's in the segment that's very well protected from a collateral position, but historically, they're based on a current outlook. We could see additional deterioration from an energy perspective in NPL, given that in the future as Tayfun indicated. But we are not changing our outlook on overall credit losses. Beyond that, when you look at the rest of the portfolio now, again, we talked this morning about commercial real estate. We feel very good about that book. The performance is holding up very well. We have very little exposure in commercial real estate in the energy states. We have 4 multifamily credits that are in Houston, 2 of which are stabilized, the other 2 are performing under construction according to the terms that we've set. And we have some exposure in Denver from a commercial real estate perspective, but that market is held up very well not being in an energy sector. So the overall commercial real estate book at this point is performing to our expectations. Our middle market book is performing very well. We're showing a very strong performance in most of our core markets. We're are not concerned there. Our leverage book is stable. We'll have some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter and leverage, but overall it's performing to our expectations as well. I hope that was responsive to your question."

We also -- as I had mentioned before, we offered an early retirement program. We are very focused on expense management, but we're also focused on making the strategic investments that we have to make going forward that we hope and we anticipate, we'll continue to drive revenue, improve our operating efficiencies, improve our service quality. We're going to make those investments. We want to do those at the best price points so we're sharpening the pencil, pulsing on how we spend that money to make sure that we get the return we're looking for. We're very much focused on the execution of those initiatives and driving to the outcomes. So going forward, we've guided lower on expenses that we initially anticipated for this year, albeit still at 4%. We need to be lower than that obviously. We need to create positive operating leverage, and that's what we're focused on. And hopefully, as we go into this latter part of this year, we'll turn to positive operating leverage."

We have a good history of managing expenses in this organization, and we'll continue that history going forward. But we have to invest to replatform of our infrastructure, which we're delaying and we'll get paid well for that.

As you can see on Page 3 of the presentation, we reported second quarter net income to common shareholders of $310 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.40. Some offsetting noncore items resulted in a $0.01 negative impact to earnings per share in the quarter. 
Since I became CEO in November of 2015, I reaffirmed the bank's key strategic priorities. These include growing fee revenue, streamlining processes to reduce expenses and improving our customer experience and investing for the future in order to deliver strong results from the business cycles. I believe we have the right strategies in place, our second quarter financial results reflect the progress we are making towards those goals. 
Our Q2 results were solid, especially concerning the marketable total experience during the quarter. In addition, we are very pleased with the credit results. Fee income levels, including corporate banking fees, were also strong. As you know, we have been building out our capital markets capabilities for the last few years. We recently hired a team to further expand our M&A and strategic advisory services. Our investments are paying off as we continue to gain market share with our expanded set of differentiated products and services. Also, our mortgage volume of $2.7 billion was up 53% sequentially. This represents the highest level since the third quarter of 2013. 
Net interest income was relatively stable in Q2, which was in line with our expectations and guidance. NII results reflect growth in commercial loans of 2% and 1% growth in security balances, along with disciplined loan pricing and targeted relationship management. 
Origination yields in our all own business improved compared to Q1, reflecting our decision to reject loans more respectively in that business. 
Also, as we had mentioned previously, we have bee n managing deposit rates tightly, and we expect that to continue in this environment. We have planned on managing through the extended period of low interest rates. With the follow up from Brexit, we are even more confident that, that was the right approach. We've been very deliberate by growing fee revenue in order to mitigate the impact of lower interest rates. We have continued to maintain a steadying cost strategy with respect to rate risk. Given our focus on our focus on outperformers in the cycle, we are better positioned to address market volatility and economic uncertainty than any point in the bank's recent history. We remain focused on executing our strategies and continue to make significant progress. We recently closed on the sale of the branches in Pennsylvania, which resulted in an $11 million pretax gain. As the consumer landscape evolves, we will continue to look for more opportunities to optimize our branch network. 
We are also making investments to enhance our digital and operational capabilities. For example, we recently hired Melissa Stevens as our Chief Digital Officer and Head of Omni-channel Banking and Steve [indiscernible] as Head of Innovation. 
Our investments in digital channel are paying off. In the second quarter, approximately 20% of consumer deposits were made via our mobile app compared to 16% a year ago. In general, we have seen a 20% increase in mobile usage year-over-year. 
We also saw 135% increase in year-over-year in checking and savings accounts opened online. We expect our investments to drive higher digital adoption and creating more integrated customer experience. 
Also in the quarter, we sold a small nonstrategic agent and credit card portfolio at a 12% premium. This allows us to continue to focus our energies on our core credit card business. 
As you may have seen, we recently signed an agreement for the third party to help consolidate our Residential Mortgage loan systems under 1 platform. This initiative will help streamline our mortgage processes and operations and improve customer closure times and significantly improve the over customer experience. As we previously disclosed, we expect this investment to generate a full run rate benefit of $12 million annually. 
The strategic initiatives we shared with you in April are on track. We are actually implementing them in a more cost-effective manner than we had initially projected. As a result of our strong execution of focus on expense management, we now expect year-over-year expense growth of 4% in 2016 compared to our guidance of 4.5% to 5% at the start of this year. 
Over time, as we realize the benefits benefit these initiatives, we would expect annual expense growth to be well below 4%. The continued execution of our key initiatives will also support our longer-range targets, including a 12% to 14% core ROTCE ratio and a 1.1% to 1.3% ROA ratio. 
Finally, we recently entered into a couple of significant transactions with Vantiv. First, we extended our process agreement with Vantiv through 2024. This agreement was previously set to expire in June of 2019. We are pleased with our new agreement as it would generate a meaningful level of revenue benefits and cost savings from the second half of 2016 onward. 
In addition, we entered into another agreement with Vantiv related to roughly $800 million of existing TRA cash flows. We terminated and settled certain cash flows totaling $331 million over 18 years for an upfront payment of $116 million. We also have the option to terminate and settle another $394 million of future cash flows at prespecified amounts through the end of 2018. I am pleased that we have reached this agreement that reduces future risk and enable us to monetize and redeploy that capital. Tayfun will provide further detail in his commentary. 
We have discussed our reference to reduce our risk exposures as a necessary aspect of delivering consisting returns through the cycle. As of June 30, our exposure to companies in the U.K. and other European countries represent less than 2% of our total loans. It consists mostly of exposure to large global businesses that are well diversified. Leading up to the Brexit vote, we engaged with our clients to assess any potential impact on our business. As a result, we reduced our direct exposure in advance of the vote. Therefore, we believe our exposure to any fall from Brexit should be limited. 
In terms of our exposure to the energy sector, we continue to believe that our risk is well contained. Oil prices in Q2 increased relative to Q1. In our energy NPLs remain essentially flat. We are comfortable with our credit loss exposure in this portfolio. 
We also note there as been an increased concern about growth in commercial real estate loans. As we have mentioned in prior calls, we had a lower mix of CRE relative to peers. Additionally, our growth in absolute dollars is lower compared to many of our peers. Our disciplined client selection and centralized loan underwriting process is designed to ensure that we have a consistent and conservative approach to making CRE loans. 
Moving on to capital. I'm very pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2016 CCAR plan. The 2016 plan allows us to invest realized gains from Vantiv share sales and realized gains from the monetization of the Vantiv TRA into share repurchases. We believe the economics are doing so are favorable. We will continue to evaluate to use cash proceeds for share repurchases. The CCAR plan demonstrates our ability to generate and return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. Additionally, it demonstrates our ability to withstand severely stressful economic conditions, while remaining well-capitalized. Our capital levels remains strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio reached 9.94%, an improvement from 9.81% at the end of the first quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter operating results and our current outlook."

Our corporate banking revenues were solid and",2370,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's start with a financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. Overall, we are pleased with our core results despite the challenging environment. Our corporate banking revenues were solid and mortgage originations have outpaced peers, as well as the overall industry, in the second quarter. We are deploying capital in businesses where return targets meet our long-term goals and are making good progress in executing on our strategic plans. As we shared with you previously, these projects were carefully [indiscernible] to minimize reliance on an improved economic environment. Operating leverage is the top priority, with a strong emphasis on sustainable expense control without weakening our businesses strength and growing revenues. 
For the second quarter, there was a net negative impact of $0.01 per share resulting from several items. The most significant item was a charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap, which was due to the rejection of the merchant litigation settlement. 
So with that, let's move to Page 5 for the balance sheet discussion. Average commercial loan balances increased 2% sequentially and about 4% year-over-year. We achieved this growth with stabilizing spreads, while repositioning the balance sheet for better risk-adjusted returns. C&I loans contributed nearly 80% of the total sequential growth in average commercial balances. CRE growth of $199 million made up the majority of the remaining quarterly balance increase. Our CRE portfolio as a percentage of total commercial loans is one of the lowest among our regional peers. 
In construction, as well as in lending, our teams are cognizant of valuations and supply demand dynamics created by the lack of attractive investment alternatives. As Greg mentioned, our disciplined client selection and credit underwriting in CRE will continue to rely on stringent standards. 
Average consumer loans were down 1% from last quarter and down 1% year-over-year. Residential Mortgage loans grew by 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year as we cap jumbo mortgages and ARMs on our balance sheet during the quarter. Our Residential Mortgage originations were up 53% from last quarter and 7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 54% of our originations consisted of purchase volumes. 
Indirect auto loans were down 4% from last quarter and 9% year-over-year, in line with our lower origination targets and focus on improving risk-adjusted returns in this business. The profile of our second quarter production was consistent with the first quarter. 
Our home equity loan portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, as loan paydowns continue to exceed originations. Our investment securities increased by $390 million in the second quarter or 1% sequentially. 
Average core deposits increased $258 million from the first quarter. This increase was driven by seasonally higher demand deposit and money market account balances, partially offset by lower interest checking balances. Average core deposit balances were negatively impacted by approximately $201 million due to the previously disclosed sale of branches in Pennsylvania and $219 million due to the full quarter impact of the sale of branches in St. Louis last quarter. Excluding these deposits sold and the branch transactions over the last 2 quarters, average core deposits were up 1% on a sequential basis. 
Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 110% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving to NII on Page 6 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by $1 million sequentially to $908 million. The decrease was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of $1.5 billion of unsecured debt issued in the first quarter of 2016 and from lower auto and home equity loan balances. The decrease was partially offset by growth in commercial loans and securities. The NIM decreased 3 basis points to 2.88% quarter-over-quarter driven by the full quarter impact of the debt issuance in the first quarter. We had previously guided to a decrease of 3 to 4 basis points in the net interest margin in the second quarter and guided to relative stability off those levels in the latter half of the year, assuming a June Fed rate increase, which did not occur. With no Fed moves during the remainder of the year, we now expect a 2 to 4 basis point NIM contraction in the third quarter, which includes the full quarter impact of our second quarter debt issuance as well as a 1 basis point impact due to the account. We will continue to execute a balanced interest risk management strategy as we have over the last 3 years. We will be able to mitigate some of the negative impact of the flatter yield curve with lockout cash flow and both securities that now constitutes approximately 50% of our investment portfolio. 
Despite the NIM contraction, we are forecasting a stable NII for the second half of the year. For the full year, our balanced management approach will enable us to growth NII 2% despite the ongoing challenges with a low rate environment. 
Shifting to fees on Page 7 of the presentation. Second quarter noninterest income was $599 million compared with $637 million in the first quarter. Our fee income adjusted for items I previously mentioned was $602 million, an increase of $24 million or 4% sequentially. Despite challenging market conditions, our results were strong. 
Corporate banking fees of $117 million were up $15 million or 15% sequentially, reflecting increases in loan syndication revenue and institutional sales revenue. The growth in corporate revenues is indicative of the scope and scale of our product offering and relationship-driven target operating model that we are executing. 
Mortgage originations were $2.7 billion in the second quarter, with 54% of the mix consisting of purchase volume. About 75% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels and the remainder from the corresponding channel. Gains on sale were up 29% quarter-over-quarter with robust origination volume as the gain on sale margin was down 85 basis points. 
Mortgage banking net revenue of $75 million was down $3 million sequentially, primarily due to servicing asset amortization as a result of high refis in the servicing portfolio. The net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $29 million compared to negative $16 million last quarter. 
Deposit service charges increased 1% from the first quarter, reflecting seasonal trends in consumer deposit fees and decreased 1% relative to the second quarter of 2015. 
Total wealth and asset management revenue of $101 million decreased 1% sequentially, reflecting seasonally lower trust tax preparation fees from the first quarter. As you may recall, our previous -- our prior guidance callid for a 4% to 5% annual fee growth over reported 2015 fees, excluding impacts from Vantiv share sales and warrant valuation adjustments, which was approximately $2.3 billion. Excluding Vantiv-related items and the Visa total return swap adjustment this quarter and any potential Vantiv-related gains, we expect to grow our fees 5% as a result of a strong first half and the expectation of continued strength during the next 2 quarters. 
Next, I'd like to discuss noninterest expense in Page 8 of the presentation. Expenses of $983 million were $3 million lower than in the first quarter, reflecting a seasonal decrease in FICA and unemployment expense, partially offset by a $9 million expense due to retirement eligibility changes. First quarter's results were also impacted by a $14 million expense related to the voluntary early retirement program. 
As Greg said earlier, we are making good progress in executing on key strategic initiatives and managing our expenses. We now expect expenses to grow at a 4% level, slightly below our April guidance. This guidance includes the impact of the higher FDIC assessments. I also would like to remind you that our guidance includes the impact of increased amortization of our low income housing investments, which most of our peers reflect in their tax line, the increase in the provision for unfunded commitments and the impact of onetime benefits related to the settlement of legal cases in 2015. These 3 items make up roughly 2% of the forecasted 4% increase in expenses. 
As I mentioned earlier, operating leverage is our top priority going into 2017. Although we are taking a cautious approach to maintain our franchises strength and growing revenues, there are a number of identified areas that we are focusing on that I would like to review with you. We plan to gauge third parties in some areas to optimize our savings. 
The first is the end-to-end commercial loan origination, underwriting and servicing process. This is a natural area of attention given the size of our commercial business. In addition to cost efficiencies, we also believe that our work here will have significant positive impact on client service quality. Similarly, we are looking at opportunities in central operations. With new senior management in place, we have identified consolidation opportunities in our facilities and believe that we will be able to extract more savings going forward. 
This morning, we announced a 5.5-year extension to our operating agreement with Vantiv. The new agreement will reflect reduced expenses for Fifth Third and enhance revenue opportunities that both companies enjoy in this mutually beneficial partnership. We will continue to look for opportunities across the board in all of our vendor relationships. We also believe that our significant offshore presence will continue to be a source of savings in all of our business operations, including our risk and compliance areas. The long-term performance targets that Greg reviewed require a focus and disciplined approach to expense management, and we are confident we can execute. 
Turning to credit results on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were $87 million or 37 basis points in the second quarter compared to $96 million and 42 basis points in the first quarter of 2016 and $86 million and 37 basis points in the second quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was primarily due to a $7 million decline in C&I net charge-offs. Of the total net charge-offs, less than $2 million were in energy. 
Nonperforming loans, excluding loans held-for-sale, were $693 million, down $8 million from the previous quarter, resulting in an NPL ratio of 74 basis points. 
Overall, credit metrics remain strong. While there may be volatility in credit metrics [indiscernible], our portfolio's performing in line with our expectations. Our provision was $4 million higher than total charge-offs, and our reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases was unchanged at 1.38%. 
Relative to our peer group, our NPA net charge-off and reserve ratios compare favorably. Our previous guidance that net charge-offs would be range bound with some quarterly variability is unchanged. Also, we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth. 
On Slide 10, given the recent events overseas, we have provided a breakdown of our U.K. and European exposure. As Greg already mentioned in his earlier remarks, our second quarter U.K. exposure is minimal at less than 2% of total loans. We do not anticipate any significant issues from our portfolio, which is diversified and consists primarily of loans to large corporate customers. 
Moving on to capital on Slide 11. Our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.9%, an increase of 52 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the second quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately 4 million. During the quarter, we executed open market share repurchases of $26 million, which reduced the share count by 1.44 million shares. This completed our previous CCAR repurchase activity. 
On Slide 12, as Greg mentioned earlier, we recently entered into another agreement with Vantiv related to our roughly $800 million of expected TRA cash flows. This transaction mitigates future risk related to these cash flows and enables us to reinvest the realized gains into share buybacks. As we discussed with you many times in the past, our ability to realize these cash flows over the next 15-plus years depends on factors, such as U.S. corporate tax rates and Vantiv's taxable income levels. With that in mind, at the end of last year, we terminated and settle the portion of these future cash flows, and this week, we executed another agreement for a termination and settlement of $331 million in cash flows for an upfront payment of $116 million. 
In addition, under a quarterly put call structure owned by Fifth Third and Vantiv, respectively, we will have the ability to terminate and settle another $394 million of future cash flows for a total of $171 million payable to Fifth Third in 2017 and in 2018 in 8 separate quarterly optional executions. We have essentially locked in the ability to receive a minimum of approximately $15 million per quarter in 2017 and $26 million per quarter in 2018. This transaction will require an upfront asset booked on our balance sheet this quarter as it essentially removes the contingencies associated with these future cash flows. 
I would like to remind you that we will also receive our annual normal payments this year and next year. These CRA flows are related to all shares sales executed up to this point. There is roughly an additional $1 billion in future TRA flows related to future potential sales of our current ownership at the current Vantiv share price. We believe that our actions around the Vantiv relationship are in the best interest of our shareholders. 
Relative to CCAR 2016, the Federal Reserve's review is complete, and we received a nonobjection to our capital plan. Our capital plan includes the ability to increase the quarterly common stock dividends to $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2016, the repurchase of common shares, an amount up to $660 million, and the ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any realized after-tax gains from the sale of Vantiv stock. 
Additionally, this year, our capital plan now also includes the ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any realized after-tax gains from the termination of any portion of the Vantiv tax receivable agreement we just discussed. We believe our results demonstrate the relative strength of our -- both our capital position and our internal capital generation capacity. 
We have included the overall outlook on Slide 13 for your reference. And with that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A."

We're not as susceptible to this low rate environment over the next few quarters.

As you can see on Page 3 of the presentation, we reported second quarter net income to common shareholders of $310 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.40. Some offsetting non-core items resulted in a $0.01 negative impact to earnings per share in the quarter. 
Since I became CEO in November of 2015, I have reaffirmed the bank's key strategic priorities. These include growing fee revenue, streamlining processes to reduce expenses, improving our customer experience and investing for the future in order to deliver strong results through business cycles. I believe we have the right strategies in place. Our second quarter financial results reflect the progress we are making towards those goals. 
Our Q2 results were solid, especially considering the market volatility we experienced during the quarter. In addition, we were very pleased with the credit results. Fee income levels, including corporate banking fees, were also strong. As you know, we have been building out our capital markets capabilities for the last few years. We recently hired a team to further expand our M&A and strategic advisory services. Our investments are paying off as we continue to gain market share with our expanded set of differentiated products and services. Also, our mortgage volume of $2.7 billion was up 53% sequentially. This represented the highest level since the third quarter of 2013. 
Net interest income was relatively stable in Q2, which was in line with our expectations and guidance. NII results reflect growth in commercial loans of 2% and 1% growth in security balances, along with disciplined loan pricing and targeted relationship management. 
Origination yields in our auto loan business improved compared to Q1, reflecting our decision to originate loans more selectively in that business. 
Also, as we have mentioned previously, we have been managing deposit rates tightly, and we expect that to continue in this environment. We have planned on managing through an extended period of low interest rates. With the fall-off from Brexit, we are even more confident that, that was the right approach. We have been very deliberate about growing fee revenue in order to mitigate the impact of lower interest rates. 
We have continued to maintain a steady and cautious strategy with respect to rate risk. Given our focus on outperformance through the cycle, we are better positioned to address market volatility and economic uncertainty than any point in the bank's recent history. 
We remain focused on executing our strategies and continue to make significant progress. We recently closed on the sale of the branches in Pennsylvania, which resulted in the $11 million pretax gain. As the consumer landscape evolves, we will continue to look for more opportunities to optimize our branch network. 
We are also making investments to enhance our digital and operational capabilities. For example, we recently hired Melissa Stevens as our Chief Digital Officer and Head of Omni-channel Banking; and Steve D'Amico as Head of Innovation. 
Our investments in the digital channel are paying off. In the second quarter, approximately 20% of consumer deposits were made via our mobile app compared to 16% a year ago. In general, we have seen a 28% increase in mobile usage year-over-year. 
We also saw a 135% increase in year-over-year in checking and savings accounts opened online. We expect our investments to drive higher digital adoption and create a more integrated customer experience. 
Also in the quarter, we sold a small nonstrategic agented card portfolio at a 12% premium. This allows us to continue to focus our energies on our core credit card business. 
As you may have seen, we recently signed an agreement with a third party to help consolidate our Residential Mortgage loan systems under one platform. This initiative will help streamline our mortgage processes and operations, improve customer closure times and significantly improve the overall customer experience. As we've previously disclosed, we expect this investment to generate a full run rate benefit of $12 million annually. 
The strategic initiatives we shared with you in April are on track. We are actually implementing them in a more cost-effective manner than we had initially projected. As a result of our strong execution of focus on expense management, we now expect year-over-year expense growth of 4% in 2016 compared to our guidance of 4.5% to 5% at the start of this year. 
Over time, as we realize the benefits of implementing these initiatives, we would expect annual expense growth to be well below 4%. The continued execution of our key initiatives will also support our longer-range targets, including a 12% to 14% core ROTCE ratio and a 1.1% to 1.3% ROA ratio. 
Finally, we recently entered into a couple of significant transactions with Vantiv. First, we extended our processing agreement with Vantiv through 2024. This agreement was previously set to expire in June of 2019. We are pleased with our new agreement as it would generate a meaningful level of revenue benefits and cost savings from the second half of 2016 onward. 
In addition, we entered into another agreement with Vantiv related to our roughly $800 million of existing TRA cash flows. We terminated and settled certain cash flows totaling $331 million over 18 years for an upfront payment of $116 million. We also have the option to terminate and settle another $394 million of future cash flows at prespecified amounts through the end of 2018. I am pleased that we have reached this agreement that reduces future risk and enables us to monetize and redeploy that capital. Tayfun would provide further detail in his commentary. 
We have discussed our efforts to reduce our risk exposures as a necessary aspect of delivering consistent returns through the cycle. As of June 30, our exposure to companies in the U.K. and other European countries represent less than 2% of our total loans. It consisted mostly of exposure to large global businesses that are well-diversified. 
Leading up to the Brexit vote, we engaged with our clients to assess any potential impact on our business. As a result, we reduced our direct exposure in advance of the vote. Therefore, we believe our exposure to any fall from Brexit should be limited. 
In terms of our exposure to the energy sector, we continue to believe that our risk is well-contained. Oil prices in Q2 increased relative to Q1, and our energy NPLs remained essentially flat. We are comfortable with our credit loss exposure in this portfolio. 
We also know there has been an increased concern about growth in commercial real estate loans. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we had a lower mix of CRE relative to peers. Additionally, our growth in absolute dollars is lower compared to many of our peers. Our disciplined client selection and centralized loan underwriting process is designed to ensure that we have a consistent and conservative approach to making CRE loans. 
Moving on to capital. I'm very pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2016 CCAR plan. The 2016 plan allows us to invest realized gains from Vantiv share sales and realized gains from the monetization of the Vantiv TRA into share repurchases. We believe the economics of doing so are favorable, and we will continue to evaluate the use cash proceeds for share repurchases. The CCAR plan demonstrates our ability to generate and return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. 
Additionally, it demonstrates our ability to withstand severely stressful economic conditions, while remaining well-capitalized. Our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio reached 9.94%, an improvement from 9.81% at the end of the first quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter operating results and our current outlook."

Overall, we are pleased with our core results despite the challenging environment. Our corporate banking revenues were solid and mortgage originations have outpaced peers as well as the overall industry in the second quarter. 
We are deploying capital in businesses where our return targets meet our long-term goals and are making good progress in executing on our strategic plans. As we shared with you previously, these projects were carefully vetted to minimize reliance on an improved economic environment. Operating leverage is the top priority, with a strong emphasis on sustainable expense control without weakening our business' strength and growing revenues. 
For the second quarter, there was a net negative impact of $0.01 per share resulting from several items. The most significant item was a charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap, which was due to the rejection of the merchant litigation settlement. 
So with that, let's move to Page 5 for the balance sheet discussion. Average commercial loan balances increased 2% sequentially and about 4% year-over-year. We achieved this growth with stabilizing spreads, while repositioning the balance sheet for better risk-adjusted returns. C&I loans contributed nearly 80% of the total sequential growth in average commercial balances. CRE growth of $199 million made up the majority of the remaining quarterly balance increase. Our CRE portfolio as a percentage of total commercial loans is one of the lowest among our regional peers. 
In construction as well as in perm lending, our teams are cognizant of valuations and supply/demand dynamics created by the lack of attractive investment alternatives. As Greg mentioned, our disciplined client selection and credit underwriting in CRE will continue to rely on stringent standards. 
Average consumer loans were down 1% from last quarter and down 1% year-over-year. Residential Mortgage loans grew by 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year, as we kept jumbo mortgages and ARMs on our balance sheet during the quarter. Our Residential Mortgage originations were up 53% from last quarter and 7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 54% of our originations consisted of purchase volumes. 
Indirect auto loans were down 4% from last quarter and 9% year-over-year, in line with our lower origination targets and focus on improving risk-adjusted returns in this business. The profile of our second quarter production was consistent with the first quarter. 
Our home equity loan portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year as loan paydowns continue to exceed originations. Average investment securities increased by $390 million in the second quarter or 1% sequentially. 
Average core deposits increased $258 million from the first quarter. This increase was driven by seasonally higher demand deposit and money market account balances, partially offset by lower interest checking balances. Average core deposit balances were negatively impacted by approximately $201 million due to the previously disclosed sale of branches in Pennsylvania and $219 million due to the full quarter impact of the sale of branches in St. Louis last quarter. 
Excluding these deposits sold and the branch transactions over the last 2 quarters, average core deposits were up 1% on a sequential basis. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 110% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving to NII on Page 6 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by $1 million sequentially to $908 million. The decrease was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of $1.5 billion of unsecured debt issued in the first quarter of 2016 and from lower auto and home equity loan balances. The decrease was partially offset by growth in commercial loans and securities. 
The NIM decreased 3 basis points to 2.88% quarter-over-quarter driven by the full quarter impact of the debt issuance in the first quarter. We had previously guided to a decrease of 3 to 4 basis points in the net interest margin in the second quarter and guided to relative stability off those levels in the latter half of the year, assuming a June Fed rate increase, which did not occur. 
With no Fed moves during the remainder of the year, we now expect a 2- to 4-basis-point NIM contraction in the third quarter, which includes the full quarter impact of our second quarter debt issuance as well as a 1-basis-point impact due to day count. 
We will continue to execute a balanced interest risk management strategy as we have over the last 3 years. We will be able to mitigate some of the negative impact of the flatter yield curve with lockout cash flow and bullet securities that now constitute approximately 50% of our investment portfolio. 
Despite the NIM contraction, we are forecasting a stable NII for the second half of the year. For the full year, our balanced management approach will enable us to grow NII 2%, despite the ongoing challenges with the low-rate environment. 
Shifting to fees on Page 7 of the presentation. Second quarter noninterest income was $599 million compared with $637 million in the first quarter. Our fee income adjusted for items I previously mentioned was $602 million, an increase of $24 million or 4% sequentially. Despite challenging market conditions, our results were strong. 
Corporate banking fees of $117 million were up $15 million or 15% sequentially, reflecting increases in loan syndication revenue and institutional sales revenue. The growth in corporate revenues is indicative of the scope and scale of our product offering and relationship-driven target operating model that we are executing. 
Mortgage originations were $2.7 billion in the second quarter, with 54% of the mix consisting of purchase volume. About 75% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels and the remainder from the correspondent channel. Gains on sale were up 29% quarter-over-quarter, with robust origination volume as the gain on sale margin was down 85 basis points. 
Mortgage banking net revenue of $75 million was down $3 million sequentially, primarily due to servicing asset amortization as a result of high refis in the servicing portfolio. The net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $29 million compared to negative $16 million last quarter. 
Deposit service charges increased 1% from the first quarter, reflecting seasonal trends in consumer deposit fees and decreased 1% relative to the second quarter of 2015. Total wealth and asset management revenue of $101 million decreased 1% sequentially, reflecting seasonally lower trust tax preparation fees from the first quarter. 
As you may recall, our previous -- our prior guidance called for a 4% to 5% annual fee growth over reported 2015 fees, excluding impacts from Vantiv share sales and warrant valuation adjustments, which was approximately $2.3 billion. Excluding Vantiv-related items and the Visa total return swap adjustment this quarter and any other potential Vantiv-related gains, we expect to grow our fees 5% as a result of a strong first half and the expectation of continued strength during the next 2 quarters. 
Next, I'd like to discuss noninterest expense in Page 8 of the presentation. Expenses of $983 million were $3 million lower than in the first quarter, reflecting a seasonal decrease in FICA and unemployment expense, partially offset by a $9 million expense due to retirement eligibility changes. First quarter's results were also impacted by a $14 million expense related to the voluntary early retirement program. 
As Greg said earlier, we are making good progress in executing on key strategic initiatives and managing our expenses. We now expect expenses to grow at a 4% level, slightly below our April guidance. This guidance includes the impact of the higher FDIC assessment. I also would like to remind you that our guidance includes the impact of increased amortization of our low income housing investments, which most of our peers reflect in their tax line; the increase in the provision for unfunded commitments; and the impact of onetime benefits related to the settlement of legal cases in 2015. These 3 items make up roughly 2% of the forecasted 4% increase in expenses. 
As I mentioned earlier, operating leverage is our top priority going into 2017. Although we are taking a cautious approach to maintain our franchise's strength in growing revenues, there are a number of identified areas that we are focusing on that I would like to review with you. We plan to engage third parties in some areas to optimize our savings. 
The first is the end-to-end commercial loan origination underwriting and servicing process. This is a natural area of attention given the size of our commercial business. In addition to cost efficiencies, we also believe that our work here will have significant positive impact on client service quality. 
Similarly, we are looking at opportunities in central operations. With new senior management in place, we have identified consolidation opportunities in our facilities and believe that we will be able to extract more savings going forward. 
This morning, we announced a 5.5-year extension to our operating agreement with Vantiv. The new agreement will reflect reduced expenses for Fifth Third and enhance revenue opportunities that both companies enjoy in this mutually beneficial partnership. We will continue to look for opportunities across the board in all of our vendor relationships. We also believe that our significant offshore presence will continue to be a source of savings in all of our business operations, including our risk and compliance areas. The long-term performance targets that Greg reviewed require a focused and disciplined approach to expense management, and we are confident we can execute. 
Turning to credit results on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were $87 million or 37 basis points in the second quarter compared to $96 million and 42 basis points in the first quarter of 2016 and $86 million and 37 basis points in the second quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was primarily due to a $7 million decline in C&I net charge-offs. Of the total net charge-offs, less than $2 million were in energy. 
Nonperforming loans, excluding loans held for sale, were $693 million, down $8 million from the previous quarter, resulting in an NPL ratio of 74 basis points. 
Overall, credit metrics remain strong. While there may be volatility in credit metrics periodically, our portfolio is performing in line with our expectations. Our provision was $4 million higher than total charge-offs, and our reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases, was unchanged at 1.38%. 
Relative to our peer group, our NPA net charge-off and reserve ratios compare favorably. Our previous guidance that net charge-offs would be range-bound with some quarterly variability is unchanged. Also, we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth. 
On Slide 10, given the recent events overseas, we have provided a breakdown of our U.K. and European exposure. As Greg already mentioned in his earlier remarks, our second quarter U.K. exposure is minimal at less than 2% of total loans. We do not anticipate any significant issues from our portfolio, which is diversified and consists primarily of loans to large corporate customers. 
Moving on to capital on Slide 11. Our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.9%, an increase of 52 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the second quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately 4 million. During the quarter, we executed open market share repurchases of $26 million, which reduced the share count by 1.44 million shares. This completed our previous CCAR repurchase activity. 
On Slide 12, as Greg mentioned earlier, we recently entered into another agreement with Vantiv related to our roughly $800 million of expected TRA cash flows. This transaction mitigates future risk related to these cash flows and enables us to reinvest the realized gains into share buybacks. 
As we've discussed with you many times in the past, our ability to realize these cash flows over the next 15-plus years depends on factors such as U.S. corporate tax rates and Vantiv's taxable income levels. With that in mind, at the end of last year, we terminated and settled a portion of these future cash flows. And this week, we executed another agreement for a termination and settlement of $331 million in cash flows for an upfront payment of $116 million. 
In addition, under a quarterly put/call structure owned by Fifth Third and Vantiv, respectively, we will have the ability to terminate and settle another $394 million of future cash flows for a total of $171 million payable to Fifth Third in 2017 and in 2018 in 8 separate quarterly optional executions. 
We have essentially locked in the ability to receive a minimum of approximately $15 million per quarter in 2017 and $26 million per quarter in 2018. This transaction will require an upfront asset booked on our balance sheet this quarter as it essentially removes the contingencies associated with these future cash flows. 
I would like to remind you that we will also receive our annual normal payments this year and next year. These TRA flows are related to all share sales executed up to this point. There is roughly an additional $1 billion in future TRA flows related to future potential sales of our current ownership at the current Vantiv share price. We believe that our actions around the Vantiv relationship are in the best interest of our shareholders. 
Relative to CCAR 2016, the Federal Reserve's review is complete, and we received a non-objection to our capital plan. Our capital plan includes the ability to increase the quarterly common stock dividends to $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2016; the repurchase of common shares, an amount up to $660 million; and the ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any realized after-tax gains from the sale of Vantiv stock. 
Additionally, this year, our capital plan now also includes the ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any realized after-tax gains from the termination of any portion of the Vantiv tax receivable agreement we just discussed. We believe our results demonstrate the relative strength of our -- both our capital position and our internal capital generation capacity. We have included the overall outlook on Slide 13 for your reference. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A."

If you look across all of our business, all of our verticals, we're seeing some excellent growth. We're continuing to expand those. We're seeing growth across our core, middle market franchise.

But overall, we're pleased with how we've positioned the securities portfolios, as Tayfun mentioned, the bullet and locked out cash flows. We're not as susceptible to this low rate environment over the next few quarters. But if this environment were to continue for an extended period of time, then it would be more challenging to have stable NIM. But at least over the foreseeable future, we feel like we've positioned the book as well as we could for this lower-for-longer environment. We've talked to you guys about that over the past 2 years as we built the securities portfolio. And then the one factor you haven't heard from us over the past couple of quarters is the fact that loan yield compression just really hasn't been a factor in our NIM.

We are -- when you look at our price decks and when you look at our -- all of our scenarios that we run from pace [ph] to stress, the price of oil is well above that. So I don't think there's going to be near as much noise depending on where price moves between now and then. We moved 8 credits over in the first quarter that were all but one reserve-based credits to non accrual, and we had very little, if any, loss forecast from those credits. Our portfolio is stable at this point. And as you know, our portfolio was only 2% of our total book. It's small. It's fairly nominal. We manage it very well, we manage it through our vertical.

As you can see on Page 3 of the presentation, we reported second quarter net income to common shareholders of $310 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.40. Some offsetting non-core items resulted in a $0.01 negative impact to earnings per share in the quarter. 
Since I became CEO in November of 2015, I have reaffirmed the bank's key strategic priorities. These include growing fee revenue, streamlining processes to reduce expenses, improving our customer experience and investing for the future in order to deliver strong results through business cycles. I believe we have the right strategies in place. Our second quarter financial results reflect the progress we are making towards those goals. 
Our Q2 results were solid, especially considering the market volatility we experienced during the quarter. In addition, we were very pleased with the credit results. Fee income levels, including corporate banking fees, were also strong. As you know, we have been building out our capital markets capabilities for the last few years. We recently hired a team to further expand our M&A and strategic advisory services. Our investments are paying off as we continue to gain market share with our expanded set of differentiated products and services. Also, our mortgage volume of $2.7 billion was up 53% sequentially. This represented the highest level since the third quarter of 2013. 
Net interest income was relatively stable in Q2, which was in line with our expectations and guidance. NII results reflect growth in commercial loans of 2% and 1% growth in security balances, along with disciplined loan pricing and targeted relationship management. 
Origination yields in our auto loan business improved compared to Q1, reflecting our decision to originate loans more selectively in that business. 
Also, as we have mentioned previously, we have been managing deposit rates tightly, and we expect that to continue in this environment. We have planned on managing through an extended period of low interest rates. With the fall-off from Brexit, we are even more confident that, that was the right approach. We have been very deliberate about growing fee revenue in order to mitigate the impact of lower interest rates. 
We have continued to maintain a steady and cautious strategy with respect to rate risk. Given our focus on outperformance through the cycle, we are better positioned to address market volatility and economic uncertainty than any point in the bank's recent history. 
We remain focused on executing our strategies and continue to make significant progress. We recently closed on the sale of the branches in Pennsylvania, which resulted in a $11 million pretax gain. As the consumer landscape evolves, we will continue to look for more opportunities to optimize our branch network. 
We are also making investments to enhance our digital and operational capabilities. For example, we recently hired Melissa Stevens as our Chief Digital Officer and Head of Omni-channel Banking; and Steve D'Amico as Head of Innovation. 
Our investments in the digital channel are paying off. In the second quarter, approximately 20% of consumer deposits were made via our mobile app compared to 16% a year ago. In general, we have seen a 28% increase in mobile usage year-over-year. 
We also saw a 135% increase in year-over-year in checking and savings accounts opened online. We expect our investments to drive higher digital adoption and create a more integrated customer experience. 
Also in the quarter, we sold a small nonstrategic agented credit card portfolio at a 12% premium. This allows us to continue to focus our energies on our core credit card business. 
As you may have seen, we recently signed an agreement with a third party to help consolidate our Residential Mortgage loan systems under one platform. This initiative will help streamline our mortgage processes and operations, improve customer closure times and significantly improve the overall customer experience. As we've previously disclosed, we expect this investment to generate a full run rate benefit of $12 million annually. 
The strategic initiatives we shared with you in April are on track. We are actually implementing them in a more cost-effective manner than we had initially projected. As a result of our strong execution and focus on expense management, we now expect year-over-year expense growth of 4% in 2016 compared to our guidance of 4.5% to 5% at the start of this year. 
Over time, as we realize the benefits of implementing these initiatives, we would expect annual expense growth to be well below 4%. The continued execution of our key initiatives will also support our longer-range targets, including a 12% to 14% core ROTCE ratio and a 1.1% to 1.3% ROA ratio. 
Finally, we recently entered into a couple of significant transactions with Vantiv. First, we extended our processing agreement with Vantiv through 2024. This agreement was previously set to expire in June of 2019. We are pleased with our new agreement as it will generate a meaningful level of revenue benefits and cost savings from the second half of 2016 onward. 
In addition, we entered into another agreement with Vantiv related to our roughly $800 million of existing TRA cash flows. We terminated and settled certain cash flows totaling $331 million over 18 years for an upfront payment of $116 million. We also have the option to terminate and settle another $394 million of future cash flows at prespecified amounts through the end of 2018. I am pleased that we have reached this agreement that reduces future risk and enables us to monetize and redeploy that capital. Tayfun would provide further detail in his commentary. 
We have discussed our efforts to reduce our risk exposures as a necessary aspect of delivering consistent returns through the cycle. As of June 30, our exposure to companies in the U.K. and other European countries represent less than 2% of our total loans. It consisted mostly of exposure to large global businesses that are well-diversified. 
Leading up to the Brexit vote, we engaged with our clients to assess any potential impact on our business. As a result, we reduced our direct exposure in advance of the vote. Therefore, we believe our exposure to any fall-out from Brexit should be limited. 
In terms of our exposure to the energy sector, we continue to believe that our risk is well-contained. Oil prices in Q2 increased relative to Q1, and our energy NPLs remained essentially flat. We are comfortable with our credit loss exposure in this portfolio. 
We also know there has been an increased concern about growth in commercial real estate loans. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we had a lower mix of CRE relative to peers. Additionally, our growth in absolute dollars is lower compared to many of our peers. Our disciplined client selection and centralized loan underwriting process is designed to ensure that we have a consistent and conservative approach to making CRE loans. 
Moving on to capital. I'm very pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2016 CCAR plan. The 2016 plan allows us to invest realized gains from Vantiv share sales and realized gains from the monetization of the Vantiv TRA into share repurchases. We believe the economics of doing so are favorable, and we will continue to evaluate the use cash proceeds for share repurchases. The CCAR plan demonstrates our ability to generate and return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. 
Additionally, it demonstrates our ability to withstand severely stressful economic conditions, while remaining well-capitalized. Our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio reached 9.94%, an improvement from 9.81% at the end of the first quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter operating results and our current outlook."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. Overall, we are pleased with our core results despite the challenging environment.

Overall, we are pleased with our core results despite the challenging environment. Our corporate banking revenues were solid and mortgage originations have outpaced peers as well as the overall industry in the second quarter. 
We are deploying capital in businesses where return targets meet our long-term goals and are making good progress in executing on our strategic plans. As we shared with you previously, these projects were carefully vetted to minimize reliance on an improved economic environment. Operating leverage is the top priority, with a strong emphasis on sustainable expense control without weakening our business' strength and growing revenues. 
For the second quarter, there was a net negative impact of $0.01 per share resulting from several items. The most significant item was a charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap, which was due to the rejection of the merchant litigation settlement. 
So with that, let's move to Page 5 for the balance sheet discussion. Average commercial loan balances increased 2% sequentially and about 4% year-over-year. We achieved this growth with stabilizing spreads, while repositioning the balance sheet for better risk-adjusted returns. C&I loans contributed nearly 80% of the total sequential growth in average commercial balances. CRE growth of $199 million made up the majority of the remaining quarterly balance increase. Our CRE portfolio as a percentage of total commercial loans is one of the lowest among our regional peers. 
In construction as well as in perm lending, our teams are cognizant of valuations and supply/demand dynamics created by the lack of attractive investment alternatives. As Greg mentioned, our disciplined client selection and credit underwriting in CRE will continue to rely on stringent standards. 
Average consumer loans were down 1% from last quarter and down 1% year-over-year. Residential Mortgage loans grew by 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year, as we kept jumbo mortgages and ARMs on our balance sheet during the quarter. Our Residential Mortgage originations were up 53% from last quarter and 7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 54% of our originations consisted of purchase volumes. 
Indirect auto loans were down 4% from last quarter and 9% year-over-year, in line with our lower origination targets and focus on improving risk-adjusted returns in this business. The profile of our second quarter production was consistent with the first quarter. 
Our home equity loan portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year as loan paydowns continued to exceed originations. Average investment securities increased by $390 million in the second quarter or 1% sequentially. 
Average core deposits increased $258 million from the first quarter. This increase was driven by seasonally higher demand deposit and money market account balances, partially offset by lower interest checking balances. Average core deposit balances were negatively impacted by approximately $201 million due to the previously disclosed sale of branches in Pennsylvania and $219 million due to the full quarter impact of the sale of branches in St. Louis last quarter. 
Excluding these deposits sold in the branch transactions over the last 2 quarters, average core deposits were up 1% on a sequential basis. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 110% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving to NII on Page 6 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by $1 million sequentially to $908 million. The decrease was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of $1.5 billion of unsecured debt issued in the first quarter of 2016 and from lower auto and home equity loan balances. The decrease was partially offset by growth in commercial loans and securities. 
The NIM decreased 3 basis points to 2.88% quarter-over-quarter driven by the full quarter impact of the debt issuance in the first quarter. We had previously guided to a decrease of 3 to 4 basis points in the net interest margin in the second quarter and guided to relative stability off those levels in the latter half of the year, assuming a June Fed rate increase, which did not occur. 
With no Fed moves during the remainder of the year, we now expect a 2- to 4-basis-point NIM contraction in the third quarter, which includes the full quarter impact of our second quarter debt issuance as well as a 1-basis-point impact due to day count. 
We will continue to execute a balanced interest rate risk management strategy as we have over the last 3 years. We will be able to mitigate some of the negative impact of the flatter yield curve with locked-out cash flow and bullet securities that now constitute approximately 50% of our investment portfolio. 
Despite the NIM contraction, we are forecasting a stable NII for the second half of the year. For the full year, our balanced management approach will enable us to grow NII 2%, despite the ongoing challenges with the low-rate environment. 
Shifting to fees on Page 7 of the presentation. Second quarter noninterest income was $599 million compared with $637 million in the first quarter. Our fee income, adjusted for items I previously mentioned, was $602 million, an increase of $24 million or 4% sequentially. Despite challenging market conditions, our results were strong. 
Corporate banking fees of $117 million were up $15 million or 15% sequentially, reflecting increases in loan syndication revenue and institutional sales revenue. The growth in corporate revenues is indicative of the scope and scale of our product offering and relationship-driven target operating model that we are executing. 
Mortgage originations were $2.7 billion in the second quarter, with 54% of the mix consisting of purchase volume. About 75% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels and the remainder from the correspondent channel. Gains on sale were up 29% quarter-over-quarter, with robust origination volume as the gain on sale margin was down 85 basis points. 
Mortgage banking net revenue of $75 million was down $3 million sequentially, primarily due to servicing asset amortization as a result of high refis in the servicing portfolio. The net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $29 million compared to negative $16 million last quarter. 
Deposit service charges increased 1% from the first quarter, reflecting seasonal trends in consumer deposit fees and decreased 1% relative to the second quarter of 2015. Total wealth and asset management revenue of $101 million decreased 1% sequentially, reflecting seasonally lower trust tax preparation fees from the first quarter. 
As you may recall, our previous -- our prior guidance called for 4% to 5% annual fee growth over reported 2015 fees, excluding impacts from Vantiv share sales and warrant valuation adjustments, which was approximately $2.3 billion. Excluding Vantiv-related items and the Visa total return swap adjustment this quarter and any other potential Vantiv-related gains, we expect to grow our fees 5% as a result of a strong first half and the expectation of continued strength during the next 2 quarters. 
Next, I'd like to discuss noninterest expense in Page 8 of the presentation. Expenses of $983 million were $3 million lower than in the first quarter, reflecting a seasonal decrease in FICA and unemployment expense, partially offset by a $9 million expense due to retirement eligibility changes. First quarter's results were also impacted by a $14 million expense related to the voluntary early retirement program. 
As Greg said earlier, we are making good progress in executing on key strategic initiatives and managing our expenses. We now expect expenses to grow at the 4% level, slightly below our April guidance. This guidance includes the impact of the higher FDIC assessment. I also would like to remind you that our guidance includes the impact of the increased amortization of our low income housing investments, which most of our peers reflect in their tax line; the increase in the provision for unfunded commitments; and the impact of onetime benefits related to the settlement of legal cases in 2015. These 3 items make up roughly 2% of the forecasted 4% increase in expenses. 
As I mentioned earlier, operating leverage is our top priority going into 2017. Although we are taking a cautious approach to maintain our franchise's strength in growing revenues, there are a number of identified areas that we are focusing on that I would like to review with you. We plan to engage third parties in some areas to optimize our savings. 
The first is the end-to-end commercial loan origination underwriting and servicing process. This is a natural area of attention given the size of our commercial business. In addition to cost efficiencies, we also believe that our work here will have significant positive impact on client service quality. 
Similarly, we are looking at opportunities in central operations. With new senior management in place, we have identified consolidation opportunities in our facilities and believe that we will be able to extract more savings going forward. 
This morning, we announced a 5.5-year extension to our operating agreement with Vantiv. The new agreement will reflect reduced expenses for Fifth Third and enhance revenue opportunities that both companies enjoy in this mutually beneficial partnership. We will continue to look for opportunities across the board in all of our vendor relationships. We also believe that our significant offshore presence will continue to be a source of savings in all of our business operations, including our risk and compliance areas. The long-term performance targets that Greg reviewed require a focused and disciplined approach to expense management, and we are confident we can execute. 
Turning to credit results on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were $87 million or 37 basis points in the second quarter compared to $96 million and 42 basis points in the first quarter of 2016 and $86 million and 37 basis points in the second quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was primarily due to a $7 million decline in C&I net charge-offs. Out of the total net charge-offs, less than $2 million were in energy. 
Nonperforming loans, excluding loans held for sale, were $693 million, down $8 million from the previous quarter, resulting in an NPL ratio of 74 basis points. 
Overall, credit metrics remain strong. While there may be volatility in credit metrics periodically, our portfolio is performing in line with our expectations. Our provision was $4 million higher than total charge-offs, and our reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases, was unchanged at 1.38%. 
Relative to our peer group, our NPA net charge-off and reserve ratios compare favorably. Our previous guidance that net charge-offs would be range-bound with some quarterly variability is unchanged. Also, we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth. 
On Slide 10, given the recent events overseas, we have provided a breakdown of our U.K. and European exposure. As Greg already mentioned in his earlier remarks, our second quarter U.K. exposure is minimal at less than 2% of total loans. We do not anticipate any significant issues from our portfolio, which is diversified and consists primarily of loans to large corporate customers. 
Moving on to capital on Slide 11. Our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.9%, an increase of 52 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the second quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately 4 million. During the quarter, we executed open market share repurchases of $26 million, which reduced the share count by 1.44 million shares. This completed our previous CCAR repurchase activity. 
On Slide 12, as Greg mentioned earlier, we recently entered into another agreement with Vantiv related to our roughly $800 million of expected TRA cash flows. This transaction mitigates future risk related to these cash flows and enables us to reinvest the realized gains into share buybacks. 
As we've discussed with you many times in the past, our ability to realize these cash flows over the next 15-plus years depends on factors such as U.S. corporate tax rates and Vantiv's taxable income levels. With that in mind, at the end of last year, we terminated and settled a portion of these future cash flows. And this week, we executed another agreement for a termination and settlement of $331 million in cash flows for an upfront payment of $116 million. 
In addition, under a quarterly put/call structure owned by Fifth Third and Vantiv, respectively, we will have the ability to terminate and settle another $394 million of future cash flows for a total of $171 million payable to Fifth Third in 2017 and in 2018 in 8 separate quarterly optional executions. 
We have essentially locked in the ability to receive a minimum of approximately $15 million per quarter in 2017 and $26 million per quarter in 2018. This transaction will require an upfront asset booked on our balance sheet this quarter as it essentially removes the contingencies associated with these future cash flows. 
I would like to remind you that we will also receive our annual normal payments this year and next year. These TRA flows are related to all share sales executed up to this point. There is roughly an additional $1 billion in future TRA flows related to future potential sales of our current ownership at the current Vantiv share price. We believe that our actions around the Vantiv relationship are in the best interest of our shareholders. 
Relative to CCAR 2016, the Federal Reserve's review is complete, and we received a non-objection to our capital plan. Our capital plan includes the ability to increase the quarterly common stock dividends to $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2016; the repurchase of common shares, an amount up to $660 million; and the ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any realized after-tax gains from the sale of Vantiv stock. 
Additionally, this year, our capital plan now also includes the ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any realized after-tax gains from the termination of any portion of the Vantiv tax receivable agreement we just discussed. We believe our results demonstrate the relative strength of our -- of both our capital position and our internal capital generation capacity. We have included the overall outlook on Slide 13 for your reference. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A."

But this is really about not overreaching and focusing on client selection. And that's -- we're going to focus on what we can control. And frankly,, we're doing that. If you look across all of our business, all of our verticals, we're seeing some excellent growth. We're continuing to expand those. We're seeing growth across our core, middle market franchise. That's very promising for us. So when we would expect to see any significant change in us relative to say H8 data, very difficult to tell, we're going to focus on what we can control, and that is building deep client relationships with attractive returns for our clients very deliberately so that we prudently use our capital and our liquidity.

But overall, we're pleased with how we've positioned the securities portfolios, as Tayfun mentioned, the bullet and locked-out cash flows. We're not as susceptible to this low rate environment over the next few quarters. But if this environment were to continue for an extended period of time, then it would be more challenging to have stable NIM. But at least over the foreseeable future, we feel like we've positioned the book as well as we could for this lower-for-longer environment. We've talked to you guys about that over the past 2 years as we built the securities portfolio. And then the one factor you haven't heard from us over the past couple of quarters is the fact that loan yield compression just really hasn't been a factor in our NIM. And given the pricing strategies and success that we've had executing on the loan side, we think we can continue to deliver a stable NIM as the loans come on the sheet at yields we're comfortable with."

As you can see on Page 3 of the presentation, we reported second quarter net income to common shareholders of $310 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.40. Some offsetting non-core items resulted in a $0.01 negative impact to earnings per share in the quarter. 
Since I became CEO in November of 2015, I have reaffirmed the bank's key strategic priorities. These include growing fee revenue, streamlining processes to reduce expenses, improving our customer experience and investing for the future in order to deliver strong results through business cycles. I believe we have the right strategies in place. Our second quarter financial results reflect the progress we are making towards those goals. 
Our Q2 results were solid, especially considering the market volatility we experienced during the quarter. In addition, we were very pleased with the credit results. Fee income levels, including corporate banking fees, were also strong. As you know, we have been building out our capital markets capabilities for the last few years. We recently hired a team to further expand our M&A and strategic advisory services. Our investments are paying off as we continue to gain market share with our expanded set of differentiated products and services. Also, our mortgage volume of $2.7 billion was up 53% sequentially. This represented the highest level since the third quarter of 2013. 
Net interest income was relatively stable in Q2, which was in line with our expectations and guidance. NII results reflect growth in commercial loans of 2% and 1% growth in security balances, along with disciplined loan pricing and targeted relationship management. 
Origination yields in our auto loan business improved compared to Q1, reflecting our decision to originate loans more selectively in that business. 
Also, as we have mentioned previously, we have been managing deposit rates tightly, and we expect that to continue in this environment. We have planned on managing through an extended period of low interest rates. With the fall-off from Brexit, we are even more confident that, that was the right approach. We have been very deliberate about growing fee revenue in order to mitigate the impact of lower interest rates. 
We have continued to maintain a steady and cautious strategy with respect to rate risk. Given our focus on outperformance through the cycle, we are better positioned to address market volatility and economic uncertainty than any point in the bank's recent history. 
We remain focused on executing our strategies and continue to make significant progress. We recently closed on the sale of the branches in Pennsylvania, which resulted in a $11 million pretax gain. As the consumer landscape evolves, we will continue to look for more opportunities to optimize our branch network. 
We are also making investments to enhance our digital and operational capabilities. For example, we recently hired Melissa Stevens as our Chief Digital Officer and Head of Omni-channel Banking; and Steve D'Amico as Head of Innovation. 
Our investments in the digital channel are paying off. In the second quarter, approximately 20% of consumer deposits were made via our mobile app compared to 16% a year ago. In general, we have seen a 28% increase in mobile usage year-over-year. 
We also saw a 135% increase in year-over-year in checking and savings accounts opened online. We expect our investments to drive higher digital adoption and create a more integrated customer experience. 
Also in the quarter, we sold a small nonstrategic agented credit card portfolio at a 12% premium. This allows us to continue to focus our energies on our core credit card business. 
As you may have seen, we recently signed an agreement with a third party to help consolidate our Residential Mortgage loan systems under one platform. This initiative will help streamline our mortgage processes and operations, improve customer closure times and significantly improve the overall customer experience. As we've previously disclosed, we expect this investment to generate a full run rate benefit of $12 million annually. 
The strategic initiatives we shared with you in April are on track. We are actually implementing them in a more cost-effective manner than we had initially projected. As a result of our strong execution and focus on expense management, we now expect year-over-year expense growth of 4% in 2016 compared to our guidance of 4.5% to 5% at the start of this year. 
Over time, as we realize the benefits of implementing these initiatives, we would expect annual expense growth to be well below 4%. The continued execution of our key initiatives will also support our longer-range targets, including a 12% to 14% core ROTCE ratio and a 1.1% to 1.3% ROA ratio. 
Finally, we recently entered into a couple of significant transactions with Vantiv. First, we extended our processing agreement with Vantiv through 2024. This agreement was previously set to expire in June of 2019. We are pleased with our new agreement as it will generate a meaningful level of revenue benefits and cost savings from the second half of 2016 onward. 
In addition, we entered into another agreement with Vantiv related to our roughly $800 million of existing TRA cash flows. We terminated and settled certain cash flows totaling $331 million over 18 years for an upfront payment of $116 million. We also have the option to terminate and settle another $394 million of future cash flows at prespecified amounts through the end of 2018. I am pleased that we have reached this agreement that reduces future risk and enables us to monetize and redeploy that capital. Tayfun would provide further detail in his commentary. 
We have discussed our efforts to reduce our risk exposures as a necessary aspect of delivering consistent returns through the cycle. As of June 30, our exposure to companies in the U.K. and other European countries represent less than 2% of our total loans. It consisted mostly of exposure to large global businesses that are well-diversified. 
Leading up to the Brexit vote, we engaged with our clients to assess any potential impact on our business. As a result, we reduced our direct exposure in advance of the vote. Therefore, we believe our exposure to any fall-out from Brexit should be limited. 
In terms of our exposure to the energy sector, we continue to believe that our risk is well-contained. Oil prices in Q2 increased relative to Q1, and our energy NPLs remained essentially flat. We are comfortable with our credit loss exposure in this portfolio. 
We also know there has been an increased concern about growth in commercial real estate loans. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we had a lower mix of CRE relative to peers. Additionally, our growth in absolute dollars is lower compared to many of our peers. Our disciplined client selection and centralized loan underwriting process is designed to ensure that we have a consistent and conservative approach to making CRE loans. 
Moving on to capital. I'm very pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2016 CCAR plan. The 2016 plan allows us to invest realized gains from Vantiv share sales and realized gains from the monetization of the Vantiv TRA into share repurchases. We believe the economics of doing so are favorable, and we will continue to evaluate the use cash proceeds for share repurchases. The CCAR plan demonstrates our ability to generate and return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. 
Additionally, it demonstrates our ability to withstand severely stressful economic conditions, while remaining well-capitalized. Our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio reached 9.94%, an improvement from 9.81% at the end of the first quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter operating results and our current outlook."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. Overall, we are pleased with our core results despite the challenging environment.

Overall, we are pleased with our core results despite the challenging environment. Our corporate banking revenues were solid and mortgage originations have outpaced peers as well as the overall industry in the second quarter. 
We are deploying capital in businesses where return targets meet our long-term goals and are making good progress in executing on our strategic plans. As we shared with you previously, these projects were carefully vetted to minimize reliance on an improved economic environment. Operating leverage is the top priority, with a strong emphasis on sustainable expense control without weakening our business' strength and growing revenues. 
For the second quarter, there was a net negative impact of $0.01 per share resulting from several items. The most significant item was a charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap, which was due to the rejection of the merchant litigation settlement. 
So with that, let's move to Page 5 for the balance sheet discussion. Average commercial loan balances increased 2% sequentially and about 4% year-over-year. We achieved this growth with stabilizing spreads, while repositioning the balance sheet for better risk-adjusted returns. C&I loans contributed nearly 80% of the total sequential growth in average commercial balances. CRE growth of $199 million made up the majority of the remaining quarterly balance increase. Our CRE portfolio as a percentage of total commercial loans is one of the lowest among our regional peers. 
In construction as well as in perm lending, our teams are cognizant of valuations and supply/demand dynamics created by the lack of attractive investment alternatives. As Greg mentioned, our disciplined client selection and credit underwriting in CRE will continue to rely on stringent standards. 
Average consumer loans were down 1% from last quarter and down 1% year-over-year. Residential Mortgage loans grew by 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year, as we kept jumbo mortgages and ARMs on our balance sheet during the quarter. Our Residential Mortgage originations were up 53% from last quarter and 7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 54% of our originations consisted of purchase volumes. 
Indirect auto loans were down 4% from last quarter and 9% year-over-year, in line with our lower origination targets and focus on improving risk-adjusted returns in this business. The profile of our second quarter production was consistent with the first quarter. 
Our home equity loan portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year as loan paydowns continued to exceed originations. Average investment securities increased by $390 million in the second quarter or 1% sequentially. 
Average core deposits increased $258 million from the first quarter. This increase was driven by seasonally higher demand deposit and money market account balances, partially offset by lower interest checking balances. Average core deposit balances were negatively impacted by approximately $201 million due to the previously disclosed sale of branches in Pennsylvania and $219 million due to the full quarter impact of the sale of branches in St. Louis last quarter. 
Excluding these deposits sold in the branch transactions over the last 2 quarters, average core deposits were up 1% on a sequential basis. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 110% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving to NII on Page 6 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by $1 million sequentially to $908 million. The decrease was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of $1.5 billion of unsecured debt issued in the first quarter of 2016 and from lower auto and home equity loan balances. The decrease was partially offset by growth in commercial loans and securities. 
The NIM decreased 3 basis points to 2.88% quarter-over-quarter driven by the full quarter impact of the debt issuance in the first quarter. We had previously guided to a decrease of 3 to 4 basis points in the net interest margin in the second quarter and guided to relative stability off those levels in the latter half of the year, assuming a June Fed rate increase, which did not occur. 
With no Fed moves during the remainder of the year, we now expect a 2- to 4-basis-point NIM contraction in the third quarter, which includes the full quarter impact of our second quarter debt issuance as well as a 1-basis-point impact due to day count. 
We will continue to execute a balanced interest rate risk management strategy as we have over the last 3 years. We will be able to mitigate some of the negative impact of the flatter yield curve with locked-out cash flow and bullet securities that now constitute approximately 50% of our investment portfolio. 
Despite the NIM contraction, we are forecasting a stable NII for the second half of the year. For the full year, our balanced management approach will enable us to grow NII 2%, despite the ongoing challenges with the low-rate environment. 
Shifting to fees on Page 7 of the presentation. Second quarter noninterest income was $599 million compared with $637 million in the first quarter. Our fee income, adjusted for items I previously mentioned, was $602 million, an increase of $24 million or 4% sequentially. Despite challenging market conditions, our results were strong. 
Corporate banking fees of $117 million were up $15 million or 15% sequentially, reflecting increases in loan syndication revenue and institutional sales revenue. The growth in corporate revenues is indicative of the scope and scale of our product offering and relationship-driven target operating model that we are executing. 
Mortgage originations were $2.7 billion in the second quarter, with 54% of the mix consisting of purchase volume. About 75% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels and the remainder from the correspondent channel. Gains on sale were up 29% quarter-over-quarter, with robust origination volume as the gain on sale margin was down 85 basis points. 
Mortgage banking net revenue of $75 million was down $3 million sequentially, primarily due to servicing asset amortization as a result of high refis in the servicing portfolio. The net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $29 million compared to negative $16 million last quarter. 
Deposit service charges increased 1% from the first quarter, reflecting seasonal trends in consumer deposit fees and decreased 1% relative to the second quarter of 2015. Total wealth and asset management revenue of $101 million decreased 1% sequentially, reflecting seasonally lower trust tax preparation fees from the first quarter. 
As you may recall, our previous -- our prior guidance called for 4% to 5% annual fee growth over reported 2015 fees, excluding impacts from Vantiv share sales and warrant valuation adjustments, which was approximately $2.3 billion. Excluding Vantiv-related items and the Visa total return swap adjustment this quarter and any other potential Vantiv-related gains, we expect to grow our fees 5% as a result of a strong first half and the expectation of continued strength during the next 2 quarters. 
Next, I'd like to discuss noninterest expense in Page 8 of the presentation. Expenses of $983 million were $3 million lower than in the first quarter, reflecting a seasonal decrease in FICA and unemployment expense, partially offset by a $9 million expense due to retirement eligibility changes. First quarter's results were also impacted by a $14 million expense related to the voluntary early retirement program. 
As Greg said earlier, we are making good progress in executing on key strategic initiatives and managing our expenses. We now expect expenses to grow at the 4% level, slightly below our April guidance. This guidance includes the impact of the higher FDIC assessment. I also would like to remind you that our guidance includes the impact of the increased amortization of our low income housing investments, which most of our peers reflect in their tax line; the increase in the provision for unfunded commitments; and the impact of onetime benefits related to the settlement of legal cases in 2015. These 3 items make up roughly 2% of the forecasted 4% increase in expenses. 
As I mentioned earlier, operating leverage is our top priority going into 2017. Although we are taking a cautious approach to maintain our franchise's strength in growing revenues, there are a number of identified areas that we are focusing on that I would like to review with you. We plan to engage third parties in some areas to optimize our savings. 
The first is the end-to-end commercial loan origination underwriting and servicing process. This is a natural area of attention given the size of our commercial business. In addition to cost efficiencies, we also believe that our work here will have significant positive impact on client service quality. 
Similarly, we are looking at opportunities in central operations. With new senior management in place, we have identified consolidation opportunities in our facilities and believe that we will be able to extract more savings going forward. 
This morning, we announced a 5.5-year extension to our operating agreement with Vantiv. The new agreement will reflect reduced expenses for Fifth Third and enhance revenue opportunities that both companies enjoy in this mutually beneficial partnership. We will continue to look for opportunities across the board in all of our vendor relationships. We also believe that our significant offshore presence will continue to be a source of savings in all of our business operations, including our risk and compliance areas. The long-term performance targets that Greg reviewed require a focused and disciplined approach to expense management, and we are confident we can execute. 
Turning to credit results on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were $87 million or 37 basis points in the second quarter compared to $96 million and 42 basis points in the first quarter of 2016 and $86 million and 37 basis points in the second quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was primarily due to a $7 million decline in C&I net charge-offs. Out of the total net charge-offs, less than $2 million were in energy. 
Nonperforming loans, excluding loans held for sale, were $693 million, down $8 million from the previous quarter, resulting in an NPL ratio of 74 basis points. 
Overall, credit metrics remain strong. While there may be volatility in credit metrics periodically, our portfolio is performing in line with our expectations. Our provision was $4 million higher than total charge-offs, and our reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases, was unchanged at 1.38%. 
Relative to our peer group, our NPA net charge-off and reserve ratios compare favorably. Our previous guidance that net charge-offs would be range-bound with some quarterly variability is unchanged. Also, we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth. 
On Slide 10, given the recent events overseas, we have provided a breakdown of our U.K. and European exposure. As Greg already mentioned in his earlier remarks, our second quarter U.K. exposure is minimal at less than 2% of total loans. We do not anticipate any significant issues from our portfolio, which is diversified and consists primarily of loans to large corporate customers. 
Moving on to capital on Slide 11. Our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.9%, an increase of 52 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the second quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately 4 million. During the quarter, we executed open market share repurchases of $26 million, which reduced the share count by 1.44 million shares. This completed our previous CCAR repurchase activity. 
On Slide 12, as Greg mentioned earlier, we recently entered into another agreement with Vantiv related to our roughly $800 million of expected TRA cash flows. This transaction mitigates future risk related to these cash flows and enables us to reinvest the realized gains into share buybacks. 
As we've discussed with you many times in the past, our ability to realize these cash flows over the next 15-plus years depends on factors such as U.S. corporate tax rates and Vantiv's taxable income levels. With that in mind, at the end of last year, we terminated and settled a portion of these future cash flows. And this week, we executed another agreement for a termination and settlement of $331 million in cash flows for an upfront payment of $116 million. 
In addition, under a quarterly put/call structure owned by Fifth Third and Vantiv, respectively, we will have the ability to terminate and settle another $394 million of future cash flows for a total of $171 million payable to Fifth Third in 2017 and in 2018 in 8 separate quarterly optional executions. 
We have essentially locked in the ability to receive a minimum of approximately $15 million per quarter in 2017 and $26 million per quarter in 2018. This transaction will require an upfront asset booked on our balance sheet this quarter as it essentially removes the contingencies associated with these future cash flows. 
I would like to remind you that we will also receive our annual normal payments this year and next year. These TRA flows are related to all share sales executed up to this point. There is roughly an additional $1 billion in future TRA flows related to future potential sales of our current ownership at the current Vantiv share price. We believe that our actions around the Vantiv relationship are in the best interest of our shareholders. 
Relative to CCAR 2016, the Federal Reserve's review is complete, and we received a non-objection to our capital plan. Our capital plan includes the ability to increase the quarterly common stock dividends to $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2016; the repurchase of common shares, an amount up to $660 million; and the ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any realized after-tax gains from the sale of Vantiv stock. 
Additionally, this year, our capital plan now also includes the ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any realized after-tax gains from the termination of any portion of the Vantiv tax receivable agreement we just discussed. We believe our results demonstrate the relative strength of our -- of both our capital position and our internal capital generation capacity. We have included the overall outlook on Slide 13 for your reference. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A."

But overall, we're pleased with how we've positioned the securities portfolios, as Tayfun mentioned, the bullet and locked-out cash flows. We're not as susceptible to this low rate environment over the next few quarters. But if this environment were to continue for an extended period of time, then it would be more challenging to have stable NIM. But at least over the foreseeable future, we feel like we've positioned the book as well as we could for this lower-for-longer environment.

But it's not just about the balance sheet, I'd remind you, it's about the total client relationship.

As you can see on Page 3 of the presentation, we reported third quarter net income to common shareholders of $501 million in earnings per diluted share of $0.65. During the quarter, some notable items resulted a net positive $0.22 impact reported earnings per share, Tayfun will provide further details in his opening comments.
During the quarter, we continue to focus on North Star initiative. Our Q3 results provide a further evidence of the progress we are making. Our net interest margin was well managed and stable sequentially reflecting our focus on higher-quality customer relationships. Adjusted fee income, excluding MSR evaluation adjustments was up 4% year-over-year and the growth rate has accelerated since the beginning of the year. Expenses were down 1% this quarter compared to second quarter 2016. During the quarter, credit quality remained stable with a decrease in both nonperforming loans and criticized asset levels for the second quarter in a row. The slight elevation in our charge-offs primarily reflects quarterly volatility from the low levels we have been experiencing.
We expect the benign credit environment to continue for the foreseeable future. Production metrics continue to be strong with mortgage volume up $2.9 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 27% from last year. Q3 volume represented the highest level record originations in the last 3 years.
In our Commercial business, we remained focused on higher-quality relationships that will enable our business to outperform through the cycle. As a result, commercial loan production for relationship manager is up 7% and fees for relationship manager up 22% on a year-to-date basis.  Our overall commercial loan balances reflect the soft loan demand which persisted during the quarter.
In regards to the environment, we will continue to focus on relationships that meet our return objectives. We're also investing in developing new origination channels. For example, during the quarter, we announced our strategic alliance with GreenSky, our investment in and partnership with GreenSky will help us to efficiently generate additional consumer loan volumes that will allow us to leverage the technology platform in existing merchant relationships.
While we continue to invest for growth in our businesses, we recognize that this remains a challenging environment for quality revenue growth. Given the limited support from a broader economic environment, we need to maintain a strong focus on expense management. We are all going to [indiscernible] across business and staff functions, we have already taken significant steps to reduce our expense base.
We completed the sale and consolidating of 108 branches this year, which is expected to drive approximately $60 million in the annualized cost savings. Last month, we announced plan to sell and consolidate an additional 22 big branches, which should generate incremental cost savings of $12 million annually.
As a result, total branches are expected to be down 12% since we began this process late last year. We expect these actions to generate run rate expense savings of $72 million annually. With rapid changes in technology and customer behavior, we'll continue to implement our omni-channel strategy. We believe this will allow us to further optimize our branch network, to best serve the needs of our customers.
We're also making the necessary technology investments to enhance our digital and operational capabilities. Our investments in the digital channel are paying off in the third quarter, approximately 20% of consumer deposits were made using our mobile app compared to 60% a year ago. Overall, we have seen a 25% increase in mobile usage year-over-year. We have also seen 150% increase year-over-year in checking and savings accounts opened online.
We expect to continue making investments to drive higher digital adoption and create a more integrated customer experience while creating efficiencies for Fifth Third.
To optimize workspace utilization, we are evaluating non-branch facilities for additional efficiencies. During the quarter, we sold one of our Michigan facilities, which generated $11 million pretax gain. We are working on similar opportunities to reduce the expense run rate or improving the overall work environment for our employees.
We also renegotiated key vendor contracts during the quarter as disclosed earlier. As a result of our strong execution and focus on expense management, we now expect year-over-year expense growth to be sub 4% in 2016 compared to our original guidance of 4.5% to 5% [indiscernible] at historic for the year. The actions we're taking should help us achieve positive operating leverage in 2017. Although near-term expense management is at the top of our priority list, we are also maintaining a long-term perspective on our strategic plans.
During the third quarter, we formally launched Project North Star to align our entire organization towards a higher and more sustainable level of profitability within the next 3 years. Our energies are focused on ensuring the right mix of expense reductions, key revenue enhancement opportunities and balance sheet optimization in order to achieve our ROTCE targets.
Assuming the current operating environment persist, we would expect to achieve a 12% to 14% ROTCE run rate by the end of 2019.
We expect the contributions from Project North Star to be additive to the improvements that we're already making in our base run rate. These initiatives will leverage our strength in middle market lending, industry verticals with special lending areas in our commercial business and the consumer business growth initiatives in mortgage banking and personal lending will provide support for more balanced growth in our overall loan portfolio. We continue to expand our capabilities in businesses such as capital markets, insurance, and wealth management that generate attractive returns.
Initiatives such as our commercial end-to-end process redesign project will help generate additional efficiencies while improving the overall customer experience. We intend to achieve these targets without changing our risk appetite for our ongoing discipline and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
Our capital and liquidity levels remain strong and improved from last quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio reached 10.16% from 9.94% at the end of the second quarter. And our liquidity coverage ratio was 115%, 25% above the current requirement. 
As previously disclosed, the Federal Reserve did not object to an increase in our common dividend of $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter.
In summary, I was pleased with the solid results we generated despite soft economic conditions. Our results demonstrate the progress we are making toward our targets on our Project North Star as well as our longer-term strategic goals. Also I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication and for keeping the customer at the center of everything we do.
With that I will turn over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter operating results and current outlook."
270961,384405077,1057647,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. As Greg said, overall we are pleased with our results in the current economic environment. The growth in our net interest income,",2371,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. As Greg said, overall we are pleased with our results in the current economic environment. The growth in our net interest income, the stability of the net interest margin and the decline in our expenses are indicative of our focus on improving shareholder returns.
For the third quarter, there was a net positive impact of $0.22 per share resulting from several items. The most significant item was a $280 million pretax gain from the termination and settlement of certain Vantiv TRA growth cash flows and the expected obligation to terminate and settle remaining TRA gross cash flows.
Our underlying fee revenues were solid during the quarter. Mortgage origination and pass through fees were 31% higher in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis.
Corporate Banking revenues were seasonally down slightly from our robust second quarter as we have previously indicated.
Expenses continue to be tightly controlled as we continue to look for efficiencies throughout the organization. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in overall key credit risk indicators is supportive of the benign credit outlook. So with that, let's move to Page 5 for the balance sheet discussion. Average commercial loan balances decreased 1% sequentially and increased about 1% year-over-year. The sequential decline reflected some softness in C&I loan demand and was consistent with industry trends. Our spreads widened as we continued to reposition and optimize the portfolio into a more attractive risk return profile that we believe will be more resilient in an economic downturn. 
Our C&I yield has increased every quarter since the third quarter of last year. CRE growth of $354 million this quarter partially offset some of the decline in C&I balances. As we discussed before, in construction as well as in perm lending, our teams are cognizant of valuations and supply-demand dynamics created by the lack of attractive investment alternatives. Our disciplined client selection and credit underwriting in CRE will continue to rely on stringent standards.
Average consumer loans decreased $78 million from last quarter and were down 2% year-over-year. Auto loans were down 3% from last quarter and 12% year-over-year in line with our loan origination targets and focus on improving risk-adjusted returns in this business.
Our strategy so far this year has resulted in higher returns on assets and capital than our initial expectations in our indirect auto business.
Residential Mortgage loans grew by 3% sequentially and 10% year-over-year as we kept jumbo mortgages, ARMs as well as certain 10- and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages on our balance sheet during the quarter.
Our Residential Mortgage originations were up 7% from last quarter and 27% year-over-year.
During the quarter, our origination mix was split roughly in half between purchase and refinance volumes. About 70% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels, and the remainder were originated through the corresponding channel.
Our home equity loan portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year as low -- loan paydowns exceeded strong origination volume. Our originations this quarter were up 15% compared to last quarter and 20% higher year-over-year.
Our goal is to achieve a better balance between commercial loan growth and consumer loan growth. Our new partnership with GreenSky should help enhance our ability to generate consumer loans, especially as we start to implement their technology in our own business.
In addition, our new initiatives in credit card lending should also support stronger growth going forward. Average investment securities decreased by $239 million in the third quarter or 1% sequentially.
Our yield widened by 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter, partly due to higher discount accretion during the quarter. Average core deposits decreased $98 million from the second quarter. Average core deposit balances were negatively impacted by approximately $302 million due to the Pennsylvania branches sold in April. Excluding these deposits, average core deposits were flat on a sequential basis and up 1% on a year-over-year basis. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 115% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving to NII on Page 6 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $5 million sequentially to $913 million. The increase was primarily driven by improved investment portfolio yields, an increase in 1-month LIBOR and the impact of the day count. The increase was partially offset by the full quarter impact of $1.25 billion of unsecured debt issued late in the second quarter and lower average C&I loan balances.
The NIM was stable from the second quarter at 2.88% and wider than we forecasted in July. The positive impact of higher-yielding investments and an increase in 1-month LIBOR was offset by the full quarter impact of the second quarter debt issuance and the day count.
Our outlook for NIM has improved relative to our July forecast. With no rate hikes for the rest of the year, we now expect the NIM to be stable to down 1 basis point in the fourth quarter, which includes the full quarter impact of our September debt issuance.
On a full-year basis, we would expect the NIM of about 2.89%, which is up 1 basis point from 2015. We expect NII to be down slightly in the fourth quarter from the full quarter impact of our third quarter debt issuance and more normalized discount accretion on the investment securities portfolio. We are still projecting full year NII growth of 2% despite ongoing challenges with the low environment, the rate environment and stable loan growth.
We will continue to execute a balanced interest rate risk management strategy as we have over the last 3 years. Our NIM outperformance should not imply that we have outsized the exposure to a decline in portfolio yields. We estimate that in a static interest rate environment, the investment portfolio would only have a detrimental impact of 2 basis points in 2017 on the Bancorp's net interest margin. A key contributor to this stability is that approximately 48% of our investment portfolio consists of lockout and bullet securities. Keeping nearly our entire investment portfolio in the available [indiscernible] for sale category has also allowed us to maintain some flexibility to reposition the investment portfolio in response to changing market conditions.
Shifting to fees on Page 7 of the presentation. Third quarter noninterest income was $840 million compared with $599 million in the second quarter. Our fee income, adjusted for items disclosed in our earnings release was $596 million. Also excluding the impact of the net MSR valuation, fee revenue was up 2% versus last quarter and up 4% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Despite the environmental factors, our underlying fee revenues were solid, mortgage production gains on sale were up 13% quarter-over-quarter reflecting the robust origination value and that I've mentioned earlier, and a 39 basis points increase in the gain on sale margin.
Mortgage banking net revenue of $66 million was down $9 million sequentially, primarily due to net MSR valuation adjustments during the quarter. Net MSR valuation adjustments were negative $9 million compared to a positive $6 million last quarter. We expect our fourth quarter mortgage origination revenue to be seasonally lower than the third quarter by 5% to 10% above last year's fourth quarter.
Corporate Banking fees of $111 million were seasonally down $6 million or 5% sequentially reflecting decreases in loan syndication revenue and foreign exchange fees, partially offset by an increase in corporate bond underwriting revenue. Fees were up 7% on a year-over-year basis, driven by a strong corporate bond underwriting and loan syndication revenues.
The expansion highlights are efforts to increase the scale and scope of our product offering in line with the relationship driven model that we are executing. We expect Corporate Banking fees in the fourth quarter to be stable relative to the third quarter.
Deposit service charges increased 4% from the second quarter, driven by a 6% increase in retail service charges as well as a 3% increase in commercial service charges. The increase in retail service charges reflected seasonally higher customer activity. Deposit service charges decreased 1% relative to the third quarter of 2017 -- 2015 reflecting reduced monthly service charges as part of our new consumer checking account lineup.
Total wealth and asset management revenue of $101 million was flat sequentially as market value improvements were offset by lower transaction-driven retail brokerage fees. Revenues declined 2% relative to the third quarter of 2015 as investment management and institutional fees were more than offset by lower brokerage fees.
We discussed the third quarter impact of the Vantiv TRA transactions in July during our second quarter earnings call. These transactions were very beneficial from both risk management as well as shareholder return optimization perspectives.
As you may recall, our prior guidance for 2016 called for a 5% annual adjusted fee growth off a base of $2.3 billion for 2015. This base excluded impact from Vantiv as previously discussed, which I mentioned on Slide 11 of our presentation.
Excluding Vantiv-related items, the Visa total return swap adjustments and any impacts from the branch sales and consolidations, we continue to expect annual fees growth of 5% growth for the full year.
Next, I'd like to discuss noninterest expense on Page 8 of the presentation. Expenses of $973 million were $10 million lower than in the second quarter, including the impact of the FDIC surcharge. This reflects a decrease in compensation-related expenses and employee benefits resulting from the impact of the second quarter of 2016 retirement eligibility change as well as other reductions in operational expenses.
As Greg stated earlier, we are making good progress in executing on key strategic initiatives and managing our expenses at the same time. We now expect expense growth to be below 4% level compared to our July guidance of 4% and 4.5% to 5% at the start of the year.
Once again, I would like to remind you that our guidance includes the impact of the increased amortization of our low income housing investments, which most of our peers reflect in their tax line. On an annual basis, this line item contributes nearly 3% to our efficiency ratio. It also includes an increase in the provision for unfunded commitments and the impact of one-time benefits related to settlement of legal cases in 2015. These 3 items make up roughly 2% of the forecasted increase in expenses.
As we have previously discussed, generating positive operating leverage is our top priority going into 2017, and our recent trends are supportive of that outcome.
Turning to credit results on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were $107 million or 45 basis points in the third quarter compared to $87 million and 37 basis points in the second quarter of 2016, and $188 million and 80 basis points in the third quarter a year ago. The sequential increase in charge-offs was primarily due to a $22 million increase in C&I net charge-offs.
Total nonperforming loans, excluding loans held-for-sale were $506 million, down $107 million or 15% from the previous quarter resulting in an NPL ratio of 63 basis points. Commercial NPLs decreased $94 million or 17% from the second quarter. In addition, our criticized assets have steadily improved over the last four quarters and our criticized asset ratio is now at the lowest point since the third quarter of 2007.
The strength in the key credit metrics indicate continued overall stability, but given the absolute low levels, there may be volatility in some periods periodically.
Our provision was $11 million lower than the last quarter, partially driven by improving nonperforming loan and criticized asset levels. Our resulting reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases decreased 1 basis point to 1.37%, but was up 2 basis points from last year. Our previous guidance and net charge-offs would be range bound with some quarterly variability is unchanged. We expect the fourth quarter charge-offs to be lower than the third quarter charge-offs. Also we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth.
Moving on to capital and liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital levels remain strong and are growing. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.16%, an increase of 22 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 76 basis points year-over-year.
At the end of the third quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately $11 million or 1.4% compared to the second quarter of 2016 and down 40 million shares or 5% compared to last year's third quarter.
During the quarter, we executed and accelerated share repurchase of $240 million, which reduced the share count by 10.98 million shares. This repurchase includes our 2016 [indiscernible] repurchases as well as the third quarter after-tax cash flows realized from the Vantiv TRA termination and settlement.
Our book value and tangible book value are up 12% and 13% respectively year-over-year. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be in the 23.5% to 24.5% range.
This quarter, we would be finalizing our 2017 financial plan as well as our outlook for Project North Star, which is a 3-year project. As Greg said, we expect Project North Star to contribute meaningfully to our base performance, which we expect to improve independently compared to our more recent performance.
The priorities embedded within the North Star project are an intense focus on expense management, smart balance sheet management and capital efficiency and revenue growth initiatives in high return businesses. These expectations include higher than historical growth in personal lending, including credit cards, expansion of our middle market and vertical businesses in commercial and widening the scope and scale in our capital markets businesses.
Expense savings should include lower infrastructure and delivery costs in IT, lower total compensation costs and other operational expense savings in workspace management, legal work and savings related to a more efficient data infrastructure and end-to-end process redesign. This quarter we are working on finalizing our 2017 financial plan as well as the construct of our Project North Star. Our goal is to share our expectations with you later this quarter and more in our January call. We have included the updated outlook on Slide 11 for your reference. And with that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A."

They continue to be cautious, [indiscernible] about making significant investments. I think that you have seen some of that play out in the lower M&A activity that we've seen as we've headed further into the year. That uncertainty also revolves around questions of the political, what's going on with China, Brexit, the EU-type issues. So those are certainly coloring some of the investments that we're seeing. We did clearly see a slower production in the third quarter, but I would see that as a little bit more seasonal, which we typically see lower levels in July and August. So I'd say it was more pronounced this third quarter, however, with the things that we're doing, investing in our verticals, new businesses and frankly, we've got some geographies, some markets that are performing very well. I would expect that we would continue to see loan growth at a good stable rate on a go-forward basis. We've got a great business model, one that clearly has been well received in the marketplace, our advisory base, relationship model as long as that's embraced and we're seeing that reflected in deeper client relationships, that's helping us to drive fee income."

So the debt you can expect to be pretty quiet, but the loan yield expansion that we've seen every quarter this year, we expect to continue into the fourth quarter and that for us is driven by C&I and auto yields, they both increased 3 basis points in the third quarter and then the one anomaly from the third quarter will be the investment portfolio had tremendous performance in the third quarter with the discount accretion. You sold that, [indiscernible] were obviously pleased with how we're positioned on the portfolio, but that should normalize in the fourth quarter just given the faster speeds in the third quarter than what we're expecting in the fourth quarter so that would be a little bit of headwind for us in the fourth quarter. But I think the loan yields and the other actions we've taken to generate either a stable NIM or perhaps down a basis point and that assumes there is no said increase in the fourth quarter."

And we've talked every quarter about whether we were or we're not going to reinvest cash flows out of the portfolio in the third quarter. We didn't like the entry points we were seeing and so we didn't reinvest over half the cash flows from the portfolio, but the total level of cash flows that come off the portfolio are a pretty low level as a percent of our book relative to our peers. And that's really where you can dig in and see when folks are invested in pass-through securities you have extension risk and you have pre-payment risk and the bullet locked out cash flow play that we have been running for over 2 years and talking you about that, really benefits in the environment that we're seeing today.

So I think on the high side, it'd be 8 and then we're looking at this more in the 6 range. But yes, we are positioned that it would be very beneficial to us and then as Tayfun said, part of the change that occurred from 4Q '15 to where we are today on the margin was in a large part driven by the $3.7 billion of debt maturities we had this year, and now that, next year, we're at a $1.2 billion level of maturities that was really the biggest influence on the margin compression this year that, that obviously would not repeat.

The qualification of the improvements in returns translates to a roughly $800 million type pretax income improvement between now and 2019. So the way we think about it is, there is a base performance uplift from the businesses that we have and in a  case scenario, probably roughly it's about, let's call it a $3 million to $4 million we can do that by managing the expenses and then growing the revenue that already in play. And then, we look at certain balance sheet optimization targets that we are establishing. That probably I don't know let's call it sort of in the $100 million to $150 million range and then roughly another $150 million to $200 million in fee income growth. So that leaves somewhere around $150 million or so expense. These are broad numbers. We will share more details with you. 
The timing of the expense saves will start coming in 2017, some of them already in play, it is obviously major restructuring. And I think it will accelerate in 2018 and '19. Some of the projects underlying expense projects related to the commercial business and design that project is kicking off and it's going to have somewhat of a delayed impact, but again we would see probably more meaningful 2018 and then there are other investments that we are making.

Where we had and where most of peers I think had issues had been overreliance on the enterprise value lending, financing M&A transactions and deals wins sideways. So when they win sideways, the problem is loss and the default is very high. That's our prior experience. And as a result of that, we have been very judicious and going through as Lars just talked about looking at over client relationships, looking our sponsor relationship, looking at the types of credits that we would finance in a leverage environment, industries that we should consider and industries probably cyclical industries for example, we probably shouldn't consider financing leverage environment. So we talked about $1.4 billion reclassifying or leaving the books, is the highest risk piece that we focus on which are enterprise value deals, highly leveraged deals, clients who don't fit our risk profile, and leverage themselves out of our comfort zone. And those are the credits that we are moving out. So whether it's 10% or 20%, to me, it's a more meaningful number to that, because we're taking the highest risk in the portfolio and that's leaving the books and what remains is a portfolio that we think Greg well, we know well, with respect well, we have a great history and they have ability to manage leverage, because they leverage an industry that's much more stable versus much more cyclical.

And we are seeing that happened in play out on a go-forward basis. So I would just underscore, as I look across almost every business line that we have in the Commercial Bank, whether stabilized or slightly increased in some cases moderately increased our core loan spreads, which is allowed our company really to benefit from a large part of the rise that we have seen in LIBOR, where in some institutions, you are seeing some of that absorbed way with thinner spreads. 
Let me tell you something. The market is no easier today from a competitive environment perspective than it was several quarters ago. In fact, I would submit that it is more aggressive today and smaller banks are going up market, larger banks are going down market and non-banks are playing at levels we haven't seen before. So we are going to have to be at our best, but frankly, we have got great bankers with great businesses, I've got a lot of confidence in them that we can continue not just for four quarters, but for the long-term to produce."

As you can see on Page 3 of the presentation, we reported third quarter net income to common shareholders of $501 million in earnings per diluted share of $0.65. During the quarter, some notable items resulted a net positive $0.22 impact reported earnings per share, Tayfun will provide further details in his opening comments.
During the quarter, we continue to focus on North Star initiative. Our Q3 results provide a further evidence of the progress we are making. Our net interest margin was well managed and stable sequentially reflecting our focus on higher-quality customer relationships. Adjusted fee income, excluding MSR evaluation adjustments was up 4% year-over-year and the growth rate has accelerated since the beginning of the year. Expenses were down 1% this quarter compared to second quarter 2016. During the quarter, credit quality remained stable with a decrease in both nonperforming loans and criticized asset levels for the second quarter in a row. The slight elevation in our charge-offs primarily reflects quarterly volatility from the low levels we have been experiencing.
We expect the benign credit environment to continue for the foreseeable future. Production metrics continue to be strong with mortgage volume up $2.9 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 27% from last year. Q3 volume represented the highest level record originations in the last 3 years.
In our Commercial business, we remained focused on higher-quality relationships that will enable our business to outperform through the cycle. As a result, commercial loan production for relationship manager is up 7% and fees for relationship manager up 22% on a year-to-date basis.  Our overall commercial loan balances reflect the soft loan demand which persisted during the quarter.
In regards to the environment, we will continue to focus on relationships that meet our return objectives. We're also investing in developing new origination channels. For example, during the quarter, we announced our strategic alliance with GreenSky, our investment in and partnership with GreenSky will help us to efficiently generate additional consumer loan volumes that will allow us to leverage the technology platform in existing merchant relationships.
While we continue to invest for growth in our businesses, we recognize that this remains a challenging environment for quality revenue growth. Given the limited support from a broader economic environment, we need to maintain a strong focus on expense management. We're all going to review across business and staff functions, we have already taken significant steps to reduce our expense base.
We completed the sale and consolidating of 108 branches this year, which is expected to drive approximately $60 million in the annualized cost savings. Last month, we announced plan to sell and consolidate an additional 22 big branches, which should generate incremental cost savings of $12 million annually.
As a result, total branches are expected to be down 12% since we began this process late last year. We expect these actions to generate run rate expense savings of $72 million annually. With rapid changes in technology and customer behavior, we'll continue to implement our omni-channel strategy. We believe this will allow us to further optimize our branch network, to best serve the needs of our customers.
We're also making the necessary technology investments to enhance our digital and operational capabilities. Our investments in the digital channel are paying off in the third quarter, approximately 20% of consumer deposits were made using our mobile app compared to 60% a year ago. Overall, we have seen a 25% increase in mobile usage year-over-year. We have also seen 150% increase year-over-year in checking and savings accounts opened online.
We expect to continue making investments to drive higher digital adoption and create a more integrated customer experience while creating efficiencies for Fifth Third.
To optimize workspace utilization, we are evaluating non-branch facilities for additional efficiencies. During the quarter, we sold one of our Michigan facilities, which generated $11 million pretax gain. We are working on similar opportunities to reduce the expense run rate or improving the overall work environment for our employees.
We also renegotiated key vendor contracts during the quarter as disclosed earlier. As a result of our strong execution and focus on expense management, we now expect year-over-year expense growth to be sub 4% in 2016 compared to our original guidance of 4.5% to 5% at the start of the year. The actions we're taking should help us achieve positive operating leverage in 2017. Although near-term expense management is at the top of our priority list, we are also maintaining a long-term perspective on our strategic plans.
During the third quarter, we formally launched Project North Star to align our entire organization towards a higher and more sustainable level of profitability within the next 3 years. Our energies are focused on ensuring the right mix of expense reductions, key revenue enhancement opportunities and balance sheet optimization in order to achieve our ROTCE targets.
Assuming the current operating environment persist, we would expect to achieve a 12% to 14% ROTCE run rate by the end of 2019.
We expect the contributions from Project North Star to be additive to the improvements that we're already making in our base run rate. These initiatives will leverage our strength in middle market lending, industry verticals with special lending areas in our commercial business and the consumer business growth initiatives in mortgage banking and personal lending will provide support for more balanced growth in our overall loan portfolio. We continue to expand our capabilities in businesses such as capital markets, insurance, and wealth management that generate attractive returns.
Initiatives such as our commercial end-to-end process redesign project will help generate additional efficiencies while improving the overall customer experience. We intend to achieve these targets without changing our risk appetite for our ongoing discipline and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
Our capital and liquidity levels remain strong and improved from last quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio reached 10.16% from 9.94% at the end of the second quarter. And our liquidity coverage ratio was 115%, 25% above the current requirement. 
As previously disclosed, the Federal Reserve did not object to an increase in our common dividend of $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter.
In summary, I was pleased with the solid results we generated despite soft economic conditions. Our results demonstrate the progress we are making toward our targets on our Project North Star as well as our longer-term strategic goals. Also I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication and for keeping the customer at the center of everything we do.
With that I will turn over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter operating results and current outlook."
270961,384405077,1057931,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. As Greg said, overall we are pleased with our results in the current economic environment. The growth in our net interest income,",2370,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. As Greg said, overall we are pleased with our results in the current economic environment. The growth in our net interest income, the stability of the net interest margin and the decline in our expenses are indicative of our focus on improving shareholder returns.
For the third quarter, there was a net positive impact of $0.22 per share resulting from several items. The most significant item was a $280 million pretax gain from the termination and settlement of certain Vantiv TRA growth cash flows and the expected obligation to terminate and settle remaining TRA gross cash flows.
Our underlying fee revenues were solid during the quarter. Mortgage origination and pass through fees were 31% higher in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis.
Corporate Banking revenues were seasonally down slightly from our robust second quarter as we have previously indicated.
Expenses continue to be tightly controlled as we continue to look for efficiencies throughout the organization. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in overall key credit risk indicators is supportive of the benign credit outlook. So with that, let's move to Page 5 for the balance sheet discussion. Average commercial loan balances decreased 1% sequentially and increased about 1% year-over-year. The sequential decline reflected some softness in C&I loan demand and was consistent with industry trends. Our spreads widened as we continued to reposition and optimize the portfolio into a more attractive risk return profile that we believe will be more resilient in an economic downturn. 
Our C&I yield has increased every quarter since the third quarter of last year. CRE growth of $354 million this quarter partially offset some of the decline in C&I balances. As we discussed before, in construction as well as in perm lending, our teams are cognizant of valuations and supply-demand dynamics created by the lack of attractive investment alternatives. Our disciplined client selection and credit underwriting in CRE will continue to rely on stringent standards.
Average consumer loans decreased $78 million from last quarter and were down 2% year-over-year. Auto loans were down 3% from last quarter and 12% year-over-year in line with our loan origination targets and focus on improving risk-adjusted returns in this business.
Our strategy so far this year has resulted in higher returns on assets and capital than our initial expectations in our indirect auto business.
Residential Mortgage loans grew by 3% sequentially and 10% year-over-year as we kept jumbo mortgages, ARMs as well as certain 10- and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages on our balance sheet during the quarter.
Our Residential Mortgage originations were up 7% from last quarter and 27% year-over-year.
During the quarter, our origination mix was split roughly in half between purchase and refinance volumes. About 70% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels, and the remainder were originated through the corresponding channel.
Our home equity loan portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year as low -- loan paydowns exceeded strong origination volume. Our originations this quarter were up 15% compared to last quarter and 20% higher year-over-year.
Our goal is to achieve a better balance between commercial loan growth and consumer loan growth. Our new partnership with GreenSky should help enhance our ability to generate consumer loans, especially as we start to implement their technology in our own business.
In addition, our new initiatives in credit card lending should also support stronger growth going forward. Average investment securities decreased by $239 million in the third quarter or 1% sequentially.
Our yield widened by 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter, partly due to higher discount accretion during the quarter. Average core deposits decreased $98 million from the second quarter. Average core deposit balances were negatively impacted by approximately $302 million due to the Pennsylvania branches sold in April. Excluding these deposits, average core deposits were flat on a sequential basis and up 1% on a year-over-year basis. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 115% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving to NII on Page 6 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $5 million sequentially to $913 million. The increase was primarily driven by improved investment portfolio yields, an increase in 1-month LIBOR and the impact of the day count. The increase was partially offset by the full quarter impact of $1.25 billion of unsecured debt issued late in the second quarter and lower average C&I loan balances.
The NIM was stable from the second quarter at 2.88% and wider than we forecasted in July. The positive impact of higher-yielding investments and an increase in 1-month LIBOR was offset by the full quarter impact of the second quarter debt issuance and the day count.
Our outlook for NIM has improved relative to our July forecast. With no rate hikes for the rest of the year, we now expect the NIM to be stable to down 1 basis point in the fourth quarter, which includes the full quarter impact of our September debt issuance.
On a full-year basis, we would expect the NIM of about 2.89%, which is up 1 basis point from 2015. We expect NII to be down slightly in the fourth quarter from the full quarter impact of our third quarter debt issuance and more normalized discount accretion on the investment securities portfolio. We are still projecting full year NII growth of 2% despite ongoing challenges with the low environment, the rate environment and stable loan growth.
We will continue to execute a balanced interest rate risk management strategy as we have over the last 3 years. Our NIM outperformance should not imply that we have outsized the exposure to a decline in portfolio yields. We estimate that in a static interest rate environment, the investment portfolio would only have a detrimental impact of 2 basis points in 2017 on the Bancorp's net interest margin. A key contributor to this stability is that approximately 48% of our investment portfolio consists of lockout and bullet securities. Keeping nearly our entire investment portfolio in the available for sale category has also allowed us to maintain some flexibility to reposition the investment portfolio in response to changing market conditions.
Shifting to fees on Page 7 of the presentation. Third quarter noninterest income was $840 million compared with $599 million in the second quarter. Our fee income, adjusted for items disclosed in our earnings release was $596 million. Also excluding the impact of the net MSR valuation, fee revenue was up 2% versus last quarter and up 4% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Despite the environmental factors, our underlying fee revenues were solid, mortgage production gains on sale were up 13% quarter-over-quarter reflecting the robust origination value and that I've mentioned earlier, and a 39 basis points increase in the gain on sale margin.
Mortgage banking net revenue of $66 million was down $9 million sequentially, primarily due to net MSR valuation adjustments during the quarter. Net MSR valuation adjustments were negative $9 million compared to a positive $6 million last quarter. We expect our fourth quarter mortgage origination revenue to be seasonally lower than the third quarter by 5% to 10% above last year's fourth quarter.
Corporate Banking fees of $111 million were seasonally down $6 million or 5% sequentially reflecting decreases in loan syndication revenue and foreign exchange fees, partially offset by an increase in corporate bond underwriting revenue. Fees were up 7% on a year-over-year basis, driven by a strong corporate bond underwriting and loan syndication revenues.
The expansion highlights are efforts to increase the scale and scope of our product offering in line with the relationship driven model that we are executing. We expect Corporate Banking fees in the fourth quarter to be stable relative to the third quarter.
Deposit service charges increased 4% from the second quarter, driven by a 6% increase in retail service charges as well as a 3% increase in commercial service charges. The increase in retail service charges reflected seasonally higher customer activity. Deposit service charges decreased 1% relative to the third quarter of 2017 -- 2015 reflecting reduced monthly service charges as part of our new consumer checking account lineup.
Total wealth and asset management revenue of $101 million was flat sequentially as market value improvements were offset by lower transaction-driven retail brokerage fees. Revenues declined 2% relative to the third quarter of 2015 as investment management and institutional fees were more than offset by lower brokerage fees.
We discussed the third quarter impact of the Vantiv TRA transactions in July during our second quarter earnings call. These transactions were very beneficial from both risk management as well as shareholder return optimization perspectives.
As you may recall, our prior guidance for 2016 called for a 5% annual adjusted fee growth off a base of $2.3 billion for 2015. This base excluded impact from Vantiv as previously discussed, which I mentioned on Slide 11 of our presentation.
Excluding Vantiv-related items, the Visa total return swap adjustments and any impacts from the branch sales and consolidations, we continue to expect annual fees growth of 5% growth for the full year.
Next, I'd like to discuss noninterest expense on Page 8 of the presentation. Expenses of $973 million were $10 million lower than in the second quarter, including the impact of the FDIC surcharge. This reflects a decrease in compensation-related expenses and employee benefits resulting from the impact of the second quarter of 2016 retirement eligibility change as well as other reductions in operational expenses.
As Greg stated earlier, we are making good progress in executing on key strategic initiatives and managing our expenses at the same time. We now expect expense growth to be below 4% level compared to our July guidance of 4% and 4.5% to 5% at the start of the year.
Once again, I would like to remind you that our guidance includes the impact of the increased amortization of our low income housing investments, which most of our peers reflect in their tax line. On an annual basis, this line item contributes nearly 3% to our efficiency ratio. It also includes an increase in the provision for unfunded commitments and the impact of one-time benefits related to settlement of legal cases in 2015. These 3 items make up roughly 2% of the forecasted increase in expenses.
As we have previously discussed, generating positive operating leverage is our top priority going into 2017, and our recent trends are supportive of that outcome.
Turning to credit results on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were $107 million or 45 basis points in the third quarter compared to $87 million and 37 basis points in the second quarter of 2016, and $188 million and 80 basis points in the third quarter a year ago. The sequential increase in charge-offs was primarily due to a $22 million increase in C&I net charge-offs.
Total nonperforming loans, excluding loans held-for-sale were $506 million, down $107 million or 15% from the previous quarter resulting in an NPL ratio of 63 basis points. Commercial NPLs decreased $94 million or 17% from the second quarter. In addition, our criticized assets have steadily improved over the last four quarters and our criticized asset ratio is now at the lowest point since the third quarter of 2007.
The strength in the key credit metrics indicate continued overall stability, but given the absolute low levels, there may be volatility in some periods periodically.
Our provision was $11 million lower than the last quarter, partially driven by improving nonperforming loan and criticized asset levels. Our resulting reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases decreased 1 basis point to 1.37%, but was up 2 basis points from last year. Our previous guidance and net charge-offs would be range bound with some quarterly variability is unchanged. We expect the fourth quarter charge-offs to be lower than the third quarter charge-offs. Also we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth.
Moving on to capital and liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital levels remain strong and are growing. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.16%, an increase of 22 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 76 basis points year-over-year.
At the end of the third quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately $11 million or 1.4% compared to the second quarter of 2016 and down 40 million shares or 5% compared to last year's third quarter.
During the quarter, we executed and accelerated share repurchase of $240 million, which reduced the share count by 10.98 million shares. This repurchase includes our 2016 FICO repurchases as well as the third quarter after-tax cash flows realized from the Vantiv TRA termination and settlement.
Our book value and tangible book value are up 12% and 13% respectively year-over-year. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be in the 23.5% to 24.5% range.
This quarter, we would be finalizing our 2017 financial plan as well as our outlook for Project North Star, which is a 3-year project. As Greg said, we expect Project North Star to contribute meaningfully to our base performance, which we expect to improve independently compared to our more recent performance.
The priorities embedded within the North Star project are an intense focus on expense management, smart balance sheet management and capital efficiency and revenue growth initiatives in high return businesses. These expectations include higher than historical growth in personal lending, including credit cards, expansion of our middle market and vertical businesses in commercial and widening the scope and scale in our capital markets businesses.
Expense savings should include lower infrastructure and delivery costs in IT, lower total compensation costs and other operational expense savings in workspace management, legal work and savings related to a more efficient data infrastructure and end-to-end process redesign. This quarter we are working on finalizing our 2017 financial plan as well as the construct of our Project North Star. Our goal is to share our expectations with you later this quarter and more in our January call. We have included the updated outlook on Slide 11 for your reference. And with that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A."

They continue to be cautious, reticent about making significant investments. I think that you have seen some of that play out in the lower M&A activity that we've seen as we've headed further into the year. That uncertainty also revolves around questions of the political, what's going on with China, Brexit, the EU-type issues. So those are certainly coloring some of the investments that we're seeing. We did clearly see a slower production in the third quarter, but I would see that as a little bit more seasonal, which we typically see lower levels in July and August. So I'd say it was more pronounced this third quarter, however, with the things that we're doing, investing in our verticals, new businesses and frankly, we've got some geographies, some markets that are performing very well. I would expect that we would continue to see loan growth at a good stable rate on a go-forward basis. We've got a great business model, one that clearly has been well received in the marketplace, our advisory base relationship model as long as that's embraced and we're seeing that reflect it in deeper client relationships that's helping us to drive fee income."

As Tayfun mentioned, the third quarter walk is what we would expect some of these to recur in the fourth quarter. So from the second quarter to the third quarter, loan yield expansion was 1 basis point of improvement and then the investment portfolio discount accretion was another 2 basis points on top of that, and then that was offset by the day count, in fact of negative 1 basis point and the debt funding impacts of negative 2 basis points. So what we expect going forward for the fourth quarter, obviously has been an active year on the debt side for us and we've refinanced all of our maturities for the year. So the debt you can expect to be pretty quiet, but the loan yield expansion that we've seen every quarter this year, we expect to continue into the fourth quarter and that for us is driven by C&I and auto yields, they both increased 3 basis points in the third quarter and then the one anomaly from the third quarter will be the investment portfolio had tremendous performance in the third quarter with the discount accretion. You saw that as how we're obviously pleased with how we're positioned on the portfolio, but that should normalize in the fourth quarter just given the faster speeds in the third quarter than what we're expecting in the fourth quarter so that would be a little bit of headwind for us in the fourth quarter. But I think the loan yields and the other actions we've taken to generate either a stable NIM or perhaps down a basis point and that assumes there is no said increase in the fourth quarter."

And we've talked every quarter about whether we were or we're not going to reinvest cash flows out of the portfolio in the third quarter. We didn't like the entry points we were seeing and so we didn't reinvest over half the cash flows from the portfolio, but the total level of cash flows that come off the portfolio are a pretty low level as a percent of our book relative to our peers. And that's really where you can dig in and see when folks are invested in pass-through securities you have extension risk and you have pre-payment risk and the bullet locked out cash flow play that we have been running for over 2 years and talking you about that, really benefits in the environment that we're seeing today. And that's why we're very pleased with how we're positioned. We're obviously, over long-term time horizon going to be subject to market yields and next year that will be about a 2 basis point NIM impact, the rates were to stay where they were today.

So I think on the high side, it'd be 8 and then we're looking at this more in the 6 range. But yes, we are positioned that it would be very beneficial to us and then as Tayfun said, part of the change that occurred from 4Q '15 to where we are today on the margin was in a large part driven by the $3.7 billion of debt maturities we had this year, and now that, next year, we're at a $1.2 billion level of maturities that was really the biggest influence on the margin compression this year that, that obviously would not repeat.

It's a -- it's all we have left. We're essentially out of the coal business. Our real estate exposure relative to our peers is much lower and is underwritten primarily to national and large regional developers, we believe at a very, very accretive manner. And our energy book as we've talked about before is 2% of our total book. We are looking at and maybe $60 million to $80 million of losses in energy that's over the next 8 to 9 quarters. So we've taken very deliberate actions with the work we're doing, coordinated with Lars on the commercial side to reposition this balance sheet to ensure that as we move towards the next recession, we're far better in control and in a far better position to be very successful in managing credit through the cycle. And so all of these things are, I think are pretty self-evident today. Our nonaccrual loans, again we've talked about before, it continued to come down quarter after quarter.

The qualification of the improvements in returns translates to a roughly $800 million type pretax income improvement between now and 2019. So the way we think about it is, there is a base performance uplift from the businesses that we have and in a  base case scenario, probably roughly it's about, let's call it a $3 million to $4 million. We can do that by managing the expenses and then growing the revenues that already in play. And then, we look at certain balance sheet optimization targets that we are establishing. That probably, I don't know let's call it sort of in the $100 million to $150 million range and then roughly another $150 million to $200 million in fee income growth. So that leaves somewhere around $150 million or so in expenses. These are broad numbers. We will share more details with you.  The timing of the expense saves will start coming in, in 2017, some of them are already in play, where you obviously done major restructuring. And I think it will accelerate into 2018 and '19. In some of the projects underlying expense day projects relate to the commercial business and enter and redesign that project is kicking off. It's going to have somewhat of a delayed impact, but again we would see probably a more meaningful save in 2018 and then there are other infrastructure investments that we're making.

So we're going to look at this every single year, we'll continue to test against it, pointing it through the lens of those 50 different variables we assess, and we'll continue to make adjustments to our branch infrastructure.

Where we've had the issues and where most of our peers I think have had issues had been overreliance on the enterprise value lending, financing M&A transactions and deals that went sideways. So when they went sideways, the problem is the loss and then the default is very high. That's our prior experience. And as a result of that, we have been very judicious and going through as Lars just talked about and looking at all our client relationships, looking at our sponsor relationships, looking at the types of credits that we would finance in a leverage environment, industries that we should consider and industries probably cyclical industries, for example, we probably shouldn't consider financing in leverage environment. So we talk about $1.4 billion reclassifying or leaving the books, it's the highest risk piece that we focus on which are enterprise value deals, highly leveraged deals, clients who don't fit our risk profile, and leverage themselves out of our comfort zone. And those are the credits that we are moving out. So whether it's 10% or 20%, to me, it's a more meaningful number than that, because we're taking the highest risk slice in the portfolio and that's leaving the books and what remains is a portfolio that we think is performing very well, we've clients that we know well, we respect well, we have a great history with them through cycles and they have the ability to manage levers, because they've proven it over time and it's the like kind of leverage in an industry that's much more stable versus much more cyclical. So I think, we know this pays well. We are repositioning ourselves in a place where we can continue to be delivering leverage finance to the right clients, right relationships, the right returns, about lot less volatility than what we've had in the past."

And we're seeing that happen and play out on a go-forward basis. So I would just underscore, as I look across almost every business line that we have in the Commercial Bank, whether it be the stabilized or slightly increased and in some cases moderately increased our core loan spreads, which has allowed our company really to benefit from a large part of the rise that we've seen in LIBOR, wherein some institutions, you've seen some of that absorbed way with thinner spreads.  Let me tell you something, the market is no easier today from a competitive environment perspective than it was several quarters ago. In fact, I would submit that it is more aggressive today and smaller banks are going up market, larger banks are going down market and non-banks are playing at levels we haven't seen before.

We thank all of you for joining us this morning. As you can see on Page 3 of the presentation, we reported third quarter net income to common shareholders of $501 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.65. During the quarter, some no",1117,"Thanks, Sameer. We thank all of you for joining us this morning. As you can see on Page 3 of the presentation, we reported third quarter net income to common shareholders of $501 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.65. During the quarter, some notable items resulted a net positive $0.22 impact reported earnings per share, Tayfun will provide further details in his opening comments.
During the quarter, we continued to focus on North Star initiative. Our Q3 results provide a further evidence of the progress we are making. Our net interest margin was well managed and stable sequentially reflecting our focus on higher-quality customer relationships. Adjusted fee income, excluding MSR evaluation adjustments was up 4% year-over-year and the growth rate has accelerated since the beginning of the year. Expenses were down 1% this quarter compared to second quarter 2016. During the quarter, credit quality remained stable with a decrease in both nonperforming loans and criticized asset levels for the second quarter in a row. The slight elevation in our charge-offs primarily reflects quarterly volatility from the low levels we have been experiencing.
We expect the benign credit environment to continue for the foreseeable future. Production metrics continue to be strong with mortgage volume up $2.9 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 27% from last year. Q3 volume represented the highest level of quarterly originations in the last 3 years.
In our Commercial business, we remained focused on higher-quality relationships that will enable our business to outperform through the cycle. As a result, commercial loan production per relationship manager is up 7% and fees per relationship manager up 22% on a year-to-date basis.  Our overall commercial loan balances reflect the softer loan demand which persisted during the quarter.
In regards to the environment, we will continue to focus on relationships that meet our return objectives. We're also investing in developing new origination channels. For example, during the quarter, we announced our strategic alliance with GreenSky, our investment in and partnership with GreenSky will help us to efficiently generate additional consumer loan volumes that will allow us to leverage the technology platform in existing merchant relationships.
While we continue to invest for growth in our businesses, we recognize that this remains a challenging environment for quality revenue growth. Given the limited support from a broader economic environment, we need to maintain a strong focus on expense management. There are ongoing reviews across business and staff functions, we have already taken significant steps to reduce our expense base.
We completed the sale and consolidating of 108 branches this year, which is expected to drive approximately $60 million in annualized cost savings. Last month, we announced plans to sell and consolidate an additional 42 bank branches, which should generate incremental cost savings of $12 million annually.
As a result, total branches are expected to be down 12% since we began this process late last year. We expect these actions to generate run rate expense savings of $72 million annually. With rapid changes in technology and customer behavior, we will continue to implement our omni-channel strategy. We believe this will allow us to further optimize our branch network to best serve the needs of our customers.
We're also making the necessary technology investments to enhance our digital and operational capabilities. Our investments in the digital channel are paying off. In the third quarter, approximately 20% of consumer deposits were made using our mobile app compared to 16% a year ago. Overall, we have seen a 25% increase in mobile usage year-over-year. We have also seen 150% increase year-over-year in checking and savings accounts opened online.
We expect to continue making investments to drive higher digital adoption and create a more integrated customer experience while creating efficiencies for Fifth Third.
To optimize workspace utilization, we are evaluating non-branch facilities for additional efficiencies. During the quarter, we sold one of our Michigan facilities, which generated $11 million pretax gain. We are working on similar opportunities to reduce the expense run rate or improving the overall work environment for our employees.
We also renegotiated key vendor contracts during the quarter as disclosed earlier. As a result of our strong execution and focus on expense management, we now expect year-over-year expense growth to be sub 4% in 2016 compared to our original guidance of 4.5% to 5% at the start of the year. The actions we are taking should help us achieve positive operating leverage in 2017. Although near-term expense management is at the top of our priority list, we are also maintaining a long-term perspective on our strategic plans.
During the third quarter, we formally launched Project North Star to align our entire organization towards a higher and more sustainable level of profitability within the next 3 years. Our energies are focused on ensuring the right mix of expense reductions, key revenue enhancement opportunities and balance sheet optimization in order to achieve our ROTCE targets.
Assuming the current operating environment persists, we would expect to achieve a 12% to 14% ROTCE run rate by the end of 2019.
We expect the contributions from Project North Star to be additive to the improvements that we're already making in our base run rate. These initiatives will leverage our strength in middle market lending, industry verticals, with specialty lending areas in our commercial business. And in consumer business growth initiatives in mortgage banking and personal lending will provide support for more balanced growth in our overall loan portfolio. We continue to expand our capabilities in businesses such as capital markets, insurance, and wealth management that generate attractive returns.
Initiatives such as our commercial end-to-end process redesign project will help generate additional efficiencies while improving the overall customer experience. We intend to achieve these targets without changing our risk appetite or our ongoing discipline in maintaining a strong balance sheet.
Our capital and liquidity levels remain strong and improved from last quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio reached 10.16% from 9.94% at the end of the second quarter. And our liquidity coverage ratio was 115%, 25% above the current requirement. 
As previously disclosed, the Federal Reserve did not object to an increase in our common dividend of $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter.
In summary, I was pleased with the solid results we generated despite soft economic conditions. Our results demonstrate the progress we are making toward our targets under Project North Star as well as our longer-term strategic goals. Also I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication and for keeping the customer at the center of everything we do.
With that I will turn over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter operating results and current outlook."
270961,384405077,1058131,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. As Greg said, overall we are pleased with our results in the current economic environment. The growth in our net interest income,",2368,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. As Greg said, overall we are pleased with our results in the current economic environment. The growth in our net interest income, the stability of the net interest margin and the decline in our expenses are indicative of our focus on improving shareholder returns.
For the third quarter, there was a net positive impact of $0.22 per share resulting from several items. The most significant item was a $280 million pretax gain from the termination and settlement of certain Vantiv TRA gross cash flows and the expected obligation to terminate and settle remaining TRA gross cash flows.
Our underlying fee revenues were solid during the quarter. Mortgage origination and pass through fees were 31% higher in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis.
Corporate Banking revenues were seasonally down slightly from our robust second quarter as we had previously indicated.
Expenses continue to be tightly controlled as we continue to look for efficiencies throughout the organization. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in overall key credit risk indicators is supportive of the benign credit outlook. 
So with that, let's move to Page 5 for the balance sheet discussion. Average commercial loan balances decreased 1% sequentially and increased about 1% year-over-year. The sequential decline reflected some softness in C&I loan demand and was consistent with industry trends. Our spreads widened as we continued to reposition and optimize the portfolio into a more attractive risk return profile that we believe will be more resilient in an economic downturn. 
Our C&I yield has increased every quarter since the third quarter of last year. CRE growth of $354 million this quarter partially offset some of the decline in C&I balances. As we discussed before, in construction as well as in perm lending, our teams are cognizant of valuations and supply-demand dynamics created by the lack of attractive investment alternatives. Our disciplined client selection and credit underwriting in CRE will continue to rely on stringent standards.
Average consumer loans decreased $78 million from last quarter and were down 2% year-over-year. Auto loans were down 3% from last quarter and 12% year-over-year in line with our lower origination targets and focus on improving risk-adjusted returns in this business.
Our strategy so far this year has resulted in higher returns on assets and capital than our initial expectations in our indirect auto business.
Residential Mortgage loans grew by 3% sequentially and 10% year-over-year as we kept jumbo mortgages, ARMs as well as certain 10-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages on our balance sheet during the quarter.
Our Residential Mortgage originations were up 7% from last quarter and 27% year-over-year.
During the quarter, our origination mix was split roughly in half between purchase and refinance volumes. About 70% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels, and the remainder were originated through the corresponding channel.
Our home equity loan portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year as low -- loan paydowns exceeded strong origination volume. Our originations this quarter were up 15% compared to last quarter and 20% higher year-over-year.
Our goal is to achieve a better balance between commercial loan growth and consumer loan growth. Our new partnership with GreenSky should help enhance our ability to generate consumer loans, especially as we start to implement their technology in our own business.
In addition, our new initiatives in credit card lending should also support stronger growth going forward. Average investment securities decreased by $239 million in the third quarter or 1% sequentially.
Our yield widened by 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter, partly due to higher discount accretion during the quarter. Average core deposits decreased $98 million from the second quarter. Average core deposit balances were negatively impacted by approximately $302 million due to the Pennsylvania branches sold in April. Excluding these deposits, average core deposits were flat on a sequential basis and up 1% on a year-over-year basis. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 115% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving to NII on Page 6 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $5 million sequentially to $913 million. The increase was primarily driven by improved investment portfolio yields, an increase in 1-month LIBOR and the impact of the day count. The increase was partially offset by the full quarter impact of $1.25 billion of unsecured debt issued late in the second quarter and lower average C&I loan balances.
The NIM was stable from the second quarter at 2.88% and wider than we forecasted in July. The positive impact of higher-yielding investments and an increase in 1-month LIBOR was offset by the full quarter impact of the second quarter debt issuance and the day count.
Our outlook for NIM has improved relative to our July forecast. With no rate hikes for the rest of the year, we now expect the NIM to be stable to down 1 basis point in the fourth quarter, which includes the full quarter impact of our September debt issuance.
On a full-year basis, we would expect the NIM of about 2.89%, which is up 1 basis point from 2015. We expect NII to be down slightly in the fourth quarter from the full quarter impact of our third quarter debt issuance and more normalized discount accretion on the investment securities portfolio. We are still projecting full year NII growth of 2% despite ongoing challenges with the low environment -- the rate environment and stable loan growth.
We will continue to execute a balanced interest rate risk management strategy as we have over the last 3 years. Our NIM outperformance should not imply that we have outsized exposure to a decline in portfolio yields. We estimate that in a static interest rate environment, the investment portfolio would only have a detrimental impact of 2 basis points in 2017 on the Bancorp's net interest margin. A key contributor to this stability is that approximately 48% of our investment portfolio consists of lockout and bullet securities. Keeping nearly our entire investment portfolio in the available for sale category has also allowed us to maintain some flexibility to reposition the investment portfolio in response to changing market conditions.
Shifting to fees on Page 7 of the presentation. Third quarter noninterest income was $840 million compared with $599 million in the second quarter. Our fee income, adjusted for items disclosed in our earnings release was $596 million. Also excluding the impact of the net MSR valuation, fee revenue was up 2% versus last quarter and up 4% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Despite the environmental factors, our underlying fee revenues were solid, mortgage production gains on sale were up 13% quarter-over-quarter reflecting the robust origination volume that I mentioned earlier, and a 39 basis points increase in the gain on sale margin.
Mortgage banking net revenue of $66 million was down $9 million sequentially, primarily due to net MSR valuation adjustments during the quarter. Net MSR valuation adjustments were negative $9 million compared to a positive $6 million last quarter. We expect our fourth quarter mortgage origination revenue to be seasonally lower than the third quarter, but 5% to 10% above last year's fourth quarter.
Corporate Banking fees of $111 million were seasonally down $6 million or 5% sequentially reflecting decreases in loan syndication revenue and foreign exchange fees, partially offset by an increase in corporate bond underwriting revenue. Fees were up 7% on a year-over-year basis, driven by a strong corporate bond underwriting and loan syndication revenues.
The expansion highlights are efforts to increase the scale and scope of our product offering in line with the relationship driven model that we are executing. We expect Corporate Banking fees in the fourth quarter to be stable relative to the third quarter.
Deposit service charges increased 4% from the second quarter, driven by a 6% increase in retail service charges as well as a 3% increase in commercial service charges. The increase in retail service charges reflected seasonally higher customer activity. Deposit service charges decreased 1% relative to the third quarter of 2015 reflecting reduced monthly service charges as part of our new consumer checking account lineup.
Total wealth and asset management revenue of $101 million was flat sequentially as market value improvements were offset by lower transaction-driven retail brokerage fees. Revenues declined 2% relative to the third quarter of 2015 as investment management and institutional fees were more than offset by lower brokerage fees.
We discussed the third quarter impact of the Vantiv TRA transactions in July during our second quarter earnings call. These transactions were very beneficial from both risk management as well as shareholder return optimization perspectives.
As you may recall, our prior guidance for 2016 called for a 5% annual adjusted fee growth off a base of $2.3 billion for 2015. This base excluded impact from Vantiv as previously discussed, which are mentioned on Slide 11 of our presentation.
Excluding Vantiv-related items, the Visa total return swap adjustments and any impacts from the branch sales and consolidations, we continue to expect annual fees growth of 5% growth for the full year.
Next, I'd like to discuss noninterest expense on Page 8 of the presentation. Expenses of $973 million were $10 million lower than in the second quarter, including the impact of the FDIC surcharge. This reflects a decrease in compensation-related expenses and employee benefits resulting from the impact of the second quarter of 2016 retirement eligibility change as well as other reductions in operational expenses.
As Greg stated earlier, we are making good progress in executing on key strategic initiatives and managing our expenses at the same time. We now expect expense growth to be below 4% level compared to our July guidance of 4% and 4.5% to 5% at the start of the year.
Once again, I would like to remind you that our guidance includes the impact of the increased amortization of our low income housing investments, which most of our peers reflect in their tax line. On an annual basis, this line item contributes nearly 3% to our efficiency ratio. It also includes an increase in the provision for unfunded commitments and the impact of one-time benefits related to settlement of legal cases in 2015. These 3 items make up roughly 2% of the forecasted increase in expenses.
As we have previously discussed, generating positive operating leverage is our top priority going into 2017, and our recent trends are supportive of that outcome.
Turning to credit results on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were $107 million or 45 basis points in the third quarter compared to $87 million and 37 basis points in the second quarter of 2016, and $188 million and 80 basis points in the third quarter a year ago. The sequential increase in charge-offs was primarily due to a $22 million increase in C&I net charge-offs.
Total nonperforming loans, excluding loans held-for-sale were $586 million, down $107 million or 15% from the previous quarter resulting in an NPL ratio of 63 basis points. Commercial NPLs decreased $94 million or 17% from the second quarter. In addition, our criticized assets have steadily improved over the last four quarters and our criticized asset ratio is now at the lowest point since the third quarter of 2007.
The strength in the key credit metrics indicate continued overall stability, but given the absolute low levels, there may be volatility in some periods periodically.
Our provision was $11 million lower than the last quarter, partially driven by improving nonperforming loan and criticized asset levels. Our resulting reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases decreased 1 basis point to 1.37%, but was up 2 basis points from last year. Our previous guidance and net charge-offs would be range bound with some quarterly variability is unchanged. We expect the fourth quarter charge-offs to be lower than the third quarter charge-offs. Also we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth.
Moving on to capital and liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital levels remain strong and are growing. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.16%, an increase of 22 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 76 basis points year-over-year.
At the end of the third quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately 11 million shares or 1.4% compared to the second quarter of 2016 and down 40 million shares or 5% compared to last year's third quarter.
During the quarter, we executed and accelerated share repurchase of $240 million, which reduced the share count by 10.98 million shares. This repurchase includes our 2016 CCAR repurchases as well as the third quarter after-tax cash flows realized from the Vantiv TRA termination and settlement.
Our book value and tangible book value are up 12% and 13% respectively year-over-year. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be in the 23.5% to 24.5% range.
This quarter, we will be finalizing our 2017 financial plan as well as our outlook for Project North Star, which is a 3-year project. As Greg said, we expect Project North Star to contribute meaningfully to our base performance, which we expect to improve independently compared to our more recent performance.
The priorities embedded within the North Star project are an intense focus on expense management, smart balance sheet management and capital efficiency and revenue growth initiatives in high return businesses. These expectations include higher than historical growth in personal lending, including credit cards, expansion of our middle market and vertical businesses in commercial and widening the scope and scale in our capital markets businesses.
Expense savings should include lower infrastructure and delivery costs in IT, lower total compensation costs and other operational expense savings in workspace management, legal work and savings related to a more efficient data infrastructure and end-to-end process redesign. This quarter we are working on finalizing our 2017 financial plan as well as the construct of our Project North Star. Our goal is to share our expectations with you later this quarter and more in our January call. We have included the updated outlook on Slide 11 for your reference. And with that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A."

They continue to be cautious, reticent about making significant investments. I think that you have seen some of that play out in the lower M&A activity that we've seen as we've headed further into the year. That uncertainty also revolves around questions of the political, what's going on with China, Brexit, the EU-type issues. So those are certainly coloring some of the investments that we're seeing. We did clearly see a slower production in the third quarter, but I would see that as a little bit more seasonal, which we typically see lower levels in July and August. So I would say it was more pronounced this third quarter, however, with the things that we're doing, investing in our verticals, new businesses and frankly, we've got some geographies, some markets that are performing very well. I would expect that we would continue to see loan growth at a good stable rate on a go-forward basis. We've got a great business model, one that clearly is being well received in the marketplace, our advisory base relationship model is one that's embraced and we're seeing that reflected in deeper client relationships that's helping us to drive fee income."

As Tayfun mentioned, the third quarter walk is what we would expect some of these to recur in the fourth quarter. So from the second quarter to the third quarter, loan yield expansion was 1 basis point of improvement and then the investment portfolio discount accretion was another 2 basis points on top of that, and then that was offset by the day count impact of negative 1 basis point and the debt funding impact of negative 2 basis points. So what we expect going forward for the fourth quarter, obviously has been an active year on the debt side for us and we've refinanced all of our maturities for the year. So the debt you can expect to be pretty quiet, but the loan yield expansion that we've seen every quarter this year, we expect to continue into the fourth quarter and that for us is driven by C&I and auto yields, they both increased 3 basis points in the third quarter and then the one anomaly from the third quarter will be the investment portfolio had tremendous performance in the third quarter with the discount accretion. You saw that as how we're obviously pleased with how we're positioned on the portfolio, but that should normalize in the fourth quarter just given the faster speeds in the third quarter than what we're expecting in the fourth quarter so that would be a little bit of headwind for us in the fourth quarter. But I think the loan yields and the other actions we've taken to generate either a stable NIM or perhaps down a basis point and that assumes there is no Fed increase in the fourth quarter."

First off, we have done a lot of heavy lifting in our last year plus and really exiting out of all the sectors and focusing on profitability whether it be commodities, term loan fee [ph], leverage loans. We basically have pushed out close to almost $2 billion over the last year. So while that's going to abate as we go into 2017, 2018, a lot of heavy lifting is going to be done, and has been done this year. So what you can think about next year as we're looking at the forward forecast, we expect commercial loan growth to be close to nominal on GDP, maybe slightly north of that. On consumer, given some of our focus on indirect auto and bringing down the originations there we would expect that to be flat to slightly up next year as we focused on other opportunities such as mortgage and unsecured lending as Tayfun mentioned in his opening comments.

And we've talked every quarter about whether we were or we're not going to reinvest cash flows out of the portfolio in the third quarter.

When you dissect the margin transition from 4Q '15 to 1Q '16, we were up 6 bps. 8 bps of that actually was driven by the Fed move. So our view on a December 2016 move were to happen is probably going to be slightly less beneficial than the 8 basis points that we saw last year, just given the deposit rates maybe a little more competitive on the second move and each prospective move. So I think on the high side, it'd be 8 bps and then we're looking at this more in the 6 bps range. But yes, we are positioned that it would be very beneficial to us and then as Tayfun said, part of the change that occurred from 4Q '15 to where we are today on the margin was in a large part driven by the $3.7 billion of debt maturities we had this year, and now that, next year, we're at a $1.2 billion level of maturities that was really the biggest influence on the margin compression this year that, that obviously would not repeat.

That probably, I don't know let's call it sort of in the $100 million to $150 million range and then roughly another $150 million to $200 million in fee income growth. So that leaves somewhere around $150 million or so in expenses. These are broad numbers. We will share more details with you.  
The timing of the expense saves will start coming in, in 2017, some of them are already in play, you know we've obviously done major restructuring. And I think it will accelerate into 2018 and '19. In some of the projects underlying expense save projects relate to the commercial business and end-to-end redesign. That project is kicking off. It's going to have somewhat of a delayed impact, but again we would see probably a more meaningful save in 2018 and then there are other infrastructure investments that we're making. But that doesn't mean '17 does not have any of those. I think there are some expense initiatives in play that also will contribute to '17. And those are the types of details that we would like to share with you as we approach the year-end and then the beginning of the year."

Where we've had the issues and where most of our peers I think have had issues had been overreliance on the enterprise value lending, financing M&A transactions and deals that went sideways. And when they went sideways, the problem is the loss in the event of default is very high. That's our prior experience. And as a result of that, we have been very judicious and going through as Lars just talked about and looking at all our client relationships, looking at our sponsor relationships, looking at the types of credits that we would finance in a leveraged environment, industries that we should consider and industries, probably cyclical industries, for example, we probably shouldn't consider financing in leverage environment. So we talk about $1.4 billion reclassifying or leaving the books, it's the highest risk piece that we focus on which are enterprise value deals, highly leveraged deals, clients who don't fit our risk profile, and leverage themselves out of our comfort zone. And those are the credits that we are moving out. So whether it's 10% or 20%, to me, it's a more meaningful number than that, because we're taking the highest risk slice in the portfolio and that's leaving the books and what remains is a portfolio that we think is performing very well, we have clients that we know well, we respect well, we have a great history with them through cycles and they have the ability to manage leverage, because they've proven it over time and it's the right kind of leverage in an industry that's much more stable versus much more cyclical. So I think, we know this space well. We are repositioning ourselves in a place where we can continue to be delivering leverage finance to the right clients, right relationships, the right returns, with a lot less volatility than what we've had in the past."

This is about prudently using our capital and reinvesting it in the right kinds of relationships and it's not just about credit, it's about the entire relationship, it's about fee solutions and developing deep, strategic, advisory-type relationships. And we're seeing that happen and play out on a go-forward basis. 
So I will just underscore, as I look across almost every business line that we have in the Commercial Bank, whether it be the stabilized or slightly increased and in some cases moderately increased our core loan spreads, which has allowed our company really to benefit from a large part of the rise that we've seen in LIBOR, where in some institutions, you've seen some of that absorbed way with thinner spreads.  Let me tell you something, the market is no easier today from a competitive environment perspective than it was several quarters ago. In fact, I would submit that it is more aggressive today as smaller banks are going up market, larger banks are going down market and non-banks are playing at levels we haven't seen before. So we're going to have to be at our best, but frankly, we've got great bankers with great businesses, I've got a lot of confidence in them that we can continue not just for four quarters, but for the long term to produce."

As you can see on Page 3 of the presentation, we reported third quarter net income to common shareholders of $501 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.65. During the quarter, some notable items resulted a net positive $0.22 impact reported earnings per share, Tayfun will provide further details in his opening comments.
During the quarter, we continued to focus on North Star initiative. Our Q3 results provide a further evidence of the progress we are making. Our net interest margin was well managed and stable sequentially reflecting our focus on higher-quality customer relationships. Adjusted fee income, excluding MSR evaluation adjustments was up 4% year-over-year and the growth rate has accelerated since the beginning of the year. Expenses were down 1% this quarter compared to second quarter 2016. During the quarter, credit quality remained stable with a decrease in both nonperforming loans and criticized asset levels for the second quarter in a row. The slight elevation in our charge-offs primarily reflects quarterly volatility from the low levels we have been experiencing.
We expect the benign credit environment to continue for the foreseeable future. Production metrics continue to be strong with mortgage volume up $2.9 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 27% from last year. Q3 volume represented the highest level of quarterly originations in the last 3 years.
In our Commercial business, we remained focused on higher-quality relationships that will enable our business to outperform through the cycle. As a result, commercial loan production per relationship manager is up 7% and fees per relationship manager up 22% on a year-to-date basis.  Our overall commercial loan balances reflect the softer loan demand which persisted during the quarter.
In regards to the environment, we will continue to focus on relationships that meet our return objectives. We're also investing in developing new origination channels. For example, during the quarter, we announced our strategic alliance with GreenSky, our investment in and partnership with GreenSky will help us to efficiently generate additional consumer loan volumes that will allow us to leverage the technology platform in existing merchant relationships.
While we continue to invest for growth in our businesses, we recognize that this remains a challenging environment for quality revenue growth. Given the limited support from a broader economic environment, we need to maintain a strong focus on expense management. There are ongoing reviews across business and staff functions, we have already taken significant steps to reduce our expense base.
We completed the sale and consolidating of 108 branches this year, which is expected to drive approximately $60 million in annualized cost savings. Last month, we announced plans to sell and consolidate an additional 42 bank branches, which should generate incremental cost savings of $12 million annually.
As a result, total branches are expected to be down 12% since we began this process late last year. We expect these actions to generate run rate expense savings of $72 million annually. With rapid changes in technology and customer behavior, we will continue to implement our omni-channel strategy. We believe this will allow us to further optimize our branch network to best serve the needs of our customers.
We're also making the necessary technology investments to enhance our digital and operational capabilities. Our investments in the digital channel are paying off. In the third quarter, approximately 20% of consumer deposits were made using our mobile app compared to 16% a year ago. Overall, we have seen a 25% increase in mobile usage year-over-year. We have also seen 150% increase year-over-year in checking and savings accounts opened online.
We expect to continue making investments to drive higher digital adoption and create a more integrated customer experience while creating efficiencies for Fifth Third.
To optimize workspace utilization, we are evaluating non-branch facilities for additional efficiencies. During the quarter, we sold one of our Michigan facilities, which generated $11 million pretax gain. We are working on similar opportunities to reduce the expense run rate or improving the overall work environment for our employees.
We also renegotiated key vendor contracts during the quarter as disclosed earlier. As a result of our strong execution and focus on expense management, we now expect year-over-year expense growth to be sub 4% in 2016 compared to our original guidance of 4.5% to 5% at the start of the year. The actions we are taking should help us achieve positive operating leverage in 2017. Although near-term expense management is at the top of our priority list, we are also maintaining a long-term perspective on our strategic plans.
During the third quarter, we formally launched Project North Star to align our entire organization towards a higher and more sustainable level of profitability within the next 3 years. Our energies are focused on ensuring the right mix of expense reductions, key revenue enhancement opportunities and balance sheet optimization in order to achieve our ROTCE targets.
Assuming the current operating environment persists, we would expect to achieve a 12% to 14% ROTCE run rate by the end of 2019.
We expect the contributions from Project North Star to be additive to the improvements that we're already making in our base run rate. These initiatives will leverage our strength in middle market lending, industry verticals, with specialty lending areas in our commercial business. And in consumer business growth initiatives in mortgage banking and personal lending will provide support for more balanced growth in our overall loan portfolio. We continue to expand our capabilities in businesses such as capital markets, insurance, and wealth management that generate attractive returns.
Initiatives such as our commercial end-to-end process redesign project will help generate additional efficiencies while improving the overall customer experience. We intend to achieve these targets without changing our risk appetite or our ongoing discipline in maintaining a strong balance sheet.
Our capital and liquidity levels remain strong and improved from last quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio reached 10.16% from 9.94% at the end of the second quarter. And our liquidity coverage ratio was 115%, 25% above the current requirement. 
As previously disclosed, the Federal Reserve did not object to an increase in our common dividend of $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter.
In summary, I was pleased with the solid results we generated despite soft economic conditions. Our results demonstrate the progress we are making toward our targets under Project North Star as well as our longer-term strategic goals. Also I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication and for keeping the customer at the center of everything we do.
With that I will turn over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter operating results and current outlook."
270961,384405077,1058519,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. As Greg said, overall we are pleased with our results in the current economic environment. The growth in our net interest income,",2368,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation. As Greg said, overall we are pleased with our results in the current economic environment. The growth in our net interest income, the stability of the net interest margin and the decline in our expenses are indicative of our focus on improving shareholder returns.
For the third quarter, there was a net positive impact of $0.22 per share resulting from several items. The most significant item was a $280 million pretax gain from the termination and settlement of certain Vantiv TRA gross cash flows and the expected obligation to terminate and settle remaining TRA gross cash flows.
Our underlying fee revenues were solid during the quarter. Mortgage origination and pass through fees were 31% higher in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis.
Corporate Banking revenues were seasonally down slightly from our robust second quarter as we had previously indicated.
Expenses continue to be tightly controlled as we continue to look for efficiencies throughout the organization. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in overall key credit risk indicators is supportive of the benign credit outlook. 
So with that, let's move to Page 5 for the balance sheet discussion. Average commercial loan balances decreased 1% sequentially and increased about 1% year-over-year. The sequential decline reflected some softness in C&I loan demand and was consistent with industry trends. Our spreads widened as we continued to reposition and optimize the portfolio into a more attractive risk return profile that we believe will be more resilient in an economic downturn. 
Our C&I yield has increased every quarter since the third quarter of last year. CRE growth of $354 million this quarter partially offset some of the decline in C&I balances. As we discussed before, in construction as well as in perm lending, our teams are cognizant of valuations and supply-demand dynamics created by the lack of attractive investment alternatives. Our disciplined client selection and credit underwriting in CRE will continue to rely on stringent standards.
Average consumer loans decreased $78 million from last quarter and were down 2% year-over-year. Auto loans were down 3% from last quarter and 12% year-over-year in line with our lower origination targets and focus on improving risk-adjusted returns in this business.
Our strategy so far this year has resulted in higher returns on assets and capital than our initial expectations in our indirect auto business.
Residential Mortgage loans grew by 3% sequentially and 10% year-over-year as we kept jumbo mortgages, ARMs as well as certain 10-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages on our balance sheet during the quarter.
Our Residential Mortgage originations were up 7% from last quarter and 27% year-over-year.
During the quarter, our origination mix was split roughly in half between purchase and refinance volumes. About 70% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels, and the remainder were originated through the corresponding channel.
Our home equity loan portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year as low -- loan paydowns exceeded strong origination volume. Our originations this quarter were up 15% compared to last quarter and 20% higher year-over-year.
Our goal is to achieve a better balance between commercial loan growth and consumer loan growth. Our new partnership with GreenSky should help enhance our ability to generate consumer loans, especially as we start to implement their technology in our own business.
In addition, our new initiatives in credit card lending should also support stronger growth going forward. Average investment securities decreased by $239 million in the third quarter or 1% sequentially.
Our yield widened by 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter, partly due to higher discount accretion during the quarter. Average core deposits decreased $98 million from the second quarter. Average core deposit balances were negatively impacted by approximately $302 million due to the Pennsylvania branches sold in April. Excluding these deposits, average core deposits were flat on a sequential basis and up 1% on a year-over-year basis. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 115% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving to NII on Page 6 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $5 million sequentially to $913 million. The increase was primarily driven by improved investment portfolio yields, an increase in 1-month LIBOR and the impact of the day count. The increase was partially offset by the full quarter impact of $1.25 billion of unsecured debt issued late in the second quarter and lower average C&I loan balances.
The NIM was stable from the second quarter at 2.88% and wider than we forecasted in July. The positive impact of higher-yielding investments and an increase in 1-month LIBOR was offset by the full quarter impact of the second quarter debt issuance and the day count.
Our outlook for NIM has improved relative to our July forecast. With no rate hikes for the rest of the year, we now expect the NIM to be stable to down 1 basis point in the fourth quarter, which includes the full quarter impact of our September debt issuance.
On a full-year basis, we would expect the NIM of about 2.89%, which is up 1 basis point from 2015. We expect NII to be down slightly in the fourth quarter from the full quarter impact of our third quarter debt issuance and more normalized discount accretion on the investment securities portfolio. We are still projecting full year NII growth of 2% despite ongoing challenges with the low environment -- the rate environment and stable loan growth.
We will continue to execute a balanced interest rate risk management strategy as we have over the last 3 years. Our NIM outperformance should not imply that we have outsized exposure to a decline in portfolio yields. We estimate that in a static interest rate environment, the investment portfolio would only have a detrimental impact of 2 basis points in 2017 on the Bancorp's net interest margin. A key contributor to this stability is that approximately 48% of our investment portfolio consists of lockout and bullet securities. Keeping nearly our entire investment portfolio in the available for sale category has also allowed us to maintain some flexibility to reposition the investment portfolio in response to changing market conditions.
Shifting to fees on Page 7 of the presentation. Third quarter noninterest income was $840 million compared with $599 million in the second quarter. Our fee income, adjusted for items disclosed in our earnings release was $596 million. Also excluding the impact of the net MSR valuation, fee revenue was up 2% versus last quarter and up 4% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Despite the environmental factors, our underlying fee revenues were solid, mortgage production gains on sale were up 13% quarter-over-quarter reflecting the robust origination volume that I mentioned earlier, and a 39 basis points increase in the gain on sale margin.
Mortgage banking net revenue of $66 million was down $9 million sequentially, primarily due to net MSR valuation adjustments during the quarter. Net MSR valuation adjustments were negative $9 million compared to a positive $6 million last quarter. We expect our fourth quarter mortgage origination revenue to be seasonally lower than the third quarter, but 5% to 10% above last year's fourth quarter.
Corporate Banking fees of $111 million were seasonally down $6 million or 5% sequentially reflecting decreases in loan syndication revenue and foreign exchange fees, partially offset by an increase in corporate bond underwriting revenue. Fees were up 7% on a year-over-year basis, driven by a strong corporate bond underwriting and loan syndication revenues.
The expansion highlights are efforts to increase the scale and scope of our product offering in line with the relationship driven model that we are executing. We expect Corporate Banking fees in the fourth quarter to be stable relative to the third quarter.
Deposit service charges increased 4% from the second quarter, driven by a 6% increase in retail service charges as well as a 3% increase in commercial service charges. The increase in retail service charges reflected seasonally higher customer activity. Deposit service charges decreased 1% relative to the third quarter of 2015 reflecting reduced monthly service charges as part of our new consumer checking account lineup.
Total wealth and asset management revenue of $101 million was flat sequentially as market value improvements were offset by lower transaction-driven retail brokerage fees. Revenues declined 2% relative to the third quarter of 2015 as investment management and institutional fees were more than offset by lower brokerage fees.
We discussed the third quarter impact of the Vantiv TRA transactions in July during our second quarter earnings call. These transactions were very beneficial from both risk management as well as shareholder return optimization perspectives.
As you may recall, our prior guidance for 2016 called for a 5% annual adjusted fee growth off a base of $2.3 billion for 2015. This base excluded impact from Vantiv as previously discussed, which are mentioned on Slide 11 of our presentation.
Excluding Vantiv-related items, the Visa total return swap adjustments and any impacts from the branch sales and consolidations, we continue to expect annual fees growth of 5% growth for the full year.
Next, I'd like to discuss noninterest expense on Page 8 of the presentation. Expenses of $973 million were $10 million lower than in the second quarter, including the impact of the FDIC surcharge. This reflects a decrease in compensation-related expenses and employee benefits resulting from the impact of the second quarter of 2016 retirement eligibility change as well as other reductions in operational expenses.
As Greg stated earlier, we are making good progress in executing on key strategic initiatives and managing our expenses at the same time. We now expect expense growth to be below 4% level compared to our July guidance of 4% and 4.5% to 5% at the start of the year.
Once again, I would like to remind you that our guidance includes the impact of the increased amortization of our low income housing investments, which most of our peers reflect in their tax line. On an annual basis, this line item contributes nearly 3% to our efficiency ratio. It also includes an increase in the provision for unfunded commitments and the impact of one-time benefits related to settlement of legal cases in 2015. These 3 items make up roughly 2% of the forecasted increase in expenses.
As we have previously discussed, generating positive operating leverage is our top priority going into 2017, and our recent trends are supportive of that outcome.
Turning to credit results on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were $107 million or 45 basis points in the third quarter compared to $87 million and 37 basis points in the second quarter of 2016, and $188 million and 80 basis points in the third quarter a year ago. The sequential increase in charge-offs was primarily due to a $22 million increase in C&I net charge-offs.
Total nonperforming loans, excluding loans held-for-sale were $586 million, down $107 million or 15% from the previous quarter resulting in an NPL ratio of 63 basis points. Commercial NPLs decreased $94 million or 17% from the second quarter. In addition, our criticized assets have steadily improved over the last four quarters and our criticized asset ratio is now at the lowest point since the third quarter of 2007.
The strength in the key credit metrics indicate continued overall stability, but given the absolute low levels, there may be volatility in some periods periodically.
Our provision was $11 million lower than the last quarter, partially driven by improving nonperforming loan and criticized asset levels. Our resulting reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases decreased 1 basis point to 1.37%, but was up 2 basis points from last year. Our previous guidance and net charge-offs would be range bound with some quarterly variability is unchanged. We expect the fourth quarter charge-offs to be lower than the third quarter charge-offs. Also we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth.
Moving on to capital and liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital levels remain strong and are growing. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.16%, an increase of 22 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 76 basis points year-over-year.
At the end of the third quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately 11 million shares or 1.4% compared to the second quarter of 2016 and down 40 million shares or 5% compared to last year's third quarter.
During the quarter, we executed and accelerated share repurchase of $240 million, which reduced the share count by 10.98 million shares. This repurchase includes our 2016 CCAR repurchases as well as the third quarter after-tax cash flows realized from the Vantiv TRA termination and settlement.
Our book value and tangible book value are up 12% and 13% respectively year-over-year. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be in the 23.5% to 24.5% range.
This quarter, we will be finalizing our 2017 financial plan as well as our outlook for Project North Star, which is a 3-year project. As Greg said, we expect Project North Star to contribute meaningfully to our base performance, which we expect to improve independently compared to our more recent performance.
The priorities embedded within the North Star project are an intense focus on expense management, smart balance sheet management and capital efficiency and revenue growth initiatives in high return businesses. These expectations include higher than historical growth in personal lending, including credit cards, expansion of our middle market and vertical businesses in commercial and widening the scope and scale in our capital markets businesses.
Expense savings should include lower infrastructure and delivery costs in IT, lower total compensation costs and other operational expense savings in workspace management, legal work and savings related to a more efficient data infrastructure and end-to-end process redesign. This quarter we are working on finalizing our 2017 financial plan as well as the construct of our Project North Star. Our goal is to share our expectations with you later this quarter and more in our January call. We have included the updated outlook on Slide 11 for your reference. And with that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A."

They continue to be cautious, reticent about making significant investments. I think that you have seen some of that play out in the lower M&A activity that we've seen as we've headed further into the year. That uncertainty also revolves around questions of the political, what's going on with China, Brexit, the EU-type issues. So those are certainly coloring some of the investments that we're seeing. We did clearly see a slower production in the third quarter, but I would see that as a little bit more seasonal, which we typically see lower levels in July and August. So I would say it was more pronounced this third quarter, however, with the things that we're doing, investing in our verticals, new businesses and frankly, we've got some geographies, some markets that are performing very well. I would expect that we would continue to see loan growth at a good stable rate on a go-forward basis. We've got a great business model, one that clearly is being well received in the marketplace, our advisory base relationship model is one that's embraced and we're seeing that reflected in deeper client relationships that's helping us to drive fee income."

As Tayfun mentioned, the third quarter walk is what we would expect some of these to recur in the fourth quarter. So from the second quarter to the third quarter, loan yield expansion was 1 basis point of improvement and then the investment portfolio discount accretion was another 2 basis points on top of that, and then that was offset by the day count impact of negative 1 basis point and the debt funding impact of negative 2 basis points. So what we expect going forward for the fourth quarter, obviously has been an active year on the debt side for us and we've refinanced all of our maturities for the year. So the debt you can expect to be pretty quiet, but the loan yield expansion that we've seen every quarter this year, we expect to continue into the fourth quarter and that for us is driven by C&I and auto yields, they both increased 3 basis points in the third quarter and then the one anomaly from the third quarter will be the investment portfolio had tremendous performance in the third quarter with the discount accretion. You saw that as how we're obviously pleased with how we're positioned on the portfolio, but that should normalize in the fourth quarter just given the faster speeds in the third quarter than what we're expecting in the fourth quarter so that would be a little bit of headwind for us in the fourth quarter. But I think the loan yields and the other actions we've taken to generate either a stable NIM or perhaps down a basis point and that assumes there is no Fed increase in the fourth quarter."

So while that's going to abate as we go into 2017, 2018, a lot of heavy lifting is going to be done, and has been done this year. So what you can think about next year as we're looking at the forward forecast, we expect commercial loan growth to be close to nominal on GDP, maybe slightly north of that. On consumer, given some of our focus on indirect auto and bringing down the originations there we would expect that to be flat to slightly up next year as we focused on other opportunities such as mortgage and unsecured lending as Tayfun mentioned in his opening comments.

And we've talked every quarter about whether we were or we're not going to reinvest cash flows out of the portfolio in the third quarter. We didn't like the entry points we were seeing and so we didn't reinvest over half the cash flows from the portfolio, but the total level of cash flows that come off the portfolio are a pretty low level as a percent of our book relative to our peers. And that's really where you can dig in and see when folks are invested in pass-through securities you have extension risk and you have pre-payment risk and the bullet and locked out cash flow play that we have been running for over 2 years and talking you about that, really benefits in the environment that we're seeing today. And that's why we're very pleased with how we're positioned. We're obviously, over long-term time horizon going to be subject to market yields and next year that will be about a 2 basis point NIM impact, if rates were to stay where they were today.

So I think on the high side, it'd be 8 bps and then we're looking at this more in the 6 bps range. But yes, we are positioned that it would be very beneficial to us and then as Tayfun said, part of the change that occurred from 4Q '15 to where we are today on the margin was in a large part driven by the $3.7 billion of debt maturities we had this year, and now that, next year, we're at a $1.2 billion level of maturities that was really the biggest influence on the margin compression this year that, that obviously would not repeat.

We've taken about $1.4 billion off the leverage book in the last 12 months and that was a high-risk piece of the leverage book. Our commodity exposure today and the outstandings is $35 million. That's it, it's all we have left. We're essentially out of the coal business. Our real estate exposure relative to our peers is much lower and is underwritten primarily to national and large regional developers, we believe in a very, very prudent manner. And our energy book as we've talked about before is 2% of our total book. We are looking at and maybe $60 million to $80 million of losses in energy that's over the next 8 to 9 quarters. So we've taken very deliberate actions with the work we're doing, coordinated with Lars on the commercial side to reposition this balance sheet to ensure that as we move towards the next recession, we're far better in control and in a far better position to be very successful in managing credit through the cycle. And so all of these things are, I think are pretty self-evident today. Our nonaccrual loans, again we've talked about before, have continued to come down quarter after quarter. We'll see some lumpiness like everybody does, but for the most part our outlook is very positive for 2017 relative to credit based on all the different things and the actions we've taken very deliberately with a lot of discipline in the last 18 months."

The qualification of the improvements in returns translates to a roughly $800 million type pretax income improvement between now and 2019. So the way we think about it is, there is a base performance uplift from the businesses that we have and in a  base case scenario, probably roughly it's about, let's call it a $300 million to $400 million. We can do that by managing the expenses and then growing the revenues that already in play. And then, we look at certain balance sheet optimization targets that we are establishing. That probably, I don't know let's call it sort of in the $100 million to $150 million range and then roughly another $150 million to $200 million in fee income growth. So that leaves somewhere around $150 million or so in expenses. These are broad numbers. We will share more details with you.  
The timing of the expense saves will start coming in, in 2017, some of them are already in play, you know we've obviously done major restructuring. And I think it will accelerate into 2018 and '19. In some of the projects underlying expense save projects relate to the commercial business and end-to-end redesign. That project is kicking off. It's going to have somewhat of a delayed impact, but again we would see probably a more meaningful save in 2018 and then there are other infrastructure investments that we're making. But that doesn't mean '17 does not have any of those. I think there are some expense initiatives in play that also will contribute to '17.

So we're going to look at this every single year, we'll continue to test against it, putting it through the lens of those 50 different variables we assess, and we'll continue to make adjustments to our branch infrastructure.

Where we've had the issues and where most of our peers I think have had issues had been overreliance on the enterprise value lending, financing M&A transactions and deals that went sideways. And when they went sideways, the problem is the loss in the event of default is very high. That's our prior experience. And as a result of that, we have been very judicious and going through as Lars just talked about and looking at all our client relationships, looking at our sponsor relationships, looking at the types of credits that we would finance in a leveraged environment, industries that we should consider and industries, probably cyclical industries, for example, we probably shouldn't consider financing in leverage environment. So we talk about $1.4 billion reclassifying or leaving the books, it's the highest risk piece that we focus on which are enterprise value deals, highly leveraged deals, clients who don't fit our risk profile, and leverage themselves out of our comfort zone. And those are the credits that we are moving out. So whether it's 10% or 20%, to me, it's a more meaningful number than that, because we're taking the highest risk slice in the portfolio and that's leaving the books and what remains is a portfolio that we think is performing very well, we have clients that we know well, we respect well, we have a great history with them through cycles and they have the ability to manage leverage, because they've proven it over time and it's the right kind of leverage in an industry that's much more stable versus much more cyclical. So I think, we know this space well. We are repositioning ourselves in a place where we can continue to be delivering leverage finance to the right clients, right relationships, the right returns, with a lot less volatility than what we've had in the past."

So I will just underscore, as I look across almost every business line that we have in the Commercial Bank, whether it be the stabilized or slightly increased and in some cases moderately increased our core loan spreads, which has allowed our company really to benefit from a large part of the rise that we've seen in LIBOR, where in some institutions, you've seen some of that absorbed way with thinner spreads.  Let me tell you something, the market is no easier today from a competitive environment perspective than it was several quarters ago. In fact, I would submit that it is more aggressive today as smaller banks are going up market, larger banks are going down market and non-banks are playing at levels we haven't seen before.
