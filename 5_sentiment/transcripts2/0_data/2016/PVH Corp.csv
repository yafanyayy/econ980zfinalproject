Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; and Ken Dwayne, who runs all of our wholesale businesses in the United States. J",2275,"Thank you, Dana. Good morning. Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; and Ken Dwayne, who runs all of our wholesale businesses in the United States. 
Just some general comments. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, which exceeded our expectations despite the difficult macroeconomic environment in the highly promotional retail market in the U.S. We grew 2015 annual earnings per share 15% on a constant currency basis, consistent with our long-term growth targets. 
Our Calvin Klein business was the highlight, as the investments we've made over the last 2 years continue to generate solid results, and we saw strength across all regions where we operate. Our Tommy Hilfiger business also saw positive momentum in all of its international markets, highlighting the global power of the brand. Lastly, our Heritage Brands produced a notable improvement in overall profitability. 
I'm going to get into the Tommy Hilfiger business a little bit. Revenue in the Tommy Hilfiger business for the quarter increased 5% on a constant currency basis. The performance was driven by our business in Europe, the brand's largest market, with European comp sales up 10% for the quarter and 8% for the year. We continue to gain market share from our peers in almost all markets throughout Europe. 
Our wholesale performance in Europe was also very strong in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to continue in 2016. Our European spring/summer 2016 wholesale order book is up 4%, and we are planning a fall holiday 2016 wholesale sales, also up about 4%. 
In the U.S. market, we were challenged with unseasonably warm weather and the further deterioration of traffic and consumer spending trends in our U.S. stores that are highly penetrated in international tourist locations. North America retail comps declined 7% in the fourth quarter. The strong U.S. dollar continues to negatively impact international tourist spending throughout the United States. 
Some marketing highlights for the brand. We saw  Rafael Nadal who signed as the brand ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger underwear, Tommy Hilfiger Talent and the Tommy Hilfiger Bold fragrance. Beginning with the fall 2015 marketing campaign, focusing on these global -- these categories that we see significant growth in. The launch of the Nadal partnership was accompanied by a global multimedia advertising campaign in over 40 countries. A campaign video that went viral and was the best -- it was one of the top 10 videos on Google for the launch period. The campaign had over 500 million impressions during the second half of '15 and held full price sales of underwear nearly double in Europe and in the United -- and in the U.S. during the second half as well. 
We also took strategic steps to strengthen the Tommy Hilfiger women's business globally during the quarter. We signed supermodel and millennial icon, Gigi Hadid, as the global brand ambassadress for Tommy Hilfiger women's collection, beginning in the fall of 2016. Gigi will also be collaborating with Tommy on a capsule collection, which will be distributed globally with key retail partners and on our own e-commerce site. 
In February, we announced our new licensing agreements with G-III Apparel to design, produce and distribute the brand's women's wear collection in the U.S. and Canada, beginning with the holiday 2016 season. We believe that G-III's expertise in the women's wear business can significantly enhance our women's presence in the U.S. And I feel that over the next 5 years, they can build a Tommy Hilfiger women's business in the U.S. to well over $1 billion, which is what they have done with our Calvin Klein women's wear business over the last 5 years. 
We also announced in February that we will be buying back the remaining 55% interest in our joint venture in China that we did not already own. The business has experienced strong momentum over the last several years, with brand awareness doubling and our retail footprint more than tripling over the last 5 years. Since 2012, the first full year of operations after the joint venture was acquired, the Tommy Hilfiger China business has more than doubled from approximately $70 million in revenue to a little bit more than $140 million in revenues for 2015. We have over 350 stores, of which 65 are directly operated by the JV. 
Moving to Calvin Klein. Overall, we continue to see great momentum with the Calvin Klein brand and our business more broadly. Revenue in the Calvin Klein business for the quarter increased 21% on a constant currency basis with international comps up 6%, while North America posted a 4% increase. Earnings on a constant currency basis increased 31%, reflecting the strong top line growth with continued gross margin improvement in both Europe and Asia. North America posted a 20% revenue growth on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter and 8% for the year, despite the challenging market conditions in the U.S. At wholesale, we saw healthy top line performance, driven by the continued outperformance of our underwear category. 
As we look at our U.S. jeans turnaround, we saw solid performance in the first half of the year, as we have had loosely discuss with you. But as we move into the fall holiday season, as a result of the overall U.S. retail landscape, we experienced the softness in business at our department store customers. But we did see strong performance through our a new retail partners, Urban Outfitters and Amazon in the U.S. 
Additionally, our U.S. retail business posted healthy performance despite the market headwinds that were experienced, with comp stores up for the full year about 2%. As we move into the first quarter, the strong wholesale sales trends have continued. 
Our Calvin Klein International business also posted strong performance, with sales growing 21% for the quarter and 11% for the year on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein Europe saw a significant turnaround in the overall business with operating profits moving to mid-single digits for the year. We saw an improvement across all categories including jeans, accessories as well as underwear, and we continue to see Europe as a major growth opportunity for the brand.
We've seen an acceleration in the Europe business as our improved product, marketing and retail execution is paying off. We are seeing outperformance against our plan, across both genders with women's outperforming men's. Our best performing markets in Europe are Spain, the U.K., Germany and Italy. Overall, for Calvin Klein Europe, our summer/spring order book for CK is up mid-teens and fall holiday is also planned up about mid-teens. We continue to see increasing consumer acceptance and strong retail performance at our wholesale accounts in almost all European markets. 
Moving to Asia. Calvin Klein continued to expand its presence in Asia, which is the most significant opportunity for long-term expansion. Strong performance in China with comps up high single digits for the quarter, building on the strong performance for the entire year. We also launched directly operated e-commerce platforms in China. We experienced strong performance in Southeast Asia and are aggressively opening travel retail stores, which are an important brand building and profit growth opportunity for that business. 
Hong Kong and Korea continue to be our softest markets in Asia, but we have strategies in place in order to move that business forward and drive the brand in 2016 and beyond.
From a market perspective, we drove brand relevance with strong campaigns and strong digital advertising campaigns as well. Marketing -- our marketing focus has been on lifestyle advertising in order to encourage cross-category shopping leveraging through the #mycalvins to connect with the consumers. The brand has had over 20 million consumer engagements across its own social media channels during 2015. We have significantly increased our distribution to youth-minded shoppers through our expanded global distribution at Urban Outfitters, Opening Ceremony, My Teresa, Amazon, the Lundell and then Team All. 
From a product categories perspective, Calvin Klein underwear has had a great quarter and year, driven by our investments in marketing, product and in technology. We focused on faster replenishment and better in-stock levels in order to meet the strong consumer demand. Our men's division grew its market share and continued to hold the #1 market position across U.S. department stores. 
Women's also posted stellar results, with a 20% year-over-year increase driven by new specialty store and e-commerce distribution. Growth in panties and our focus on better bra fits as well as the exceptional response to our Modern Cotton assortment, which is a casual alternative to our core lingerie business. 
Importantly, our Modern Cotton line is increasing our engagement with the younger consumer, which we believe will create loyalty over the long term as the younger consumer graduates, in the future, to a more elevated product categories and our more elevated product offerings. 
We have also seen strong improvement in our Calvin Klein jeans business with the continued investment in product, which has been evidenced across all of our international markets through their strong growth. We are increasingly focused on key initiatives to drive this business forward, including investing in supply chain across our -- all of our denim efforts globally. We are also investing in capsule collection and the ability to respond faster to the consumer demands. 
Moving to our Heritage business. Revenue in the Heritage business for the quarter decreased 10% from $447 million in the prior quarter. We saw a double-digit increase in earnings as we discontinued our IZOD retail business during the year as well as the number of underperforming product lines in our dress furnishings business that did not meet our profit goals
In dress shirts, we launched the Van Heusen Flex Collar, featuring an expendable collar. And given its initial success, we are taking this technology and moving it across a number of our other brands in 2016. Our IZOD shops at Kohl's continue to post very strong performance, following their 2014 fall holiday launch last year. Warnaco improve market share positions for bras in the U.S., both in the chain and department store channels with both brands significantly increasing their market share. During 2015, the Warnaco No Side Effects brought drove significant performance improvement as its television commercial effectively communicated its key comfort features and led to significant conversion at point of sale. 
Our Speedo division continued to post healthy performance during 2015, and we see a significant opportunity for the Speedo brand in 2016 with the Summer Olympics, which we believe we can commercialize with our key retail partners as we move forward. 
Van Heusen also had a solid year with comparable store sales growing 5 -- 8% in the quarter and 10% for the year, and it also exceeded all of our profit expectations.
As we look forward into the first quarter and we look at the environment today by region, let me give you a little bit of a background -- backdrop to what we're seeing. In Europe, our business continues to persevere through the volatility that is plaguing the region. We continue -- especially the recent terror attacks in Belgium, Turkey and Paris. We continue to see strong comp store sales at both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger with no signs of slowdown. Comps for Tommy continues to perform in the high single-digit range, and the Calvin Klein Europe business continues to comp low double digits. 
Moving to the U.S. As we've come out of the highly promotional fourth quarter, industry-wide inventory levels are elevated across channels. We aggressively cleared inventory in the fourth quarter and are not aggressively promoting in the first quarter, as we are managing gross margin rates against lower unit inventory levels at retail. As such, we are currently seeing comps down in the Calvin Klein business low single digits and down low double digits for the Tommy Hilfiger North America business. Our Van Heusen retail business was posting high single-digit comp store growth. At the same time, we are seeing higher gross margins across the board in the U.S. We continue to see the strong dollars negative impact on our international tourist stores. However, we are seeing solid sales performance continue in our Canadian business. 
Moving to Asia. China continues to demonstrate strong results similar to what we've experienced in 2015. However, we were up against a shift in the Chinese New Year relative to our first quarter last year. We are expecting the weakness to continue in Korea and Hong Kong, driven more by the broader macro environment, in large part due to the lack of Mainland Chinese tourist spending in those markets. Overall, Asia comps here are trending down in the high single-digit range due to the year-over-year compare against Chinese New Year. China continues to outperform the region and continues to outperform the rest of the world. 
And I guess as an overall backdrop, the global retail landscape continues to be uncertain with major foreign currencies largely weakening against the U.S. dollar. 
Global consumer spending patterns are volatile. The consumer is dealing with a tremendous amount of uncertainty and also dealing with geopolitical risk. Given this backtrack, we believe that we can successfully manage this challenging environment and have taken a prudent approach to our 2016 plan. We believe that our best-in-class brands and management teams will continue to manage through the volatility by leveraging our powerful brands and our operating platforms while not losing sight of a long-term vision and our ability to deliver double-digit constant currency earnings per share growth. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to quantify some of the results."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to briefly touch on the fourth quarter of 2015 and then move on to 2016.
On a constant currency basis, revenues for the fourth quarter were up 7% versus the prior year and exceeded our guidance. Driving our revenue increase was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 21% constant currency increase over the prior year. Both our Calvin Klein North America and international businesses had revenue growth of over 20% in constant currency. The North America growth was driven by our wholesale underwear business and square footage expansion in our retail business, which included the conversion of the IZOD retail stores to Calvin Klein accessory and underwear stores. Calvin Klein international growth was mostly driven by Europe and China. 
Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 5% in constant currency, also exceeding our guidance, with strong revenue growth in our international business, which had revenue up 8% in constant currency and Europe comps up 10%, with most markets showing increases. Our U.S. Tommy Hilfiger retail stores located in international tourist destinations continued to be under significant pressure from a lack of traffic and spending. 
Our Heritage business revenues were down 10% due to the continued rationalization of the Heritage business, which included exiting the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Our Heritage revenues were below our guidance due to shipments that were planned to go out at the end of '15, shifting into the first quarter of 2016. Our overall strong revenues drove an earnings per share beat for the company of $0.05 for the quarter versus our guidance, with favorable taxes and interest of about $0.03 being offset by further foreign exchange pressure of $0.03.
Moving to 2016. Our 2016 earnings will be significantly impacted by foreign exchange. In 2016, we are anticipating, based on current exchange rates, that it will be impacted negatively by about $1.60 of earnings per share for foreign exchange. The $1.60 impact is approximately 85% driven by transaction and 15% driven by translation. As a reminder, our exposure at a transactional level is mostly due to our international divisions purchasing their inventory in U.S. dollars. To partially protect against this, we bought foreign exchange hedge contracts about 12 months out for about 80% of our projected inventory purchases made by our international divisions in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the hedges we entered into during 2014 at more favorable exchange rates impacted our operations in 2015, while the hedges we entered into in 2015 during the strengthening U.S. dollar will negatively impact our operations in 2016. Our exposure at a translation level is simply due to converting the revenue and earnings of our international divisions into U.S. dollars. 
For the full year 2016, we are projecting earnings per share of $6.30 to $6.50. If we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.60, we have earnings per share growth of 12% to 15% over the prior year. Overall, we are projecting constant currency revenue to grow approximately 2%, excluding a negative impact of 1% related to foreign currency. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase approximately 75 basis points on a constant currency basis and to decrease approximately 100 basis points on a reported basis.
We project Calvin Klein revenues to grow 6% on a constant currency basis, excluding a negative impact of 2% related to foreign currency. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase about 50 basis points on a constant currency basis and to decrease approximately 100 basis points on a reported basis. 
Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on constant currency basis, excluding a negative impact of 1% related to foreign currency with operating margins planned to increase about 50 basis points on a constant currency basis and to decrease approximately 175 basis on a reported basis. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 7% and mostly due to the exiting of the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 50 basis points. The impact to currency on our Heritage business is relatively immaterial. 
Interest for the year is planned to be between $100 million and $125 million compared to the prior year amount of $113 million. As a reminder, an interest rate swap converting variable to fixed interest again in February of 2016 and is the reason for the increase. 
We currently expect to generate approximately $500 million of free cash flow in 2016, which we will use with existing cash on hand to fund the acquisition of the remaining 55% stake in our Tommy Hilfiger joint venture and to make similar debt paydowns in stock repurchases as we did in 2015. Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 20% and in line with the prior year.
First quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.40 to $1.45 and includes $0.50 in estimated negative impact for foreign exchange. Excluding this negative impact, we're expecting earnings per share to increase 27% to 30% for the first quarter. Revenue in the first quarter is projected to increase 3% on a constant currency basis, excluding the negative impact of 2% for foreign exchange. 
Calvin Klein revenues are planned at a 12% constant currency increase, excluding the negative impact of 4% for foreign currency. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at a 2% constant currency increase, excluding the negative impact of 1% for foreign currency, with North America planned down mid-single digits due to continued weakness in our retail stores located in international tourist locations, while our international business is planned up high single digits due to its continued strength in Europe. Heritage brand revenues are projected to decreased 9% due mostly to our exiting of the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in dress shirts. Interest expenses is projected to be about $28 million to $30 million and taxes to be 23% to 24% in the first quarter. 
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

Because there's still margins we're pretty heavy inventory levels that came out of the fourth quarter.

They're being very aggressive, focusing on inventory turned. And I think everyone is really trying to manage gross margin rates going forward and limit their markdown exposure. So I think you'll start to see that play out. My point in my comments were, I think we're a little bit ahead of the market. We really took the fourth quarter, and we had a good quarter and we really took advantage of clearing goods to get to the right inventory level. So we could start to see the gross margin improvement maybe earlier than you'll see in the overall market."

The Orlando's, the Las Vegas, the -- some of the California markets, New York, which is really -- which has had enjoyed a significant level of tourist spending from key markets like Brazil and South America as well as the European markets. With the currencies going the opposite way and the U.S. dollar continuing to strengthen, there's nothing an attractive place to travel to, and we've seen that really impact our business. More directly on the Tommy business that has such a premium business globally, Europe and Asia and Latin America, that we've really taken in all the chain of the Tommy business from a comp store performance. On the positive side, we've also seen tremendous growth in our international business. European comps are double-digit increases.

We're trying to do -- to really control the promotional agenda, not only in department stores, but also online. It's all into play. And I think that we really are taking an omni-channel approach to all of the brands and really trying to, not only grow the pure-play business, but really have focused on our key department store accounts like Macy's, like Kohl's, like Nordstrom's where we've really invested inventory and invested from a technology point of view our ability to respond to that business. So we see it as a real growth vehicle for us going forward, and we're really managing it cautiously from a promotional agenda.

When you think about the quarters, our second half of 2015 really slow substantial growth in the Calvin Klein businesses. So the comparisons get tougher in the second half of the year. And we are assuming that we're just not going to be able to have that kind of double-digit growth that we experienced in the first and maybe into the second quarter of this year to continue into the second half of this year. In addition, I'd just remind everyone, in the U.S., open-to-buy dollars at retail for the second half of the year, major department stores, have really shrunk those open-to-buy dollars. The challenge there is that they went into that season expecting comp store growth. We all know it didn't happen for a lot of reason: The unseasonably warm weather, international tourism issues. But suffice it to say is in the second half of the year was generally very tough. The assumption here is we're dealing with these compressed open-to-buy dollars, and we're managing inventories tightly. So we're planning that second half level of sales growth much more cautiously as we go forward. If the trends were to continue what they are now, we would chase that business, and I think they'll be a sales upside opportunity we don't have in our numbers.

The Calvin Klein underwear business is, by its nature, one of the highest-margin businesses we have from a profitability point of view. Our underwear business, in general, is one of our highest operating margin business. So I would not anticipate significant margin expansion in those business, but I would expect continued top line growth in those businesses, which are margin-rich. So I think as they grow faster than the core, I think you'll see margins improve. On the jeans side, domestically, there's significant opportunity to grow on our operating margins. That business was -- the business that I'd argue when we made the Warnaco acquisition was most -- the most damage. It's about a $300 million business, men's and women's, and I think we can continue to see margin expansion there. And I think you can think about that we are in the low single-digit kind of margin rates in jeans in North America. And there's no reason why that category, as it expands, and as we get better sell-throughs from the better investments that we're making in the product and marketing, that, that shouldn't be a 10% operating margin business. So last piece I would say is our European business are from a margin point of view, is clearly the biggest opportunity we have. That's about -- that business has been the most impacted on the Calvin side by currency. And it's really transactional currencies. But despite that last year, we operated in the mid-single digits. With the headwinds we're seeing this year transaction-wise, I'd expect that business to continue into the mid-single digits this year and may to start to expand to that 10% goal we talked about. So Europe, both from a top line business for Calvin Klein and on an operating margin basis, probably geographically, holds the biggest opportunity for continued growth in profitability."

It's $140 million business, highly profitable business that we think can grow long-term over the next 5 to 6 years to somewhere in the vicinity of $300 million to $400 million. The Calvin Klein business today is approaching $300 million, to give you a sense of that. So we're -- we really see it there. The other area is that, in China, the Tommy Hilfiger business is really driven by men's sportswear. Women's is about 20% to 25% of the business. The balance is men's wear.

But despite all of that, and I know it's -- I know from an investor point of view, it must be as frustrating as a management team, we've grown our earnings on a constant currency basis about 15% over the last 2 years. So it's very frustrating over 2-year period looking at almost $3 of earnings per share that has gone against us on the currency line. There's -- we didn't see nothing that would stop us from continuing over, these that's a over the next 3 years, that's how we do our strategic planning that we couldn't continue to drive diluted share growth at a double-digit rate, something between 12% and 16%, continuing to drive it given the dynamics of that we see in the Calvin Klein business and the dynamics we see in the Tommy Hilfiger business. I think there is clearly an opportunity over time to regain the margin loss that has impacted us on a operating margin basis from a foreign currency impact. So when we look out there -- we think that there's somewhere in the neighborhood of another 100 to 200 basis points overall operating margin improvement in the business that we can build on as we move forward. If we get any kind of a tailwind from currencies, meaning that the dollar levels or starts to actually we can somewhat long-term against some of these currencies as we get back to equilibrium around the world, that will clearly be a tailwind that would help us going forward and have the biggest impact on our operating margins as we go forward internationally.

I would say the current model was -- that has been built is too franchisee dependent. So we will be bringing that business in-house. That's a lower-margin business, but still very healthy, very, very healthy than just a pure wholesale franchise model business. But I think it's critical. If you take ownership of your brand and how you present it, not only a Shanghai and Beijing, but throughout the other Tier 1, Tier 2 cities throughout China. And I think that -- in China, should be our highest operating margin region in the world."

And to be honest, it's changing faster than most of us would have anticipated. I think historically, for the last 20 years, we've been a multichannel distributor of product across different channels of distribution. So for us, this is another channel distribution that needs to be managed and managed directly. I think the challenge is, from a profitability point of view, short term, the e-commerce profitability is lower than in the brick-and-mortar opportunity both wholesale and retail. But as that business scales, the profitability should level out. We should become agnostic to where we sell the goods moving forward. But that will require, over the next couple of years, more investments in the systems, more investments in technology and people in order to bring that to balance while at the same time, dealing with what the North America is a shrinking store point. I mean, every major retailer is talking about some store closings. And I think we'll continue to see retailers pruning their store base 5% a year. And that slow march, I think, is ahead of us for the next 3 to 5 years as we get balance. And they deal with in their channels of distribution and their retail stores, their growing e-commerce platform. Just the need for investors in order to connect to the consumers."

Secondly, we're looking at, as you said, price increases. But you need to do that very broadly. The idea of you just raise prices the match, of course, it just doesn't work that way. That's not the real world. You have key price points be it for core categories that are big and highly profitable, and you need to managing that over time and have the consumer move with you, change their promotional agenda to a degree and try to get your average unit retails out. I think that's an opportunity as we go forward as well. And the last piece is, as we get equilibrium in the currency area, the real challenge that we have to face was -- if you're really look at what happened with currencies, the huge hit took place really in our compressed 6- to 9-month period of time. The euro was actually like in a 3-month period of time that we saw a drop from the mid-$1.30 to somewhere both -- around $1.10. And that drop happened so quickly to be able to usually blended into your hedging strategy, react to it. There just wasn't time. The ability to raise prices all at once with the consumer that's feeling pressure wasn't there as well. So I think there's an ability to recapture that over time. And I would characterize it as against the 2016 margins and goals that we said that there's 100 to 200 basis point opportunity in operating margins post 2016 as we move forward to improve operating margin."

Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; and Ken Dwayne, who runs all of our wholesale businesses in the United States.

Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; and Ken Dwayne, who runs all of our wholesale businesses in the United States. 
Just some general comments. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, which exceeded our expectations despite the difficult macroeconomic environment in the highly promotional retail market in the U.S. We grew 2015 annual earnings per share 15% on a constant currency basis, consistent with our long-term growth targets. 
Our Calvin Klein business was the highlight, as the investments we've made over the last 2 years continue to generate solid results, and we saw strength across all regions where we operate. Our Tommy Hilfiger business also saw a  positive momentum in all of its international markets, highlighting the global power of the brand. Lastly, our Heritage Brands produced a notable improvement in overall profitability. 
I'm going to get into the Tommy Hilfiger business a little bit. Revenue in the Tommy Hilfiger business for the quarter increased 5% on a constant currency basis. The performance was driven by our business in Europe, the brand's largest market, with European comp sales up 10% for the quarter and 8% for the year. We continue to gain market share from our peers in almost all markets throughout Europe. 
Our wholesale performance in Europe was also very strong in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to continue in 2016. Our European spring/summer 2016 wholesale order book is up 4%, and we are planning a fall holiday 2016 wholesale sales, also up about 4%. 
In the U.S. market, we were challenged with unseasonably warm weather and the further deterioration of traffic and consumer spending trends in our U.S. stores that are highly penetrated in international tourist locations. North America retail comps declined 7% in the fourth quarter. The strong U.S. dollar continues to negatively impact international tourist spending throughout the United States. 
Some marketing highlights for the brand. We signed -- Rafael Nadal was signed as the brand ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger Underwear, Tommy Hilfiger Talent and the Tommy Hilfiger Bold fragrance. Beginning with the fall 2015 marketing campaign, focusing on these global -- these categories that we see significant growth in. The launch of the Nadal partnership was accompanied by a global multimedia advertising campaign in over 40 countries. A campaign video that went viral and was the best -- it was one of the top 10 videos on Google for the launch period. The campaign had over 500 million impressions during the second half of '15 and held full price sales of underwear nearly double in Europe and in the United -- and in the U.S. during the second half as well. 
We also took strategic steps to strengthen the Tommy Hilfiger women's business globally during the quarter. We signed supermodel and millennial icon, Gigi Hadid, as the global brand ambassadress for Tommy Hilfiger women's collection, beginning in the fall of 2016. Gigi will also be collaborating with Tommy on a capsule collection, which will be distributed globally with key retail partners and on our own e-commerce site. 
In February, we announced our new licensing agreement with G-III Apparel to design, produce and distribute the brand's women's wear collection in the U.S. and Canada, beginning with the holiday 2016 season. We believe that G-III's expertise in the women's wear business can significantly enhance our women's presence in the U.S. And I feel that over the next 5 years, they can build a Tommy Hilfiger women's business in the U.S. to well over $1 billion, which is what they have done with our Calvin Klein women's wear business over the last 5 years. 
We also announced in February that we will be buying back the remaining 55% interest in our joint venture in China that we did not already own. The business has experienced strong momentum over the last several years, with brand awareness doubling and our retail footprint more than tripling over the last 5 years. Since 2012, the first full year of operations after the joint venture was acquired, the Tommy Hilfiger China business has more than doubled from approximately $70 million in revenue to a little bit more than $140 million in revenues for 2015. We have over 350 stores, of which 65 are directly operated by the JV. 
Moving to Calvin Klein. Overall, we continue to see great momentum with the Calvin Klein brand and our business more broadly. Revenue in the Calvin Klein business for the quarter increased 21% on a constant currency basis, with international comps up 6%, while North America posted a 4% increase. Earnings on a constant currency basis increased 31%, reflecting the strong top line growth with continued gross margin improvement in both Europe and Asia. North America posted a 20% revenue growth on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter and 8% for the year, despite the challenging market conditions in the U.S. At wholesale, we saw healthy top line performance, driven by the continued outperformance of our underwear category. 
As we look at our U.S. jeans turnaround, we saw solid performance in the first half of the year, as we had previously discussed with you. But as we move into the fall holiday season, as a result of the overall U.S. retail landscape, we experienced the softness in business at our department store customers. But we did see strong performance through our new retail partners, Urban Outfitters and Amazon in the U.S. 
Additionally, our U.S. retail business posted healthy performance despite the market headwinds that were experienced, with comp stores up for the full year about 2%. As we move into the first quarter, the strong wholesale sales trends have continued. 
Our Calvin Klein International business also posted strong performance, with sales growing 21% for the quarter and 11% for the year on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein Europe saw a significant turnaround in the overall business with operating profits moving to mid-single digits for the year. We saw an improvement across all categories including jeans, accessories as well as underwear, and we continue to see Europe as a major growth opportunity for the brand.
We've seen an acceleration in the Europe business as our improved product, marketing and retail execution is paying off. We are seeing outperformance against our plan, across both genders with women's outperforming men's. Our best performing markets in Europe are Spain, the U.K., Germany and Italy. Overall, for Calvin Klein Europe, our summer/spring order book for CK is up mid-teens and fall holiday is also planned up about mid-teens. We continue to see increasing consumer acceptance and strong retail performance at our wholesale accounts in almost all European markets. 
Moving to Asia. Calvin Klein continued to expand its presence in Asia, which is the most significant opportunity for long-term expansion. Strong performance in China, with comps up high single digits for the quarter, building on the strong performance for the entire year. We also launched directly-operated e-commerce platforms in China. We experienced strong performance in Southeast Asia and are aggressively opening travel retail stores, which are an important brand building and profit growth opportunity for the business. 
Hong Kong and Korea continue to be our softest markets in Asia, but we have strategies in place in order to move that business forward and drive the brand in 2016 and beyond.
From a market perspective, we drove brand relevance with strong campaigns and strong digital advertising campaigns as well. Marketing -- our marketing focus has been on lifestyle advertising in order to encourage cross-category shopping leveraging through the #mycalvins to connect with the consumers. The brand has had over 20 million consumer engagements across its own social media channels during 2015. We have significantly increased our distribution to youth-minded shoppers through our expanded global distribution at Urban Outfitters, Opening Ceremony, Mytheresa, Amazon, Zalando and C Mall then Tmall. 
From a product categories perspective, Calvin Klein Underwear has had a great quarter and year, driven by our investments in marketing, product and in technology. We focused on faster replenishment and better in-stock levels in order to meet the strong consumer demand. Our men's division grew its market share and continued to hold the #1 market position across U.S. department stores. 
Women's also posted stellar results, with a 20% year-over-year increase driven by new specialty store and e-commerce distribution. Growth in panties and our focus on better bra fits as well as the exceptional response to our Modern Cotton assortment, which is a casual alternative to our core lingerie business. 
Importantly, our Modern Cotton line is increasing our engagement with the younger consumer, which we believe will create loyalty over the long term as the younger consumer graduates, in the future, to a more elevated product categories and our more elevated product offerings. 
We have also seen strong improvement in our Calvin Klein jeans business with the continued investment in product, which has been evidenced across all of our international markets through their strong growth. We are increasingly focused on key initiatives to drive this business forward, including investing in supply chain across our -- all of our denim efforts globally. We are also investing in capsule collections and the ability to respond faster to the consumer demands. 
Moving to our Heritage business. Revenue in the Heritage business for the quarter decreased 10% from $447 million in the prior quarter. We saw a double-digit increase in earnings as we discontinued our IZOD retail business during the year as well as the number of underperforming product lines in our dress furnishings business that did not meet our profit goals.
In dress shirts, we launched the Van Heusen flex collar, featuring an expandable collar. And given its initial success, we are taking this technology and moving it across a number of our other brands in 2016. Our IZOD shops at Kohl's continue to post very strong performance, following their 2014 fall holiday launch last year. Warner's and Olga improved market share positions for bras in the U.S., both in the chain and department store channels, with both brands significantly increasing their market share. During 2015, the Warner's No Side Effects bra drove significant performance improvement as its television commercial effectively communicated its key comfort features and led to significant conversion at point of sale. 
Our Speedo division continued to post healthy performance during 2015, and we see a significant opportunity for the Speedo brand in 2016 with the Summer Olympics, which we believe, we can commercialize with our key retail partners as we move forward. 
Van Heusen also had a solid year with comparable store sales growing 5 -- 8% in the quarter and 10% for the year, and it also exceeded all of our profit expectations.
As we look forward into the first quarter and we look at the environment today by region, let me give you a little bit of a background -- backdrop to what we're seeing. In Europe, our business continues to persevere through the volatility that is plaguing the region. We continue -- especially the recent terror attacks in Belgium, Turkey and Paris. We continue to see strong comp store sales at both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger with no signs of slowdown. Comps for Tommy continues to perform in the high single-digit range, and the Calvin Klein Europe business continues to comp low double digits. 
Moving to the U.S. As we've come out of the highly promotional fourth quarter, industry-wide inventory levels are elevated across channels. We aggressively cleared inventory in the fourth quarter and are not aggressively promoting in the first quarter, as we are managing gross margin rates against lower unit inventory levels at retail. As such, we are currently seeing comps down in the Calvin Klein business, low single digits and down low double digits for the Tommy Hilfiger North America business. Our Van Heusen retail business was posting high single-digit comp store growth. At the same time, we are seeing higher gross margins across the board in the U.S. We continue to see the strong dollars negative impact on our international tourist stores. However, we are seeing solid sales performance continue in our Canadian business. 
Moving to Asia. China continues to demonstrate strong results similar to what we've experienced in 2015. However, we were up against a shift in the Chinese New Year relative to our first quarter last year. We are expecting the weakness to continue in Korea and Hong Kong, driven more by the broader macro environment, in large part due to the lack of Mainland Chinese tourist spending in those markets. Overall, Asia comps here are trending down in the high single-digit range due to the year-over-year compare against Chinese New Year. China continues to outperform the region and continues to outperform the rest of the world. 
And I guess, as an overall backdrop, the global retail landscape continues to be uncertain with major foreign currencies largely weakening against the U.S. dollar. 
Global consumer spending patterns are volatile. The consumer is dealing with a tremendous amount of uncertainty and also dealing with geopolitical risk. Given this backtrack, we believe that we can successfully manage this challenging environment and have taken a prudent approach to our 2016 plan. We believe that our best-in-class brands and management teams will continue to manage through the volatility by leveraging our powerful brands and our operating platforms, while not losing sight of a long-term vision and our ability to deliver double-digit constant currency earnings per share growth. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to quantify some of the results."

I'm going to briefly touch on the fourth quarter of 2015 and then move on to 2016.On a constant currency basis, revenues for the fourth",1032,"Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to briefly touch on the fourth quarter of 2015 and then move on to 2016.
On a constant currency basis, revenues for the fourth quarter were up 7% versus the prior year and exceeded our guidance. Driving our revenue increase was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 21% constant currency increase over the prior year. Both our Calvin Klein North America and international businesses had revenue growth of over 20% in constant currency. The North America growth was driven by our wholesale underwear business and square footage expansion in our retail business, which included the conversion of the IZOD retail stores to Calvin Klein accessory and underwear stores. Calvin Klein international growth was mostly driven by Europe and China. 
Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 5% in constant currency, also exceeding our guidance, with strong revenue growth in our international business, which had revenue up 8% in constant currency and Europe comps up 10%, with most markets showing increases. Our U.S. Tommy Hilfiger retail stores located in international tourist destinations continued to be under significant pressure from a lack of traffic and spending. 
Our Heritage business revenues were down 10% due to the continued rationalization of the Heritage business, which included exiting the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Our Heritage revenues were below our guidance due to shipments that were planned to go out at the end of '15, shifting into the first quarter of 2016. Our overall strong revenues drove an earnings per share beat for the company of $0.05 for the quarter versus our guidance, with favorable taxes and interest of about $0.03 being offset by further foreign exchange pressure of $0.03.
Moving to 2016. Our 2016 earnings will be significantly impacted by foreign exchange. In 2016, we are anticipating, based on current exchange rates, that it will be impacted negatively by about $1.60 of earnings per share for foreign exchange. The $1.60 impact is approximately 85% driven by transaction and 15% driven by translation. As a reminder, our exposure at a transactional level is mostly due to our international divisions purchasing their inventory in U.S. dollars. To partially protect against this, we bought foreign exchange hedge contracts about 12 months out for about 80% of our projected inventory purchases made by our international divisions in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the hedges we entered into during 2014 at more favorable exchange rates impacted our operations in 2015, while the hedges we entered into in 2015 during the strengthening U.S. dollar will negatively impact our operations in 2016. Our exposure at a translation level is simply due to converting the revenue and earnings of our international divisions into U.S. dollars. 
For the full year 2016, we are projecting earnings per share of $6.30 to $6.50. If we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.60, we have earnings per share growth of 12% to 15% over the prior year. Overall, we are projecting constant currency revenue to grow approximately 2%, excluding a negative impact of 1% related to foreign currency. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase approximately 75 basis points on a constant currency basis and to decrease approximately 100 basis points on a reported basis.
We project Calvin Klein revenues to grow 6% on a constant currency basis, excluding a negative impact of 2% related to foreign currency. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase about 50 basis points on a constant currency basis and to decrease approximately 100 basis points on a reported basis. 
Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on constant currency basis, excluding a negative impact of 1% related to foreign currency, with operating margins planned to increase about 50 basis points on a constant currency basis and to decrease approximately 175 basis on a reported basis. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 7% and mostly due to the exiting of the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 50 basis points. The impact to currency on our Heritage business is relatively immaterial. 
Interest for the year is planned to be between $100 million and $125 million compared to the prior year amount of $113 million. As a reminder, an interest rate swap converting variable to fixed interest, again in February of 2016 and is the reason for the increase. 
We currently expect to generate approximately $500 million of free cash flow in 2016, which we will use with existing cash on hand to fund the acquisition of the remaining 55% stake in our Tommy Hilfiger joint venture and to make similar debt paydowns in the stock repurchases as we did in 2015. Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 20% and in line with the prior year.
First quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.40 to $1.45 and includes $0.50 in estimated negative impact for foreign exchange. Excluding this negative impact, we are expecting earnings per share to increase 27% to 30% for the first quarter. Revenue in the first quarter is projected to increase 3% on a constant currency basis, excluding the negative impact of 2% for foreign exchange. 
Calvin Klein revenues are planned at a 12% constant currency increase, excluding the negative impact of 4% for foreign currency. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at a 2% constant currency increase, excluding the negative impact of 1% for foreign currency, with North America planned down mid-single digits due to continued weakness in our retail stores located in international tourist locations, while our international business is planned up high single digits due to its continued strength in Europe. Heritage brand revenues are projected to decreased 9% due mostly to our exiting of the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in dress shirts. Interest expense is projected to be about $28 million to $30 million and taxes to be 23% to 24% in the first quarter. 
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

When you think about the quarters, second half of 2015 really saw a substantial growth in the Calvin Klein businesses. So the comparisons get tougher in the second half of the year. And we are assuming that we're just not going to be able to have the kind of double-digit growth that we experienced in the first and maybe into the second quarter of this year to continue into the second half of this year. In addition, I'd just remind everyone, in the U.S., open-to-buy dollars at retail for the second half of the year, major department stores, have really shrunk those open-to-buy dollars. The challenge there is that they went into that season expecting comp store growth. We all know it didn't happen for a lot of reason: the unseasonably warm weather, international tourism issues. But suffice it to say is that second half of the year was generally very tough. The assumption here is we're dealing with these compressed open-to-buy dollars, and we're managing inventories tightly. So we're planning that second half level of sales growth much more cautiously as we go forward. If the trends were to continue what they are now, we would chase that business, and I think they'd be a sales upside opportunity we don't have in our numbers.

The Calvin Klein underwear business is, by its nature, one of the highest-margin businesses we have from a profitability point of view. Our underwear business, in general, is one of our highest operating margin business. So I would not anticipate significant margin expansion in those business, but I would expect continued top line growth in those businesses, which are margin-rich. So I think as they grow faster than the core, I think you'll see margins improve. On the jeans side, domestically, there's significant opportunity to grow on our operating margins. That business was -- the business that I'd argue when we made the Warnaco acquisition, was the most damaged. It's about a $300 million business, men's and women's, and I think we can continue to see margin expansion there. And I think you can think about that we are in the low-single digit kind of margin rates in jeans in North America. And there's no reason why that category, as it expands, and as we get better sell-throughs from the better investments that we're making in the product and marketing, that, that shouldn't be a 10% operating margin business. So the last piece I would say is our European business, from a margin point of view, is clearly the biggest opportunity we have. That's about -- that business has been the most impacted on the Calvin side by currency, and it's really transactional currencies. But despite that last year, we operated in the mid-single digits. With the headwinds we're seeing this year transaction-wise, I'd expect that business to continue into the mid-single digits this year and then start to expand to that 10% goal we talked about. So Europe, both from a top line basis for Calvin Klein and on an operating margin basis, probably geographically, holds the biggest opportunity for continued growth in profitability."

We will basically spend -- we'll spend more on marketing than is currently being spent. But let me put it in perspective. The acquisition, even a partial year, will be marginally accretive, and they should be significantly more accretive in 2017. So our assumption's based on, as the brand owner, we're making more of a marketing investment in the brand in China because we see the significant growth opportunity. It's a $140 million business, a highly profitable business that we think can grow long-term over the next 5 to 6 years to somewhere in the vicinity of $300 million to $400 million. The Calvin Klein business today is approaching $300 million, to give you a sense of that. So we're -- we really see it there. The other area is that, in China, the Tommy Hilfiger business is really driven by men's sportswear. Women's is about 20% to 25% of the business. The balance is men's wear. So there's a huge men's wear opportunity. And then when you think about our other categories that are just marginally represented there, denim, accessories and tailored, we see filling out the full lifestyle for the Tommy Hilfiger brand in China, similar to what we look like in Europe with the Tommy Hilfiger brand."

I think the way we are thinking about it right now, the focus will be on the incremental acquisitions that we've talked about, continuing to bring those in, continuing to maximize what the opportunity is for Calvin and Tommy. And then as we turn 2016 into '17, opportunistically looking at what's out there in the world, we do -- as you know, we generated a tremendous amount of cash. We're not leveraged to any extent, given our strong balance sheet dynamics. So there's a significant amount of open-to-buy dollars that are there. And historically, we've been a significant acquirer of brands, be it Calvin, Tommy, Warnaco. So I don't think that's really going to change.

We're dealing with a lot of issues caused by the geopolitical situation. But despite all of that, and I know it's -- I know from an investor point of view, it must be as frustrating as the management team, we've grown our earnings on a constant currency basis about 15% over the last 2 years. So it's very frustrating over a 2-year period looking at almost $3 of earnings per share that has gone against us on the currency line. There's -- we see nothing that would stop us from continuing over -- at least let's use the next 3 years, that's how we do our strategic planning, that we couldn't continue to drive earnings per share growth at a double-digit rate, something between 12% and 16%, continuing to drive it given the dynamics that we see in the Calvin Klein business and the dynamics we see in the Tommy Hilfiger business. I think there's clearly an opportunity over time to regain the margin loss that has impacted us on an operating margin basis from a foreign currency impact. So when we look out, there's -- we think that there's somewhere in the neighborhood of another 100 to 200 basis points overall operating margin improvement in the business that we can build on as we move forward. If we get any kind of a tailwind from currencies, meaning that the dollar levels or starts to actually we can somewhat long-term against some of these currencies, as we get back to equilibrium around the world, that would clearly be a tailwind, that would help us going forward and have the biggest impact on our operating margins as we go forward internationally. So I hope that answers your question."

And to be honest, it's changing faster than most of us would have anticipated. I think historically, for the last 20 years, we've been a multichannel distributor of product across different channels of distribution. So for us, this is another channel of distribution that needs to be managed and managed directly. I think the challenge is, from a profitability point of view, short term, the e-commerce profitability is lower than the brick-and-mortar opportunity, both wholesale and retail. But as that business scales, the profitability should level out, and we should become agnostic to where we sell the goods moving forward. But that will require, over the next couple of years, more investment in the systems, more investments in technology and people in order to bring that to balance, while at the same time, dealing with what in North America is a shrinking store pool. I mean, every major retailer is talking about some store closing. And I think we'll continue to see retailers pruning their store base 5% a year. And that slow march, I think, is ahead of us for the next 3 to 5 years as we get balanced. And they deal with in their channels of distribution and their retail stores, their growing e-commerce platform and just the need for less stores in order to connect with the consumers."

We're focused on the supply chain, and that's where we're making tremendous investments , just looking at different sources of product. And that's a long-term opportunity to continue to improve our margin. Secondly, we're looking at, as you said, price increases. But you need to do that very broadly. The idea of you just raise prices to match your costs, it just doesn't work that way. That's not the real world. You have key price points, be it for core categories that are big and highly profitable, and you need to manage that over time and have the consumer move with you, change their promotional agenda to a degree and try to get your average unit retails up. I think that's an opportunity as we go forward as well. And the last piece is, as we get equilibrium in the currency area, the real challenge that we have to face was that if you really look at what happened with currencies, the huge hit took place really in our compressed 6 to 9-month period of time. The euro was actually in like a 3-month period of time that we saw a drop from the mid-$1.30 to somewhere around $1.10. And that drop happened so quickly to be able to usually blend it into your hedging strategy, react to it. There just wasn't time. The ability to raise prices all at once with the consumer that's feeling pressure wasn't there as well. So I think there's an ability to recapture that over time. And I would characterize it as against the 2016 margins and goals that we said that there's 100 to 200-basis-point opportunity in operating margins post 2016 as we move forward to improve operating margin."

Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; and Ken Duane, who runs all of our wholesale businesses in the United States. 
Just some general comments. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, which exceeded our expectations despite the difficult macroeconomic environment and the highly promotional retail market in the U.S. We grew 2015 annual earnings per share 15% on a constant currency basis, consistent with our long-term growth targets. 
Our Calvin Klein business was the highlight, as the investments we've made over the last 2 years continue to generate solid results, and we saw strength across all regions where we operate. Our Tommy Hilfiger business also saw positive momentum in all of its international markets, highlighting the global power of the brand. Lastly, our Heritage Brands produced a notable improvement in overall profitability. 
I'm going to get into the Tommy Hilfiger business a little bit. Revenue in the Tommy Hilfiger business for the quarter increased 5% on a constant currency basis. The performance was driven by our business in Europe, the brand's largest market, with European comp sales up 10% for the quarter and 8% for the year. We continue to gain market share from our peers in almost all markets throughout Europe. 
Our wholesale performance in Europe was also very strong in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to continue in 2016. Our European spring/summer 2016 wholesale order book is up 4%, and we are planning on fall holiday 2016 wholesale sales also up about 4%. 
In the U.S. market, we were challenged with unseasonably warm weather and the further deterioration of traffic and consumer spending trends in our U.S. stores that are highly penetrated in international tourist locations. North America retail comps declined 7% in the fourth quarter. The strong U.S. dollar continues to negatively impact international tourist spending throughout the United States. 
Some marketing highlights for the brand. We signed -- Rafael Nadal was signed as the brand ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger Underwear, Tommy Hilfiger Tailored and the Tommy Hilfiger Bold fragrance. Beginning with the fall 2015 marketing campaign, focusing on these global -- these categories that we see significant growth in. The launch of the Nadal partnership was accompanied by a global multimedia advertising campaign in over 40 countries. A campaign video that went viral and was the best -- it was one of the top 10 videos on Google for the launch period. The campaign had over 500 million impressions during the second half of '15 and helped full price sales of underwear nearly double in Europe and in the United -- and in the U.S. during the second half as well. 
We also took strategic steps to strengthen the Tommy Hilfiger women's business globally during the quarter. We signed supermodel and millennial icon, Gigi Hadid, as the global brand ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger women's collection, beginning in the fall of 2016. Gigi will also be collaborating with Tommy on a capsule collection, which will be distributed globally with key retail partners and on our own e-commerce site. 
In February, we announced our new licensing agreement with G-III Apparel to design, produce and distribute the brand's women's wear collection in the U.S. and Canada, beginning with the holiday 2016 season. We believe that G-III's expertise in the women's wear business can significantly enhance our women's presence in the U.S. And I feel that over the next 5 years, they can build a Tommy Hilfiger women's business in the U.S. to well over $1 billion, which is what they have done with our Calvin Klein women's wear business over the last 5 years. 
We also announced in February that we will be buying back the remaining 55% interest in our joint venture in China that we did not already own. The business has experienced strong momentum over the last several years, with brand awareness doubling and our retail footprint more than tripling over the last 5 years. Since 2012, the first full year of operations after the joint venture was acquired, the Tommy Hilfiger China business has more than doubled from approximately $70 million in revenue to a little bit more than $140 million in revenues for 2015. We have over 350 stores, of which 65 are directly operated by the JV. 
Moving to Calvin Klein. Overall, we continue to see great momentum with the Calvin Klein brand and our business more broadly. Revenue in the Calvin Klein business for the quarter increased 21% on a constant currency basis, with international comps up 6%, while North America posted a 4% increase. Earnings on a constant currency basis increased 31%, reflecting the strong top line growth with continued gross margin improvement in both Europe and Asia. North America posted a 20% revenue growth on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter and 8% for the year, despite the challenging market conditions in the U.S. At wholesale, we saw healthy top line performance, driven by the continued outperformance of our underwear category. 
As we look at our U.S. jeans turnaround, we saw solid performance in the first half of the year, as we had previously discussed with you. But as we moved into the fall holiday season, as a result of the overall U.S. retail landscape, we experienced a softness in business at our department store customers. But we did see strong performance through our new retail partners, Urban Outfitters and Amazon in the U.S. 
Additionally, our U.S. retail business posted healthy performance despite the market headwinds that were experienced, with comp stores up for the full year about 2%. As we move into the first quarter, the strong wholesale sales trends have continued. 
Our Calvin Klein International business also posted strong performance, with sales growing 21% for the quarter and 11% for the year on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein Europe saw a significant turnaround in the overall business with operating profits moving to mid-single digits for the year. We saw an improvement across all categories including jeans, accessories as well as underwear, and we continue to see Europe as a major growth opportunity for the brand.
We've seen an acceleration in the Europe business as our improved product, marketing and retail execution is paying off. We are seeing outperformance against our plan, across both genders with women's outperforming men's. Our best performing markets in Europe are Spain, the U.K., Germany and Italy. Overall, for Calvin Klein Europe, our summer/spring order book for CK is up mid-teens and fall holiday is also planned up about mid-teens. We continue to see increasing consumer acceptance and strong retail performance at our wholesale accounts in almost all European markets. 
Moving to Asia. Calvin Klein continued to expand its presence in Asia, which is the most significant opportunity for long-term expansion. Strong performance in China, with comps up high single digits for the quarter, building on the strong performance for the entire year. We also launched directly-operated e-commerce platforms in China. We experienced strong performance in Southeast Asia and are aggressively opening travel retail stores, which are an important brand building and profit growth opportunity for the business. 
Hong Kong and Korea continue to be our softest markets in Asia, but we have strategies in place in order to move that business forward and drive the brand in 2016 and beyond.
From a market perspective, we drove brand relevance with strong campaigns and strong digital advertising campaigns as well. Marketing -- our marketing focus has been on lifestyle advertising in order to encourage cross-category shopping leveraging through the #mycalvins to connect with the consumers. The brand has had over 20 million consumer engagements across its owned social media channels during 2015. We have significantly increased our distribution to youth-minded shoppers through our expanded global distribution at Urban Outfitters, Opening Ceremony, Mytheresa, Amazon, Zalando and T -- then Tmall. 
From a product categories perspective, Calvin Klein Underwear has had a great quarter and year, driven by our investments in marketing, product and in technology. We focused on faster replenishment and better in-stock levels in order to meet the strong consumer demand. Our men's division grew its market share and continued to hold the #1 market position across U.S. department stores. 
Women's also posted stellar results, with a 20% year-over-year increase driven by new specialty store and e-commerce distribution, growth in panties and our focus on better bra fits as well as the exceptional response to our Modern Cotton assortment, which is a casual alternative to our core lingerie business. 
Importantly, our Modern Cotton line is increasing our engagement with the younger consumer, which we believe will create loyalty over the long term as the younger consumer graduates, in the future, to our more elevated product categories and our more elevated product offerings. 
We have also seen strong improvement in our Calvin Klein jeans business with the continued investment in product, which has been evidenced across all of our international markets through their strong growth. We are increasingly focused on key initiatives to drive this business forward, including investing in supply chain across our -- all of our denim efforts globally. We are also investing in capsule collections and the ability to respond faster to the consumer demands. 
Moving to our Heritage business. Revenue in the Heritage business for the quarter decreased 10% from $447 million in the prior quarter. We saw a double-digit increase in earnings as we discontinued our IZOD retail business during the year as well as a number of underperforming product lines in our dress furnishings business that did not meet our profit goals.
In dress shirts, we launched the Van Heusen flex collar, featuring an expandable collar. And given its initial success, we are taking this technology and moving it across a number of our other brands in 2016. Our IZOD shops at Kohl's continue to post very strong performance, following their 2014 fall holiday launch -- last year. Warner's and Olga improved market share positions for bras in the U.S., both in the chain and department store channels, with both brands significantly increasing their market share. During 2015, the Warner's No Side Effects bra drove significant performance improvement as its television commercial effectively communicated its key coverage features and led to significant conversion at point of sale. 
Our Speedo division continued to post healthy performance during 2015, and we see a significant opportunity for the Speedo brand in 2016 with the Summer Olympics, which we believe we can commercialize with our key retail partners as we move forward. 
Van Heusen also had a solid year with comparable store sales growing 5 -- 8% in the quarter and 10% for the year, and it also exceeded all of our profit expectations.
As we look forward into the first quarter and we look at the environment today by region, let me give you a little bit of a background -- backdrop to what we're seeing. In Europe, our business continues to persevere through the volatility that is plaguing the region. We continue -- especially the recent terror attacks in Belgium, Turkey and Paris. We continue to see strong comp store sales growth out of both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger with no signs of slowdown. Comps for Tommy continues to perform in the high single-digit range, and the Calvin Klein Europe business continues to comp low double digits. 
Moving to the U.S. As we've come out of the highly promotional fourth quarter, industry-wide inventory levels are elevated across channels. We aggressively cleared inventory in the fourth quarter and are not aggressively promoting in the first quarter, as we are managing gross margin rates against lower unit inventory levels at retail. As such, we are currently seeing comps down in the Calvin Klein business, low single digits, and down low double digits for the Tommy Hilfiger North America business. Our Van Heusen retail business was posting high single-digit comp store growth. At the same time, we are seeing higher gross margins across the board in the U.S. We continue to see the strong dollar's negative impact on our international tourist stores. However, we are seeing solid sales performance continue in our Canadian business. 
Moving to Asia. China continues to demonstrate strong results similar to what we've experienced in 2015. However, we were up against a shift in the Chinese New Year relative to our first quarter last year. We are expecting the weakness to continue in Korea and Hong Kong, driven more by the broader macro environment, in large part due to the lack of Mainland Chinese tourist spending in those markets. Overall, Asia comps here are trending down in the high single-digit range due to the year-over-year compare against Chinese New Year. China continues to outperform the region and continues to outperform the rest of the world. 
And I guess, as an overall backdrop, the global retail landscape continues to be uncertain with major foreign currencies largely weakening against the U.S. dollar. 
Global consumer spending patterns are volatile. The consumer is dealing with a tremendous amount of uncertainty and also dealing with geopolitical risk. Given this backtrack, we believe that we can successfully manage this challenging environment and have taken a prudent approach to our 2016 plan. We believe that our best-in-class brands and management teams will continue to manage through the volatility by leveraging our powerful brands and our operating platforms, while not losing sight of our long-term vision and our ability to deliver double-digit constant currency earnings per share growth. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to quantify some of the results."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to briefly touch on the fourth quarter of 2015 and then move on to 2016.
On a constant currency basis, revenues for the fourth quarter were up 7% versus the prior year and exceeded our guidance. Driving our revenue increase was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 21% constant currency increase over the prior year. Both our Calvin Klein North America and international businesses had revenue growth of over 20% in constant currency. The North America growth was driven by our wholesale underwear business and square footage expansion in our retail business, which included the conversion of the IZOD retail stores to Calvin Klein accessory and underwear stores. Calvin Klein international growth was mostly driven by Europe and China. 
Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 5% in constant currency, also exceeding our guidance, with strong revenue growth in our international business, which had revenue up 8% in constant currency and Europe comps up 10%, with most markets showing increases. Our U.S. Tommy Hilfiger retail stores located in international tourist destinations continue to be under significant pressure from a lack of traffic and spending. 
Our Heritage business revenues were down 10% due to the continued rationalization of the Heritage business, which included exiting the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Our Heritage revenues were below our guidance, due to shipments that were planned to go out at the end of '15 shifting into the first quarter of 2016. Our overall strong revenues drove an earnings per share beat for the company of $0.05 for the quarter versus our guidance, with favorable taxes and interest of about $0.03 being offset by further foreign exchange pressure of $0.03.
Moving to 2016. Our 2016 earnings will be significantly impacted by foreign exchange. In 2016, we are anticipating, based on current exchange rates, that it will be impacted negatively by about $1.60 of earnings per share for foreign exchange. The $1.60 impact is approximately 85% driven by transaction and 15% driven by translation. As a reminder, our exposure at a transactional level is mostly due to our international divisions purchasing their inventory in U.S. dollars. To partially protect against this, we buy foreign exchange hedge contracts about 12 months out for about 80% of our projected inventory purchases made by our international divisions in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the hedges we entered into during 2014 at more favorable exchange rates impacted our operations in 2015, while the hedges we entered into in 2015 during the strengthening U.S. dollar will negatively impact our operations in 2016. Our exposure at a translation level is simply due to converting the revenue and earnings of our international divisions into U.S. dollars. 
For the full year 2016, we are projecting earnings per share at $6.30 to $6.50. If we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.60, we have earnings per share growth of 12% to 15% over the prior year. Overall, we are projecting constant currency revenue to grow approximately 2%, excluding a negative impact of 1% related to foreign currency. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase approximately 75 basis points on a constant currency basis and to decrease approximately 100 basis points on a reported basis.
We project Calvin Klein revenues to grow 6% on a constant currency basis, excluding a negative impact of 2% related to foreign currency. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase about 50 basis points on a constant currency basis and to decrease approximately 100 basis points on a reported basis. 
Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on a constant currency basis, excluding a negative impact of 1% related to foreign currency, with operating margins planned to increase about 50 basis points on a constant currency basis and to decrease approximately 175 basis -- on a reported basis. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 7%, due mostly to the exiting of the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 50 basis points. The impact of currency on our Heritage business is relatively immaterial. 
Interest for the year is planned to be between $100 million and $125 million compared to the prior year amount of $113 million. As a reminder, an interest rate swap converting variable to fixed interest began in February of 2016 and is the reason for the increase. 
We currently expect to generate approximately $500 million of free cash flow in 2016, which we will use with existing cash on hand to fund the acquisition of the remaining 55% stake in our Tommy Hilfiger joint venture and to make similar debt paydowns and stock repurchases as we did in 2015. Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 20% and in line with the prior year.
First quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.40 to $1.45 and includes $0.50 in estimated negative impact for foreign exchange. Excluding this negative impact, we are expecting earnings per share to increase 27% to 30% for the first quarter. Revenue in the first quarter is projected to increase 3% on a constant currency basis, excluding the negative impact of 2% for foreign exchange. 
Calvin Klein revenues are planned at a 12% constant currency increase, excluding a negative impact of 4% for foreign currency. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at a 2% constant currency increase, excluding a negative impact of 1% for foreign currency, with North America planned down mid-single digits due to continued weakness in our retail stores located in international tourist locations, while our international business is planned up high single digits due to its continued strength in Europe. Heritage brand revenues are projected to decrease 9%, due mostly to our exiting of the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in dress shirts. Interest expense is projected to be about $28 million to $30 million and taxes to be 23% to 24% in the first quarter. 
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

I think the -- as we turn into second and third quarter, I think you'll see a significant decline in inventory levels as retailers have really tried to contract their open-to-buy dollars for fall and holiday. They're being very aggressive, focusing on inventory turn. And I think everyone is really trying to manage gross margin rates going forward and limit their markdown exposure, so I think you'll start to see that play out. My point in all of my comments were, I think we're a little bit ahead of the market. We really took the fourth quarter, and we had a good quarter and we really took advantage of clearing goods to get to the right inventory level. So we could start to see the gross margin improvement maybe earlier than you'll see in the overall market."

With the currencies going the opposite way and the U.S. dollar continuing to strengthen, it's not been an attractive place to travel to, and we've seen that really impact our business. More directly on the Tommy business that has such a premium position globally, Europe and Asia and Latin America, that we've really taken it on the chin on the Tommy business from a comp store performance.

It's also a very long year, as we're trying to really lay out what I would describe as a prudent plan that we continue to invest in. When you think about the quarters, second half of 2015 really saw substantial growth in the Calvin Klein businesses. So the comparisons get tougher in the second half of the year. And we are assuming that we're just not going to be able to have the kind of double-digit growth that we experienced in the first and maybe into the second quarter of this year to continue into the second half of this year. In addition, I'd just remind everyone, in the U.S., open-to-buy dollars at retail for the second half of the year, major department stores, have really shrunk those open-to-buy dollars. The challenge there is that they went into that season expecting comp store growth. We all know it didn't happen for a lot of reason: the unseasonably warm weather, international tourism issues. But suffice it to say is that second half of the year was generally very tough. The assumption here is we're dealing with these compressed open-to-buy dollars, and we're managing inventories tightly. So we're planning that second half level of sales growth much more cautiously as we go forward. If the trends were to continue what they are now, we would chase that business, and I think there'd be a sales upside opportunity we don't have in our numbers. But I think it would be premature to call that out now."

The Calvin Klein underwear business is, by its nature, one of the highest-margin businesses we have from a profitability point of view. Our underwear business, in general, is one of our highest operating margin business. So I would not anticipate significant margin expansion in those business, but I would expect continued top line growth in those businesses, which are margin-rich. So I think as they grow faster than the core, I think you'll see margins improve. On the jeans side, domestically, there's significant opportunity to grow our operating margins. That business was the business that I'd argue, when we made the Warnaco acquisition, was the most damaged. It's about a $300 million business, men's and women's, and I think we can continue to see margin expansion there. And I think you can think about that we are in the low-single digit kind of margin rates in jeans in North America. And there's no reason why that category, as it expands, and as we get better sell-throughs from the better investments that we're making in product and marketing, that, that shouldn't be a 10% operating margin business. The last piece I would say is our European business, from a margin point of view, is clearly the biggest opportunity we have. That's about -- that business has been the most impacted on the Calvin side by currency, and it's really transactional currencies. But despite that last year, we operated in the mid-single digits. With the headwinds we're seeing this year transaction-wise, I'd expect that business to continue into the mid-single digits this year and then to start to expand to that 10% goal we talked about. So Europe, both from a top line basis for Calvin Klein and on an operating margin basis, probably geographically, holds the biggest opportunity for continued growth in profitability."

It's a $140 million business, highly profitable business that we think can grow long-term over the next 5 to 6 years to somewhere in the vicinity of $300 million to $400 million. The Calvin Klein business today is approaching $300 million, to give you a sense of that. So we're -- we really see it there. The other area is that, in China, the Tommy Hilfiger business is really driven by men's sportswear. Women's is about 20% to 25% of the business. The balance is men's wear. So there's a huge men's wear opportunity.

But despite all of that, and I know it's -- I know from an investor point of view, it must be as frustrating as it is to the management team, we've grown our earnings on a constant currency basis about 15% over the last 2 years. So it's very frustrating over a 2-year period looking at almost $3 of earnings per share that has gone against us on the currency line. There's -- we see nothing that would stop us from continuing over -- at least let's use the next 3 years, that's how we do our strategic planning. That we couldn't continue to drive earnings per share growth at a double-digit rate, something between 12% and 16%, continuing to drive it given the dynamics that we see in the Calvin Klein business and the dynamics we see in the Tommy Hilfiger business. I think there's clearly an opportunity over time to regain the margin loss that has impacted us on an operating margin basis from a foreign currency impact. So when we look out, there's -- we think that there's somewhere in the neighborhood of another 100 to 200 basis points overall operating margin improvement in the business that we can build on as we move forward. If we get any kind of a tailwind from currencies, meaning that the dollar levels or starts to actually weaken somewhat long-term against some of these currencies, as we get back to equilibrium around the world, that would clearly be a tailwind that would help us going forward and have the biggest impact on our operating margins as we go forward, internationally.

And to be honest, it's changing faster than most of us would have anticipated. I think historically, for the last 20 years, we've been a multichannel distributor of product across different channels of distribution. So for us, this is another channel of distribution that needs to be managed and managed directly. I think the challenge is, from a profitability point of view, short term, the e-commerce profitability is lower than the brick-and-mortar opportunity, both wholesale and retail. But as that business scales, the profitability should level out, and we should become agnostic to where we sell the goods moving forward. But that will require, over the next couple of years, more investment in the systems, more investments in technology and people in order to bring that to balance, while at the same time, dealing with what in North America is a shrinking store pool. I mean, every major retailer is talking about some store closing. And I think we'll continue to see retailers pruning their store base 5% a year. And that slow march, I think, is ahead of us for the next 3 to 5 years as we get balanced and they deal with, in their channels of distribution and their retail stores, their growing e-commerce platform and just the need for less stores in order to connect with the consumers."

I think over time -- so I think there's 3 places that we are really focused on. We're focused on the supply chain, and that's where we're making tremendous investments, just looking at different sources of product. And that's a long-term opportunity to continue to improve our margin. Secondly, we're looking at, as you said, price increases. But you need to do that very thoughtfully. The idea of you just raise prices to match your costs, it just doesn't work that way. That's not the real world. You have key price points, be it for core categories that are big and highly profitable, and you need to manage that over time and have the consumer move with you, change their promotional agenda to a degree and try to get your average unit retails up. I think that's an opportunity as we go forward as well. And the last piece is, as we get equilibrium in the currency area, the real challenge that we had to face was that if you really look at what happened with currencies, the huge hit took place really in a compressed 6 to 9-month period of time. The euro was actually in like a 3-month period of time that we saw a drop from the mid-$1.30 to somewhere around $1.10. And that drop happened so quickly to be able to usually blend it into your hedging strategy, react to it. There just wasn't time. The ability to raise prices all at once with a consumer that's feeling pressure wasn't there as well. So I think there's an ability to recapture that over time. And I would characterize it as against the 2016 margins and goals that we set that there's 100 to 200 basis point opportunity in operating margins post 2016 as we move forward to improve operating margin."

With me this morning is Mike Schaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; as well as Ken Duane, who runs our Wholesale businesse",2004,"Thank you, Dana. Good morning, and thank you for joining me on the call. With me this morning is Mike Schaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; as well as Ken Duane, who runs our Wholesale businesses throughout the United States. 
We're very pleased with our first quarter results, which exceeded our expectations despite a challenging global environment and a difficult retail market in the U.S. 
Overall, we have a terrific quarter with revenues increasing 3% on a constant currency basis, while earnings per share grew 33% on a constant currency basis. The momentum in the quarter was primarily led by the strength of our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger International businesses. Our European and China businesses continue to be our healthiest markets while Hong Kong and Brazil are under pressure. 
From a macro perspective, the U.S. market continues to be the most difficult and volatile market we operate in. Despite that, our U.S. wholesale businesses are running ahead of plan and the prior year actual results. However, our U.S. retail businesses are seeing weaker traffic and higher promotional trends. Overall, international tourist traffic and spending continues to weigh on our U.S. retail business and we are experiencing a deceleration in sales trends in the U.S., especially after the early Easter. 
Our digital commerce businesses saw revenue growth in excess of 20% for the quarter, and this channel continues to be our fastest-growing distribution channel. Given our overall strong first quarter financial performance and the momentum we see in our international businesses, we are pleased that we're able to raise our full year earnings guidance and significantly increase the bottom end of our earnings forecast. 
Let me move into our -- each of our individual brands, moving to Tommy Hilfiger. Overall, revenue increased 4% on a constant currency basis and EBIT was up 20% on a constant currency basis. Our revenues were driven by the outstanding performance of our Tommy International business, which was up 11%. 
We saw solid performance in all major European markets demonstrated by our 8% increase in comps store sales for our retail business with particular strength in the U.K., Germany and Central European markets. Comp trends in the second quarter have continued to be strong running up high-single digits. 
Moving to wholesale. The Hilfiger brands continues to resonate with the European consumer, and we are seeing growth in our fall 2016 order book, which is now up 6% versus our previous indication of plus 4%. Growth in the order book was generated across all product categories and strong growth is coming out of markets like the U.K., Germany, Scandinavia, Spain and even Italy, which we have not seen in many seasons. 
Our Tommy Hilfiger China acquisition, which closed in mid-April, had a minimum impact in the first quarter. This business continues to demonstrate strong results and is tracking to our plan, which will be slightly accretive to our earnings this year. 
As we have said before, we will be deploying more marketing spend into this business, particularly in the second half of the year, which we believe will help set the foundation for sustainable growth in 2017 and beyond. 
Moving to North America. Our U.S. retail business continues to be under pressure, driven by the weakness in traffic and consumer spending. Comp store sales declined 10% in the first quarter and we have not seen any improvement in second quarter sales trends, and we are not forecasting for this trend to improve for the balance of the year. Moving to wholesale. 
I'm pleased to say that our Tommy Men's wholesale business has performed very well in the first quarter, highlighting the design improvements and product quality enhancements we have made to the men's line. We are posting positive retail sales results, strong sell-throughs and higher average unit retails. We are seeing this performance continue into the second quarter of the year for wholesale and are excited about the development there. 
I want to comment also on some recent news around the Hilfiger brand. From a brand perspective, we continue to be focused on driving brand relevancy and consumer engagement. We are leveraging our Ralphy almond relationship which began with Raffa as our brand ambassador for Tommy underwear and is now expanding to our tail clothing business. In conjunction, with the French open we just posted a great event in Paris with Raffa for TH flex suits, which are performing very well at retail. 
In September, we launched our Gigi Hadid capsule collection with 2 wide reaching e-commerce players, Amazon and Revolve. In addition, we will be offering the product in our Tommy Hilfiger stores and other key wholesale accounts around the world. This underscores the focus we are placing on our women's business for fall 2016 and beyond. 
We believe that we have the significant future global growth opportunity in women's and we are beginning to see positive momentum in this business. We will also introduce a Tommy jeans capsule collection in the U.S., which will hit Urban Outfitters stores in August. This exciting partnership will allow us to further tap into a younger consumer base which is critical for the brand. 
This jeans capsule collection has already been a huge success for us throughout Europe, and we look forward to leveraging this opportunity in the North American mall market. 
Last week, we also announced the we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture in Mexico with Grupo Axo, a long-time licensee of the Tommy Hilfiger brand in Mexico. This is an important strategic development for the business as it allows us to maintain a direct ownership interest in our Calvin Klein and Heritage businesses in Mexico while gaining control over our Tommy Hilfiger business in that region as well. 
Grupo Axo Hilfiger business is a larger business in terms of sales and profits than our Mexico business. However, given the strength of our brands position in the market, we were able to negotiate a favorable 50-50% ownership split. The closing of this transaction is expected to occur early in the third quarter of 2016. 
As a reminder, we are still on track to the hand over of our women's wholesale business to G-III for holiday 2016. Our key department store customer's initial reaction to the G-III reaction have been very positive and we continue to be very optimistic about the future prospects for this business. 
Moving to Calvin Klein. The first quarter was another solid quarter for Calvin Klein, as we generated top line growth of 13% on a constant currency basis. EBIT was up about 20% on a constant currency basis as well. 
Let me start with the international businesses for Calvin, which is really driven by the significant momentum in our European business. Europe continued to experienced double-digit retail comps and very healthy wholesale selling. Our fall 2016 order book has accelerated to high teens growth versus our previous indication of midteens growth. The strength of the business is coming from all major markets and across all of our product categories beyond just jeans and underwear, including menswear and accessories. 
We are seeing our brand presence across the markets continue to improve by the season. Growth is coming from new doors and incremental square footage being dedicated to the brand. In the second quarter, comp store sales in Europe continued to post strong double-digit sales increases. 
Our CK Asia businesses continues to perform with China outperforming the other markets. We are seeing strength across jeans, underwear, accessories and on newer CK performance business. As we look at the region, Hong Kong and Macau remains under pressure due to lack of mainland Chinese tourists. And Korea continues to be pressured by the macro environment and the department store sector. However, our Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia businesses are growing significantly. 
Second quarter comps sales in Asia have improved and are now running up about mid single-digits. In North America, our revenues are up about 14% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth of over 20% in North America wholesale due to the strong performance across all categories, particularly in men's underwear and the women's intimate businesses. 
During the quarter, we saw continued strong momentum in our Underwear business. As our women's business continues to see tremendous growth, both in bras and panties with our market share growing to the #5 position in bras and the #2 position in panties in the department store sector. In men's, we continue to hold the #1 market share position and we saw our market share in the first quarter grow to over 30%, which is a record performance for the men's business. 
Our jeans and men's sportswear business saw an improvement from the fall season with better AURs and strong sell-throughs, especially on the men's jeans side of the business. Women's continues to see outside improvement through our specialty store accounts like Urban Outfitters. 
Moving to retail. The business in the U.S. remains challenging with international tourist traffic and spending under the same pressure as we are seeing in our Hilfiger U.S. business. Retail comp trends continued to decelerate to May, and we are not running for this sales strength to improve for the balance of the year. 
Let me take a moment and discuss some of the recent news around the Calvin Klein brand. In April, we announced a new global creative strategy for the company, which will unify all Calvin Klein brands under one creative vision across all categories of the business. As a company continues to build itself into a $10 billion global retail sales business, this undertaking will further solidify the brand's position in worldwide and pave the way for future long-term global growth. We look forward to providing update on the strategy over the next few months. 
As it relates to the brand's relevancy and the power of the brand globally, we continue to see our awareness levels and willingness to purchase metrics continue to improve in all markets. Consumer engagement across the brand showed an over 35% increase in social media followers globally with a 60% increase in global engagements. We are connecting our e-commerce through our partnerships with Zalando, Urban Outfitters and key social media platforms. And of course, the brand continues to drive controversy with tremendous industry buzz, be it sponsoring Justin Bieber's worldwide tour, our #myCalvin's campaign, or many of our digital partnerships. 
Moving on to our Heritage businesses. The Heritage business revenues declined 12% driven by the ongoing rationalization of the business, including the exit of the eyes our retail business and the discontinuation of several license product launch in the dress furnishing business. Partially offset this decline was a 12% comp store sales increase in our venues and retail business. 
Earnings were close to flat versus prior year, as the gross margin rate improvement offset the planned revenue declines in the quarter. Overall, we have seen the department store channel continued to be under pressure from a traffic perspective, but we believe that our Heritage Brands are in most cases outperforming their respective categories. 
During the quarter, we continue to see positive response in sell-throughs from our venues and flex collar product and we celebrated the launch of Speedo Fit. Speedo Fit is a platform designed to inspire and equip athletes at all levels to explore the power of training in the water. We held major events, both in New York City and Los Angeles, with our Team Speedo athletes to launch the campaign. 
We are looking forward to the Olympics Speedo and have some exciting events planned around the games and around our business. Just to conclude my remarks. Overall, we were quite pleased with our performance in the first quarter and believe that our world-class brands, proven business model and best-in-class management teams are well positioned to navigate through this uncertain and volatile environment while continuing to deliver strong financial results. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike Schaffer, our CFO, to quantify some of my comments."
296568,337162035,992515,"PVH Corp., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 26, 2016",2016-05-26,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. First quarter revenues were in line with guidance with the 3% constant currency increase over the prior year after excluding the negative",835,"Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. First quarter revenues were in line with guidance with the 3% constant currency increase over the prior year after excluding the negative impact of 1% from foreign exchange. 
Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter and both exceeded our guidance. Calvin Klein revenues were up 13% on a constant currency basis driven by strong growth in Europe and North America wholesale, particularly our Underwear business. 
Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 4% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by strong performance in Europe as the Tommy Hilfiger International comp store sales were up 8%. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger U.S. retail businesses remained under pressure due to continued declines in the stores located in international tourist destinations. 
Heritage revenues were down 12%, primarily due to the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several license product lines in the address furnishing business. EPS for the quarter was better than the top end of our guidance by $0.05. The beat was driven by a strong Calvin Klein and Tommy performance for $0.03, as well as FX and the timing of taxes for another $0.02 combined. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2016, we are increasing our earnings guidance on the non-GAAP basis for the year while continuing to take a prudent approach to planning our business as foreign currency and global consumer spending remain unpredictable and volatile and the U.S. retail market is increasingly more promotional. 
For the full year 2016, we are anticipating based on current exchange rates that we will be impacted negatively by about $1.55 of earnings per share for foreign exchange. The $1.55 impact was approximately 90% driven by transaction and 10% driven by translation. 
For the full year 2016, we are projecting earnings per share of $6.45 to $6.55. If we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.55, we have earnings per share growth of 13% to 15% over the prior year. We have increased our guidance $0.15 from the bottom of our previous range and $0.05 on the top end of our previous range, which reflects a prudent view of our business for the second half of the year. 
Included in our full year guidance is increased marketing spending versus the prior year, which is mostly second half weighted. Overall, we are projecting revenue to grow approximately 2%, both on a constant currency and GAAP basis. This guidance reflects a revenue reduction of approximately $55 million in the second half of the year related to our proposed joint venture in Mexico, which is expected to close in the early third quarter and would primarily impact our Calvin Klein business. 
Overall, we expect the Mexico transaction to be earnings neutral for 2016. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase approximately 75 basis points on a constant currency basis and expected to decrease approximately 100 basis points on a reported basis. 
Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins to increase about 50 basis points, excluding the negative impact of 150 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned to increase about 50 basis points, excluding a negative impact with FX of 225 basis points. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 8% due mostly from the exiting of our IZOD retail business and several license product lines in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 30 basis points. The impact of foreign currency and the Heritage business is relatively immaterial. 
Interest expense for the year is planned to be between $117 million and $120 million compared to the prior year amount of $113 million and reflects decreased from our previous guidance as a result of our recent amendment to our credit facility. As a reminder, when compared to the prior year interest rate swap converting variable to fixed interest began in February and is the reason for the increase. 
Our tax rate for the year is plan to be about 20%, which is in line with our previous guidance and the prior year. Second quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.25 to $1.30 and includes $0.45 of estimated negative impact of foreign exchange. Excluding this negative impact, we are expecting earnings per share to increase 24% to 28% for the second quarter. 
Revenue in the second quarter is projected to increase 5% on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein revenues are planned at 13% constant currency increase and Tommy Hilfiger is planned at 7% constant currency increase. Heritage brand revenues are projected to decrease 12%. Interest expense is projected to be $26 million and $28 million for the second quarter and taxes. 24% to 25%. 
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

You can't just generalize because we're seeing really, substantial strength in our Calvin Klein brand. And I think that's really going counter trend to what's going on",651,"So again, Bob, when we look at sales trends, I guess, is a couple of stories going on. You can't just generalize because we're seeing really, substantial strength in our Calvin Klein brand. And I think that's really going counter trend to what's going on in the markets. So our wholesale, be it our Underwear business, our sportswear businesses, the women's business, the G-III is operating despite the challenges that we've already about in the last couple of weeks in the department store, U.S. department store channel, that Calvin brand continues to grow across department stores and continues to grow in some of the key specialty store counts, as well as online. 
Our retail businesses -- the Tommy business I'd also say, particularly on the men's side of the equation continues to perform very well, and we're planning the second quarter conservatively. But there's continue to grow from a top line point of view from us. The challenge -- when you look at the department store environment, I think one thing you have to take into consideration is that the overall comp trends have been challenging. But I think if you look at the categories that have been stronger, men's clearly has been stronger than women's overall. Apparel has been under pressure. But really, where I think we're seeing a much more significant pressure on the business is center core accessory business under major pressure. We play in that, but to a limited extent compared to the depth of our apparel business. 
So I think you got to factor that in when you think about our department store business. Of course, as I said, Calvin continue to grow 20% in the quarter and wholesale. So clearly, there's positive results going on there. 
Moving to our own retail business. Look, the biggest factor we are dealing with is a lack of traffic, particularly in the international tourist markets. We are continuing to see a downturn in international tourist coming out of South America, as well as some -- the Chinese consumer really taking a step back in the first quarter. So I think that has to do with currencies, what's going on with travel into the U.S. And to be honest I think at some of the strength that we see both in our European business and in our Asia business as well with tourist staying home in market, meaning, European staying within Europe, the Asian consumer traveling either to Europe or into the Asia market as well. So that's how I'll characterize it. 
Inventories, I'm concerned. I think our inventories are really under good control. We made a decision to invest in core inventory for the second quarter and beyond because we really see a sales opportunity, particularly in the underwear category, and we want to be in a position to fill those sales trends, both in men's and women's. And to remind you last year the sales trends were so positive, we were surprised by them. We were chasing inventory all year last year in that category. So we really have ourselves well positioned to really fulfill at the 100% rate given the current sales trends. So we're making that commitment on our inventories. But given the sales performance, inventories are building as we go into fall this day and it's going to be a promotional second quarter. 
We are hopeful that, that will, that the pain has been factored in at retail. And we're hopeful that as we come out of second quarter, inventories going into fall will be well positioned. And I think most retailers are really planning for turnaround in second half sales performance, given the difficult environment that they had to deal with last second half, last year second half.

I think most other apparel companies in this market and most of the retailer is based on what I read are looking for a sequential improvement as we start third and fourth quarter. We are not. But we are -- we position ourselves with the core product to be able to capture that sales growth if it were to come. So I think we are sitting in a good position in that given the momentum in our international business, as we've been able to plan our U.S. businesses conservatively, and I think that's partially what you're seeing as pulling down some of the sales growth that we see in the Calvin business. That coupled with the other 2 factors. I mean, we're coming off of double-digit growth in the third and fourth quarter of last year. We're growing on top of that, but we're not anticipating thIs is going to be double-digit growth going into the third and fourth quarter. You mentioned Mexico, which is worth over $50 million to us for the quarter. But from a profit point of view, we don't have any impact on us for the year.

So I think there's a real opportunity to outperform what we're currently projecting, given the positive reaction to the collections, given G-III's expertise and given the enthusiasm, which retailers seem to be getting on board with the product at Tommy. I also think that if you think about the women's opportunity for us, the opportunity is even bigger internationally. And I think the investments we are making, starting in the second half of this year from a marketing focus around the Tommy women's business, I think really positions us to take advantage of some of that momentum we see in the business. So you would expect women's to be bigger than men's. Obviously, for us it's not. It's men's represents over 60% of the Tommy Hilfiger volume worldwide.

But we don't promote dramatically. We try to keep it site pure. Our average unit retail selling on that side is significantly higher than what you would see average unit retails in department stores in the United States. And we really are trying to do the business in North America through our wholesale partners and a number of the pure plays here in the United States, particularly Amazon, which is growing dramatically. When you move internationally, it's really a 2-tiered approach for us. We are focused on our own e-commerce sites, Tommy Hilfiger is very large in Europe. By itself, our site is over $100 million there and is nicely profitable as well. And we're also selling to our wholesale.com accounts, as well as a number of the pure plays, like Amazon and Zalando. 
In Asia, where with the one to go acquisition, we probably saw a little bit later. We're really seeing strong momentum in that business as we move forward. Our key sites that we operate ourselves are doing well. But even more dramatically, Ali Baba, T-mall and our JV partnerships are really driving outsize growth for the business there. So it's a channel that we are really focused on. It's a channel that we're making significant investments in, and it's a channel that is our fastest growing channel distribution for both brands."

In men's, the opportunity here in North America continues to be the channel diversification that's somewhat going on. Calvin Klein is the department store brand from Nordtrom's to Macy's, those are key large accounts, Bloomingdale's. As you think about it with the growth of pure plays, it's opening us up to a newer consumer and we are capturing that market share, should be it on Amazon, or Urban Outfitters.com. So really, a channel play there in the United States is important for us as we move forward as well. Internationally, it's just all white space. We had huge opportunity in Europe. We continue to grow that business as the brand continues to expand there, both in men's and women's. And in Asia, which is a direct retail place for us, we continue to see strong comp store sales performance there, and I think both men's and women's could continue to grow.

And as e-commerce scales, both our own and the pure plays and our wholesale.com business, our profitability in that channel is similar to our profitability in the wholesale channel. So we are -- we believe -- from a profitability point of view, we're going to manage the distribution from a brand point of view, but it really doesn't change dramatically impact our profitability at all. On the distribution channel, what we do find is the specialty store channel and the dot-com channel opens us up to a younger consumer, not only for underwear but for all of our businesses. And that's exciting for us. And we're connecting with that consumer from a marketing perspective, marketing campaigns relatively engage. Our digital spend in Calvin and Tommy today is almost 65% of our marketing spend is really occurring on a digital basis. And we're really trying to move and connect with that consumer emotionally and may shop differently. At the same time, we're not looking to alienate our department store customer North America or around the world.

I think if currencies were to start to swing the other way marginally and start to improve, that's how you capture back the other half of it as we move forward. It's something that we really need to watch. We've got Dana and Mike have very sophisticated hedging strategies to really get us early next 12 months from a transaction point of view. But as you go long-term and since inventory throughout the world in Europe, throughout Asia is more from U.S. dollars. You can hedge and you can go out probably 15 months. But once those hedges fall off, if currencies remained weak against the U.S. dollar, you're going to have to deal with that at that point in time. And that's what's happening to us in 2016. So hopefully, we're optimistic that we'll see some strengthening of some of the currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the euro, given the strengthening of that economy as we move forward.

And Gigi is the key part of that marketing investments. I think the opportunities not so much just the Gigi collection. I think that creates buzz with the consumer. I think you're going to see it over and you're going to see it in key retailers and you also see it really advertising significantly globally but I think it really provides platform and foundation to really move that Tommy women's business as we go forward."

I think one of the things -- we listen to our customers, and one of the things that we talk about 3, 4 years ago is they wanted us from an e-commerce point of view, from a.com point of view, they wanted us to help drive traffic to their sites. So we make decision in North America not to compete directly with them or online. And by that, I mean is I think competitors, whoever they are, have much bigger direct e-commerce sites that we have. We make strategic decisions to partner with our department store customers to really expand their e-commerce businesses, to make investments on their platforms that our brands are well positioned, not only in their brick-and-mortar stores, but also in their e-commerce sites. And obviously, we're seeing outsize scrolls with that channel distribution be Macy's.com or Morgentaler.com. So really making investments along with them to drive that business. I don't feel a constant going there. I think the Amazon situation, it's an opportunity. We tried to have different merchandising strategies for both players with not the same performance. Obviously, the fashion closure that Macy's are much stronger, much deeper. Amazon really knows how to sell core products. They're trying to get into the fashion world, like they have improved that yet and will see how that all plays out. But clearly, for us, comparative wise, it hasn't been a major discussion point. Calvin and Tommy, depending on the retailer in North America, we are 2 of the top 4 brands in every major retailer in North America where it's appropriate for us to sell our goods. So the relationships are really never been better. And the channel conflict that we manage everyday has been going on for the last 20 years, whether its concerns about all retail stores, whatever, and that's just being global brands, that's what we do, that's what we get paid for. So I have not seen that in tens of significantly. 
Thank you so much everyone. I wish everyone a happy, safe Memorial Day weekend to kick off the summer and hopefully, some better selling at retail here in the United States, and we look forward to speaking to you in August about the second quarter performance. Have a good day, everyone."

Good morning, and thank you for joining me on the call. With me this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; as well as Ken Duane, who runs our wholesale businesses throughout the United States.
We're very pleased with our first quarter results, which exceeded our expectations despite the challenging global environment and a difficult retail market in the U.S.
Overall, we had a terrific quarter with revenues increasing 3% on a constant currency basis, while earnings per share grew 33% on a constant currency basis. The momentum in the quarter was primarily led by the strength of our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger international businesses. Our European and China businesses continued to be our healthiest markets, while Hong Kong and Brazil are under pressure.
From a macro perspective, the U.S. market continues to be the most difficult and volatile market we operate in. Despite that, our U.S. wholesale businesses are running ahead of plan and the prior year actual results. However, our U.S. retail businesses are seeing weaker traffic and higher promotional trends. Overall, international tourist traffic and spending continues to weigh on our U.S. retail business, and we are experiencing a deceleration in sales trends in the U.S., especially after the early Easter.
Our digital commerce businesses saw revenue growth in excess of 20% for the quarter, and this channel continues to be our fastest-growing distribution channel.
Given our overall strong first quarter financial performance and the momentum we see in our international businesses, we are pleased that we're able to raise our full year earnings guidance and significantly increase the bottom end of our earnings forecast.
Let me move into our -- each of our individual brands. Moving to Tommy Hilfiger. Overall, revenue increased 4% on a constant currency basis, and EBIT was up 20% on a constant currency basis. Our revenues were driven by the outstanding performance of our Tommy International business, which was up 11%. We saw solid performance in all major European markets, demonstrated by our 8% increase in comp store sales for our retail business, with particular strength in the U.K., Germany and Central European markets. Comp trends in the second quarter have continued to be strong, running up high-single digits.
Moving to wholesale. The Hilfiger brand continues to resonate with the European consumer, and we are seeing growth in our fall 2016 order book, which is now up 6% versus our previous indication of plus 4%. Growth in the order book was generated across all product categories, and strong growth is coming out of markets like the U.K., Germany, Scandinavia, Spain and even Italy, which we have not seen in many seasons.
Our Tommy Hilfiger China acquisition, which closed in mid-April, had a minimum impact in the first quarter. This business continues to demonstrate strong results and is tracking to our plan, which will be slightly accretive to our earnings this year.
As we have said before, we will be deploying more marketing spend into this business, particularly in the second half of the year, which we believe will help set the foundation for sustainable growth in 2017 and beyond.
Moving to North America. Our U.S. retail business continues to be under pressure, driven by the weakness in traffic and consumer spending. Comp store sales declined 10% in the first quarter, and we have not seen any improvement in second quarter sales trends, and we are not forecasting for this trend to improve for the balance of the year.
Moving to wholesale. I'm pleased to say that our Tommy men's wholesale business has performed very well in the first quarter, highlighting the design improvements and product quality enhancements we have made to the men's line. We are posting positive retail sales results, strong sell-throughs and higher average unit retails. We are seeing this performance continue into the second quarter of the year for wholesale and are excited about the development there.
I want to comment also on some recent news around the Hilfiger brand. From a brand perspective, we continue to be focused on driving brand relevancy and consumer engagement. We are leveraging our Rafael Nadal relationship, which began with Rafa as our brand ambassador for Tommy underwear, and is now expanding to our tailored clothing business. In conjunction with the French Open, we just hosted a great event in Paris with Rafa for TH Flex suits, which are performing very well at retail.
In September, we launched our Gigi Hadid capsule collection with 2 wide-reaching e-commerce players, Amazon and Revolve. In addition, we will be offering the product in our Tommy Hilfiger stores and other key wholesale accounts around the world. This underscores the focus we are placing on our women's business for fall 2016 and beyond.
We believe that we have the significant future global growth opportunity in women's, and we are beginning to see positive momentum in this business. We will also introduce a Tommy Jeans capsule collection in the U.S., which will hit Urban Outfitters stores in August. This exciting partnership will allow us to further tap into a younger consumer base, which is critical for the brand. This jeans capsule collection has already been a huge success for us throughout Europe, and we look forward to leveraging this opportunity in the North America mall market.
Last week, we also announced that we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture in Mexico with Grupo Axo, a long-time licensee of the Tommy Hilfiger brand in Mexico. This is an important strategic development for the business as it allows us to maintain a direct ownership interest in our Calvin Klein and Heritage businesses in Mexico, while gaining control over our Tommy Hilfiger business in that region as well.
Grupo Axo's Hilfiger business is a larger business in terms of sales and profits than our Mexico business. However, given the strength of our brands position in the market, we were able to negotiate a favorable 50-50% ownership split. The closing of this transaction is expected to occur early in the third quarter of 2016.
As a reminder, we are still on track for the handover of our women's wholesale business to G-III for holiday 2016. Our key department store customers' initial reaction to the G-III collections have been very positive, and we continue to be very optimistic about the future prospects for this business.
Moving to Calvin Klein. The first quarter was another solid quarter for Calvin Klein as we generated top line growth of 13% on a constant currency basis. EBIT was up about 20% on a constant currency basis as well.
Let me start with the international businesses for Calvin, which is really driven by the significant momentum in our European business. Europe continued to experience double-digit retail comps and very healthy wholesale selling. Our fall 2016 order book has accelerated to high-teens growth versus our previous indication of mid-teens growth. The strength of the business is coming from all major markets and across all of our product categories beyond just jeans and underwear, including menswear and accessories.
We are seeing our brand presence across the markets continue to improve by the season. Growth is coming from new doors and incremental square footage being dedicated to the brand. In the second quarter, comp store sales in Europe continued to post strong double-digit sales increases.
Our CK Asia businesses continues to perform with China outperforming the other markets. We are seeing strength across jeans, underwear, accessories and on newer CK performance business. As we look at the region, Hong Kong and Macau remains under pressure due to the lack of Mainland Chinese tourists. And Korea continues to be pressured by the macro environment and the department store sector. However, our Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia businesses are growing significantly. Second quarter comp sales in Asia have improved and are now running up about mid-single digits.
In North America, our revenues are up about 14% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth of over 20% in North America wholesale, due to the strong performance across all categories, particularly in men's underwear and the women's intimate businesses.
During the quarter, we saw continued strong momentum in our Underwear business. As our women's business continues to see tremendous growth, both in bras and panties, with our market share growing to the #5 position in bras and the #2 position in panties in the department store sector. In men's, we continue to hold the #1 market share position, and we saw our market share in the first quarter grow to over 30%, which is a record performance for the men's business.
Our jeans and men's sportswear business saw an improvement from the fall season with better AURs and strong sell-throughs, especially on the men's jeans side of the business. Women's continues to see outsized improvement through our specialty store accounts, like Urban Outfitters.
Moving to retail. The business in the U.S. remains challenging with international tourist traffic and spending under the same pressure as we are seeing in our Hilfiger U.S. business. Retail comp trends continued to decelerate into May, and we are not planning for this sales strength to improve for the balance of the year.
Let me take a moment and discuss some of the recent news around the Calvin Klein brand. In April, we announced a new global creative strategy for the company, which will unify all Calvin Klein brands under one creative vision across all categories of the business. As the company continues to build itself into a $10 billion global retail sales business, this undertaking will further solidify the brand's positioning worldwide and pave the way for future long-term global growth. We look forward to providing update on this strategy over the next few months.
As it relates to the brand's relevancy and the power of the brand globally, we continue to see our awareness levels and willingness to purchase metrics continue to improve in all markets. Consumer engagement across the brand showed an over 35% increase in social media followers globally with a 60% increase in global engagements. We are connecting art with commerce through our partnerships with Zalando, Urban Outfitters and key social media platforms. And of course, the brand continues to drive controversy with tremendous industry buzz, be it sponsoring Justin Bieber's worldwide tour, our #MyCalvin's campaign or many of our digital partnerships.
Moving on to our Heritage businesses. The Heritage businesses revenues declined 12%, driven by the ongoing rationalization of the business, including the exit of IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishing business. Partially offsetting this decline was a 12% comp store sales increase in our venues and retail business.
Earnings were close to flat versus the prior year as the gross margin rate improvement offset the planned revenue declines in the quarter. Overall, we have seen the department store channel continue to be under pressure from a traffic perspective, but we believe that our Heritage Brands are, in most cases, outperforming their respective categories.
During the quarter, we continue to see positive response in sell-throughs from our venues and Flex Collar product, and we celebrated the launch of Speedo Fit. Speedo Fit is a platform designed to inspire and equip athletes at all levels to explore the power of training in the water. We held major events, both in New York City and Los Angeles, with our Team Speedo athletes to launch the campaign. We are looking forward to the Olympics Speedo and have some exciting events planned around the games and around our business.
Just to conclude my remarks. Overall, we were quite pleased with our performance in the first quarter and believe that our world-class brands, proven business model and best-in-class management teams are well positioned to navigate through this uncertain and volatile environment, while continuing to deliver strong financial results.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike Shaffer, our CFO, to quantify some of my comments."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. First quarter revenues were in line with guidance with the 3% constant currency increase over the prior year after excluding the negative impact of 1% from foreign exchange.
Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter and both exceeded our guidance. Calvin Klein revenues were up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth in Europe and North America wholesale, particularly our underwear business.
Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 4% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by strong performance in Europe as our Tommy Hilfiger International comp store sales were up 8%.
Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger U.S. retail businesses remain under pressure due to continued declines in our stores located in international tourist destinations.
Heritage revenues were down 12%, primarily due to the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business.
EPS for the quarter was better than the top end of our guidance by $0.05. The beat was driven by a strong Calvin Klein and Tommy performance for $0.03 as well as FX and the timing of taxes for another $0.02 combined.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2016, we are increasing our earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis for the year, while continuing to take a prudent approach to planning our business as foreign currency and global consumer spending remain unpredictable and volatile and the U.S. retail market is increasingly more promotional.
For the full year 2016, we are anticipating, based on current exchange rates, that we will be impacted negatively by about $1.55 of earnings per share for foreign exchange. The $1.55 impact was approximately 90% driven by transaction and 10% driven by translation.
For the full year 2016, we are projecting earnings per share of $6.45 to $6.55. If we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.55, we have earnings per share growth of 13% to 15% over the prior year. We have increased our guidance $0.15 from the bottom of our previous range and $0.05 on the top end of our previous range, which reflects a prudent view of our business for the second half of the year.
Included in our full year guidance is increased marketing spending versus the prior year, which is mostly second-half weighted. Overall, we are projecting revenue to grow approximately 2%, both on a constant currency and GAAP basis. This guidance reflects a revenue reduction of approximately $55 million in the second half of the year related to our proposed joint venture in Mexico, which is expected to close in the early third quarter and would primarily impact our Calvin Klein business.
Overall, we expect the Mexico transaction to be earnings neutral for 2016. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase approximately 75 basis points on a constant currency basis and expected to decrease approximately 100 basis points on a reported basis.
Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins to increase about 50 basis points, excluding the negative impact of 150 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned to increase about 50 basis points, excluding a negative impact with FX of 225 basis points.
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 8%, due mostly through the exiting of our IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 30 basis points. The impact of foreign currency in the Heritage business is relatively immaterial.
Interest expense for the year is planned to be between $117 million and $120 million compared to the prior year amount of $113 million and reflects a decrease from our previous guidance as a result of our recent amendment to our credit facilities. As a reminder, when compared to the prior year, interest rate swap converting variable to fixed interest began in February and is the reason for the increase.
Our tax rate for the year is planned to be about 20%, which is in line with previous guidance and the prior year. Second quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.25 to $1.30 and includes $0.45 of estimated negative impact for foreign exchange. Excluding this negative impact, we are expecting earnings per share to increase 24% to 28% for the second quarter.
Revenue in the second quarter is projected to increase 5% on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein revenues are planned at 13% constant currency increase and Tommy Hilfiger is planned at 7% constant currency increase. Heritage brand revenues are projected to decrease 12%. Interest expense is projected to be $26 million and $28 million for the second quarter. And taxes, 24% to 25%.
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

And then the second part of it is within the U.S., can you just talk a little bit about where you see current inventory levels and where the pressure is and how you feel positioned both in our retail business, but also at the wholesale level?"
296568,337162035,992647,"PVH Corp., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 26, 2016",2016-05-26,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","So again, Bob, when we look at sales trends, I guess, it's a couple of stories going on. You can't just generalize because we're seeing really substantial strength in our Calvin Klein brand, and I think that's really going counter trend to what's going on",656,"So again, Bob, when we look at sales trends, I guess, it's a couple of stories going on. You can't just generalize because we're seeing really substantial strength in our Calvin Klein brand, and I think that's really going counter trend to what's going on in the markets. So our wholesale, be it our underwear business, our sportswear businesses, the women's business, the G-III is operating despite the challenges that we've all read about over the last couple of weeks in the department store -- U.S. department store channel. That Calvin brand continues to grow across department stores and continues to grow in some of the key specialty store accounts as well as online. Our retail businesses -- the Tommy business, I'd also say, particularly on the men's side of the equation continues to perform very well, and we're planning the second quarter conservatively, but this continue to grow from a top line point of view from us. The challenge -- when you look at the department store environment, I think one thing you have to take into consideration is that the overall comp trends have been challenging. But I think if you look at the categories that have been stronger, men's clearly has been stronger than women's overall. Apparel has been under pressure. But really, where I think we're seeing a much more significant pressure on the business is center core. The accessory business is under major pressure. We play in that, but to a limited extent compared to the depth of our apparel business. So I think you got to factor that in when you think about our department store business. Of course, as I said, Calvin continued to grow 20% in the quarter at wholesale. So clearly, there's positive results going on there. Moving to our own retail business. Look, the biggest factor we are dealing with is a lack of traffic, particularly in the international tourist markets. We are continuing to see a downturn in international tourists coming out of South America as well as some -- the Chinese consumer really taking a step back in the first quarter. So I think that has to do with currencies, what's going on with travel into the U.S. And to be honest, I think it's some of the strength that we see both in our European business and in our Asia business as well with tourist staying home in market, meaning, European staying within Europe, the Asian consumer traveling either to Europe or into the Asia market as well. So that's how I'll characterize it. Inventories, I'm concerned. I think our inventories are really under good control. We've made a decision to invest in core inventory for the second quarter and beyond because we really see a sales opportunity, particularly in the underwear category, and we wanted to be in a position to fill those sales trends, both in men's and women's. And to remind you, last year, the sales trends were so positive, we were surprised by them. We were chasing inventory all year last year in that category. So we really have ourselves well positioned to really fulfill at the 100% rate given the current sales trends. So we're making that commitment on our inventories. But given the sales performance, inventories are building as we go into Father's Day, and it's going to be a promotional second quarter. We are hopeful that, that will -- that, that the pain has been factored in at retail. And we're hopeful that as we come out of second quarter, inventories going into fall will be well positioned. And I think most retailers are really planning for turnaround in second half sales performance given the difficult environment that they had to deal with last second half -- last year second half. So long-winded answer, I really do believe inventories will be under pressure and promotions will be more significant in the second quarter in the U.S."

We're anticipating that the sales trends that we've seen in the first quarter are going to continue into May -- are going to continue for the balance of the year in Calvin Klein. We're not looking for a sequential improvement as we get to the second half of the year. I think most other apparel companies in this market and most of the retailers, based on what I've read, are looking for a sequential improvement as we start third and fourth quarter; we are not. But we are -- we positioned ourselves with core product to be able to capture that sales growth if it were to come. So I think we are sitting in a good position in that given the momentum in our international business as we've been able to plan our U.S. businesses conservatively, and I think that's partially what you're seeing as pulling down some of the sales growth that we see in the Calvin business. That coupled with the other 2 factors. I mean, we're coming off of double-digit growth in the third and fourth quarter of last year. We're growing on top of that, but we're not anticipating it's going to be double-digit growth going into the third and fourth quarter. You mentioned Mexico, which is worth over $50 million to us for the quarter. But from a profit point of view, we don't have any impact on us for the year. So I think there's opportunity -- let me just sum it up by saying, I think, there's opportunity to outperform those sales projections if the environment just improves slightly."

So I think there's a real opportunity to outperform what we're currently projecting, given the positive reaction to the collections, given G-III's expertise and given the enthusiasm, which retailers seem to be getting onboard with the product at Tommy. I also think that if you think about the women's opportunity for us, the opportunity is even bigger internationally. And I think the investments we are making, starting in the second half of this year from a marketing focus around the Tommy women's business, I think, really positions us to take advantage of some of that momentum we see in the business. So you would expect the women's to be bigger than men's. Obviously, for us, it's not. It's -- men's represents over 60% of the Tommy Hilfiger volume worldwide. So there's a real opportunity to continue to grow men's, but really outperform in women's, and that's not in any of our forward-looking projections."

We haven't even launched any kind of women's sportswear or related classification businesses with Calvin outside of North America. We've got a big jeans business, but very limited sportswear offerings on the women's side of the business. And on men's, sportswear businesses internationally are significantly underdeveloped as well as tailored clothing, which is big businesses here.

But we don't promote dramatically, we try to keep the site pure. Our average unit retail selling on that side is significantly higher than what you would see average unit retails in department stores in the United States. And we really are trying to do the business in North America through our wholesale partners and a number of the pure plays here in the United States, particularly Amazon, which is growing dramatically. When you move internationally, it's really a 2-tiered approach for us. We are focused on our own e-commerce sites. Tommy Hilfiger is very large in Europe. By itself, our site is over $100 million there and is nicely profitable as well. And we're also selling to our wholesale dot-com accounts as well as some -- a number of the pure plays, like Amazon and Zalando. In Asia, where, with one little acquisition, we probably saw it a little bit later. We're really seeing strong momentum in that business as we move forward. Our key sites that we operate ourselves are doing well. But even more dramatically, Alibaba through Tmall and our JV partnerships are really driving outsize growth for the business there. So it's a channel that we are really focused on, it's a channel that we're making significant investments in, and it's a channel that is our fastest growing channel distribution for both brands."

In men's, the opportunity here in North America continues to be the channel diversification that's somewhat going on. Calvin Klein is the department store brand from Nordtrom's to Macy's, those are our key large accounts, Bloomingdale's. As you think about it with the growth of pure plays, it's opening us up to a newer consumer, and we are capturing that market share, be it on Amazon or urbanoutfitters.com. So really, a channel play there in the United States is important for us as we move forward as well. Internationally, it's just all white space. We had huge opportunity in Europe to continue to grow that business as the brand continues to expand there, both in men's and women's. And in Asia, which is a direct retail place for us, we continue to see strong comp store sales performance there, and I think both men's and women's could continue to grow.

I think the second part of the question is easier to understand is we are agnostic about where the consumer buys products. By that, I mean is, we have a very profitable retail direct-to-consumer channel. Our wholesale business is highly profitable within 100 basis points of each other. And as e-commerce scales, both our own and the pure plays and our wholesale dot-com business, our profitability in that channel is similar to our profitability in the wholesale channel. So we are -- we believe we're -- from a profitability point of view, we're going to manage the distribution from a brand point of view, but it really doesn't truly dramatically impact our profitability at all. On the distribution channel, what we do find is the specialty store channel and the dot-com channel opens us up to a younger consumer, not only for underwear, but for all of our businesses, and that's exciting for us. And we're connecting with that consumer from a marketing perspective, marketing campaigns [indiscernible] to engage. Our digital spend in Calvin and Tommy today is -- over 65% of our marketing spend is really occurring on a digital basis. And we're really trying to move and connect with that consumer emotionally and may shop differently. At the same time, we're not looking to alienate our department store customer in North America or around the world. And we're able to -- we believe we're able to balance that out through our channels of distribution. So we think we're in a strong position to manage the brick-and-mortar evolution that's going on, at the same time, the advantage of the growth that's occurring in the e-commerce channel."

I think from a -- if currencies just stayed where they are and more or less leveled here, I believe we can capture back half of that over the next 3 years. I think if currencies were to start to swing the other way marginally and start to improve, that's how you capture back the other half of it as we move forward. So it's something that we really need to watch. We've got very -- Dana and Mike have very sophisticated hedging strategies to really get us through the next 12 months from a transaction point of view. But as you go long-term and since inventory throughout the world in Europe, throughout Asia is more than U.S. dollars, you can hedge and you can go out probably 15 months. But once those hedges fall off, if currencies remain weak against the U.S. dollar, you're going to have to deal with that at that point in time. And that's what's happening to us in 2016. So hopefully, we're optimistic that we'll see some strengthening of some of the currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the euro, given the strengthening of that economy as we move forward.

I think you're going to -- you'll see it all over, and you'll see it in key retailers, and you'll all also see it really advertising significantly globally, but I think it really provides a platform and a foundation to really move the Tommy women's business as we go forward."

I can assure you that systems are a big piece of that, platforms are a big piece. If we made a decision that the commerce business is growing so strongly that we need a separate warehouse for e-comm, that will be a major capital investment. But you could be sure that they would be a significant expense benefit associated with making that investment based on the efficiencies that would come out of standalone warehouses here in North America or Europe or Asia. So I think we're very comfortable with the investments we have made, which we'll continue to make. And I think the business will continue to evolve, and our business and our investments will evolve along with where we see those growth initiatives.

I think one of the things -- we listen to our customers, and one of the things that we talk about 3, 4 years ago is they wanted us, from an e-commerce point of view, from a dot-com point of view, they wanted us to help drive traffic to their sites. So we made a decision in North America not to compete directly with them or online. And by that, I mean is I think competitors, whoever they are, have much bigger direct e-commerce sites than we have. We have made a strategic decision to partner with the -- with our department store customers to really expand their e-commerce businesses, to make investments on their platforms that our brands are well positioned, not only in their brick-and-mortar stores, but also in their e-commerce sites. And obviously, we're seeing outsize growth with that channel of distribution, be macy's.com or lordandtaylor.com. So really making the investments along with them to drive that business. So I don't feel a constant growing there. I think the Amazon situation, it's an opportunity. We try to have different merchandising strategies for both players with not the same performance. Obviously, the fashion quotient at Macy's is much stronger, much deeper. Amazon really knows how to sell core products. They're trying to get into the fashion world, but they have improved that yet, and we'll see how that all plays out. But clearly, for us, comparative-wise, it hasn't been a major discussion point. Calvin and Tommy, depending on the retailer in North America, we are 2 of the top 4 brands in every major retailer in North America, where it's appropriate for us to sell our goods. So the relationships have really never been better. And the channel conflict that we manage everyday has been going on for the last 20 years, whether it was concerns about our own retail stores, whatever, and that's the global brands, that's what we do, that's what we get paid for. So I have not seen that intensify significantly.
Thank you so much, everyone. I wish everyone a happy, safe Memorial Day weekend to kick off the summer and hopefully, some better selling at retail here in the United States, and we look forward to speaking to you in August about the second quarter performance. Have a good day, everyone."

Good morning, and thank you for joining me on the call. With me this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; as well as Ken Duane, who runs our wholesale businesses throughout the United States.
We're very pleased with our first quarter results, which exceeded our expectations despite the challenging global environment and a difficult retail market in the U.S.
Overall, we had a terrific quarter with revenues increasing 3% on a constant currency basis, while earnings per share grew 33% on a constant currency basis. The momentum in the quarter was primarily led by the strength of our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger international businesses. Our European and China businesses continued to be our healthiest markets, while Hong Kong and Brazil are under pressure.
From a macro perspective, the U.S. market continues to be the most difficult and volatile market we operate in. Despite that, our U.S. wholesale businesses are running ahead of plan and the prior year actual results. However, our U.S. retail businesses are seeing weaker traffic and higher promotional trends. Overall, international tourist traffic and spending continues to weigh on our U.S. retail business, and we are experiencing a deceleration in sales trends in the U.S., especially after the early Easter.
Our digital commerce businesses saw revenue growth in excess of 20% for the quarter, and this channel continues to be our fastest-growing distribution channel.
Given our overall strong first quarter financial performance and the momentum we see in our international businesses, we are pleased that we're able to raise our full year earnings guidance and significantly increase the bottom end of our earnings forecast.
Let me move into our -- each of our individual brands. Moving to Tommy Hilfiger. Overall, revenue increased 4% on a constant currency basis, and EBIT was up 20% on a constant currency basis. Our revenues were driven by the outstanding performance of our Tommy International business, which was up 11%. We saw solid performance in all major European markets, demonstrated by our 8% increase in comp store sales for our retail business, with particular strength in the U.K., Germany and Central European markets. Comp trends in the second quarter have continued to be strong, running up high-single digits.
Moving to wholesale. The Hilfiger brand continues to resonate with the European consumer, and we are seeing growth in our fall 2016 order book, which is now up 6% versus our previous indication of plus 4%. Growth in the order book was generated across all product categories, and strong growth is coming out of markets like the U.K., Germany, Scandinavia, Spain and even Italy, which we have not seen in many seasons.
Our Tommy Hilfiger China acquisition, which closed in mid-April, had a minimum impact in the first quarter. This business continues to demonstrate strong results and is tracking to our plan, which will be slightly accretive to our earnings this year.
As we have said before, we will be deploying more marketing spend into this business, particularly in the second half of the year, which we believe will help set the foundation for sustainable growth in 2017 and beyond.
Moving to North America. Our U.S. retail business continues to be under pressure, driven by the weakness in traffic and consumer spending. Comp store sales declined 10% in the first quarter, and we have not seen any improvement in second quarter sales trends, and we are not forecasting for this trend to improve for the balance of the year.
Moving to wholesale. I'm pleased to say that our Tommy men's wholesale business has performed very well in the first quarter, highlighting the design improvements and product quality enhancements we have made to the men's line. We are posting positive retail sales results, strong sell-throughs and higher average unit retails. We are seeing this performance continue into the second quarter of the year for wholesale and are excited about the development there.
I want to comment also on some recent news around the Hilfiger brand. From a brand perspective, we continue to be focused on driving brand relevancy and consumer engagement. We are leveraging our Rafael Nadal relationship, which began with Rafa as our brand ambassador for Tommy underwear, and is now expanding to our tailored clothing business. In conjunction with the French Open, we just hosted a great event in Paris with Rafa for TH Flex suits, which are performing very well at retail.
In September, we launched our Gigi Hadid capsule collection with 2 wide-reaching e-commerce players, Amazon and Revolve. In addition, we will be offering the product in our Tommy Hilfiger stores and other key wholesale accounts around the world. This underscores the focus we are placing on our women's business for fall 2016 and beyond.
We believe that we have a significant future global growth opportunity in women's, and we are beginning to see positive momentum in this business. We will also introduce a Tommy Jeans capsule collection in the U.S., which will hit Urban Outfitters stores in August. This exciting partnership will allow us to further tap into a younger consumer base, which is critical for the brand. This jeans capsule collection has already been a huge success for us throughout Europe, and we look forward to leveraging this opportunity in the North America mall pocket.
Last week, we also announced that we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture in Mexico with Grupo Axo, a long-time licensee of the Tommy Hilfiger brand in Mexico. This is an important strategic development for the business as it allows us to maintain a direct ownership interest in our Calvin Klein and Heritage businesses in Mexico, while gaining control over our Tommy Hilfiger business in that region as well.
Grupo Axo's Hilfiger business is a larger business in terms of sales and profits than our Mexico business. However, given the strength of our brands position in the market, we were able to negotiate a favorable 50-50% ownership split. The closing of this transaction is expected to occur early in the third quarter of 2016.
As a reminder, we are still on track for the handover of our women's wholesale business to G-III for holiday 2016. Our key department store customers' initial reaction to the G-III collections have been very positive, and we continue to be very optimistic about the future prospects for this business.
Moving to Calvin Klein. The first quarter was another solid quarter for Calvin Klein as we generated top line growth of 13% on a constant currency basis. EBIT was up about 20% on a constant currency basis as well.
Let me start with the international businesses for Calvin, which is really driven by the significant momentum in our European business. Europe continued to experience double-digit retail comps and very healthy wholesale selling. Our fall 2016 order book has accelerated to high-teens growth versus our previous indication of mid-teens growth. The strength of the business is coming from all major markets and across all of our product categories beyond just jeans and underwear, including menswear and accessories.
We are seeing our brand presence across the markets continue to improve by the season. Growth is coming from new doors and incremental square footage being dedicated to the brand. In the second quarter, comp store sales in Europe continued to post strong double-digit sales increases.
Our CK Asia businesses continues to perform with China outperforming the other markets. We are seeing strength across jeans, underwear, accessories and on newer CK performance business. As we look at the region, Hong Kong and Macau remains under pressure due to the lack of Mainland Chinese tourists. And Korea continues to be pressured by the macro environment and the department store sector. However, our Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia businesses are growing significantly. Second quarter comp sales in Asia have improved and are now running up about mid-single digits.
In North America, our revenues are up about 14% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth of over 20% in North America wholesale, due to the strong performance across all categories, particularly in men's underwear and the women's intimate businesses.
During the quarter, we saw continued strong momentum in our Underwear business. As our women's business continues to see tremendous growth, both in bras and panties, with our market share growing to the #5 position in bras and the #2 position in panties in the department store sector. In men's, we continue to hold the #1 market share position, and we saw our market share in the first quarter grow to over 30%, which is a record performance for the men's business.
Our jeans and men's sportswear business saw an improvement from the fall season with better AURs and strong sell-throughs, especially on the men's jeans side of the business. Women's continues to see outsized improvement through our specialty store accounts, like Urban Outfitters.
Moving to retail. The business in the U.S. remains challenging with international tourist traffic and spending under the same pressure as we are seeing in our Hilfiger U.S. business. Retail comp trends continued to decelerate into May, and we are not planning for this sales strength to improve for the balance of the year.
Let me take a moment and discuss some of the recent news around the Calvin Klein brand. In April, we announced a new global creative strategy for the company, which will unify all Calvin Klein brands under one creative vision across all categories of the business. As the company continues to build itself into a $10 billion global retail sales business, this undertaking will further solidify the brand's positioning worldwide and pave the way for future long-term global growth. We look forward to providing an update on this strategy over the next few months.
As it relates to the brand's relevancy and the power of the brand globally, we continue to see our awareness levels and willingness to purchase metrics continue to improve in all markets. Consumer engagement across the brand showed an over 35% increase in social media followers globally with a 60% increase in global engagements. We are connecting art with commerce through our partnerships with Zalando, Urban Outfitters and key social media platforms. And of course, the brand continues to drive controversy with tremendous industry buzz, be it sponsoring Justin Bieber's worldwide tour, our #MyCalvin's campaign or many of our digital partnerships.
Moving on to our Heritage businesses. The Heritage businesses revenues declined 12%, driven by the ongoing rationalization of the business, including the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishing business. Partially offsetting this decline was a 12% comp store sales increase in our venues and retail business.
Earnings were close to flat versus the prior year as the gross margin rate improvement offset the planned revenue declines in the quarter. Overall, we have seen the department store channel continue to be under pressure from a traffic perspective, but we believe that our Heritage Brands are, in most cases, outperforming their respective categories.
During the quarter, we continue to see positive response in sell-throughs from our venues and Flex Collar product, and we celebrated the launch of Speedo Fit. Speedo Fit is a platform designed to inspire and equip athletes at all levels to explore the power of training in the water. We held major [indiscernible] events, both in New York City and Los Angeles, with our Team Speedo athletes to launch the campaign. We are looking forward to the Olympics with Speedo and have some exciting events planned around the games and around our business.
Just to conclude my remarks. Overall, we were quite pleased with our performance in the first quarter and believe that our world-class brands, proven business model and best-in-class management teams are well positioned to navigate through this uncertain and volatile environment, while continuing to deliver strong financial results.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike Shaffer, our CFO, to quantify some of my comments."
296568,337162035,992785,"PVH Corp., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 26, 2016",2016-05-26,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release.

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. First quarter revenues were in line with guidance with the 3% constant currency increase over the prior year after excluding the negative impact of 1% from foreign exchange.
Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter and both exceeded our guidance. Calvin Klein revenues were up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth in Europe and North America wholesale, particularly our underwear business.
Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 4% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by strong performance in Europe as our Tommy Hilfiger International comp store sales were up 8%.
Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger U.S. retail businesses remain under pressure due to continued declines in our stores located in international tourist destinations.
Heritage revenues were down 12%, primarily due to the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business.
EPS for the quarter was better than the top end of our guidance by $0.05. The beat was driven by a strong Calvin Klein and Tommy performance for $0.03 as well as FX and the timing of taxes for another $0.02 combined.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2016, we are increasing our earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis for the year, while continuing to take a prudent approach to planning our business as foreign currency and global consumer spending remain unpredictable and volatile and the U.S. retail market is increasingly more promotional.
For the full year 2016, we are anticipating, based on current exchange rates, that we will be impacted negatively by about $1.55 of earnings per share for foreign exchange. The $1.55 impact was approximately 90% driven by transaction and 10% driven by translation.
For the full year 2016, we are projecting earnings per share of $6.45 to $6.55. If we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.55, we have earnings per share growth of 13% to 15% over the prior year. We have increased our guidance $0.15 from the bottom of our previous range and $0.05 on the top end of our previous range, which reflects a prudent view of our business for the second half of the year.
Included in our full year guidance is increased marketing spending versus the prior year, which is mostly second-half weighted. Overall, we are projecting revenue to grow approximately 2%, both on a constant currency and GAAP basis. This guidance reflects a revenue reduction of approximately $55 million in the second half of the year related to our proposed joint venture in Mexico, which is expected to close in the early third quarter and would primarily impact our Calvin Klein business.
Overall, we expect the Mexico transaction to be earnings neutral for 2016. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase approximately 75 basis points on a constant currency basis and expected to decrease approximately 100 basis points on a reported basis.
Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins to increase about 50 basis points, excluding the negative impact of 150 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned to increase about 50 basis points, excluding a negative impact with FX of 225 basis points.
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 8%, due mostly through the exiting of our IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 30 basis points. The impact of foreign currency in the Heritage business is relatively immaterial.
Interest expense for the year is planned to be between $117 million and $120 million compared to the prior year amount of $113 million and reflects a decrease from our previous guidance as a result of our recent amendment to our credit facilities. As a reminder, when compared to the prior year, interest rate swap converting variable to fixed interest began in February and is the reason for the increase.
Our tax rate for the year is planned to be about 20%, which is in line with previous guidance and the prior year. Second quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.25 to $1.30 and includes $0.45 of estimated negative impact for foreign exchange. Excluding this negative impact, we are expecting earnings per share to increase 24% to 28% for the second quarter.
Revenue in the second quarter is projected to increase 5% on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein revenues are planned at a 13% constant currency increase and Tommy Hilfiger is planned at a 7% constant currency increase. Heritage brand revenues are projected to decrease 12%. Interest expense is projected to be $26 million and $28 million for the second quarter. And taxes, 24% to 25%.
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

And then the second part of it is within the U.S., can you just talk a little bit about where you see current inventory levels and where the pressure is and how you feel positioned both in your retail business, but also at the wholesale level?"
296568,337162035,992785,"PVH Corp., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 26, 2016",2016-05-26,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","So again, Bob, when we look at sales trends, I guess, it's a couple of stories going on. You can't just generalize because we're seeing really substantial strength in our Calvin Klein brand, and I think that's really going counter trend to what's going on",656,"So again, Bob, when we look at sales trends, I guess, it's a couple of stories going on. You can't just generalize because we're seeing really substantial strength in our Calvin Klein brand, and I think that's really going counter trend to what's going on in the markets. So our wholesale, be it our underwear business, our sportswear businesses, the women's business, the G-III is operating despite the challenges that we've all read about over the last couple of weeks in the department store -- U.S. department store channel. That Calvin brand continues to grow across department stores and continues to grow in some of the key specialty store accounts as well as online. Our retail businesses -- the Tommy business, I'd also say, particularly on the men's side of the equation continues to perform very well, and we're planning the second quarter conservatively, but does continue to grow from a top line point of view from us. The challenge -- when you look at the department store environment, I think one thing you have to take into consideration is that the overall comp trends have been challenging. But I think if you look at the categories that have been stronger, men's clearly has been stronger than women's overall. Apparel has been under pressure. But really, where I think we're seeing a much more significant pressure on the business is center core. The accessory business is under major pressure. We play in that, but to a limited extent compared to the depth of our apparel business. So I think you got to factor that in when you think about our department store business. Of course, as I said, Calvin continued to grow 20% in the quarter at wholesale. So clearly, there's positive results going on there. Moving to our own retail business. Look, the biggest factor we are dealing with is a lack of traffic, particularly in the international tourist markets. We are continuing to see a downturn in international tourists coming out of South America as well as some -- the Chinese consumer really taking a step back in the first quarter. So I think that has to do with currencies, what's going on with travel into the U.S. And to be honest, I think it's some of the strength that we see both in our European business and in our Asia business as well with tourists staying home in market, meaning, European staying within Europe, the Asian consumer traveling either to Europe or into the Asia market as well. So that's how I'll characterize it. Inventories, I'm concerned. I think our inventories are really under good control. We've made a decision to invest in core inventory for the second quarter and beyond because we really see a sales opportunity, particularly in the underwear category, and we wanted to be in a position to fill those sales trends, both in men's and women's. And to remind you, last year, the sales trends were so positive, we were surprised by them. We were chasing inventory all year last year in that category. So we really have ourselves well positioned to really fulfill at the 100% rate given the current sales trends. So we're making that commitment on our inventories. But given the sales performance, inventories are building as we go into Father's Day, and it's going to be a promotional second quarter. We are hopeful that, that will -- that the pain has been factored in at retail. And we're hopeful that as we come out of second quarter, inventories going into fall will be well positioned. And I think most retailers are really planning for a turnaround in second half sales performance given the difficult environment that they had to deal with last second half -- last year second half. So long-winded answer, I really do believe inventories will be under pressure and promotions will be more significant in the second quarter in the U.S."

We're anticipating that the sales trends that we've seen in the first quarter are going to continue into May -- are going to continue for the balance of the year in Calvin Klein. We're not looking for a sequential improvement as we get to the second half of the year. I think most other apparel companies in this market and most of the retailers, based on what I've read, are looking for a sequential improvement as we start third and fourth quarter; we are not. But we are -- we positioned ourselves with core product to be able to capture that sales growth if it were to come. So I think we are sitting in a good position in that given the momentum in our international business as we've been able to plan our U.S. businesses conservatively, and I think that's partially what you're seeing as pulling down some of the sales growth that we see in the Calvin business. That coupled with the other 2 factors. I mean, we're coming off of double-digit growth in the third and fourth quarter of last year. We're growing on top of that, but we're not anticipating it's going to be double-digit growth going into the third and fourth quarter. You mentioned Mexico, which is worth over $50 million to us for the quarter. But from a profit point of view, it won't have any impact on us for the year. So I think there's opportunity -- let me just sum it up by saying I think there's opportunity to outperform those sales projections if the environment just improves slightly."

So I think there's a real opportunity to outperform what we're currently projecting, given the positive reaction to the collections, given G-III's expertise and given the enthusiasm, which retailers seem to be getting onboard with the product at Tommy. I also think that if you think about the women's opportunity for us, the opportunity is even bigger internationally. And I think the investments we are making, starting in the second half of this year from a marketing focus around the Tommy women's business, I think, really positions us to take advantage of some of that momentum we see in the business. So you would expect the women's to be bigger than men's. Obviously, for us, it's not. It's -- men's represents over 60% of the Tommy Hilfiger volume worldwide. So there's a real opportunity to continue to grow men's, but really outperform in women's, and that's not in any of our forward-looking projections."

If you think about the European business, this year it will probably approach around $600 million for us. The Tommy Hilfiger business is well over $1.7 billion, just to put that into perspective. We haven't even launched any kind of women's sportswear or related classification businesses with Calvin outside of North America. We've got a big jeans business, but very limited sportswear offerings on the women's side of the business. And on men's, sportswear businesses internationally are significantly underdeveloped as well as tailored clothing, which is big businesses here.

But we don't promote dramatically, we try to keep the site pure. Our average unit retail selling on that side is significantly higher than what you would see average unit retails in department stores in the United States. And we really are trying to do the business in North America through our wholesale partners and a number of the pure plays here in the United States, particularly Amazon, which is growing dramatically. When you move internationally, it's really a 2-tiered approach for us. We are focused on our own e-commerce sites. Tommy Hilfiger is very large in Europe. By itself, our site is over $100 million there and is nicely profitable as well. And we're also selling to our wholesale dot-com accounts as well as some -- a number of the pure plays, like Amazon and Zalando. In Asia, where, with the Warnaco acquisition, we probably started a little bit later. We're really seeing strong momentum in that business as we move forward. Our key sites that we operate ourselves are doing well. But even more dramatically, Alibaba through Tmall and our JV partnerships are really driving outsize growth for the business there. So it's a channel that we are really focused on, it's a channel that we're making significant investments in, and it's a channel that is our fastest growing channel distribution for both brands."

In men's, the opportunity here in North America continues to be the channel diversification that's somewhat going on. Calvin Klein is the department store brand from Nordstrom's to Macy's, those are our key large accounts, Bloomingdale's. As you think about it with the growth of pure plays, it's opening us up to a newer consumer, and we are capturing that market share, be it on Amazon or urbanoutfitters.com. So really, a channel play there in the United States is important for us as we move forward as well. Internationally, it's just all white space. We had huge opportunity in Europe to continue to grow that business as the brand continues to expand there, both in men's and women's. And in Asia, which is a direct retail play for us, we continue to see strong comp store sales performance there, and I think both men's and women's could continue to grow.

I think the second part of the question is easier to understand is we are agnostic about where the consumer buys products. By that, I mean is, we have a very profitable retail direct-to-consumer channel. Our wholesale business is highly profitable within 100 basis points of each other. And as e-commerce scales, both our own and the pure plays and our wholesale dot-com business, our profitability in that channel is similar to our profitability in the wholesale channel. So we are -- we believe we're -- from a profitability point of view, we're going to manage the distribution from a brand point of view, but it really doesn't truly dramatically impact our profitability at all. On the distribution channel, what we do find is the specialty store channel and the dot-com channel opens us up to a younger consumer, not only for underwear, but for all of our businesses, and that's exciting for us. And we're connecting with that consumer from a marketing perspective, marketing campaigns [indiscernible] to engage. Our digital spend in Calvin and Tommy today is -- over 65% of our marketing spend is really occurring on a digital basis. And we're really trying to move and connect with that consumer emotionally and they shop differently. At the same time, we're not looking to alienate our core department store customer in North America or around the world. And we're able to -- we believe we're able to balance that out through our channels of distribution. So we think we're in a strong position to manage the brick-and-mortar evolution that's going on, at the same time, the advantage of the growth that's occurring in the e-commerce channel."

I think from a -- if currencies just stayed where they are and more or less leveled here, I believe we can capture back half of that over the next 3 years. I think if currencies were to start to swing the other way marginally and start to improve, that's how you capture back the other half of it as we move forward. So it's something that we really need to watch. We've got very -- Dana and Mike have very sophisticated hedging strategies to really get us through the next 12 months from a transaction point of view. But as you go long-term and since inventory throughout the world in Europe, throughout Asia is more than U.S. dollars, you can hedge and you can go out probably 15 months. But once those hedges fall off, if currencies remain weak against the U.S. dollar, you're going to have to deal with that at that point in time. And that's what's happening to us in 2016. So hopefully, we're optimistic that we'll see some strengthening of some of the currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the euro, given the strengthening of that economy as we move forward.

I think you're going to -- you'll see it all over, and you'll see it in key retailers, and you'll also see it really advertised significantly globally, but I think it really provides a platform and a foundation to really move the Tommy women's business as we go forward."

I can assure you that systems are a big piece of that, platforms are a big piece. If we made a decision that the commerce business is growing so strongly that we need a separate warehouse for e-comm, that will be a major capital investment. But you could be sure that they would be a significant expense benefit associated with making that investment based on the efficiencies that would come out of a standalone warehouse facility here in North America or Europe or Asia. So I think we're very comfortable with the investments we have made, which we'll continue to make. And I think the business will continue to evolve, and our business and our investments will evolve along with where we see those growth initiatives.

I think one of the things -- we listen to our customers, and one of the things that we talked about 3, 4 years ago is they wanted us, from an e-commerce point of view, from a dot-com point of view, they wanted us to help drive traffic to their sites. So we made a decision in North America not to compete directly with them online. And by that, I mean is I think competitors, whoever they are, have much bigger direct e-commerce sites than we have. We have made a strategic decision to partner with the -- with our department store customers to really expand their e-commerce businesses, to make investments on their platforms that our brands are well positioned, not only in their brick-and-mortar stores, but also in their e-commerce sites. And obviously, we're seeing outsize growth with that channel of distribution, be it macy's.com or lordandtaylor.com. So really making the investments along with them to drive that business. So I don't feel a constant growing there. I think the Amazon situation, it's an opportunity. We try to have different merchandising strategies for both players, if not the same performance. Obviously, the fashion quotient at Macy's is much stronger, much deeper. Amazon really knows how to sell core products. They're trying to get into the fashion world, but they haven't proved that yet, and we'll see how that all plays out. But clearly, for us, comparative-wise, it hasn't been a major discussion point. Calvin and Tommy, depending on the retailer in North America, we are 2 of the top 4 brands in every major retailer in North America, where it's appropriate for us to sell our goods. So the relationships have really never been better. And the channel conflict that we manage everyday has been going on for the last 20 years, whether it was concerns about our own retail stores, whatever, and that's the global brand, that's what we do, that's what we get paid for. So I have not seen that intensify significantly.
Thank you so much, everyone. I wish everyone a happy, safe Memorial Day weekend to kick off the summer and hopefully, some better selling at retail here in the United States, and we look forward to speaking to you in August about the second quarter performance. Have a good day, everyone."

Good morning, and thank you for joining me on the call. With me this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; as well as Ken Duane, who runs our wholesale businesses throughout the United States.
We're very pleased with our first quarter results, which exceeded our expectations despite the challenging global environment and a difficult retail market in the U.S.
Overall, we had a terrific quarter with revenues increasing 3% on a constant currency basis, while earnings per share grew 33% on a constant currency basis. The momentum in the quarter was primarily led by the strength of our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger international businesses. Our European and China businesses continued to be our healthiest markets, while Hong Kong and Brazil are under pressure.
From a macro perspective, the U.S. market continues to be the most difficult and volatile market we operate in. Despite that, our U.S. wholesale businesses are running ahead of plan and the prior year actual results. However, our U.S. retail businesses are seeing weaker traffic and higher promotional trends. Overall, international tourist traffic and spending continues to weigh on our U.S. retail business, and we are experiencing a deceleration in sales trends in the U.S., especially after the early Easter.
Our digital commerce businesses saw revenue growth in excess of 20% for the quarter, and this channel continues to be our fastest-growing distribution channel.
Given our overall strong first quarter financial performance and the momentum we see in our international businesses, we are pleased that we're able to raise our full year earnings guidance and significantly increase the bottom end of our earnings forecast.
Let me move into our -- each of our individual brands. Moving to Tommy Hilfiger. Overall, revenue increased 4% on a constant currency basis, and EBIT was up 20% on a constant currency basis. Our revenues were driven by the outstanding performance of our Tommy International business, which was up 11%. We saw solid performance in all major European markets, demonstrated by our 8% increase in comp store sales for our retail business, with particular strength in the U.K., Germany and Central European markets. Comp trends in the second quarter have continued to be strong, running up high-single digits.
Moving to wholesale. The Hilfiger brand continues to resonate with the European consumer, and we are seeing growth in our fall 2016 order book, which is now up 6% versus our previous indication of plus 4%. Growth in the order book was generated across all product categories, and strong growth is coming out of markets like the U.K., Germany, Scandinavia, Spain and even Italy, which we have not seen in many seasons.
Our Tommy Hilfiger China acquisition, which closed in mid-April, had a minimum impact in the first quarter. This business continues to demonstrate strong results and is tracking to our plan, which will be slightly accretive to our earnings this year.
As we have said before, we will be deploying more marketing spend into this business, particularly in the second half of the year, which we believe will help set the foundation for sustainable growth in 2017 and beyond.
Moving to North America. Our U.S. retail business continues to be under pressure, driven by the weakness in traffic and consumer spending. Comp store sales declined 10% in the first quarter, and we have not seen any improvement in second quarter sales trends, and we are not forecasting for this trend to improve for the balance of the year.
Moving to wholesale. I'm pleased to say that our Tommy men's wholesale business has performed very well in the first quarter, highlighting the design improvements and product quality enhancements we have made to the men's line. We are posting positive retail sales results, strong sell-throughs and higher average unit retails. We are seeing this performance continue into the second quarter of the year for wholesale and are excited about the development there.
I want to comment also on some recent news around the Hilfiger brand. From a brand perspective, we continue to be focused on driving brand relevancy and consumer engagement. We are leveraging our Rafael Nadal relationship, which began with Rafa as our brand ambassador for Tommy underwear, and is now expanding to our tailored clothing business. In conjunction with the French Open, we just hosted a great event in Paris with Rafa for TH Flex suits, which are performing very well at retail.
In September, we launched our Gigi Hadid capsule collection with 2 wide-reaching e-commerce players, Amazon and Revolve. In addition, we will be offering the product in our Tommy Hilfiger stores and other key wholesale accounts around the world. This underscores the focus we are placing on our women's business for fall 2016 and beyond.
We believe that we have a significant future global growth opportunity in women's, and we are beginning to see positive momentum in this business. We will also introduce a Tommy Jeans capsule collection in the U.S., which will hit Urban Outfitters stores in August. This exciting partnership will allow us to further tap into a younger consumer base, which is critical for the brand. This jeans capsule collection has already been a huge success for us throughout Europe, and we look forward to leveraging this opportunity in the North America mall pocket.
Last week, we also announced that we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture in Mexico with Grupo Axo, a long-time licensee of the Tommy Hilfiger brand in Mexico. This is an important strategic development for the business as it allows us to maintain a direct ownership interest in our Calvin Klein and Heritage businesses in Mexico, while gaining control over our Tommy Hilfiger business in that region as well.
Grupo Axo's Hilfiger business is a larger business in terms of sales and profits than our Mexico business. However, given the strength of our brands position in the market, we were able to negotiate a favorable 50-50% ownership split. The closing of this transaction is expected to occur early in the third quarter of 2016.
As a reminder, we are still on track for the handover of our women's wholesale business to G-III for holiday 2016. Our key department store customers' initial reaction to the G-III collections have been very positive, and we continue to be very optimistic about the future prospects for this business.
Moving to Calvin Klein. The first quarter was another solid quarter for Calvin Klein as we generated top line growth of 13% on a constant currency basis. EBIT was up about 20% on a constant currency basis as well.
Let me start with the international businesses for Calvin, which is really driven by the significant momentum in our European business. Europe continued to experience double-digit retail comps and very healthy wholesale selling. Our fall 2016 order book has accelerated to high-teens growth versus our previous indication of mid-teens growth. The strength of the business is coming from all major markets and across all of our product categories beyond just jeans and underwear, including menswear and accessories.
We are seeing our brand presence across the markets continue to improve by the season. Growth is coming from new doors and incremental square footage being dedicated to the brand. In the second quarter, comp store sales in Europe continued to post strong double-digit sales increases.
Our CK Asia businesses continues to perform with China outperforming the other markets. We are seeing strength across jeans, underwear, accessories and on newer CK performance business. As we look at the region, Hong Kong and Macau remains under pressure due to the lack of Mainland Chinese tourists. And Korea continues to be pressured by the macro environment and the department store sector. However, our Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia businesses are growing significantly. Second quarter comp sales in Asia have improved and are now running up about mid-single digits.
In North America, our revenues are up about 14% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth of over 20% in North America wholesale, due to the strong performance across all categories, particularly in men's underwear and the women's intimate businesses.
During the quarter, we saw continued strong momentum in our Underwear business. As our women's business continues to see tremendous growth, both in bras and panties, with our market share growing to the #5 position in bras and the #2 position in panties in the department store sector. In men's, we continue to hold the #1 market share position, and we saw our market share in the first quarter grow to over 30%, which is a record performance for the men's business.
Our jeans and men's sportswear business saw an improvement from the fall season with better AURs and strong sell-throughs, especially on the men's jeans side of the business. Women's continues to see outsized improvement through our specialty store accounts, like Urban Outfitters.
Moving to retail. The business in the U.S. remains challenging with international tourist traffic and spending under the same pressure as we are seeing in our Hilfiger U.S. business. Retail comp trends continued to decelerate into May, and we are not planning for this sales strength to improve for the balance of the year.
Let me take a moment and discuss some of the recent news around the Calvin Klein brand. In April, we announced a new global creative strategy for the company, which will unify all Calvin Klein brands under one creative vision across all categories of the business. As the company continues to build itself into a $10 billion global retail sales business, this undertaking will further solidify the brand's positioning worldwide and pave the way for future long-term global growth. We look forward to providing an update on this strategy over the next few months.
As it relates to the brand's relevancy and the power of the brand globally, we continue to see our awareness levels and willingness to purchase metrics continue to improve in all markets. Consumer engagement across the brand showed an over 35% increase in social media followers globally with a 60% increase in global engagements. We are connecting art with commerce through our partnerships with Zalando, Urban Outfitters and key social media platforms. And of course, the brand continues to drive controversy with tremendous industry buzz, be it sponsoring Justin Bieber's worldwide tour, our #MyCalvin's campaign or many of our digital partnerships.
Moving on to our Heritage businesses. The Heritage businesses revenues declined 12%, driven by the ongoing rationalization of the business, including the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishing business. Partially offsetting this decline was a 12% comp store sales increase in our venues and retail business.
Earnings were close to flat versus the prior year as the gross margin rate improvement offset the planned revenue declines in the quarter. Overall, we have seen the department store channel continue to be under pressure from a traffic perspective, but we believe that our Heritage Brands are, in most cases, outperforming their respective categories.
During the quarter, we continue to see positive response in sell-throughs from our venues and Flex Collar product, and we celebrated the launch of Speedo Fit. Speedo Fit is a platform designed to inspire and equip athletes at all levels to explore the power of training in the water. We held major [indiscernible] events, both in New York City and Los Angeles, with our Team Speedo athletes to launch the campaign. We are looking forward to the Olympics with Speedo and have some exciting events planned around the games and around our business.
Just to conclude my remarks. Overall, we were quite pleased with our performance in the first quarter and believe that our world-class brands, proven business model and best-in-class management teams are well positioned to navigate through this uncertain and volatile environment, while continuing to deliver strong financial results.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike Shaffer, our CFO, to quantify some of my comments."
296568,337162035,993004,"PVH Corp., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 26, 2016",2016-05-26,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release.

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. First quarter revenues were in line with guidance with the 3% constant currency increase over the prior year after excluding the negative impact of 1% from foreign exchange.
Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter and both exceeded our guidance. Calvin Klein revenues were up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth in Europe and North America wholesale, particularly our underwear business.
Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 4% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by strong performance in Europe as our Tommy Hilfiger International comp store sales were up 8%.
Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger U.S. retail businesses remain under pressure due to continued declines in our stores located in international tourist destinations.
Heritage revenues were down 12%, primarily due to the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business.
EPS for the quarter was better than the top end of our guidance by $0.05. The beat was driven by a strong Calvin Klein and Tommy performance for $0.03 as well as FX and the timing of taxes for another $0.02 combined.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2016, we are increasing our earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis for the year, while continuing to take a prudent approach to planning our business as foreign currency and global consumer spending remain unpredictable and volatile and the U.S. retail market is increasingly more promotional.
For the full year 2016, we are anticipating, based on current exchange rates, that we will be impacted negatively by about $1.55 of earnings per share for foreign exchange. The $1.55 impact was approximately 90% driven by transaction and 10% driven by translation.
For the full year 2016, we are projecting earnings per share of $6.45 to $6.55. If we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.55, we have earnings per share growth of 13% to 15% over the prior year. We have increased our guidance $0.15 from the bottom of our previous range and $0.05 on the top end of our previous range, which reflects a prudent view of our business for the second half of the year.
Included in our full year guidance is increased marketing spending versus the prior year, which is mostly second-half weighted. Overall, we are projecting revenue to grow approximately 2%, both on a constant currency and GAAP basis. This guidance reflects a revenue reduction of approximately $55 million in the second half of the year related to our proposed joint venture in Mexico, which is expected to close in the early third quarter and would primarily impact our Calvin Klein business.
Overall, we expect the Mexico transaction to be earnings neutral for 2016. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase approximately 75 basis points on a constant currency basis and expected to decrease approximately 100 basis points on a reported basis.
Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins to increase about 50 basis points, excluding the negative impact of 150 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned to increase about 50 basis points, excluding a negative impact with FX of 225 basis points.
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 8%, due mostly through the exiting of our IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 30 basis points. The impact of foreign currency in the Heritage business is relatively immaterial.
Interest expense for the year is planned to be between $117 million and $120 million compared to the prior year amount of $113 million and reflects a decrease from our previous guidance as a result of our recent amendment to our credit facilities. As a reminder, when compared to the prior year, interest rate swap converting variable to fixed interest began in February and is the reason for the increase.
Our tax rate for the year is planned to be about 20%, which is in line with previous guidance and the prior year. Second quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.25 to $1.30 and includes $0.45 of estimated negative impact for foreign exchange. Excluding this negative impact, we are expecting earnings per share to increase 24% to 28% for the second quarter.
Revenue in the second quarter is projected to increase 5% on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein revenues are planned at a 13% constant currency increase and Tommy Hilfiger is planned at a 7% constant currency increase. Heritage brand revenues are projected to decrease 12%. Interest expense is projected to be $26 million and $28 million for the second quarter. And taxes, 24% to 25%.
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

And then the second part of it is within the U.S., can you just talk a little bit about where you see current inventory levels and where the pressure is and how you feel positioned both in your retail business, but also at the wholesale level?"
296568,337162035,993004,"PVH Corp., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 26, 2016",2016-05-26,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","So again, Bob, when we look at sales trends, I guess, it's a couple of stories going on. You can't just generalize because we're seeing really substantial strength in our Calvin Klein brand, and I think that's really going counter trend to what's going on",656,"So again, Bob, when we look at sales trends, I guess, it's a couple of stories going on. You can't just generalize because we're seeing really substantial strength in our Calvin Klein brand, and I think that's really going counter trend to what's going on in the markets. So our wholesale, be it our underwear business, our sportswear businesses, the women's business, the G-III is operating despite the challenges that we've all read about over the last couple of weeks in the department store -- U.S. department store channel. That Calvin brand continues to grow across department stores and continues to grow in some of the key specialty store accounts as well as online. Our retail businesses -- the Tommy business, I'd also say, particularly on the men's side of the equation continues to perform very well, and we're planning the second quarter conservatively, but does continue to grow from a top line point of view from us. The challenge -- when you look at the department store environment, I think one thing you have to take into consideration is that the overall comp trends have been challenging. But I think if you look at the categories that have been stronger, men's clearly has been stronger than women's overall. Apparel has been under pressure. But really, where I think we're seeing a much more significant pressure on the business is center core. The accessory business is under major pressure. We play in that, but to a limited extent compared to the depth of our apparel business. So I think you got to factor that in when you think about our department store business. Of course, as I said, Calvin continued to grow 20% in the quarter at wholesale. So clearly, there's positive results going on there. Moving to our own retail business. Look, the biggest factor we are dealing with is a lack of traffic, particularly in the international tourist markets. We are continuing to see a downturn in international tourists coming out of South America as well as some -- the Chinese consumer really taking a step back in the first quarter. So I think that has to do with currencies, what's going on with travel into the U.S. And to be honest, I think it's some of the strength that we see both in our European business and in our Asia business as well with tourists staying home in market, meaning, European staying within Europe, the Asian consumer traveling either to Europe or into the Asia market as well. So that's how I'll characterize it. Inventories, I'm concerned. I think our inventories are really under good control. We've made a decision to invest in core inventory for the second quarter and beyond because we really see a sales opportunity, particularly in the underwear category, and we wanted to be in a position to fill those sales trends, both in men's and women's. And to remind you, last year, the sales trends were so positive, we were surprised by them. We were chasing inventory all year last year in that category. So we really have ourselves well positioned to really fulfill at the 100% rate given the current sales trends. So we're making that commitment on our inventories. But given the sales performance, inventories are building as we go into Father's Day, and it's going to be a promotional second quarter. We are hopeful that, that will -- that the pain has been factored in at retail. And we're hopeful that as we come out of second quarter, inventories going into fall will be well positioned. And I think most retailers are really planning for a turnaround in second half sales performance given the difficult environment that they had to deal with last second half -- last year second half. So long-winded answer, I really do believe inventories will be under pressure and promotions will be more significant in the second quarter in the U.S."

We're anticipating that the sales trends that we've seen in the first quarter are going to continue into May -- are going to continue for the balance of the year in Calvin Klein. We're not looking for a sequential improvement as we get to the second half of the year. I think most other apparel companies in this market and most of the retailers, based on what I've read, are looking for a sequential improvement as we start third and fourth quarter; we are not. But we are -- we positioned ourselves with core product to be able to capture that sales growth if it were to come. So I think we are sitting in a good position in that given the momentum in our international business as we've been able to plan our U.S. businesses conservatively, and I think that's partially what you're seeing as pulling down some of the sales growth that we see in the Calvin business. That coupled with the other 2 factors. I mean, we're coming off of double-digit growth in the third and fourth quarter of last year. We're growing on top of that, but we're not anticipating it's going to be double-digit growth going into the third and fourth quarter. You mentioned Mexico, which is worth over $50 million to us for the quarter. But from a profit point of view, it won't have any impact on us for the year. So I think there's opportunity -- let me just sum it up by saying I think there's opportunity to outperform those sales projections if the environment just improves slightly."

So I think there's a real opportunity to outperform what we're currently projecting, given the positive reaction to the collections, given G-III's expertise and given the enthusiasm, which retailers seem to be getting onboard with the product at Tommy. I also think that if you think about the women's opportunity for us, the opportunity is even bigger internationally. And I think the investments we are making, starting in the second half of this year from a marketing focus around the Tommy women's business, I think, really positions us to take advantage of some of that momentum we see in the business. So you would expect the women's to be bigger than men's. Obviously, for us, it's not. It's -- men's represents over 60% of the Tommy Hilfiger volume worldwide. So there's a real opportunity to continue to grow men's, but really outperform in women's, and that's not in any of our forward-looking projections."

If you think about the European business, this year it will probably approach around $600 million for us. The Tommy Hilfiger business is well over $1.7 billion, just to put that into perspective. We haven't even launched any kind of women's sportswear or related classification businesses with Calvin outside of North America. We've got a big jeans business, but very limited sportswear offerings on the women's side of the business. And on men's, sportswear businesses internationally are significantly underdeveloped as well as tailored clothing, which is big businesses here.

But we don't promote dramatically, we try to keep the site pure. Our average unit retail selling on that side is significantly higher than what you would see average unit retails in department stores in the United States. And we really are trying to do the business in North America through our wholesale partners and a number of the pure plays here in the United States, particularly Amazon, which is growing dramatically. When you move internationally, it's really a 2-tiered approach for us. We are focused on our own e-commerce sites. Tommy Hilfiger is very large in Europe. By itself, our site is over $100 million there and is nicely profitable as well. And we're also selling to our wholesale dot-com accounts as well as some -- a number of the pure plays, like Amazon and Zalando. In Asia, where, with the Warnaco acquisition, we probably started a little bit later. We're really seeing strong momentum in that business as we move forward. Our key sites that we operate ourselves are doing well. But even more dramatically, Alibaba through Tmall and our JV partnerships are really driving outsize growth for the business there. So it's a channel that we are really focused on, it's a channel that we're making significant investments in, and it's a channel that is our fastest growing channel distribution for both brands."

In men's, the opportunity here in North America continues to be the channel diversification that's somewhat going on. Calvin Klein is the department store brand from Nordstrom's to Macy's, those are our key large accounts, Bloomingdale's. As you think about it with the growth of pure plays, it's opening us up to a newer consumer, and we are capturing that market share, be it on Amazon or urbanoutfitters.com. So really, a channel play there in the United States is important for us as we move forward as well. Internationally, it's just all white space. We had huge opportunity in Europe to continue to grow that business as the brand continues to expand there, both in men's and women's. And in Asia, which is a direct retail play for us, we continue to see strong comp store sales performance there, and I think both men's and women's could continue to grow.

I think the second part of the question is easier to understand is we are agnostic about where the consumer buys products. By that, I mean is, we have a very profitable retail direct-to-consumer channel. Our wholesale business is highly profitable within 100 basis points of each other. And as e-commerce scales, both our own and the pure plays and our wholesale dot-com business, our profitability in that channel is similar to our profitability in the wholesale channel. So we are -- we believe we're -- from a profitability point of view, we're going to manage the distribution from a brand point of view, but it really doesn't truly dramatically impact our profitability at all. On the distribution channel, what we do find is the specialty store channel and the dot-com channel opens us up to a younger consumer, not only for underwear, but for all of our businesses, and that's exciting for us. And we're connecting with that consumer from a marketing perspective, marketing campaigns [indiscernible] to engage. Our digital spend in Calvin and Tommy today is -- over 65% of our marketing spend is really occurring on a digital basis. And we're really trying to move and connect with that consumer emotionally and they shop differently. At the same time, we're not looking to alienate our core department store customer in North America or around the world. And we're able to -- we believe we're able to balance that out through our channels of distribution. So we think we're in a strong position to manage the brick-and-mortar evolution that's going on, at the same time, the advantage of the growth that's occurring in the e-commerce channel."

I think from a -- if currencies just stayed where they are and more or less leveled here, I believe we can capture back half of that over the next 3 years. I think if currencies were to start to swing the other way marginally and start to improve, that's how you capture back the other half of it as we move forward. So it's something that we really need to watch. We've got very -- Dana and Mike have very sophisticated hedging strategies to really get us through the next 12 months from a transaction point of view. But as you go long-term and since inventory throughout the world in Europe, throughout Asia is more than U.S. dollars, you can hedge and you can go out probably 15 months. But once those hedges fall off, if currencies remain weak against the U.S. dollar, you're going to have to deal with that at that point in time. And that's what's happening to us in 2016. So hopefully, we're optimistic that we'll see some strengthening of some of the currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the euro, given the strengthening of that economy as we move forward.

I think you're going to -- you'll see it all over, and you'll see it in key retailers, and you'll also see it really advertised significantly globally, but I think it really provides a platform and a foundation to really move the Tommy women's business as we go forward."

I can assure you that systems are a big piece of that, platforms are a big piece. If we made a decision that the commerce business is growing so strongly that we need a separate warehouse for e-comm, that will be a major capital investment. But you could be sure that they would be a significant expense benefit associated with making that investment based on the efficiencies that would come out of a standalone warehouse facility here in North America or Europe or Asia.

I think one of the things -- we listen to our customers, and one of the things that we talked about 3, 4 years ago is they wanted us, from an e-commerce point of view, from a dot-com point of view, they wanted us to help drive traffic to their sites. So we made a decision in North America not to compete directly with them online. And by that, I mean is I think competitors, whoever they are, have much bigger direct e-commerce sites than we have. We have made a strategic decision to partner with the -- with our department store customers to really expand their e-commerce businesses, to make investments on their platforms that our brands are well positioned, not only in their brick-and-mortar stores, but also in their e-commerce sites. And obviously, we're seeing outsize growth with that channel of distribution, be it macy's.com or lordandtaylor.com. So really making the investments along with them to drive that business. So I don't feel a constant growing there. I think the Amazon situation, it's an opportunity. We try to have different merchandising strategies for both players, if not the same performance. Obviously, the fashion quotient at Macy's is much stronger, much deeper. Amazon really knows how to sell core products. They're trying to get into the fashion world, but they haven't proved that yet, and we'll see how that all plays out. But clearly, for us, comparative-wise, it hasn't been a major discussion point. Calvin and Tommy, depending on the retailer in North America, we are 2 of the top 4 brands in every major retailer in North America, where it's appropriate for us to sell our goods. So the relationships have really never been better. And the channel conflict that we manage everyday has been going on for the last 20 years, whether it was concerns about our own retail stores, whatever, and that's the global brand, that's what we do, that's what we get paid for. So I have not seen that intensify significantly.

Joining me on this call will be Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relationships; as well as Ken Duane, who runs our Wholesale businesses here in the United States and North America. 
We're very pleased with our second quarter and first half results. Our strong performance year-to-date exceeded our expectations and demonstrates our ability to deliver against our 2016 plan despite a challenging macro environment. 
Overall, we had a terrific quarter with revenues increasing 5% on a constant currency basis while earnings per share grew approximately 40% on a constant currency basis. 
The momentum across our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger International businesses continue during the quarter. Our European and China businesses continued to be our healthiest markets. The strength is being seen across all channels of distribution, wholesale, retail and our digital channels. 
Speaking of digital, we continue to see outsized growth across all of our digital e-commerce businesses. For the second quarter, we continue to generate revenue growth in excess of 20%, and this channel continues to be our fastest-growing distribution channel. Key measures we are taking include enhancing the navigation on our own sites, elevating our own sites to focus less on promotions, investing in mobile capabilities and taking steps to ensure that we are in stock in high core demand items, which is the key to the profitability on digital commerce. In the second quarter, the U.S. market continued to be almost volatile market that we operate in.
Similar to the first quarter, our U.S. wholesale business continues to grow and show improvement. For the first half, we are running well ahead of our wholesale plans and our prior year actual results. However, our U.S. retail businesses have not seen much improvement in trend from the first quarter and continued to experience soft traffic and higher promotional trends. Specifically, our international tourist traffic and spending continues to weigh on our U.S. retail business. And as we began August, these sales trends have not improved.
Looking ahead to the balance of the year, given the strong momentum in our businesses, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the year while also further investing in our brands. We have also taken a prudent approach to planning our businesses in the second half of 2016, particularly our U.S. retail businesses, which we are now planning second half comps stores sales trends at the same levels that we experienced in the first half. Let me move on to a brand update to discuss each of our key brands.
Moving to Tommy Hilfiger. Let me start with an update on some of our brand marketing activities. A major focus of our fall campaign will be our women's businesses. As we are previously announced, Gigi Hadid, will be I will global ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger's Women's, representing apparel footwear, accessories and fragrance. This initiative reflects the brand's strategic commitment to expand its women's businesses globally. We believe that we have a significant global growth opportunity in women's, and we are beginning to see positive momentum in these businesses. As part of her exclusive ambassadorship, Gigi has partnered with Tommy Hilfiger to launch our first collaborative collection. The collection will launch globally at the New York Fashion Week with Tommy Hilfiger's first consumer fashion show, where all looks will be immediately available for purchase. The collection will be available in over 70 countries around the world, in over 200 Tommy Hilfiger stores and 150 wholesale partners stores, all with dedicated in-store marketing installations. The collection will also be available on our own e-commerce sites. 
Another important brand initiative for us has been Tommy jeans. Now in its second season, Tommy jeans celebrates the most iconic styles from the brand from the 1990s. We add nostalgic classics with a fresh, youthful energy. We first launched the jeans collection in April 2016 in 15 countries across Europe with strong sell-throughs on both e-commerce and at retail. The collection has allowed us to establish new wholesale partnerships that support our efforts to attract a new, younger consumer base. In the U.S. and the U.K, we have invested in the strategic partnership with Urban Outfitters. We have also established similar partnerships with specialty stores in France, Germany and Scandinavia.
The second delivery of the Tommy jeans capsule has hit stores in August, and the collection continues to perform very well and have excellent sell-throughs. Moving to the financial performance in the second quarter. 
Overall, revenues for Tommy increased 7% on a constant currency basis and EBIT was up over 20% on a constant currency basis. Our revenues were driven by the outstanding performance of our international business, which continued to generate 11% constant currency sales growth in the quarter.
Moving to our European business. We saw solid performance in all major European markets, demonstrated by an 8% comp store increase in Europe for our retail business, which strength across all major markets. I think it's important to comment that our U.K. business continues to show strong momentum despite a short-lived, slow down around the Brexit vote. We continue to be encouraged by healthy comp trends we have experienced so far in the third quarter, which continue to run up high single-digits throughout Europe.
Moving to wholesale. The Hilfiger brand continues to resonate with the U.S. with the European consumer and our fall sales are projected to be up 6%, while our spring 2017 order book is running up 7% over the prior year. Growth in the order book was generated across all product categories with acceleration across our denim and women's businesses. Strong growth is coming out of all markets, the U.K, Germany, Scandinavia, Spain and even Italy, which has not seen growth in many seasons. The only challenging market for the brand is Turkey, which is understandable, given the current geopolitical situation there.
Moving to Asia. As a reminder, we closed our acquisition in China in mid April for the Tommy Hilfiger business there. That business continues to demonstrate strong results and is tracking to our plan. This plant has added about 300 basis points to the top line during the second quarter and we exceed being slightly accretive to our full year earnings. We affirmed up our plant marketing spend in China that we spoke to you previously about, and we believe this will help further support the brand and our fall initiatives that are primarily focused on promoting women's, as well as the foundation for sustainable growth in 2017 and beyond.
Moving to North America. Starting with our wholesale business, I'm pleased to say that our Tommy's men's wholesale business continues to perform very well. And during the quarter and first half, we continue to see good sell-throughs and higher sales. During the quarter, we continue to see stronger sell-throughs and higher average unit retails. We believe this healthy performance from the first half of the year will continue into the second half, and we are excited about the developments in the men's business.
Lastly, we are working with G-III to handle the women's sportswear business in the fourth quarter, and that transition continues to run on plan, and we continue to see strong, positive reaction to the lines by our wholesale partners.
Turning to our U.S. retail business. Unfortunately, we have not seen a material improvement in this business year-to-date with comps running down year-to-date about 8%. The business continues to be under pressure, driven by weakness in traffic and consumer spending in the international tourist stores. As a reminder, we're taking a prudent approach and are not forecasting for the first half trends to improve for the balance of this year.
Moving to Calvin Klein. Let me take a moment and discuss some of the recent moves around the Calvin Klein brand. We announced a few weeks ago that Raf Simons has been appointed a Global Creative Officer to drive our new global creative strategy for the brand, which will unify all Calvin Klein brands under one creative vision across all other categories of the brand. We believe that this undertaking will further solidify the brand's positioning worldwide and pave the way for future growth. As Raf has only been in the building a few weeks, he is working with our teams as he builds out how the brand will continue to evolve from a creative direction point of view.
As it relates to the overall brands relevancy and the power of the brand globally, we continue to see our awareness levels and willingness to purchase metrics continue to improve in all markets. The fall 2016 global advertising campaign continues to roll out featuring a provocative blend of talent and deeper storytelling while continue to leverage #MyCalvin. The campaign is featured in 26 global markets with a diversified media mix comprised of digital, print and outdoor advertising. 
As a reminder, we're also the official partner partners of the European Justin Bieber's Purpose Tour, which kicks off in September. And we will have dedicated branded top-up shops at the tour's Berlin, London and Madrid stops, similar to what we did for Justin's U.S. tour. Specifically from a brand's perspective, I want to call out a few exciting launches for Fall 2016.
On the jeans front, we have a major global launch of our sculpted jean, which will hit stores at the end of this month. This launch will be supported by a global ad campaign with features Bella Hadid, Gigi's sister. This company will focus on all major markets with a diversified mix of media, both digital, print and outdoor. 
As a product category, we have seen significant growth in our Calvin Klein Underwear and intimates business. And this is far and away been our most successful growth category, posting exclusive growth and consistently growing its leading global market share position. We believe women's intimates will continue to be our most significant growth area, and we have a number of fall growth initiatives taking place. 
Our Modern Cotton logo business continues to gain momentum and has enabled us to capture the #1 market position in the bra led category. For Fall 2016, we are taking this logo application to tailored bras and are launching our seamless logo e bra. It marries bra technology with a great CK logo. This will allow us to continue to cater to a younger consumer and offer those that want more support the ability to purchase logo product as well. 
Additionally, on the bra side, we continue to expand our Black Label offer -- offering, particularly in Asia and Europe, and have launched 2 new product -- products for fall to address our broader talent bra segment. Offering seductive comfort with lace, adding new fashion details to our well-known, proven seductive comfort silhouette, and offering a 3-piece lace bra with a focus on our attempt to gain a larger portion the large size cup market, both in U.S. and in Europe markets.
Lastly, we launched the brand's latest women's fragrance. Deep Euphoria, earlier this month, which will help expand the Euphoria business. The print and video advertising campaign for the fragrance features Margo Robbie and will receive support through global campaign with print, broadcast and digital media. 
From a financial performance perspective in the second quarter, overall, the global momentum in Calvin Klein continues as we posted revenue growth of 15% on a constant currency basis and non-GAAP EBIT growth of close to 50% on a constant currency basis.
Let me start with the international businesses to Calvin. International revenues were up approximately 17% on a constant currency basis with comparable store sales growth increasing by 11% in the quarter. Europe continue to experience very healthy wholesale selling and comparable store sales increases across every major market. And our branded presence across the major markets continue to improve each season. The wholesale business continues its strong performance. Our Fall 2016 sales are projected to be up high-teens, and I'm pleased to provide you with an update on Spring 2017's order book, which is running up about 20%.
The strength of the business is coming from all major markets and across all product categories with an acceleration in both jeans and the underwear categories. And we have seen growth in some of our new -- newer categories, particularly accessories. 
Our European retail business continues to gain momentum with comps running up in the midteens in the second quarter. As we have moved into the third quarter, comp store sales in Europe continues to post strong double-digit sales increases.
Moving to Asia. Our businesses continue to perform very well with China outperforming our other markets. However, it is important to note that we did experience a nice improvement in our Korea business. The trends from our first quarter continues as we see strength across jeans, underwear, accessories and our newer performance at leisure business. 
We continue to see nice square footage growth across the region with us some key new store openings in Hong Kong and Mainland China this year. Additionally, by the end of the year, our Asia CK.com sites will be shipping to all major markets across Asia, including Australia and New Zealand. Second quarter comp sales in Asia saw a nice improvement, and we continue to see that trend into our third quarter running up about positive mid single-digits.
In North America, our revenues were up 15% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by the strong performance of our wholesale business across all categories. During the quarter, we saw continued momentum in our underwear business, as our women's business continues to see tremendous growth and market share gains in the department store sector.
We've seen market share growth in the bra Business to the #5 position overall in department stores and #1 position in the bralette category. We also have grow into the #2 position in panties with a strong momentum in the logo bottoms business. In men's, we continue told you the #1 market share position in bottoms and the #2 position in tops. 
Our newest launch in bottoms in the U.S. is the 3 pack micro, which is off to a strong start. Historically, we have not offered micro-product in multipacks, but only in singles, and the consumers reacted very positive to this. While the debarment stores continue to drive the lion share of our volume growth, penetration of our e-commerce and growth in these channels continues to outpace the brick-and-mortar trends.
Continuing on the solid momentum from this first quarter is our men's sportswear and jeans business, which continued to see improvement from the fall season with better AURs and strong sell-throughs. Women's jeans continues to see outsized improvement through our specialty store accounts, like Urban Outfitters, and we did see improvement trends across all of our department store businesses there as well.
Moving to our retail U.S. business. That remains challenging with our international tourist traffic and spending under the same pressure that we are seeing in our Hilfiger U.S. business. Retail comps continue to remain soft in the second quarter at mid single-digit negative and we are not planning for the sales trend to improve for the balance of the year.
Finally, in our Heritage businesses. The Heritage business revenues declined 14%, driven by the ongoing impact of our rationalization initiatives, including the exit the IZOD retail business and the discontinualization of several licensed product launch within dress furnishing. Additionally, our Heritage Brands business was impacted by a shift in timing of our wholesale shipment into the third quarter from the second quarter.
Our Heritage businesses continue to track positively against our full year 2016 financial plan. We are very well positioned in these businesses. Inventories are very clean and our sales orders at wholesale are very healthy. We believe we are poised to post a significant earnings turnaround in the second half of the year.
Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Speedo and its Olympic performance. I would like to congratulate Team Speedo on their performance during the Summer Olympics. The Speedo brand was dominant during the games and very prominent to our consumers, and we believe that this exposure will continue to have a positive impact on our business.
Finally, to conclude my remarks. Overall, we are quite pleased with our performance in the first half and believe that our world-class brands, proven business model and best-in-class management teams are well-positioned to navigate through the macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility that we've seen, while being positioned, hopefully, to outperform against our second half projections. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to quantify some of the financial results."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. 
Second quarter revenues were in line with guidance with the 5% constant currency increase over the prior year after excluding a negative impact of 1% from foreign exchange. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had the strong quarter. Calvin Klein revenues were up 15% on a constant currency basis, ahead of guidance and driven by all regions. Calvin Klein International comps with particularly strong comp store increase of 11%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 7% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by strong performance in Europe, as our Europe comp sales were up 8%, as well as the addition of our China business. 
Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger U.S. wholesale businesses performed well in the quarter and exceeded the plan. However, our U.S. retail businesses for these brands remain under pressure due to continued decline in our stores located international tourist locations
Heritage revenues were down 14%, primarily due to the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in dress furnishings business, as well as the timing of shipment. EPS for the quarter was better than the top end of our guidance by $0.17. The beat was driven by our strong Calvin and Tommy performance for $0.10, a favorable shift of marketing spend into the second half for the year of $0.05. Favorable timing on taxes of $0.03 and a partial offset from FX of $0.01.
Our inventories were very clean at the end the second quarter, relatively flat to the prior year despite acquiring inventories as part of the Tommy China acquisition.
Looking ahead the remainder of 2016, we're increasing our earnings guidance for the year while continuing to take a prudent approach to planning our business in the second half as a result of global consumer spending remaining volatile and the U.S. retail market continuing to be promotional. In particular, we are now planning second half comp store sales trends in our U.S. retail business not to improve. Specifically, we are projecting on second half comps be at the same level as our first half trends.
For the full year 2016, we are anticipating, based on our current exchange rates, that we'll be negatively impacted by about $1.60 earnings per share for foreign exchange, which is $0.05 worse than previous guidance and was primarily driven by the British pound. 
The $1.60 impact is approximately 85% transaction and 15% translation. For the full year 2016, we're projecting non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.55 to $6.65, if we exclude the negative impact of $1.60, earnings per share growth is 16% and 17% over the prior year. We've increased our earnings per share guidance to $0.10 despite the price of negative impact from FX. 
Our guidance continues to reflect a prudent view of our businesses for the second half of the year. In total, the second half of the year will include an increase of $40 million versus the prior year on brand marketing, as well as investments associated with the recent Calvin Klein creative leadership changes
Versus our previous guidance, our full year marketing spend has increased approximately $10 million. Overall, we are projecting full year revenues to grow approximately 3% on a constant currency basis. This guidance reflects a revenue reduction of approximately $40 million in the second half of the year related to our proposed joint venture in Mexico, which is expected to close late in the third quarter and would primarily impact our Calvin Klein business. Overall, we expect this transaction to be earnings neutral on a non-GAAP basis for 2016.
Overall, operating margins are expected to increase 75 basis points on a constant currency basis and decrease 90 basis points on a reported basis. Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 7% on a constant currency basis without bringing margins increase about 50 points excluding the negative impact of FX of 160 basis points. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned to increase about 75 basis points, excluding the negative impact of approximately 225 basis points of FX.
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 8%, mostly to the exiting of the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines from in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 30 basis points.
The impact of foreign currency in Heritage is relatively immaterial. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at $2.35 to $2.40 and includes $0.45 of estimated negative impact to foreign exchange. Excluding this negative impact, we're expecting earnings per share to increase 5% to 7% for the third quarter. Included in our third quarter guidance and increase marketing and investment spend of approximately $20 million versus the prior year.
Revenue in the third quarter is projected to increase 3% on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at a 6% constant currency increase while the Heritage business is planned to decrease 6%.
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

We start to -- we'll start to anniversary that right around Labor Day. I guess, from a guidance and projection point of view, it just seemed prudent to try whatever risk might be in the business. The idea was to try to derisk any of the guidance as we went forward. And given the momentum that we see in other parts of the business, we felt comparable taking that sales trend down. I think just to say it, if we were to see a somewhat of a leveling off in that environment, we're well-positioned with inventory there to take advantage with it, both from a top line point of view and even more importantly, I think from a margin point of view as we go forward. So opportunity exists if that channel were to bounce back somewhat in the third and fourth quarter. I think the real opportunity to be, to sum it up, is really the fourth quarter, given the weather issues that we faced last year and the pressure that was put on margins last year to liquidate goods."

And we're seeing very strong momentum in the business, both men's and women's. A lot of the fashion issues that you touched on and what's moving forward, be it skinny, flair, stretch, whatever case, we're really on all of those issues and really doing very well with it. I'd be remised if I didn't mention that the Tommy Hilfiger, our Hilfiger denim line continues to really post very strong results as well. That business internationally, well, in Europe, is larger than the Calvin Klein jeans business there, and we're really seeing real strong growth in that denim category with Tommy Hilfiger in that area. Moving to the United States. The men's business, as I've mentioned a couple of times, is ahead of the women's business, both from a fashion point of view and from a performance point of view at departments -- in our performance at department stores. I think from a fashion point of view, our fall line really moves us forward on the women's side of the equation and will be well-positioned for the back-to-school season and hopefully, to capture significant amount of growth in that area. Our retail partners really feel strongly about how the line is positioned, and we're starting to see in our order book as we look beyond 2016 and '17 where our retail partners are gaining more confidence in the line and placing stronger quarters as we go forward. So I feel positive about the moves that are being made on the Calvin Klein jeans side of the business. Men's, first and foremost, really performing very well in the U.S. And in women's, really seems to be coming on and we'll be able to report better to you as we get into third quarter."

I think it may put a little bit of pressure on top line, but from a profitability point of view, these obviously weren't Macy's most profitable stores and they weren't our most profitable margin stores. So I think the opportunity is to have a healthier presentation and healthier profitability in the brick-and-mortar side of the business. From a positioning point of view, the last 24 to 36 months, we've been really trying to drive our digital growth, both not only site, but also our partner sites, Macy's.com, our key players there, and also couple -- a number of the pure plays globally, be it Amazon, Zalando, Alibaba, Tmall. So those are clearly areas for us. And we have tried to segment our product, make sure that we're well positioned in those areas, significantly investing. I mentioned in my comments the investments we're making from a digital presentation point of view. Clearly, our marketing campaigns have shifted their spends to -- well, well over 50% of our marketing spend now is digital, both at Calvin and Tommy. So I think we're making all the right moves. And we need to be where the consumer is. They want our brands and we're positioned there. And over the next 12 months, we're trying to position ourselves that we're agnostic about where we make the sale, whether it's all in our own retail stores, departments stores, through their brick-and-mortar or their own e-commerce sites. So that's the way we're positioned. I think we are  well positioned as anyone. We got 2 key brands to take advantage of that."

I think it'll be a huge benefit for us as we go forward. As far as how that will impact our marketing campaigns and as we move forward, I think, look, that's a work in process. I think is -- I think what you will probably see is the last 2 years appropriately so, given the size the business, disproportionate amount of our marketing spend has gone to Calvin Klein jeans and underwear and I think as we're moving to '17 and beyond, you'll see more lifestyle marketing of the brand that will capture and take advantage of the -- other product category as where we think there is significant growth. So I view this as all very positive. From a licensing point of view, I don't think a changes any of our direction. I think we continue to look to take control of the more geographic components of our brand, where it makes sense, particularly where we have strong operating platforms like we did with the Tommy Hilfiger business in China. We could see that happening both with Tommy and Calvin going forward. And then there's always the opportunities as we move forward to potentially bring in some significant product categories in-house. Those opportunities exist.

I know they're optimistic and enthusiastic about how they see that business. I know the dresses hit the floor and the dresses are hitting the floor and women's suits are hitting the floor earlier. And they really feeling good about that portion of the business as we relate to Tommy Hilfiger. But I think the important another few days, I think let them lay it out for you. The transition really gone smoothly. The two companies have worked together very well to make sure from an inventor point of view, there's no carryover merchandise that's going to negatively impact the business. It really work well with Macy's, in particular in our other key department store measure, that transition is seamless. And I'm very confident that about the way that's moving. G-III, what we're hoping for is what they delivered in Calvin Klein over the last 5 to 7 years that they'll deliver for the Tommy Hilfiger and really take a business that a couple of hundred million dollars and turn it into a $500 million to $700 million business at much higher price points and at better margins.
As you mentioned China. Again, this year, with the transition and some of the amortization and some of the accounting stuff that we have to deal with, it's slightly -- it's going to be slightly accretive. I think that business will continue to grow. I think we are going -- I guess, we were projecting it to grow high single digits. There's an opportunity to do more than that. But it's a question of how fast and quickly how we want to move. Clearly, if you look at the size of the business, round numbers, $140 million to $150 million, compared to a Calvin Klein business that's at least twice as large. There's clearly a footprint opportunity for us to grow. And I guess, just having 2 brands under 1 roof, under 1 logistics platform, 1 operating platform, the synergies should start to come towards the second half of next year in a bigger way. So it'll be a much bigger contributor profitability next year as we move forward. And it will be a bit contributor to our top line growth as well. So I feel -- I really think that, that will be, without a doubt, it is -- it will be next year for sure our highest operating margin business in the company for the Tommy Hilfiger brand, very similar to how profitable our Calvin Klein China business is.

Obviously, the leverage ratio on the balance sheet continues to come down well north of $500 million in free cash flow this year, which is only going to grow over the next couple of years. So how do you think about the point in cash at this point between balancing acquisitions of licenses and maybe deleveraging the balance sheet?"

Clearly, Korea will be a big market for us. We believe Japan could be a market for us. And Central and Southeast Asia, which would include Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan. So some pretty substantial markets as we go forward, which should be nicely profitable as we go forward. The key in all of that is Tommy have license explorations, really working hand-in-hand with our strategic licensing partners who've really done a great job in building the brand throughout Asia. The other opportunity will be Brazil. Calvin Klein has a very profitable business there that despite the economic conditions in Brazil, it continues to be close to 20% operating margin business for us and is about 25% -- the Tommy Hilfiger business in Brazil is about 25% the size the Calvin Klein business in Brazil. So clear growth opportunity there that we're doing with the strategic partner, where we own a little bit over 40% of the joint venture and the ability there, over time, to bring that in-house will play itself out. So clear opportunities there. And that's really our focus area at this point, the focus areas at this point as far as license takebacks"

And then we are putting on comps on top of comps and we're comping on top of double-digit comps from last year in certain quarters. As we look at it, we continue to see opportunities. The big improvement in our retail stores has been very healthy on women's business. And I think that only continues. If you think about the brand in Europe, it is 65% to 70% men's versus women's. And we all know how much larger the women's market is than men's. So that opportunity keeps presenting itself. The productivity in our stores continues to improve, and a lot of it is being driven by the women's sales per square foot growing closer and closer to the men's productivity in those stores. So the opportunity is there to continue this momentum, and a big piece of it will be driven by the women's component getting better. And as our men's tailored business becomes a bigger piece of the pie and we continue to get strong success there throughout Europe at the wholesale level as we bring that product category into the stores, given the much higher price point, it really -- it does wonders for the sales productivity in the stores. The margins are comparable to our sportswear apparel margins and footwear margins. So clearly, the opportunity there is to grow men's tailored in our stores and to grow the women's businesses in our stores. And there's a lot of momentum behind in those businesses. So I don't think -- I think will continue to see positive comps. I can't talk about double-digit comp store increases, but I can continue to say we'll continue to see momentum. Europe sees much healthier as a market to us. I know all the headlines about Europe and what you see. But as far as the consumers being -- spending discretionary money, it's very healthy there. I think the fact that the dollar has strengthened has only made our -- the pressure that puts on our U.S. business I've talked about. The flip side is in that is it really significantly helps our international businesses as people travel or people stay closer to home in Europe, within Europe and buy while they're on vacation and holiday, that's really big-big win for us and so. So I think those trends will continue."

On the Calvin Klein side, look, it's more product categories. And I don't mean to sound cavalier about it when I say it, is the strength is across all countries, all major countries, all product categories, we were really seeing tremendous growth in jeans and underwear because those are the 2 largest categories. But our accessory business is also performing very strong there. We just only recently launched men's sportswear. And that, the percentage there are very, very high. But the dollars, they're a small as it starts to roll out. And we haven't done anything with women's sportswear and apparel outside of jeans and underwear at all. So that's really be a major opportunity for us as we move forward. We just thought we just match up from where we are position geographically in the United States and even in Asia, where Calvin women's presents about 40% of volume. There's a huge opportunity in Europe for that to continue. Just to remind everybody, the European strategy, first and foremost, was to take a broken Warnaco jeans and Underwear business that was in the wrong distribution at -- and still basically breaking even. And when you pull out the bad distributions that was losing money. Our European business today is healthy, growing. You see the international margins. You see the margins there. So our European business is really contributing significantly. If you use Tommy Hilfiger as a comparison, the Tommy Hilfiger business in Europe is 3x the size of the Calvin business. It's the only region in the world where Tommy's larger than Calvin. The profitability is 200 to 300 basis points higher and that actually do it scale. And I think those opportunities as the brand -- now the Calvin brand has solidified its position, has got a profitable foundation, the ability to take that forward and the enthusiasm that our wholesale partners have for the brand just gives us -- makes us just more optimistic about that this European trend to continue for the next 3 to 4 years."

And it's being impacted by international to raise them, but it is still one of the most largest, most profitable apartment source in the world. And not to put out those in the same categories with basis our own scare. But the stores are our largest, most profitable stores. And I think these tourism will balance out. I'm not going to sit here and say, it's coming back. But I do think, as we get to the third and fourth quarter of this year, it should level off and we will continue to add very profitable stores. If you look at our retail profitability, it's as strong as our wholesale profitably. And you see how profitable our Calvin and Tommy North America businesses are, double-digit operating margins, very profitable businesses. So this is just a shift in sales trends. And I think our European business is benefiting from that shift and our Asia business is to an extent and our Latin America businesses. But that U.S. retail business is just the component of our sales. We just feel it directly here."

And I mean, if you talk to most department stores, they'll tell you how healthy the Calvin Klein business is, how continue to fuel growth, be it on the women's side of the floor or men's side of the floor. So I think we do have, with the Calvin brand in particular, a lot of mentum behind the brand. We've been able to take advantage of some the weakness with some of our competitors to grow square footage and to gain market share in that channel. So I think we are outperforming. We positioned ourselves and we -- I don't believe we've over extended our brands in that channel of distribution where other players have talked about that they overexposed and over -- we've been continuing to grow, but I think we've been doing in a very healthy way. We -- we're in categories that department stores really are focused on growing women's and men's. And we've been a solution in both of those areas. With the Tommy brand, with Macy's, it continues to perform very well for us on the men's side of the floor. And now with the G-III initiative, Macy's has really gotten behind the brand and things that really can make up for some the market share losses that they've had with other brands. So I think we are -- I think we've been better positioned. We know where we play in the U.S. and understand that market positioning and has worked for us even in difficult times like last year's third and fourth quarter.

Joining me on this call will be Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relationships; as well as Ken Duane, who runs our Wholesale businesses here in the United States and North America. 
We're very pleased with our second quarter and first half results. Our strong performance year-to-date exceeded our expectations and demonstrates our ability to deliver against our 2016 plan despite a challenging macro environment. 
Overall, we had a terrific quarter with revenues increasing 5% on a constant currency basis while earnings per share grew approximately 40% on a constant currency basis. 
The momentum across our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger International businesses continued during the quarter. Our European and China businesses continued to be our healthiest markets. The strength is being seen across all channels of distribution, wholesale, retail and our digital channels. 
Speaking of digital, we continue to see outsized growth across all of our digital e-commerce businesses. For the second quarter, we continue to generate revenue growth in excess of 20%, and this channel continues to be our fastest-growing distribution channel. Key measures we are taking include enhancing the navigation on our own sites, elevating our own sites to focus less on promotions, investing in mobile capabilities and taking steps to ensure that we are in stock in high core demand items, which is the key to the profitability on digital commerce. In the second quarter, the U.S. market continued to be almost volatile market that we operate in.
Similar to the first quarter, our U.S. wholesale business continued to grow and show improvement. For the first half, we are running well ahead of our wholesale plans and our prior year actual results. However, our U.S. retail businesses have not seen much improvement in trend from the first quarter and continued to experience soft traffic and higher promotional trends. Specifically, our international tourist traffic and spending continues to weigh on our U.S. retail business. And as we began August, these sales trends have not improved.
Looking ahead to the balance of the year, given the strong momentum in our businesses, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the year while also further investing in our brands. We have also taken a prudent approach to planning our businesses in the second half of 2016, particularly our U.S. retail businesses, which we are now planning second half comps stores sales trends at the same levels that we experienced in the first half. Let me move on to a brand update to discuss each of our key brands.
Moving to Tommy Hilfiger. Let me start with an update on some of our brand marketing activities. A major focus of our fall campaign will be our women's businesses. As we have previously announced, Gigi Hadid, will be our global ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger's Women's, representing apparel footwear, accessories and fragrance. This initiative reflects the brand's strategic commitment to expand its women's businesses globally. We believe that we have a significant global growth opportunity in women's, and we are beginning to see positive momentum in these businesses. As part of her exclusive ambassadorship, Gigi has partnered with Tommy Hilfiger to launch her first collaborative collection. The collection will launch globally at the New York Fashion Week with Tommy Hilfiger's first consumer fashion show, where all looks will be immediately available for purchase. The collection will be available in over 70 countries around the world, in over 200 Tommy Hilfiger stores and 150 wholesale partner's stores, all with dedicated in-store marketing installations. The collection will also be available on our own e-commerce sites. 
Another important brand initiative for us has been Tommy Jeans. Now in its second season, Tommy Jeans celebrates the most iconic styles from the brand from the 1990s. We added nostalgic classics with a fresh, youthful energy. We first launched the jeans collection in April 2016 in 15 countries across Europe with strong sell-throughs on both e-commerce and at retail. The collection has allowed us to establish new wholesale partnerships that support our efforts to attract a new, younger consumer base. In the U.S. and the U.K, we have invested in a strategic partnership with Urban Outfitters. We have also established similar partnerships with specialty stores in France, Germany and Scandinavia.
The second delivery of the Tommy Jeans capsule has hit stores in August, and the collection continues to perform very well and has excellent sell-throughs. Moving to the financial performance in the second quarter. 
Overall, revenues for Tommy increased 7% on a constant currency basis and EBIT was up over 20% on a constant currency basis. Our revenues were driven by the outstanding performance of our international business, which continued to generate 11% constant currency sales growth in the quarter.
Moving to our European business. We saw solid performance in all major European markets, demonstrated by an 8% comp store increase in Europe for our retail business, with strength across all major markets. I think it's important to comment that our U.K. business continues to show strong momentum despite a short-lived, slow down around the Brexit vote. We continue to be encouraged by healthy comp trends we have experienced so far in the third quarter, which continue to run up high single digits throughout Europe.
Moving to wholesale. The Hilfiger brand continues to resonate with the U.S. -- with the European consumer and our fall sales are projected to be up 6%, while our spring 2017 order book is running up 7% over the prior year. Growth in the order book was generated across all product categories with acceleration across our denim and women's businesses. Strong growth is coming out of all markets, the U.K, Germany, Scandinavia, Spain and even Italy, which has not seen growth in many seasons. The only challenging market for the brand is Turkey, which is understandable, given the current geopolitical situation there.
Moving to Asia. As a reminder, we closed our acquisition in China in mid-April for the Tommy Hilfiger business there. That business continues to demonstrate strong results and is tracking to our plan. This plant has added about 300 basis points to the top line during the second quarter and we see it being slightly accretive to our full year earnings. We affirmed up our planned marketing spend in China that we spoke to you previously about, and we believe this will help further support the brand and our fall initiatives that are primarily focused on promoting women's as well as the foundation for sustainable growth in 2017 and beyond.
Moving to North America. Starting with our wholesale business, I'm pleased to say that our Tommy's men's wholesale business continues to perform very well. And during the quarter and first half, we continue to see good sell-throughs and higher sales. During the quarter, we continue to see stronger sell-throughs and higher average unit retails. We believe this healthy performance from the first half of the year will continue into the second half, and we are excited about the developments in the men's business.
Lastly, we are working with G-III to handle the women's sportswear business in the fourth quarter, and that transition continues to run on plan, and we continue to see strong, positive reaction to the lines by our wholesale partners.
Turning to our U.S. retail business. Unfortunately, we have not seen a material improvement in this business year-to-date with comps running down year-to-date about 8%. The business continues to be under pressure, driven by weakness in traffic and consumer spending in the international tourist stores. As a reminder, we're taking a prudent approach and are not forecasting for the first half trends to improve for the balance of this year.
Moving to Calvin Klein. Let me take a moment and discuss some of the recent moves around the Calvin Klein brand. We announced a few weeks ago that Raf Simons has been appointed as our Global Creative Officer to drive our new global creative strategy for the brand, which will unify all Calvin Klein brands under one creative vision across all other categories of the brand. We believe that this undertaking will further solidify the brand's positioning worldwide and pave the way for future growth. As Raf has only been in the building a few weeks, he is working with the teams as he builds out how the brand will continue to evolve from a creative direction point of view.
As it relates to the overall brands relevancy and the power of the brand globally, we continue to see our awareness levels and willingness to purchase metrics continues to improve in all markets. The fall 2016 global advertising campaign continues to roll out featuring a provocative blend of talent and deeper storytelling while continue to leverage #MyCalvin. The campaign is featured in 26 global markets with a diversified media mix comprised of digital, print and outdoor advertising. 
As a reminder, we're also the official apparel partners of the European Justin Bieber's Purpose Tour, which kicks off in September. And we will have dedicated branded top-up shops at the tour's Berlin, London and Madrid stops, similar to what we did for Justin's U.S. tour. Specifically from a brand's perspective, I want to call out a few exciting launches for Fall 2016.
On the jeans front, we have a major global launch of our sculpted jean, which will hit stores at the end of this month. This launch will be supported by a global ad campaign with that features Bella Hadid, Gigi's sister. This company will focus on all major markets with a diversified mix of media, both digital, print and outdoor. 
As a product category, we have seen significant growth in our Calvin Klein Underwear and intimates business. And this is far and away been our most successful growth category, posting exclusive growth and consistently growing its leading global market share position. We believe women's intimates will continue to be our most significant growth area, and we have a number of fall growth initiatives taking place. 
Our Modern Cotton logo business continues to gain momentum and has enabled us to capture the #1 market position in the bralette category. For Fall 2016, we are taking this logo application to tailored bras and are launching our Seamless Logo bra. It marries bra technology with a great CK logo. This will allow us to continue to cater to a younger consumer and offer those that want more support the ability to purchase logo product as well. 
Additionally, on the bra side, we continue to expand our Black Label offer -- offering, particularly in Asia and Europe, and have launched 2 new product -- products for fall to address our broader tailored bra segment. Offering seductive comfort with lace, adding new fashion details to our well-known, proven seductive comfort silhouette, and offering a 3-piece lace bra with a focus on our attempt to gain a larger portion of the large size cup market, both in U.S. and in Europe markets.
Lastly, we launched the brand's latest women's fragrance. Deep Euphoria, earlier this month, which will help expand the Euphoria business. The print and video advertising campaign for the fragrance features Margot Robbie, and will receive support through global campaign with print, broadcast and digital media. 
From a financial performance perspective in the second quarter, overall, the global momentum in Calvin Klein continues as we posted revenue growth of 15% on a constant currency basis and non-GAAP EBIT growth of close to 50% on a constant currency basis.
Let me start with the international businesses to Calvin. International revenues were up approximately 17% on a constant currency basis with comparable store sales growth increasing by 11% in the quarter. Europe continued to experience very healthy wholesale selling and comparable store sales increases across every major market. And our branded presence across the major markets continues to improve each season. The wholesale business continues its strong performance. Our Fall 2016 sales are projected to be up high-teens, and I'm pleased to provide you with an update on Spring 2017's order book, which is running up about 20%.
The strength of the business is coming from all major markets and across all product categories with an acceleration in both jeans and the underwear categories. And we have seen growth in some of our new -- newer categories, particularly accessories. 
Our European retail business continues to gain momentum with comps running up in the midteens in the second quarter. As we have moved into the third quarter, comp store sales in Europe continue to post strong double-digit sales increases.
Moving to Asia. Our businesses continue to perform very well with China outperforming our other markets. However, it is important to note that we did experience a nice improvement in our Korea business. The trends from our first quarter continue as we see strength across jeans, underwear, accessories and our newer performance at leisure business. 
We continue to see nice square footage growth across the region with some key new store openings in Hong Kong and Mainland China this year. Additionally, by the end of the year, our Asia CK.com sites will be shipping to all major markets across Asia, including Australia and New Zealand. Second quarter comp sales in Asia saw a nice improvement, and we continue to see that trend into our third quarter running up about positive mid-single digits.
In North America, our revenues were up 15% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by the strong performance of our wholesale business across all categories. During the quarter, we saw continued momentum in our underwear business, as our women's business continues to see tremendous growth and market share gains in the department store sector.
We've seen market share growth in the bra business to the #5 position overall in department stores and #1 position in the bralette category. We also have grown to the #2 position in panties with strong momentum in the logo bottoms business. In men's, we continue to hold the #1 market share position in bottoms and the #2 position in tops. 
Our newest launch in bottoms in the U.S. is the 3-pack micro, which is off to a strong start. Historically, we have not offered micro-product in multipacks, but only in singles, and the consumers reacted very positive to this. While the department stores continue to drive the lion share of our volume growth, penetration of our e-commerce and growth in these channels continues to outpace the brick-and-mortar trends.
Continuing on the solid momentum from this first quarter is our men's sportswear and jeans business, which continued to see improvement from the fall season with better AURs and strong sell-throughs. Women's jeans continues to see outsized improvement through our specialty store accounts, like Urban Outfitters, and we did see improvement trends across all of our department store businesses there as well.
Moving to our retail U.S. business. That remains challenging with our international tourist traffic and spending under the same pressure that we are seeing in our Hilfiger U.S. business. Retail comps continue to remain soft in the second quarter at mid-single-digit negative and we are not planning for the sales trend to improve for the balance of the year.
Finally, in our Heritage businesses. The Heritage business revenues declined 14%, driven by the ongoing impact of our rationalization initiatives, including the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product launch within dress furnishing. Additionally, our Heritage Brands business was impacted by a shift in timing of our wholesale shipments into the third quarter from the second quarter.
Our Heritage businesses continue to track positively against our full year 2016 financial plan. We are very well positioned in these businesses. Inventories are very clean and our sales orders at wholesale are very healthy. We believe we are poised to post a significant earnings turnaround in the second half of the year.
Finally, I'd be remissed if I didn't mention Speedo and its Olympic performance. I would like to congratulate Team Speedo on their performance during the Summer Olympics. The Speedo brand was dominant during the games and very prominent to our consumers, and we believe this exposure will continue to have a positive impact on our business.
Finally, to conclude my remarks. Overall, we are quite pleased with our performance in the first half and believe that our world-class brands, proven business model and best-in-class management teams are well-positioned to navigate through the macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility that we're seeing, while being positioned, hopefully, to outperform against our second half projections. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to quantify some of the financial results."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Second quarter revenues were in line with guidance with the 5% constant currency increase over the prior year after excluding a negative",878,"Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. 
Second quarter revenues were in line with guidance with the 5% constant currency increase over the prior year after excluding a negative impact of 1% from foreign exchange. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter. Calvin Klein revenues were up 15% on a constant currency basis, ahead of guidance and driven by all regions. Calvin Klein International comps were particularly strong with a comp store increase of 11%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 7% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by strong performance in Europe, as our Europe comp sales were up 8% as well as the addition of our China business. 
Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger U.S. wholesale businesses performed well in the quarter and exceeded the plan. However, our U.S. retail businesses for these brands remain under pressure due to continued decline in our stores located international tourist locations.
Heritage revenues were down 14%, primarily due to the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in dress furnishings business as well as the timing of shipment. EPS for the quarter was better than the top end of our guidance by $0.17. The beat was driven by our strong Calvin and Tommy performance for $0.10, a favorable shift of marketing spend into the second half of the year of $0.05. Favorable timing on taxes of $0.03 and a partial offset from FX of $0.01.
Our inventories were very clean at the end of the second quarter, relatively flat to the prior year despite acquiring inventories as part of the Tommy China acquisition.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2016, we're increasing our earnings guidance for the year while continuing to take a prudent approach to planning our business in the second half as a result of global consumer spending remaining volatile and the U.S. retail market continuing to be promotional. In particular, we are now planning second half comp store sales trends in our U.S. retail business not to improve. Specifically, we are projecting on second half comps to be at the same level as our first half trends.
For the full year 2016, we are anticipating, based on our current exchange rates, that we'll be negatively impacted by about $1.60 of earnings per share for foreign exchange, which is $0.05 worse than previous guidance and was primarily driven by the British pound. 
The $1.60 impact is approximately 85% transaction and 15% translation. For the full year 2016, we're projecting non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.55 to $6.65, if we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.60, earnings per share growth is 16% to 17% over the prior year. We've increased our earnings per share guidance to $0.10 despite the price of negative impact from FX. 
Our guidance continues to reflect a prudent view of our businesses for the second half of the year. In total, the second half of the year will include an increase of $40 million versus the prior year on brand marketing as well as investments associated with the recent Calvin Klein creative leadership changes.
Versus our previous guidance, our full year marketing spend has increased approximately $10 million. Overall, we are projecting full year revenues to grow approximately 3% on a constant currency basis. This guidance reflects a revenue reduction of approximately $40 million in the second half of the year related to our proposed joint venture in Mexico, which is expected to close late in the third quarter and would primarily impact our Calvin Klein business. Overall, we expect this transaction to be earnings neutral on a non-GAAP basis for 2016.
Overall, operating margins are expected to increase 75 basis points on a constant currency basis and decrease 90 basis points on a reported basis. Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 7% on a constant currency basis with operating margins to increase about 50 points excluding the negative impact of FX of 160 basis points. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned to increase about 75 basis points, excluding the negative impact of approximately 225 basis points of FX.
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 8%, mostly to the exiting of the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 30 basis points.
The impact of foreign currency in Heritage is relatively immaterial. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at $2.35 to $2.40 and includes $0.45 of estimated negative impact for foreign exchange. Excluding this negative impact, we're expecting earnings per share to increase 5% to 7% for the third quarter. Included in our third quarter guidance is an increase marketing and investment spend of approximately $20 million versus the prior year.
Revenue in the third quarter is projected to increase 3% on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at a 6% constant currency increase while the Heritage business is planned to decrease 6%.
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

We start to -- we'll start to anniversary that right around Labor Day. I guess, from a guidance and projection point of view, it just seemed prudent to try whatever risk might be in the business. The idea was to try to derisk any of the guidance as we went forward. And given the momentum that we're seeing in other parts of the business, we felt comfortable taking that sales trend down. I think just to say it, if we were to see somewhat of a leveling off in that environment, we're well-positioned with inventory there to take advantage with it, both from a top line point of view and even more importantly, I think from a margin point of view as we go forward. So opportunity exists if that channel were to bounce back somewhat in the third and fourth quarter. I think the real opportunity to be, to sum it up, is really the fourth quarter, given the weather issues that we faced last year and the pressure that was put on margins last year to liquidate goods."

I'd be remised if I didn't mention that the Tommy Hilfiger, our Hilfiger denim line continues to really post very strong results as well. That business internationally, well, in Europe, is larger than the Calvin Klein jeans business there, and we're seeing real strong growth in that denim category with Tommy Hilfiger in that area. Moving to the United States. The men's business, as I've mentioned a couple of times, is ahead of the women's business, both from a fashion point of view and from a performance point of view at departments -- in our performance at department stores. I think from a fashion point of view, our fall line really moves us forward on the women's side of the equation and will be well-positioned for the back-to-school season and hopefully, to capture significant amount of growth in that area. Our retail partners really feel strongly about how the line is positioned, and we're starting to see it in our order book as we look beyond 2016 and '17 where our retail partners are gaining more confidence in the line and placing stronger orders as we go forward. So I feel positive about the moves that are being made on the Calvin Klein jeans side of the business.

I think it may put a little bit of pressure on top line, but from a profitability point of view, these obviously weren't Macy's most profitable stores and they weren't our most profitable margin stores. So I think the opportunity is to have a healthier presentation at healthier profitability in the brick-and-mortar side of the business. From a positioning point of view, for the last 24 to 36 months, we've been really trying to drive our digital growth, both not only site, but also our partner sites, Macys.com, our key players there, and also couple -- a number of the pure plays globally, be it Amazon, Zalando, Alibaba, Tmall. So those are clearly areas for us. And we have tried to segment our product, make sure that we're well positioned in those areas, significantly investing. I mentioned in my comments the investments we're making from a digital presentation point of view. Clearly, our marketing campaigns have shifted their spends to -- we're well over 50% of our marketing spend now is digital, both for Calvin and Tommy. So I think we're making all the right moves. And we need to be where the consumer is. They want our brands and we're positioned there. And over the next 12 months, we're trying to position ourselves that we're agnostic about where we make the sale, whether it's in our own retail stores, department stores, through their brick-and-mortar or their own e-commerce sites. So that's the way we're positioned. I think we are as well positioned as anyone. We got 2 key brands to take advantage of that."

So I have a cohesive view of the brand and the product and being able to really take advantage of the collection business to diffuse it down to our white label and bridge lines I think will be a huge benefit for us as we go forward. As far as how that will impact our marketing campaigns and as we move forward, I think, look, that's a work in process. I think is -- I think what you will probably see is the last 2 years appropriately so, given the size of the business, disproportionate amount of our marketing spend has gone to Calvin Klein jeans and underwear, and I think as we move into '17 and beyond, you'll see more lifestyle marketing of the brand that will capture and take advantage of the -- other product category as -- where we think there is significant growth. So I view this as all very positive. From a licensing point of view, I don't think it changes any of our direction. I think we continue to look to take control of the more geographic components of our brand, where it makes sense, particularly where we have strong operating platforms like we did with the Tommy Hilfiger business in China. We could see that happening both with Tommy and Calvin going forward. And that there's always the opportunity as we move forward to potentially bring in some significant product categories in-house.

I would not lead anything into the fourth quarter sales trends that would any way indicate that either Tommy Hilfiger business or the Calvin Klein business are seeing any type of slowdown against what we're seeing going forward. So I just think it's a quarter. Maybe we're being a little bit conservative, but there's nothing -- there's no fundamental changes in the business, no fundamental changes in the sales trends that we see.

I know they're optimistic and enthusiastic about how they see that business. I know the dresses hit the floor -- the dresses are hitting the floor and women's suits are hitting the floor earlier. And they're really feeling good about that portion of the business as it relates to Tommy Hilfiger. But I think they're reporting in another few days, I think let them lay it out for you. The transition really going smoothly. The two companies have worked together very well to make sure from an inventory point of view, there's no carryover merchandise that's going to negatively impact the business. And it really worked well with Macy's, in particular, in our other key department store accounts to make sure that transition is seamless. And I'm very confident about the way that's moving. G-III, what we're hoping for is what they've delivered in Calvin Klein over the last 5 to 7 years that they'll deliver for Tommy Hilfiger and really take a business that's a couple of hundred million dollars and turn it into a $500 million to $700 million business at much higher price points and at better margins.
As you mentioned China. Again, this year, with the transition and some of the amortizations and some of the accounting stuff that we have to deal with, it's slightly -- it's going to be slightly accretive. I think that business will continue to grow. I think we are going -- I guess, we were projecting it to grow high single digits. There's an opportunity to do more than that. But it's a question of how fast and quickly we want to move. Clearly, if you look at the size of the business, round numbers, $140 million to $150 million, compared to a Calvin Klein business that's at least twice as large. There's clearly a footprint opportunity for us to grow. And I guess, just having the 2 brands under 1 roof, under 1 logistics platform, 1 operating platform, the synergies should start to come towards the second half of next year in a bigger way. So it'll be a much bigger contributor of profitability next year as we move forward. And it will be a big contributor to our top line growth as well. So I feel -- I really think that, that will be, probably without a doubt, it is -- it will be next year for sure our highest operating margin business in the company for the Tommy Hilfiger brand, very similar to how profitable our Calvin Klein China business is. So as we look forward, we're enthusiastic, and I think it'll be a contributor significantly to our top and bottom line."

The key in all of that is Tommy got license explorations, really working hand-in-hand with our strategic licensing partners who've really done a great job in building the brand throughout Asia. The other opportunity will be Brazil. Calvin Klein has a very profitable business there that despite the economic conditions in Brazil, it continues to be close to 20% operating margin business for us and is about 25% -- the Tommy Hilfiger business in Brazil is about 25% the size of the Calvin Klein business in Brazil. So clear growth opportunity there that we're doing with the strategic partner, where we own a little bit over 40% of the joint venture and the ability there, over time, to bring that in-house will play itself out.

And then we are putting on comps on top of comps and we're comping on top of double-digit comps from last year in certain quarters. As we look at it, we continue to see opportunities. The big improvement in our retail stores has been very healthy women's business. And I think that only continues. If you think about the brand in Europe, it is 65% to 70% men's versus women's. And we all know how much larger the women's market is than men's. So that opportunity keeps presenting itself. The productivity in our stores continues to improve, and a lot of it is being driven by the women's sales per square foot growing closer and closer to the men's productivity in those stores. So the opportunity is there to continue this momentum, and a big piece of it will be driven by the women's component getting better. And as our men's tailored business becomes a bigger piece of the pie and we continue to get strong success there throughout Europe at the wholesale level as we bring that product category into the stores, given the much higher price point, it really -- it does wonders for the sales productivity in the stores. The margins are comparable to our sportswear apparel margins and footwear margins. So clearly, the opportunity there is to grow men's tailored in our stores and to grow the women's businesses in our stores. And there's a lot of momentum behind those businesses. So I don't think -- I think we'll continue to see positive comps. I can't talk about double-digit comp store increases, but I can continue to say we'll continue to see momentum. Europe seems much healthier as a market to us. I know all the headlines about Europe and what you see. But as far as the consumers being -- spending discretionary money, it's very healthy there. I think the fact that the dollar has strengthened has only made our -- the pressure that puts on our U.S. business I've talked about, the flip side to that is it really significantly helps our international businesses as people travel or people stay closer to home in Europe, within Europe and buy when they're on vacation or on holiday that's really been a big win for us as well.

And I don't mean to sound cavalier about it when I say it, is the strength is across all countries, all major countries, all product categories, we're really seeing tremendous growth in jeans and underwear because they're the 2 largest categories. But our accessory business is also performing very strong there. We've just only recently launched men's sportswear. And that -- the percentage there are very, very high. But the dollars there are small as it starts to roll out. And we haven't done anything with women's sportswear and apparel outside of jeans and underwear at all. So that's really a major opportunity for us as we move forward. We if just start to just match up from where we are positioned geographically in the United States and or even in Asia, where Calvin women's represents about 40% of the volume there's a huge opportunity in Europe for that to continue. Just to remind everybody, the European strategy, first and foremost, was to take a broken Warnaco Jeans and Underwear business that was in the wrong distribution at -- and still basically breaking even. And when you pulled out the bad distribution it was losing money. Our European business today is healthy, growing. You see the international numbers. You see the margins there. So our European business is really contributing significantly. If you use Tommy Hilfiger as a comparison, the Tommy Hilfiger business in Europe is 3x the size of the Calvin business. It's the only region in the world where Tommy is larger than Calvin. The profitability is 200 to 300 basis points higher and that has to do  with scale. And I think those opportunities as the brand -- now that the Calvin brand has solidified its position, has got a profitable foundation, the ability to take that forward and the enthusiasm that our wholesale partners have for the brand just gives us -- makes us just more optimistic about that this European trend to continue for the next 3 to 4 years."

And it's being impacted by international tourism, but it is still one of the most largest, most profitable department stores in the world. And not to say -- not to put us in the same category as Macy's Herald Square but these stores are our largest, most profitable stores. And I think this tourism will balance out. I'm not going to sit here and say, it's coming back. But I do think, as we get through the third and fourth quarter of this year, it should level off, and we will continue to have very profitable stores. If you look at our retail profitability, it's as strong as our wholesale profitably. And you see how profitable our Calvin and Tommy North America businesses are, double-digit operating margins, very profitable businesses. So this is just a shift in sales trends. And I think our European business is benefiting from that shift and our Asia business is to an extent and our Latin America businesses.

We've been able to take advantage of some of the weakness with some of our competitors to grow square footage and to gain market share in that channel. So I think we are outperforming. We positioned ourselves and we -- I don't believe we've overextended our brands in that channel of distribution where other players have talked about that they overexposed and over -- we've been continuing to grow, but I think we've been doing in a very healthy way. We -- we're in categories that department stores really are focused on growing women's and men's. And we've been a solution in both of those areas. With the Tommy brand, with Macy's, it continues to perform very well for us on the men's side of the floor. And now with the G-III initiative, Macy's has really gotten behind the brand and the things that really can make up for some of the market share losses that they've had with other brands.

Joining me on this call will be Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relationships; as well as Ken Duane, who runs our Wholesale businesses here in the United States and North America. 
We're very pleased with our second quarter and first half results. Our strong performance year-to-date exceeded our expectations and demonstrates our ability to deliver against our 2016 plan despite a challenging macro environment. 
Overall, we had a terrific quarter with revenues increasing 5% on a constant currency basis while earnings per share grew approximately 40% on a constant currency basis. 
The momentum across our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger International businesses continued during the quarter. Our European and China businesses continued to be our healthiest markets. The strength is being seen across all channels of distribution, wholesale, retail and our digital channels. 
Speaking of digital, we continue to see outsized growth across all of our digital e-commerce businesses. For the second quarter, we continue to generate revenue growth in excess of 20%, and this channel continues to be our fastest-growing distribution channel. Key measures we are taking include enhancing the navigation on our own sites, elevating our own sites to focus less on promotions, investing in mobile capabilities and taking steps to ensure that we are in stock in high core demand items, which is the key to the profitability on digital commerce. In the second quarter, the U.S. market continued to be our most volatile market that we operate in.
Similar to the first quarter, our U.S. wholesale business continued to grow and show improvement. For the first half, we are running well ahead of our wholesale plans and our prior year actual results. However, our U.S. retail businesses have not seen much improvement in trend from the first quarter and continued to experience soft traffic and higher promotional trends. Specifically, our international tourist traffic and spending continues to weigh on our U.S. retail business. And as we began August, these sales trends have not improved.
Looking ahead to the balance of the year, given the strong momentum in our businesses, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the year while also further investing in our brands. We have also taken a prudent approach to planning our business in the second half of 2016, particularly our U.S. retail businesses, which we are now planning second half comps store sales trends at the same levels that we experienced in the first half. Let me move on to a brand update to discuss each of our key brands.
Moving to Tommy Hilfiger. Let me start with an update on some of our brand marketing activities. A major focus of our fall campaign will be our women's businesses. As we have previously announced, Gigi Hadid, will be our global ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger's Women's, representing apparel footwear, accessories and fragrance. This initiative reflects the brand's strategic commitment to expand its women's businesses globally. We believe that we have a significant global growth opportunity in women's, and we are beginning to see positive momentum in these businesses. As part of her exclusive ambassadorship, Gigi has partnered with Tommy Hilfiger to launch her first collaborative collection. The collection will launch globally at the New York Fashion Week with Tommy Hilfiger's first consumer fashion show, where all looks will be immediately available for purchase. The collection will be available in over 70 countries around the world, in over 200 Tommy Hilfiger stores and 150 wholesale partner's stores, all with dedicated in-store marketing installations. The collection will also be available on our own e-commerce sites. 
Another important brand initiative for us has been Tommy Jeans. Now in its second season, Tommy Jeans celebrates the most iconic styles from the brand from the 1990s. We've added nostalgic classics with a fresh, youthful energy. We first launched the jeans collection in April 2016 in 15 countries across Europe with strong sell-throughs on both e-commerce and at retail. The collection has allowed us to establish new wholesale partnerships that support our efforts to attract a new, younger consumer base. In the U.S. and the U.K., we have invested in a strategic partnership with Urban Outfitters. We have also established similar partnerships with specialty stores in France, Germany and Scandinavia.
The second delivery of the Tommy Jeans capsule has hit stores in August, and the collection continues to perform very well and has excellent sell-throughs. Moving to the financial performance in the second quarter. 
Overall, revenues for Tommy increased 7% on a constant currency basis and EBIT was up over 20% on a constant currency basis. Our revenues were driven by the outstanding performance of our international business, which continued to generate 11% constant currency sales growth in the quarter.
Moving to our European business. We saw solid performance in all major European markets, demonstrated by an 8% comp store increase in Europe for our retail business, with strength across all major markets. I think it's important to comment that our U.K. business continues to show strong momentum despite a short-lived slow-down around the Brexit vote. We continue to be encouraged by healthy comp trends we have experienced so far in the third quarter, which continue to run up high single digits throughout Europe.
Moving to wholesale. The Hilfiger brand continues to resonate with the U.S. -- with the European consumer and our fall sales are projected to be up 6%, while our spring 2017 order book is running up 7% over the prior year. Growth in the order book was generated across all product categories with acceleration across our denim and women's businesses. Strong growth is coming out of all markets, the U.K., Germany, Scandinavia, Spain and even Italy, which has not seen growth in many seasons. The only challenging market for the brand is Turkey, which is understandable, given the current geopolitical situation there.
Moving to Asia. As a reminder, we closed our acquisition in China in mid-April for the Tommy Hilfiger business there. That business continues to demonstrate strong results and is tracking to our plan. This plan has added about 300 basis points to the top line during the second quarter and we see it being slightly accretive to our full year earnings. We affirmed up our planned marketing spend in China that we spoke to you previously about, and we believe this will help further support the brand and our fall initiatives that are primarily focused on promoting women's as well as the foundation for sustainable growth in 2017 and beyond.
Moving to North America. Starting with our wholesale business, I'm pleased to say that our Tommy's men's wholesale business continues to perform very well. And during the quarter and first half, we continue to see good sell-throughs and higher sales. During the quarter, we continue to see stronger sell-throughs and higher average unit retails. We believe this healthy performance from the first half of the year will continue into the second half, and we are excited about the developments in the men's business.
Lastly, we are working with G-III to handle the women's sportswear business in the fourth quarter, and that transition continues to run on plan, and we continue to see strong, positive reaction to the lines by our wholesale partners.
Turning to our U.S. retail business. Unfortunately, we have not seen a material improvement in this business year-to-date with comps running down year-to-date about 8%. The business continues to be under pressure, driven by weakness in traffic and consumer spending in the international tourist stores. As a reminder, we're taking a prudent approach and are not forecasting for the first half trends to improve for the balance of this year.
Moving to Calvin Klein. Let me take a moment and discuss some of the recent moves around the Calvin Klein brand. We announced a few weeks ago that Raf Simons has been appointed our Global Creative Officer to drive our new global creative strategy for the brand, which will unify all Calvin Klein brands under one creative vision across all other categories of the brand. We believe that this undertaking will further solidify the brand's positioning worldwide and pave the way for future growth. As Raf has only been in the building a few weeks, he is working with the teams as he builds out how the brand will continue to evolve from a creative direction point of view.
As it relates to the overall brand's relevancy and the power of the brand globally, we continue to see our awareness levels and willingness to purchase metrics continue to improve in all markets. The fall 2016 global advertising campaign continues to roll out featuring a provocative blend of talent and deeper storytelling while continue to leverage #mycalvins. The campaign is featured in 26 global markets with a diversified media mix comprised of digital, print and outdoor advertising. 
As a reminder, we're also the official apparel partners of the European Justin Bieber's Purpose Tour, which kicks off in September. And we will have dedicated branded top-up shops at the tour's Berlin, London and Madrid stops, similar to what we did for Justin's U.S. tour. Specifically from a brand's perspective, I want to call out a few exciting launches for Fall 2016.
On the jeans front, we have a major global launch of our sculpted jean, which will hit stores at the end of this month. This launch will be supported by a global ad campaign with that features Bella Hadid, Gigi's sister. This company will focus on all major markets with a diversified mix of media, both digital, print and outdoor. 
As a product category, we have seen significant growth in our Calvin Klein Underwear and Intimates business. And this has far and away been our most successful growth category, posting exclusive growth and consistently growing its leading global market share position. We believe women's intimates will continue to be our most significant growth area, and we have a number of fall growth initiatives taking place. 
Our Modern Cotton logo business continues to gain momentum and has enabled us to capture the #1 market position in the bralette category. For Fall 2016, we are taking this logo application to tailored bras and are launching our Seamless Logo bra. It marries bra technology with a great CK logo. This will allow us to continue to cater to a younger consumer and offer those that want more support the ability to purchase logo product as well. 
Additionally, on the bra side, we continue to expand our Black Label offer -- offering, particularly in Asia and Europe, and have launched 2 new product -- products for fall to address our broader tailored bra segment. Offering seductive comfort with lace, adding new fashion details to our well-known, proven seductive comfort silhouette, and offering a 3-piece lace bra with a focus on our attempt to gain a larger portion of the large size cup market, both in U.S. and in Europe markets.
Lastly, we launched the brand's latest women's fragrance, Deep Euphoria, earlier this month, which will help expand the Euphoria business. The print and video advertising campaign for the fragrance features Margot Robbie, and will receive support through a global campaign with print, broadcast and digital media. 
From a financial performance perspective in the second quarter, overall, the global momentum in Calvin Klein continues as we posted revenue growth of 15% on a constant currency basis and non-GAAP EBIT growth of close to 50% on a constant currency basis.
Let me start with the international businesses to Calvin. International revenues were up approximately 17% on a constant currency basis with comparable store sales growth increasing by 11% in the quarter. Europe continued to experience very healthy wholesale selling and comparable store sales increases across every major market. And our branded presence across the major markets continues to improve each season. The wholesale business continues its strong performance. Our Fall 2016 sales are projected to be up high-teens, and I'm pleased to provide you with an update on Spring 2017's order book, which is running up about 20%.
The strength of the business is coming from all major markets and across all product categories with an acceleration in both jeans and the underwear categories. And we have seen growth in some of our new -- newer categories, particularly accessories. 
Our European retail business continues to gain momentum with comps running up in the midteens in the second quarter. As we have moved into the third quarter, comp store sales in Europe continues to post strong double-digit sales increases.
Moving to Asia. Our businesses continue to perform very well with China outperforming our other markets. However, it is important to note that we did experience a nice improvement in our Korea business. The trends from our first quarter continue as we see strength across jeans, underwear, accessories and our newer performance at leisure business. 
We continue to see nice square footage growth across the region with some key new store openings in Hong Kong and Mainland China this year. Additionally, by the end of the year, our Asia CK.com sites will be shipping to all major markets across Asia, including Australia and New Zealand. Second quarter comp sales in Asia saw a nice improvement, and we continue to see that trend into our third quarter running up about positive mid-single digits.
In North America, our revenues were up 15% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by the strong performance of our wholesale business across all categories. During the quarter, we saw continued momentum in our underwear business, as our women's business continues to see tremendous growth and market share gains in the department store sector.
We've seen market share growth in the bra business to the #5 position overall in department stores and #1 position in the bralette category. We also have grown to the #2 position in panties with strong momentum in the logo bottoms business. In men's, we continue to hold the #1 market share position in bottoms and the #2 position in tops. 
Our newest launch in bottoms in the U.S. is the 3-pack micro, which is off to a strong start. Historically, we have not offered micro-product in multipacks, but only in singles, and the consumers reacted very positive to this. While the department stores continue to drive the lion's share of our volume growth, penetration of our e-commerce and growth in these channels continues to outpace the brick-and-mortar trends.
Continuing on the solid momentum from this first quarter is our men's sportswear and jeans business, which continues to see improvement from the fall season with better AURs and strong sell-throughs. Women's jeans continues to see outsized improvement through our specialty store accounts, like Urban Outfitters, and we did see improvement trends across all of our department store businesses there as well.
Moving to our retail U.S. business. That remains challenging with our international tourist traffic and spending under the same pressure that we are seeing in our Hilfiger U.S. business. Retail comps continue to remain soft in the second quarter at mid-single-digit negative and we are not planning for this sales trend to improve for the balance of the year.
Finally, in our Heritage businesses. The Heritage business revenues declined 14%, driven by the ongoing impact of our rationalization initiatives, including the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines within dress furnishing. Additionally, our Heritage Brands business was impacted by a shift in timing of our wholesale shipments into the third quarter from the second quarter.
Our Heritage businesses continue to track positively against our full year 2016 financial plan. We are very well positioned in these businesses. Inventories are very clean and our sales orders at wholesale are very healthy. We believe we are poised to post a significant earnings turnaround in the second half of the year.
Finally, I'd be remissed if I didn't mention Speedo and its Olympic performance. I would like to congratulate Team Speedo on their performance during the Summer Olympics. The Speedo brand was dominant during the games and very prominent to our consumers, and we believe this exposure will continue to have a positive impact on our business.
Finally, to conclude my remarks. Overall, we are quite pleased with our performance in the first half and believe that our world-class brands, proven business model and best-in-class management teams are well-positioned to navigate through the macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility that we're seeing, while being positioned, hopefully, to outperform against our second half projections. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to quantify some of the financial results."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. 
Second quarter revenues were in line with guidance with the 5% constant currency increase over the prior year after excluding a negative impact of 1% from foreign exchange. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter. Calvin Klein revenues were up 15% on a constant currency basis, ahead of guidance and driven by all regions. Calvin Klein International comps were particularly strong with a comp store increase of 11%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 7% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by strong performance in Europe, as our Europe comp sales were up 8% as well as the addition of our China business. 
Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger U.S. wholesale businesses performed well in the quarter and exceeded plan. However, our U.S. retail businesses for these brands remain under pressure due to continued declines in our stores located in international tourist locations.
Heritage revenues were down 14%, primarily due to the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in dress furnishings business as well as the timing of shipment. EPS for the quarter was better than the top end of our guidance by $0.17. The beat was driven by our strong Calvin and Tommy performance for $0.10, a favorable shift of marketing spend into the second half of the year of $0.05. Favorable timing on taxes of $0.03 and a partial offset from FX of $0.01.
Our inventories were very clean at the end of the second quarter, relatively flat to the prior year despite acquiring inventories as part of the Tommy China acquisition.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2016, we're increasing our earnings guidance for the year while continuing to take a prudent approach to planning our business in the second half as a result of global consumer spending remaining volatile and the U.S. retail market continuing to be promotional. In particular, we are now planning second half comp store sales trends in our U.S. retail business not to improve. Specifically, we are projecting our second half comps to be at the same level as our first half trends.
For the full year 2016, we are anticipating, based on our current exchange rates, that we'll be negatively impacted by about $1.60 of earnings per share for foreign exchange, which is $0.05 worse than previous guidance and was primarily driven by the British pound. 
The $1.60 impact is approximately 85% transaction and 15% translation. For the full year 2016, we're projecting non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.55 to $6.65, if we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.60, earnings per share growth is 16% to 17% over the prior year. We've increased our earnings per share guidance to $0.10 despite the $0.05 negative impact from FX. 
Our guidance continues to reflect a prudent view of our businesses for the second half of the year. In total, the second half of the year will include an increase of $40 million versus the prior year on brand marketing as well as investments associated with the recent Calvin Klein creative leadership changes.
Versus our previous guidance, our full year marketing spend has increased approximately $10 million. Overall, we are projecting full year revenues to grow approximately 3% on a constant currency basis. This guidance reflects a revenue reduction of approximately $40 million in the second half of the year related to our proposed joint venture in Mexico, which is expected to close late in the third quarter and would primarily impact our Calvin Klein business. Overall, we expect this transaction to be earnings neutral on a non-GAAP basis for 2016.
Overall, operating margins are expected to increase 75 basis points on a constant currency basis and decrease 90 basis points on a reported basis. Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 7% on a constant currency basis with operating margins to increase about 50 points excluding the negative impact of FX of 160 basis points. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned to increase about 75 basis points, excluding the negative impact of approximately 225 basis points of FX.
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 8%, mostly to the exiting of the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 30 basis points.
The impact of foreign currency in Heritage is relatively immaterial. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at $2.35 to $2.40 and includes $0.45 of estimated negative impact for foreign exchange. Excluding this negative impact, we're expecting earnings per share to increase 5% to 7% for the third quarter. Included in our third quarter guidance is increased marketing and investment spend of approximately $20 million versus the prior year.
Revenue in the third quarter is projected to increase 3% on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at a 6% constant currency increase while the Heritage business is planned to decrease 6%.
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

I guess from a guidance and projection point of view, it just seemed prudent to try -- whatever risk might be in the business, the idea was to try to derisk any of the guidance as we went forward. And given the momentum that we're seeing in other parts of the business, we felt comfortable taking that sales trend down. I think just to say it, if we were to see somewhat of a leveling off in that environment, we're well-positioned with inventory there to take advantage of it, both from a top line point of view and even more importantly, I think from a margin point of view as we go forward. So opportunity exists if that channel were to bounce back somewhat in the third and fourth quarter. I think the real opportunity ought to be, to sum it up, is really the fourth quarter, given the weather issues that we faced last year and the pressure that was put on margins last year to liquidate goods."

Moving to the United States. The men's business, as I've mentioned a couple of times, is ahead of the women's business, both from a fashion point of view and from a performance point of view at departments -- in our performance at department stores. I think from a fashion point of view, our fall line really moves us forward on the women's side of the equation and will be well-positioned for the back-to-school season and hopefully, to capture significant amount of growth in that area. Our retail partners really feel strongly about how the line is positioned, and we're starting to see it in our order book as we look beyond 2016 and '17 where our retail partners are gaining more confidence in the line and placing stronger orders as we go forward. So I feel positive about the moves that are being made on the Calvin Klein jeans side of the business.

I think it may put a little bit of pressure on top line, but from a profitability point of view, these obviously weren't Macy's most profitable stores and they weren't our most profitable margin stores. So I think the opportunity is to have a healthier presentation at healthier profitability in the brick-and-mortar side of the business. From a positioning point of view, for the last 24 to 36 months, we've been really trying to drive our digital growth, both our only site, but also our partner sites, macys.com, our key players there, and also a couple -- a number of the pure plays globally, be it Amazon, Zalando, Alibaba, Tmall. So those are clearly areas for us. And we've tried to segment our product, make sure that we're well positioned in those areas, significantly investing. I mentioned in my comments the investments we're making from a digital presentation point of view. Clearly, our marketing campaigns have shifted their spends to -- we're well over 50% of our marketing spend now is digital, both for Calvin and Tommy. So I think we're making all the right moves. And we need to be where the consumer is. They want our brands and we're positioned there. And over the next 12 months, we're trying to position ourselves that we're agnostic about where we make the sale, whether it's in our own retail stores, department stores, through their brick-and-mortar or their own e-commerce sites. So that's the way we're positioned. I think we are as well positioned as anyone. We got 2 key brands to take advantage of that."

I think is -- I think what you will probably see is the last 2 years appropriately so, given the size of the business, disproportionate amount of our marketing spend has gone to Calvin Klein jeans and underwear, and I think as we move into '17 and beyond, you'll see more lifestyle marketing of the brand that will capture and take advantage of the -- other product category as -- where we think there's significant growth. So I view this as all very positive. From a licensing point of view, I don't think it changes any of our direction. I think we continue to look to take control of the more geographic components of our brand, where it makes sense, particularly where we have strong operating platforms like we did with the Tommy Hilfiger business in China. We could see that happening both with Tommy and Calvin going forward. And that there's always the opportunity as we move forward to potentially bring in some significant product categories in-house. Those opportunities exist. If anything, I think Raf's presence only gives us more confidence to take it on as we move forward."

But I will just say that our e-commerce wholesale business, where we are selling to our pure plays and all -- where we are selling to our pure plays and to our department store partners is a very profitable business, consistent with all of our other businesses. The only business that is a challenge for us from a profitability point of view is our own e-commerce businesses, which we're truly running as flagship sites. We don't over promote on those sites. It's very event driven. We don't do flash sites and flash selling on our own sites. We don't drive excess product to our sites. We really view that as flagship sites where the consumer comes to our sites, be it Tommy or Calvin. They investigate the brand, better understand the brand. They can buy on our sites or we will drive them to our retail partner's sites, or they'll use that investigation to shop in department stores as we move forward. So we feel -- we see it as a very cohesive strategy that works together. And I think from a pure profitability point of view, the only issue we're dealing with on our own e-commerce sites is scale. As that business continues to grow, we've talked about the kind of growth rates we're seeing, we're 12 months away from going from a loss position on those businesses to a profit position on those businesses. And each incremental sale that we make online is as profitable as an incremental sale on -- in wholesale on our own retail stores. So from that perspective, we truly are becoming agnostic about where the customer shops."

So I think some years are top line growth years or some seasons, and some seasons are margin seasons. I think this is really a margin season where the opportunity really exists to show dramatic improvement over last year's fourth quarter on the margin line, if we can continue to keep the channel clean from an inventory point of view and if we just get some reasonable weather.

I know they're optimistic and enthusiastic about how they see that business. I know the dresses hit the floor -- the dresses are hitting the floor and women's suits are hitting the floor earlier. And they're really feeling good about that portion of the business as it relates to Tommy Hilfiger. But I think they're reporting in another few days, I think let them lay it out for you. The transition really going smoothly. The two companies have worked together very well to make sure from an inventory point of view, there's no carryover merchandise that's going to negatively impact the business. And it really worked well with Macy's, in particular, in our other key department store accounts to make sure that transition is seamless. And I'm very confident about the way that's moving. G-III, what we're hoping for is what they've delivered in Calvin Klein over the last 5 to 7 years that they'll deliver for Tommy Hilfiger and really take a business that's a couple of hundred million dollars and turn it into a $500 million to $700 million business at much higher price points and at better margins.
As you mentioned China. Again, this year, with the transition and some of the amortizations and some of the accounting stuff that we have to deal with, it's slightly -- it's going to be slightly accretive. I think that business will continue to grow. I think we are going -- I guess, we're projecting it to grow high single digits. There's an opportunity to do more than that. But it's a question of how fast and quickly we want to move. Clearly, if you look at the size of the business, round numbers, $140 million to $150 million business, compared to a Calvin Klein business that's at least twice as large. There's clearly a footprint opportunity for us to grow. And I guess, just having the 2 brands under 1 roof, under 1 logistics platform, 1 operating platform, the synergies should start to come towards the second half of next year in a bigger way. So it'll be a much bigger contributor of profitability next year as we move forward. And it will be a big contributor to our top line growth as well. So I feel -- I really think that, that will be, probably without a doubt, it is -- it will be next year for sure our highest operating margin business in the company for the Tommy Hilfiger brand, very similar to how profitable our Calvin Klein China business is. So as we look forward, we're enthusiastic, and I think it'll be a contributor significantly to our top and bottom line."

And then we are putting on comps on top of comps and we're comping on top of double-digit comps from last year in certain quarters. As we look at it, we continue to see opportunities. The big improvement in our retail stores has been very healthy women's business. And I think that only continues. If you think about the brand in Europe, it is 65% to 70% men's versus women's. And we all know how much larger the women's market is than men's. So that opportunity keeps presenting itself. The productivity in our stores continues to improve, and a lot of it is being driven by the women's sales per square foot growing closer and closer to the men's productivity in those stores. So the opportunity is there to continue this momentum, and a big piece of it will be driven by the women's component getting better. And as our men's tailored business becomes a bigger piece of the pie and we continue to get strong success there throughout Europe at the wholesale level as we bring that product category into the stores, given the much higher price point, it really -- it does wonders for the sales productivity in the stores. The margins are comparable to our sportswear apparel margins and footwear margins. So clearly, the opportunity there is to grow men's tailored in our stores and to grow the women's businesses in our stores. And there's a lot of momentum behind those businesses. So I don't think -- I think we'll continue to see positive comps. I can't talk about double-digit comp store increases, but I can continue to say we'll continue to see momentum. Europe seems much healthier as a market to us. I know all the headlines about Europe and what you see. But as far as the consumers being -- spending discretionary money, it's very healthy there. I think the fact that the dollar has strengthened has only made our -- the pressure that puts on our U.S. business I've talked about, the flip side to that is it really significantly helps our international businesses as people travel or people stay closer to home in Europe, within Europe and buy when they're on vacation or on holiday, that's really been a big win for us as well.

On the Calvin Klein side, look, it's more product categories. And I don't mean to sound cavalier about it when I say it, is the strength is across all countries, all major countries, all product categories, where we're really seeing tremendous growth in jeans and underwear because they're the 2 largest categories. But our accessory business is also performing very strong there. We've just only recently launched men's sportswear. And that -- the percentage there are very, very high. But the dollars there are small as it starts to roll out. And we haven't done anything with women's sportswear and apparel outside of jeans and underwear at all. So that's really a major opportunity for us as we move forward. If we start to just match up from where we are positioned geographically in the United States or even in Asia, where Calvin women's represents about 40% of the volume, there's a huge opportunity in Europe for that to continue. Just to remind everybody, the European strategy, first and foremost, was to take a broken Warnaco Jeans and Underwear business that was in the wrong distribution at -- and still basically breaking even. And when you pulled out the bad distribution, it was losing money, our European business today is healthy, growing. You see the international numbers. You see the margins there. So our European business is really contributing significantly. If you use Tommy Hilfiger as a comparison, the Tommy Hilfiger business in Europe is 3x the size of the Calvin business. It's the only region in the world where Tommy is larger than Calvin. The profitability is 200 to 300 basis points higher and that has to do with scale. And I think those opportunities as the brand -- now that the Calvin brand has solidified its position, has got a profitable foundation, the ability to take that forward and the enthusiasm that our wholesale partners have for the brand, just gives us -- makes us just more optimistic about that this European trend could continue for the next 3 to 4 years."

So I used as a comparison is -- the Herald -- Macy's Herald Square is the most profitable department store in the world, I believe. And it's being impacted by international tourism, but it is still one of the most largest, most profitable department stores in the world. And not to say -- not to put us in the same category as Macy's Herald Square but these stores are our largest, most profitable stores. And I think this tourism will balance out. I'm not going to sit here and say it's coming back. But I do think as we get through the third and fourth quarter of this year, it should level off, and we will continue to have very profitable stores. If you look at our retail profitability, it's as strong as our wholesale profitability. And you see how profitable our Calvin and Tommy North America businesses are, double-digit operating margins, very profitable businesses. So this is just a shift in sales trends. And I think our European business is benefiting from that shift and our Asia business is to an extent and our Latin America businesses. But the U.S. retail business is just such a big component of our sales. We just feel it directly here."

And I mean, if you talk to most department stores, they'll tell you how healthy the Calvin Klein business is, how -- continue to fuel growth, be it on the women's side of the floor or men's side of the floor. So I think we do have, with the Calvin brand in particular, a lot of momentum behind the brand. We've been able to take advantage of some of the weakness with some of our competitors to grow square footage and to gain market share in that channel. So I think we are outperforming. We positioned ourselves and we -- I don't believe we've overextended our brands in that channel of distribution where other players have talked about that they overexposed and over -- we've been continuing to grow, but I think we've been doing in a very healthy way. We -- we're in categories that department stores really are focused on growing women's and men's. And we've been a solution in both of those areas. With the Tommy brand, with Macy's, it continues to perform very well for us on the men's side of the floor. And now with the G-III initiative, Macy's has really gotten behind the brand and the things that really can make up for some of the market share losses that they've had with other brands. So I think we are -- I think we've been better positioned. We know where we play in the U.S. and understand that market positioning and it's worked for us even in difficult times like last year's third and fourth quarter.

Joining me on this call will be Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relationships; as well as Ken Duane, who runs our Wholesale businesses here in the United States and North America. 
We're very pleased with our second quarter and first half results. Our strong performance year-to-date exceeded our expectations and demonstrates our ability to deliver against our 2016 plan despite a challenging macro environment. 
Overall, we had a terrific quarter with revenues increasing 5% on a constant currency basis while earnings per share grew approximately 40% on a constant currency basis. 
The momentum across our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger International businesses continued during the quarter. Our European and China businesses continued to be our healthiest markets. The strength is being seen across all channels of distribution, wholesale, retail and our digital channels. 
Speaking of digital, we continue to see outsized growth across all of our digital e-commerce businesses. For the second quarter, we continue to generate revenue growth in excess of 20%, and this channel continues to be our fastest-growing distribution channel. Key measures we are taking include enhancing the navigation on our own sites, elevating our own sites to focus less on promotions, investing in mobile capabilities and taking steps to ensure that we are in stock in high core demand items, which is the key to the profitability on digital commerce. In the second quarter, the U.S. market continued to be our most volatile market that we operate in.
Similar to the first quarter, our U.S. wholesale business continued to grow and show improvement. For the first half, we are running well ahead of our wholesale plans and our prior year actual results. However, our U.S. retail businesses have not seen much improvement in trend from the first quarter and continued to experience soft traffic and higher promotional trends. Specifically, our international tourist traffic and spending continues to weigh on our U.S. retail business. And as we began August, these sales trends have not improved.
Looking ahead to the balance of the year, given the strong momentum in our businesses, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the year while also further investing in our brands. We have also taken a prudent approach to planning our business in the second half of 2016, particularly our U.S. retail businesses, which we are now planning second half comps store sales trends at the same levels that we experienced in the first half. Let me move on to a brand update to discuss each of our key brands.
Moving to Tommy Hilfiger. Let me start with an update on some of our brand marketing activities. A major focus of our fall campaign will be our women's businesses. As we have previously announced, Gigi Hadid, will be our global ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger's Women's, representing apparel footwear, accessories and fragrance. This initiative reflects the brand's strategic commitment to expand its women's businesses globally. We believe that we have a significant global growth opportunity in women's, and we are beginning to see positive momentum in these businesses. As part of her exclusive ambassadorship, Gigi has partnered with Tommy Hilfiger to launch her first collaborative collection. The collection will launch globally at the New York Fashion Week with Tommy Hilfiger's first consumer fashion show, where all looks will be immediately available for purchase. The collection will be available in over 70 countries around the world, in over 200 Tommy Hilfiger stores and 150 wholesale partner's stores, all with dedicated in-store marketing installations. The collection will also be available on our own e-commerce sites. 
Another important brand initiative for us has been Tommy Jeans. Now in its second season, Tommy Jeans celebrates the most iconic styles from the brand from the 1990s. We've added nostalgic classics with a fresh, youthful energy. We first launched the jeans collection in April 2016 in 15 countries across Europe with strong sell-throughs on both e-commerce and at retail. The collection has allowed us to establish new wholesale partnerships that support our efforts to attract a new, younger consumer base. In the U.S. and the U.K., we have invested in a strategic partnership with Urban Outfitters. We have also established similar partnerships with specialty stores in France, Germany and Scandinavia.
The second delivery of the Tommy Jeans capsule has hit stores in August, and the collection continues to perform very well and has excellent sell-throughs. Moving to the financial performance in the second quarter. 
Overall, revenues for Tommy increased 7% on a constant currency basis and EBIT was up over 20% on a constant currency basis. Our revenues were driven by the outstanding performance of our international business, which continued to generate 11% constant currency sales growth in the quarter.
Moving to our European business. We saw solid performance in all major European markets, demonstrated by an 8% comp store increase in Europe for our retail business, with strength across all major markets. I think it's important to comment that our U.K. business continues to show strong momentum despite a short-lived slow-down around the Brexit vote. We continue to be encouraged by healthy comp trends we have experienced so far in the third quarter, which continue to run up high single digits throughout Europe.
Moving to wholesale. The Hilfiger brand continues to resonate with the U.S. -- with the European consumer and our fall sales are projected to be up 6%, while our spring 2017 order book is running up 7% over the prior year. Growth in the order book was generated across all product categories with acceleration across our denim and women's businesses. Strong growth is coming out of all markets, the U.K., Germany, Scandinavia, Spain and even Italy, which has not seen growth in many seasons. The only challenging market for the brand is Turkey, which is understandable, given the current geopolitical situation there.
Moving to Asia. As a reminder, we closed our acquisition in China in mid-April for the Tommy Hilfiger business there. That business continues to demonstrate strong results and is tracking to our plan. This plan has added about 300 basis points to the top line during the second quarter and we see it being slightly accretive to our full year earnings. We affirmed up our planned marketing spend in China that we spoke to you previously about, and we believe this will help further support the brand and our fall initiatives that are primarily focused on promoting women's as well as the foundation for sustainable growth in 2017 and beyond.
Moving to North America. Starting with our wholesale business, I'm pleased to say that our Tommy's men's wholesale business continues to perform very well. And during the quarter and first half, we continue to see good sell-throughs and higher sales. During the quarter, we continue to see stronger sell-throughs and higher average unit retails. We believe this healthy performance from the first half of the year will continue into the second half, and we are excited about the developments in the men's business.
Lastly, we are working with G-III to handle the women's sportswear business in the fourth quarter, and that transition continues to run on plan, and we continue to see strong, positive reaction to the lines by our wholesale partners.
Turning to our U.S. retail business. Unfortunately, we have not seen a material improvement in this business year-to-date with comps running down year-to-date about 8%. The business continues to be under pressure, driven by weakness in traffic and consumer spending in the international tourist stores. As a reminder, we're taking a prudent approach and are not forecasting for the first half trends to improve for the balance of this year.
Moving to Calvin Klein. Let me take a moment and discuss some of the recent moves around the Calvin Klein brand. We announced a few weeks ago that Raf Simons has been appointed our Global Creative Officer to drive our new global creative strategy for the brand, which will unify all Calvin Klein brands under one creative vision across all other categories of the brand. We believe that this undertaking will further solidify the brand's positioning worldwide and pave the way for future growth. As Raf has only been in the building a few weeks, he is working with the teams as he builds out how the brand will continue to evolve from a creative direction point of view.
As it relates to the overall brand's relevancy and the power of the brand globally, we continue to see our awareness levels and willingness to purchase metrics continue to improve in all markets. The fall 2016 global advertising campaign continues to roll out featuring a provocative blend of talent and deeper storytelling while continue to leverage #mycalvins. The campaign is featured in 26 global markets with a diversified media mix comprised of digital, print and outdoor advertising. 
As a reminder, we're also the official apparel partners of the European Justin Bieber's Purpose Tour, which kicks off in September. And we will have dedicated branded top-up shops at the tour's Berlin, London and Madrid stops, similar to what we did for Justin's U.S. tour. Specifically from a brand's perspective, I want to call out a few exciting launches for Fall 2016.
On the jeans front, we have a major global launch of our sculpted jean, which will hit stores at the end of this month. This launch will be supported by a global ad campaign with that features Bella Hadid, Gigi's sister. This company will focus on all major markets with a diversified mix of media, both digital, print and outdoor. 
As a product category, we have seen significant growth in our Calvin Klein Underwear and Intimates business. And this has far and away been our most successful growth category, posting exclusive growth and consistently growing its leading global market share position. We believe women's intimates will continue to be our most significant growth area, and we have a number of fall growth initiatives taking place. 
Our Modern Cotton logo business continues to gain momentum and has enabled us to capture the #1 market position in the bralette category. For Fall 2016, we are taking this logo application to tailored bras and are launching our Seamless Logo bra. It marries bra technology with a great CK logo. This will allow us to continue to cater to a younger consumer and offer those that want more support the ability to purchase logo product as well. 
Additionally, on the bra side, we continue to expand our Black Label offer -- offering, particularly in Asia and Europe, and have launched 2 new product -- products for fall to address our broader tailored bra segment. Offering seductive comfort with lace, adding new fashion details to our well-known, proven seductive comfort silhouette, and offering a 3-piece lace bra with a focus on our attempt to gain a larger portion of the large size cup market, both in U.S. and in Europe markets.
Lastly, we launched the brand's latest women's fragrance, Deep Euphoria, earlier this month, which will help expand the Euphoria business. The print and video advertising campaign for the fragrance features Margot Robbie, and will receive support through a global campaign with print, broadcast and digital media. 
From a financial performance perspective in the second quarter, overall, the global momentum in Calvin Klein continues as we posted revenue growth of 15% on a constant currency basis and non-GAAP EBIT growth of close to 50% on a constant currency basis.
Let me start with the international businesses to Calvin. International revenues were up approximately 17% on a constant currency basis with comparable store sales growth increasing by 11% in the quarter. Europe continued to experience very healthy wholesale selling and comparable store sales increases across every major market. And our branded presence across the major markets continues to improve each season. The wholesale business continues its strong performance. Our Fall 2016 sales are projected to be up high-teens, and I'm pleased to provide you with an update on Spring 2017's order book, which is running up about 20%.
The strength of the business is coming from all major markets and across all product categories with an acceleration in both jeans and the underwear categories. And we have seen growth in some of our new -- newer categories, particularly accessories. 
Our European retail business continues to gain momentum with comps running up in the midteens in the second quarter. As we have moved into the third quarter, comp store sales in Europe continues to post strong double-digit sales increases.
Moving to Asia. Our businesses continue to perform very well with China outperforming our other markets. However, it is important to note that we did experience a nice improvement in our Korea business. The trends from our first quarter continue as we see strength across jeans, underwear, accessories and our newer performance at leisure business. 
We continue to see nice square footage growth across the region with some key new store openings in Hong Kong and Mainland China this year. Additionally, by the end of the year, our Asia CK.com sites will be shipping to all major markets across Asia, including Australia and New Zealand. Second quarter comp sales in Asia saw a nice improvement, and we continue to see that trend into our third quarter running up about positive mid-single digits.
In North America, our revenues were up 15% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by the strong performance of our wholesale business across all categories. During the quarter, we saw continued momentum in our underwear business, as our women's business continues to see tremendous growth and market share gains in the department store sector.
We've seen market share growth in the bra business to the #5 position overall in department stores and #1 position in the bralette category. We also have grown to the #2 position in panties with strong momentum in the logo bottoms business. In men's, we continue to hold the #1 market share position in bottoms and the #2 position in tops. 
Our newest launch in bottoms in the U.S. is the 3-pack micro, which is off to a strong start. Historically, we have not offered micro-product in multipacks, but only in singles, and the consumers reacted very positive to this. While the department stores continue to drive the lion's share of our volume growth, penetration of our e-commerce and growth in these channels continues to outpace the brick-and-mortar trends.
Continuing on the solid momentum from this first quarter is our men's sportswear and jeans business, which continues to see improvement from the fall season with better AURs and strong sell-throughs. Women's jeans continues to see outsized improvement through our specialty store accounts, like Urban Outfitters, and we did see improvement trends across all of our department store businesses there as well.
Moving to our retail U.S. business. That remains challenging with our international tourist traffic and spending under the same pressure that we are seeing in our Hilfiger U.S. business. Retail comps continue to remain soft in the second quarter at mid-single-digit negative and we are not planning for this sales trend to improve for the balance of the year.
Finally, in our Heritage businesses. The Heritage business revenues declined 14%, driven by the ongoing impact of our rationalization initiatives, including the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines within dress furnishing. Additionally, our Heritage Brands business was impacted by a shift in timing of our wholesale shipments into the third quarter from the second quarter.
Our Heritage businesses continue to track positively against our full year 2016 financial plan. We are very well positioned in these businesses. Inventories are very clean and our sales orders at wholesale are very healthy. We believe we are poised to post a significant earnings turnaround in the second half of the year.
Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Speedo and its Olympic performance. I would like to congratulate Team Speedo on their performance during the Summer Olympics. The Speedo brand was dominant during the games and very prominent to our consumers, and we believe this exposure will continue to have a positive impact on our business.
Finally, to conclude my remarks. Overall, we are quite pleased with our performance in the first half and believe that our world-class brands, proven business model and best-in-class management teams are well-positioned to navigate through the macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility that we're seeing, while being positioned, hopefully, to outperform against our second half projections. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to quantify some of the financial results."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release.

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. 
Second quarter revenues were in line with guidance with the 5% constant currency increase over the prior year after excluding a negative impact of 1% from foreign exchange. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter. Calvin Klein revenues were up 15% on a constant currency basis, ahead of guidance and driven by all regions. Calvin Klein International comps were particularly strong with a comp store increase of 11%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 7% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by strong performance in Europe, as our Europe comp sales were up 8% as well as the addition of our China business. 
Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger U.S. wholesale businesses performed well in the quarter and exceeded plan. However, our U.S. retail businesses for these brands remain under pressure due to continued declines in our stores located in international tourist locations.
Heritage revenues were down 14%, primarily due to the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in dress furnishings business as well as the timing of shipment. EPS for the quarter was better than the top end of our guidance by $0.17. The beat was driven by our strong Calvin and Tommy performance for $0.10, a favorable shift of marketing spend into the second half of the year of $0.05. Favorable timing on taxes of $0.03 and a partial offset from FX of $0.01.
Our inventories were very clean at the end of the second quarter, relatively flat to the prior year despite acquiring inventories as part of the Tommy China acquisition.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2016, we're increasing our earnings guidance for the year while continuing to take a prudent approach to planning our business in the second half as a result of global consumer spending remaining volatile and the U.S. retail market continuing to be promotional. In particular, we are now planning second half comp store sales trends in our U.S. retail business not to improve. Specifically, we are projecting our second half comps to be at the same level as our first half trends.
For the full year 2016, we are anticipating, based on our current exchange rates, that we'll be negatively impacted by about $1.60 of earnings per share for foreign exchange, which is $0.05 worse than previous guidance and was primarily driven by the British pound. 
The $1.60 impact is approximately 85% transaction and 15% translation. For the full year 2016, we're projecting non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.55 to $6.65, if we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.60, earnings per share growth is 16% to 17% over the prior year. We've increased our earnings per share guidance to $0.10 despite the $0.05 negative impact from FX. 
Our guidance continues to reflect a prudent view of our businesses for the second half of the year. In total, the second half of the year will include an increase of $40 million versus the prior year on brand marketing as well as investments associated with the recent Calvin Klein creative leadership changes.
Versus our previous guidance, our full year marketing spend has increased approximately $10 million. Overall, we are projecting full year revenues to grow approximately 3% on a constant currency basis. This guidance reflects a revenue reduction of approximately $40 million in the second half of the year related to our proposed joint venture in Mexico, which is expected to close late in the third quarter and would primarily impact our Calvin Klein business. Overall, we expect this transaction to be earnings neutral on a non-GAAP basis for 2016.
Overall, operating margins are expected to increase 75 basis points on a constant currency basis and decrease 90 basis points on a reported basis. Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 7% on a constant currency basis with operating margins to increase about 50 points excluding the negative impact of FX of 160 basis points. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned to increase about 75 basis points, excluding the negative impact of approximately 225 basis points of FX.
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 8%, mostly to the exiting of the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 30 basis points.
The impact of foreign currency in Heritage is relatively immaterial. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at $2.35 to $2.40 and includes $0.45 of estimated negative impact for foreign exchange. Excluding this negative impact, we're expecting earnings per share to increase 5% to 7% for the third quarter. Included in our third quarter guidance is increased marketing and investment spend of approximately $20 million versus the prior year.
Revenue in the third quarter is projected to increase 3% on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at a 6% constant currency increase while the Heritage business is planned to decrease 6%.

I guess from a guidance and projection point of view, it just seemed prudent to try -- whatever risk might be in the business, the idea was to try to derisk any of the guidance as we went forward. And given the momentum that we're seeing in other parts of the business, we felt comfortable taking that sales trend down. I think just to say it, if we were to see somewhat of a leveling off in that environment, we're well-positioned with inventory there to take advantage of it, both from a top line point of view and even more importantly, I think from a margin point of view as we go forward. So opportunity exists if that channel were to bounce back somewhat in the third and fourth quarter. I think the real opportunity ought to be, to sum it up, is really the fourth quarter, given the weather issues that we faced last year and the pressure that was put on margins last year to liquidate goods."

The men's business, as I've mentioned a couple of times, is ahead of the women's business, both from a fashion point of view and from a performance point of view at departments -- in our performance at department stores. I think from a fashion point of view, our fall line really moves us forward on the women's side of the equation and will be well-positioned for the back-to-school season and hopefully, to capture significant amount of growth in that area. Our retail partners really feel strongly about how the line is positioned, and we're starting to see it in our order book as we look beyond 2016 and '17 where our retail partners are gaining more confidence in the line and placing stronger orders as we go forward.

I think it may put a little bit of pressure on top line, but from a profitability point of view, these obviously weren't Macy's most profitable stores and they weren't our most profitable margin stores. So I think the opportunity is to have a healthier presentation at healthier profitability in the brick-and-mortar side of the business. From a positioning point of view, for the last 24 to 36 months, we've been really trying to drive our digital growth, both our only site, but also our partner sites, macys.com, our key players there, and also a couple -- a number of the pure plays globally, be it Amazon, Zalando, Alibaba, Tmall. So those are clearly areas for us. And we've tried to segment our product, make sure that we're well positioned in those areas, significantly investing. I mentioned in my comments the investments we're making from a digital presentation point of view. Clearly, our marketing campaigns have shifted their spends to -- we're well over 50% of our marketing spend now is digital, both for Calvin and Tommy. So I think we're making all the right moves. And we need to be where the consumer is. They want our brands and we're positioned there. And over the next 12 months, we're trying to position ourselves that we're agnostic about where we make the sale, whether it's in our own retail stores, department stores, through their brick-and-mortar or their own e-commerce sites.

So I have a cohesive view of the brand and the product and being able to really take advantage of the collection business to diffuse it down to our white label and bridge lines, I think will be a huge benefit for us as we go forward. As far as how that will impact our marketing campaigns and as we move forward, I think, look, that's a work in process. I think is -- I think what you will probably see is the last 2 years appropriately so, given the size of the business, disproportionate amount of our marketing spend has gone to Calvin Klein jeans and underwear, and I think as we move into '17 and beyond, you'll see more lifestyle marketing of the brand that will capture and take advantage of the -- other product category as -- where we think there's significant growth. So I view this as all very positive. From a licensing point of view, I don't think it changes any of our direction. I think we continue to look to take control of the more geographic components of our brand, where it makes sense, particularly where we have strong operating platforms like we did with the Tommy Hilfiger business in China. We could see that happening both with Tommy and Calvin going forward. And that there's always the opportunity as we move forward to potentially bring in some significant product categories in-house.

It's very event driven. We don't do flash sites and flash selling on our own sites. We don't drive excess product to our sites. We really view that as flagship sites where the consumer comes to our sites, be it Tommy or Calvin. They investigate the brand, better understand the brand.

As that business continues to grow, we've talked about the kind of growth rates we're seeing, we're 12 months away from going from a loss position on those businesses to a profit position on those businesses.

And it really worked well with Macy's, in particular, in our other key department store accounts to make sure that transition is seamless. And I'm very confident about the way that's moving. G-III, what we're hoping for is what they've delivered in Calvin Klein over the last 5 to 7 years that they'll deliver for Tommy Hilfiger and really take a business that's a couple of hundred million dollars and turn it into a $500 million to $700 million business at much higher price points and at better margins.
As you mentioned China. Again, this year, with the transition and some of the amortizations and some of the accounting stuff that we have to deal with, it's slightly -- it's going to be slightly accretive. I think that business will continue to grow. I think we are going -- I guess, we're projecting it to grow high single digits. There's an opportunity to do more than that. But it's a question of how fast and quickly we want to move. Clearly, if you look at the size of the business, round numbers, $140 million to $150 million business, compared to a Calvin Klein business that's at least twice as large. There's clearly a footprint opportunity for us to grow. And I guess, just having the 2 brands under 1 roof, under 1 logistics platform, 1 operating platform, the synergies should start to come towards the second half of next year in a bigger way. So it'll be a much bigger contributor of profitability next year as we move forward. And it will be a big contributor to our top line growth as well. So I feel -- I really think that, that will be, probably without a doubt, it is -- it will be next year for sure our highest operating margin business in the company for the Tommy Hilfiger brand, very similar to how profitable our Calvin Klein China business is. So as we look forward, we're enthusiastic, and I think it'll be a contributor significantly to our top and bottom line."

Clearly, Korea will be a big market for us. We believe Japan could be a market for us. And Central and Southeast Asia, which would include Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan. So some pretty substantial markets as we go forward, which should be nicely profitable as we go forward. The key in all of that is timing of license expirations, really working hand-in-hand with our strategic licensing partners who've really done a great job in building the brand throughout Asia. The other opportunity will be Brazil. Calvin Klein has a very profitable business there that despite the economic conditions in Brazil, it continues to be close to 20% operating margin business for us and is about 25% -- the Tommy Hilfiger business in Brazil is about 25% the size of the Calvin Klein business in Brazil. So clear growth opportunity there that we're doing with the strategic partner, where we own a little bit over 40% of the joint venture and the ability there, over time, to bring that in-house will play itself out. So clear opportunities there. And that's really our focus area at this point, the focus areas at this point as far as license takebacks."

And then we are putting on comps on top of comps and we're comping on top of double-digit comps from last year in certain quarters. As we look at it, we continue to see opportunities. The big improvement in our retail stores has been very healthy women's business. And I think that only continues. If you think about the brand in Europe, it is 65% to 70% men's versus women's. And we all know how much larger the women's market is than men's. So that opportunity keeps presenting itself. The productivity in our stores continues to improve, and a lot of it is being driven by the women's sales per square foot growing closer and closer to the men's productivity in those stores. So the opportunity is there to continue this momentum, and a big piece of it will be driven by the women's component getting better. And as our men's tailored business becomes a bigger piece of the pie and we continue to get strong success there throughout Europe at the wholesale level as we bring that product category into the stores, given the much higher price point, it really -- it does wonders for the sales productivity in the stores. The margins are comparable to our sportswear apparel margins and footwear margins. So clearly, the opportunity there is to grow men's tailored in our stores and to grow the women's businesses in our stores. And there's a lot of momentum behind those businesses. So I don't think -- I think we'll continue to see positive comps. I can't talk about double-digit comp store increases, but I can continue to say we'll continue to see momentum. Europe seems much healthier as a market to us. I know all the headlines about Europe and what you see. But as far as the consumers being -- spending discretionary money, it's very healthy there. I think the fact that the dollar has strengthened has only made our -- the pressure that puts on our U.S. business I've talked about, the flip side to that is it really significantly helps our international businesses as people travel or people stay closer to home in Europe, within Europe and buy when they're on vacation or on holiday, that's really been a big win for us as well. So I think those trends will continue."

On the Calvin Klein side, look, it's more product categories. And I don't mean to sound cavalier about it when I say it, is the strength is across all countries, all major countries, all product categories, where we're really seeing tremendous growth in jeans and underwear because they're the 2 largest categories. But our accessory business is also performing very strong there. We've just only recently launched men's sportswear. And that -- the percentage there are very, very high. But the dollars there are small as it starts to roll out. And we haven't done anything with women's sportswear and apparel outside of jeans and underwear at all. So that's really a major opportunity for us as we move forward. If we start to just match up from where we are positioned geographically in the United States or even in Asia, where Calvin women's represents about 40% of the volume, there's a huge opportunity in Europe for that to continue. Just to remind everybody, the European strategy, first and foremost, was to take a broken Warnaco Jeans and Underwear business that was in the wrong distribution at -- and still basically breaking even. And when you pulled out the bad distribution, it was losing money, our European business today is healthy, growing. You see the international numbers. You see the margins there. So our European business is really contributing significantly. If you use Tommy Hilfiger as a comparison, the Tommy Hilfiger business in Europe is 3x the size of the Calvin business. It's the only region in the world where Tommy is larger than Calvin. The profitability is 200 to 300 basis points higher and that has to do with scale. And I think those opportunities as the brand -- now that the Calvin brand has solidified its position, has got a profitable foundation, the ability to take that forward and the enthusiasm that our wholesale partners have for the brand, just gives us -- makes us just more optimistic about that this European trend could continue for the next 3 to 4 years."

And it's being impacted by international tourism, but it is still one of the most largest, most profitable department stores in the world. And not to say -- not to put us in the same category as Macy's Herald Square but these stores are our largest, most profitable stores. And I think this tourism will balance out. I'm not going to sit here and say it's coming back. But I do think as we get through the third and fourth quarter of this year, it should level off, and we will continue to have very profitable stores. If you look at our retail profitability, it's as strong as our wholesale profitability. And you see how profitable our Calvin and Tommy North America businesses are, double-digit operating margins, very profitable businesses. So this is just a shift in sales trends. And I think our European business is benefiting from that shift and our Asia business is to an extent and our Latin America businesses.

So I think we do have, with the Calvin brand in particular, a lot of momentum behind the brand. We've been able to take advantage of some of the weakness with some of our competitors to grow square footage and to gain market share in that channel. So I think we are outperforming. We positioned ourselves and we -- I don't believe we've overextended our brands in that channel of distribution where other players have talked about that they overexposed and over -- we've been continuing to grow, but I think we've been doing in a very healthy way. We -- we're in categories that department stores really are focused on growing women's and men's. And we've been a solution in both of those areas. With the Tommy brand, with Macy's, it continues to perform very well for us on the men's side of the floor. And now with the G-III initiative, Macy's has really gotten behind the brand and the things that really can make up for some of the market share losses that they've had with other brands.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. Joining me on the call is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; and Ken Duane, who runs our North America wholesale businesses. Overall, our performance year-to-date and through the third quarter continues to exceed our expectations and demonstrates our ability to deliver against the 2016 plan despite the ongoing macro environment. Overall, we have a terrific quarter, with revenues increasing 5% on a constant currency basis, while EPS grew approximately 15% on a constant currency basis. 
The momentum across our Calvin and Tommy Hilfiger international businesses continued during the quarter. Our Europe and China businesses continued to be our healthiest markets, along with our North America wholesale business.
The strength has been across all channels of distribution, wholesale, retail and our digital channels. Speaking of digital, Q3, we continue to generate revenue growth in excess of 20% and this channel continues to be our fastest-growing distribution channels. They 1 channel that's part of our business continue to be our U.S. retail businesses in the third quarter. We did not see an improvement in comp stores sales trends from first half trends. Specifically, international tourist traffic and spending continue to weigh on our U.S. retail business. However, as we move into the last 2 weeks of November, we have seen a significant improvement in comp store sales across all of our U.S. retail businesses. 
Let me move on to our brands. Speaking about the Tommy Hilfiger brand, we have previously discussed with you that Gigi Hadid, as our global ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger womens, representing apparel, footwear, accessories and fragrance. And the reaction and the brand awareness that she has helped to bring to our brand over the last few months has been terrific. This initiative reflects the brand strategic commitment to expand our women's businesses globally.
We believe that we have a significant growth opportunity in women's, and we are encouraged by the improvements and positive momentum we are seeing globally in this fall holiday season. Financially speaking, overall revenues for Tommy increased 6% on a constant currency basis and EBIT was up about 12% on a constant currency basis. 
Our revenues were driven by outstanding, by the outstanding performance of our international business, which generate 18% constant currency sales growth in the quarter. The Tommy Europe business performance was incredible. And we continued, it continues to highlight the strength of the brand in our largest region and highlights the market share gains the brand continues to achieve. We continue to see very healthy performance in all major European markets in the third quarter, demonstrated by a 10% comp store sales increase in Europe for our retail business. This strong performance has continued into November, along with very strong margins.
Again, we are pleased with the strong wholesale performance of that we are seeing as our holiday, as our fall holiday season to date is up about 6%. Looking out spring 2017 season which starts to shift in the fourth quarter, our spring order book is running up 8% versus the prior year, which is ahead of our previous guidance of about 7%. 
Moving to Asia. Our Tommy Asia business continues to perform well, led by our recently acquired China businesses as that business will be on track will be accretive to this year's earnings despite the increased marketing dollars we have put into the China market despite the long-term growth of the brand going forward.
Moving to our North America business. Tommy North America continues to see a really strong men's wholesale business, which has continued to outperform our competitors, not only the third quarter, but thought the entire year. We have now hand it off the women's business to G-III and expect to see strong growth going forward from them as all licensee. Shifting to retail. As I mentioned, in the third quarter, we continue to see challenging sales trends with our comes down 11% in our U.S. stores. This trend continued into the first week, 2 weeks of November. However, we did see a significant improvement in comps in the last 2 weeks of November with overall fourth quarter comps to date down mid-single digits.
This strongest selling, which is being driven by higher AURs, coupled with our health inventory position, has the potential to generate higher than blend gross margins in the fourth quarter. Moving to Calvin Klein. Overall, we continue to see great momentum within the Calvin Klein brand and our business more broadly. The brand continues to drive relevancy with strong digital advertising campaigns and by enhancing and diversifying our distribution of the brand to a number of key specialty stores in the U.S. and Europe. Over the last quarter, we continue to see our awareness levels and willingness to purchase metrics, continue to improve in all major markets. As an update on some product initiatives, generally speaking, our sculpted Jean launch fall has been well-received across all markets where we have string strong sell-throughs, higher AURs and better overall margins. Our fall launch in tailored bras was seductive comfort with lace where we took our best-selling [audio gap] [ph][ph][ph]   These additional size bands of 36 to 40 have the potential to represent 25% to 30% of our total U.S. bra business. This represents a significant market share opportunity for us going forward. 
For men, we introduced our liquid Stretch product, which provided the utmost comfort in a great new innovative stretch fabric and takes advantage of the actives trend that is happening in the market. 
From a financial perspective, revenues for Calvin increased 10% on a constant currency basis, and EBIT was up 9% on a constant currency basis. Our revenues were driven by strong top line growth out of Europe, China and North America wholesale across all classifications with continued strong gross margin performance.
Calvin Klein Europe's performance continues to show incredible improvement year-over-year, and I am quite pleased with the progress of the business and where we are headed. The wholesale business continued its strong performance, with fall holiday 2016 sales up high-teens. This momentum is accelerating as we move into 2017 as our spring order book now is running up over 20%.
Our European retail business continues to gain momentum with third quarter comps running up mid-teens, and this sales trends has continued into the fourth quarter. The strength of the European business was coming from all major markets and across all product categories, with an acceleration in both jeans and the underwear categories. And we have also seen strong growth in some of our new product categories, particularly accessories.
Our Calvin Klein Asia business also continues to perform well, with China outperforming all other markets. We continue to see strength across jeans, underwear, accessories and our newer performance athleisure business within Asia. 
Moving to North America. Our Calvin Klein North American business continued to see healthy growth across our wholesale channels in line with our plans, which reflected lower open-to-buy dollars from retailers versus the previous year. I'm pleased to report that we continue to see strength across all categories from our dress shirt business to sportswear, jeans, and certainly our underwear business led by continued momentum in our women's intimates business.
Shifting to retail. As I commented on our Tommy Hilfiger North America retail results, we did not experience any improvement across our U.S. retail business at Calvin, with overall comps down about 5% for the third quarter. This trend continued into the first 2 weeks of November. However, we have seen a significant improvement in comp store sales during the last 2 weeks of the month with fourth quarter comps to date flat to last year.
Finally, our Heritage business. Revenues were down 8%, driven by the ongoing impact of our rationalization initiatives announced in 2015, including the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed products within dress furnishings. 
Our Heritage business has continued to track positively against our full year 2016 financial plan, with operating margins improving 90 basis points for the quarter, driven by improved wholesale performance and continued strength in our Van Heusen retail business, with third quarter comps up 6%. Specifically, we continue to see solid performance across all of our Heritage businesses, with the exception of our neckwear business, which has been soft for the entire year.
Looking at our outlook for the year, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the year, while taking into account the impact that the strengthening U.S. dollar will have on our reported results. We are being prudent in planning the fourth quarter holiday season, which we expect will be -- remain highly competitive. We also believe that geopolitical uncertainty has intensified post the U.S. elections, which will drive macroeconomic volatility. Given this backdrop, we believe it is prudent to be conservative with our financial projections for the fourth quarter as we move out. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike to quantify our third quarter earnings and our outlook."

Third quarter revenues were up 4% versus our guidance of up 3%. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter. Calvin Klein revenues were up 10% on a constant currency basis, ahead of guidance and driven by all regions. Calvin Klein International comps were particularly strong with a comp store increase of 7%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 6% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by strong performance in Europe, as our Europe comp store sales were up 10% and the addition of our China business as well. 
Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger U.S. wholesale businesses performed well in the quarter and exceeded plan. However, our U.S. retail businesses for these brands remain under pressure due to continued declines in our stores located in international tourist destinations. Heritage revenues were down 8%, primarily due to the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business. EPS for the quarter was better than the top end of our guidance by $0.20. The beat was driven by a strong Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger performance as well as favorable taxes and interest for approximately $0.15 and a timing shift in marketing spend into the fourth quarter from the third quarter of $0.05. 
Our inventories for the quarter were very clean at the end of the third -- at the end of the quarter, and were down 6% versus the prior year
We have increased our EPS guidance by $0.15 at the top end of our previous range and $0.20 at the low end of our previous range before a $0.05 negative impact from FX. For the full year 2016, we are increasing our non-GAAP earnings per share estimate to $6.70 to $6.75. If we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.65, we have earnings per share growth of 18% to 19% over the prior year.
As I mentioned, for the full year 2016, we're anticipating based on current exchange rates that will be impacted negatively by about $1.65 of earnings per share for foreign exchange, which is $0.05 worse than previous guidance. The $1.65 impact is approximately 80% driven by transaction and 20% driven by translation.
Our guidance continues to reflect the prudent view of our business for the fourth quarter as a result of global consumer spending remaining volatile and the U.S. retail market continuing to be promotional. 
Overall, we are projecting full year revenue to grow approximately 3% on a constant currency basis. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase approximately 75 basis on a constant currency basis and to decrease approximately 80 basis points on an as reported basis.
Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 8% on a constant currency basis with operating margins to increase about 50 basis points, excluding a negative impact of 160 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned to increase about 110 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 220 basis points of FX. 
Our Heritage businesses is planned to have a revenue decrease of 9% due mostly to our exiting of the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to decrease about 30 basis points.
The fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at $1.13 to $1.18 and includes $0.23 of estimated negative impact for foreign exchange. The fourth quarter will include an increase of $25 million versus the prior year in brand marketing as well as investments associated with the recent Calvin Klein creative leadership changes.
The $25 million increase includes a shift of $5 million of marketing from the third quarter into the fourth quarter versus our previous guidance. Our full year marketing spend remains flat to the previous guidance. Revenue in the fourth quarter is projected to increase 1% on a constant currency basis, negatively impacting revenue in the fourth quarter, is a 2% reduction resulting from our transaction to form a joint venture in Mexico, which primarily impacts our Calvin Klein business, and licensing our Tommy Hilfiger North American's wholesale business to G-III.
Calvin Klein revenues are planned at 3% constant currency decrease. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at a 5% constant currency increase while Heritage revenues are planned to decrease 3%.
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

We really weren't positioned out to fill the fixtures in as we came out of holiday season into that January period. So there was -- from a regular price point of view, there was a significant amount of department store fill. And there was also, in the off-price channel, a significant amount of fixture fill going on there to service that channel as well as the demand for the product continue to improve. That happens once. And now, unfortunately, we're up against that as we move forward. That's the biggest issue we're dealing with. That's been factored in from the beginning of the year. I guess, now as we move into the fourth quarter, it gets more highlighted. I don't think, in any way, it puts any limit on us as we go forward into 2017. I think our growth, financially, will continue to be very strong. And I think there'll be some carryover of that into the first quarter of 2017, but I don't believe it'll have any significant impact on our overall annual results to Calvin.

We think that's a big opportunity for '17 and, more importantly, for '18. So I think taking those kinds of ins and outs at, there's no reason that we shouldn't be growing Calvin and Tommy in that mid-single-digit range overall to high-single digits on a constant currency basis. And our Heritage businesses, like always, we manage those business from a profitability and cash flow point of view.

But I think when you really get down and look at the fundamentals of the business and the profitability levels and what's happening with the 2 -- our 2 major brands is our international growth has just never been better than it is right now in the performance there. So I'm pretty optimistic about the future. But again, we're going to have to deal with where this is all heading.

And it was part of the rationale that we said, ""Let's move -- let's hold some of our marketing dollars in the third quarter and use them when we think the consumer will actually shopping."" We've moved that into November and December at $5 million. And clearly, that's had a positive impact on trends as well in North America. So the biggest beneficiary has been our domestic stores. But also, we've seen an improvement in our international tourist stores. And if you think about where the trends had been for the first 2 weeks in November for Calvin now to be flat, we had a very strong pre-Black Friday, post-Black Friday business, both in Calvin and Tommy compared to trends. And the best part is, I think we've been really good at managing inventories and how we've really focused on that area, and we're really seeing it flow through on the gross margin line even more so than on the sales line.

And the women's opportunity, given the Calvin DNA, is even -- is significantly larger for us in Europe as we go forward. And listen, it's early in the -- with Raf Simons joining us.

But if you think about whenever you decide that the -- to project next year sales kind of growth, I think second half sales growth will be stronger than first half sales growth, mainly in the Calvin Klein North America business because of a lot of the fixture fill and new programs that went into effect this year that are anniversary-ing. But that big pop-in, particularly on those EDI core-based programs are significant and are big moneymakers for us as we go forward. I think in the first half of the year, the opportunity is greater from a gross margin point of view for the reasons you pointed out, is that not only us, but I think everyone will come out of fourth quarter in a much cleaner inventory position, just given the fact that we went into the third -- we're going into the fourth quarter with 6% less inventories and projecting overall sales growth for the business. So I think that will bode well for margins as we go forward and some of the coursing benefits that we're seeing in the first half of the year.

But are there some areas that come on to the microscope as you guys start doing your midrange planning here? Specifically like how do you look at the U.S. store fleet? It's been a while now that they've been under pressure. It looks like the drivers that caused that pressure a few years are starting to flare up again.

So absent those stores, which are critical for the brand perception, our retail businesses continue to be one of our most profitable businesses. So the challenge we're facing is -- as you rightly point out, is the business that was so strong in '13 and '14 has been under pressure, but that pressure is still double-digit EBIT margins on a fully allocated basis for our 2 big brands as we go forward. So very enhancing from a profitability point of view. I think you also rightly point out that we are starting to really lap a lot of the pressures that we saw from the U.S. dollar strengthening, where particularly, the euro and the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, being down anywhere from 15% to 30% and really having to deal with that in '14 and '15, that was really prudent. We're expecting that to subside as we go into the fourth quarter. And I think that's part of some of the improvements we're seeing in late November, early December. I'd like some more time to see that to see where we're going. And the dollar pressure so far that we've seen happening in the business is not nearly to the levels we saw before. So that needs to all work itself out. And to be honest, Mike, some of this is just so new, so recent. I mean, this -- when I was on the fourth quarter call, the euro was $1.13. And today, it's $1.6. So down 6%, 7%. It's all of a month old, so 1.5 months old. So we really have got to get our arms around a little bit more understanding what the impact of that might be as we move forward."

But our U.K. business post-Brexit has the been stronger. And I think that's a reflection of the fact that the euro strengthened against the British pound. Obviously, the dollar strengthened as well. And I think people are just viewing that as this is a great place to shop and really get value for their dollars or their euros. And that business has just been off the charts strong.

And we also have a full year impact of the creative direction that's going on, the change in creative direction that's going on in Calvin Klein. But I really think a bigger part of the SG&A movement is mix of business. Our European and our China and all of our international businesses come with higher overall SG&A expenses, probably to tune of 1,000 basis point, but also come with a higher gross margins for those businesses. And then overall, when you blend this together, probably 100 basis points higher operating margins, put together. So as our international business is Calvin, Tommy are growing substantially faster, now our North American domestic business, that makes a business and SG&A growth is going to continue. And I think you've just have to keep your eye on a constant currency basis on operating margins overall. So that, that's like a significant piece of what's happening."

The high, if you're a luxury brand, I think you're feeling pressure in that market. And I think China, that Hong Kong market, the surrounding areas, has been under more pressure. We, both for Calvin and Tommy, we tend to see the net premium space. And we're benefiting from that. Tommy has had a, an earlier stage of development, and Calvin has been in China for a longer period of time. So Calvin -- Tommy we believe, has significant opportunity. It's today, it's much more of a men's sportswear business. And we believe that there's a significant women's and denim opportunity in China for the Tommy brand. So I think we're going to continue to just see growth with the existing businesses that are in China. For Calvin, the brand is arguably one of the strongest brands in China with amazing consumer recognition and ability. And we're really taking the brand to places where it hasn't been before. It's really been a jeans, underwear play. Accessories now becoming more and more meaningful. Sportswear, as a future opportunity, will become more and more meaningful as we go forward. And I think the women's opportunity there continues to be a significant opportunity for us. Lastly, we see to be getting some real momentum in our performance athleisure business that we're running directly throughout Asia and in China in particular. And the trends, the trends that we've seen here in the states with that category has been, I'll say, it's clearly maturing here. But in China, it's probably 3 or 4 years behind that trend. And that, it's just starting to get more and more explosive as a category. And I think we are well-positioned to capture that, a significant portion of that market as it happens as a fashion brand that really plays well there. So we're excited about what that might mean. So I hope that gives you enough color in China. Accessories, overall, I've always talked about it. Calvin is a lifestyle brand. It's not Kate Spade, and it's not Coach or Michael Kors. It's really an accessory-driven business. So relatively speaking, we have a small accessory business but it's growing very fast. And as you know, the accessory business carries a much higher gross margin and operating margin when it's done right. So the opportunity is there for the Calvin Klein brand. I don't think it's -- we're not going to become this big, huge accessory player globally, but we think it could continue to be a significant growth vehicle for us, given that on a relative basis, it's still a very small business."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. Joining me on the call is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; and Ken Duane, who runs our North America w",1554,"Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. Joining me on the call is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; and Ken Duane, who runs our North America wholesale businesses. Overall, our performance year-to-date and through the third quarter continues to exceed our expectations and demonstrates our ability to deliver against the 2016 plan despite the ongoing macro environment. Overall, we had a terrific quarter, with revenues increasing 5% on a constant currency basis, while EPS grew approximately 15% on a constant currency basis. 
The momentum across our Calvin and Tommy Hilfiger International businesses continued during the quarter. Our Europe and China businesses continue to be our healthiest markets, along with our North America wholesale business.
The strength has been across all channels of distribution, wholesale, retail and our digital channels. Speaking of digital, for Q3, we continue to generate revenue growth in excess of 20%, and this channel continues to be our fastest-growing distribution channels. The one challenging part of our business continue to be our U.S. retail businesses in the third quarter. We did not see an improvement in comp stores sales trends from first-half trends. Specifically, international tourist traffic and spending continue to weigh on our U.S. retail business. However, as we move into the last 2 weeks of November, we have seen a significant improvement in comp store sales across all of our U.S. retail businesses. 
Let me move on to our brands. Speaking about the Tommy Hilfiger brand, we have previously discussed with you that Gigi Hadid, as our global ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger women's representing apparel, footwear, accessories and fragrance, and the reaction and the brand awareness that she has helped to bring to our brand over the last few months has been terrific. This initiative reflects the brand's strategic commitment to expand our women's businesses globally.
We believe that we have a significant growth opportunity in women's, and we are encouraged by the improvements and positive momentum we are seeing globally in this fall holiday season. Financially speaking, overall revenues for Tommy increased 6% on a constant currency basis, and EBIT was up about 12% on a constant currency basis. 
Our revenues were driven by outstanding -- by the outstanding performance of our international business, which generate 18% constant currency sales growth in the quarter. The Tommy Europe business performance was incredible. And we continue to -- it continues to highlight the strength of the brand in our largest region, and highlights the market share gains the brand continues to achieve. We continue to see very healthy performance in all major European markets in the third quarter, demonstrated by a 10% comp store sales increase in Europe for our retail business. This strong performance has continued into November, along with very strong margins.
Again, we are pleased with the strong wholesale performance that we are seeing as our holiday -- as our fall holiday season to date is up about 6%. Looking out spring, the 2017 season, which starts to shift in the fourth quarter, our spring order book is running up 8% versus the prior year, which is ahead of our previous guidance of about 7%. 
Moving to Asia. Our Tommy Asia business continues to perform well, led by our recently acquired China business, as that business will be on track to be accretive to this year's earnings, despite the increased marketing dollars we have put into the China market to support the long-term growth of the brand going forward.
Moving to our North America business. Tommy North America continues to see a really strong men's wholesale business, which has continued to outperform our competitors, not only in the third quarter, but throughout the entire year. We have now handed off the women's business to G-III and expect to see strong growth going forward from them as our licensee. Shifting to retail. As I mentioned, in the third quarter, we continue to see challenging sales trends, with our comps down 11% in our U.S. stores. This trend continued into the first week -- 2 weeks of November. However, we did see a significant improvement in comps in the last 2 weeks of November with overall fourth quarter comps to-date down mid-single digits.
This strong selling, which is being driven by higher AURs, coupled with our health inventory position, has the potential to generate higher-than-planned gross margins in the fourth quarter. Moving to Calvin Klein. Overall, we continue to see great momentum within the Calvin Klein brand and our business more broadly. The brand continues to drive relevancy with strong digital advertising campaigns and by enhancing and diversifying our distribution of the brand to a number of key specialty stores in the U.S. and Europe. Over the last quarter, we continue to see our awareness levels and willingness to purchase metrics, continue to improve in all major markets. As an update on some product initiatives, generally speaking, our sculpted jean launch fall has been well-received across all markets, where we have seen strong sell-throughs, higher AURs and better overall margins. Our fall launch in tailored bras was seductive comfort with lace, where we took our best-selling seductive comfort silhouette and added lace, and have seen a great reception to-date around the globe. We have also expanded our size scale offering in the U.S. to exclude -- to include extended sizes up to size 40DDD. These additional size bands of 36 to 40 have the potential to represent 25% to 30% of our total U.S. bra business. This represents a significant market share opportunity for us going forward. 
For men, we introduced our liquid Stretch product, which provided the utmost comfort in a great new innovative stretch fabric and takes advantage of the active trend that is happening in the market. 
From a financial perspective, revenues for Calvin increased 10% on a constant currency basis, and EBIT was up 9% on a constant currency basis. Our revenues were driven by strong top line growth out of Europe, China and North America wholesale across all classifications with continued strong gross margin performance.
Calvin Klein Europe's performance continues to show incredible improvement year-over-year, and I am quite pleased with the progress of the business and where we are headed. The wholesale business continued its strong performance, with fall holiday 2016 sales up high-teens. This momentum is accelerating as we move into 2017 as our spring order book now is running up over 20%.
Our European retail business continues to gain momentum with third quarter comps running up mid-teens, and this sales trends has continued into the fourth quarter. The strength of the European business was coming from all major markets and across all product categories, with an acceleration in both jeans and the underwear categories. And we have also seen strong growth in some of our new product categories, particularly accessories.
Our Calvin Klein Asia business also continues to perform well, with China outperforming all other markets. We continue to see strength across jeans, underwear, accessories and our newer performance athleisure business within Asia. 
Moving to North America. Our Calvin Klein North American business continued to see healthy growth across our wholesale channels in line with our plans, which reflected lower open-to-buy dollars from retailers versus the previous year. I'm pleased to report that we continue to see strength across all categories from our dress shirt business to sportswear, jeans, and certainly our underwear business led by continued momentum in our women's intimates business.
Shifting to retail. As I commented on our Tommy Hilfiger North America retail results, we did not experience any improvement across our U.S. retail business at Calvin, with overall comps down about 5% for the third quarter. This trend continued into the first 2 weeks of November. However, we have seen a significant improvement in comp store sales during the last 2 weeks of the month with fourth quarter comps to date flat to last year.
Finally, our Heritage business. Revenues were down 8%, driven by the ongoing impact of our rationalization initiatives announced in 2015, including the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed products within dress furnishings. 
Our Heritage business has continued to track positively against our full year 2016 financial plan, with operating margins improving 90 basis points for the quarter, driven by improved wholesale performance and continued strength in our Van Heusen retail business, with third quarter comps up 6%. Specifically, we continue to see solid performance across all of our Heritage businesses, with the exception of our neckwear business, which has been soft for the entire year.
Looking at our outlook for the year, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the year, while taking into account the impact that the strengthening U.S. dollar will have on our reported results. We are being prudent in planning the fourth quarter holiday season, which we expect will be -- remain highly competitive. We also believe that geopolitical uncertainty has intensified post the U.S. elections, which will drive macroeconomic volatility. Given this backdrop, we believe it is prudent to be conservative with our financial projections for the fourth quarter as we move out. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike to quantify our third quarter earnings and our outlook."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Third quarter revenues were up 4% versus our guidance of up 3%. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter. Calvi",763,"Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Third quarter revenues were up 4% versus our guidance of up 3%. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter. Calvin Klein revenues were up 10% on a constant currency basis, ahead of guidance and driven by all regions. Calvin Klein International comps were particularly strong with a comp store increase of 7%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 6% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by strong performance in Europe, as our Europe comp store sales were up 10% and the addition of our China business as well. 
Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger U.S. wholesale businesses performed well in the quarter and exceeded plan. However, our U.S. retail businesses for these brands remain under pressure due to continued declines in our stores located in international tourist destinations. Heritage revenues were down 8%, primarily due to the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business. EPS for the quarter was better than the top end of our guidance by $0.20. The beat was driven by a strong Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger performance as well as favorable taxes and interest for approximately $0.15 and a timing shift in marketing spend into the fourth quarter from the third quarter of $0.05. 
Our inventories for the quarter were very clean at the end of the third -- at the end of the quarter, and were down 6% versus the prior year
We have increased our EPS guidance by $0.15 at the top end of our previous range and $0.20 at the low end of our previous range before a $0.05 negative impact from FX. For the full year 2016, we are increasing our non-GAAP earnings per share estimate to $6.70 to $6.75. If we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.65, we have earnings per share growth of 18% to 19% over the prior year.
As I mentioned, for the full year 2016, we're anticipating based on current exchange rates that will be impacted negatively by about $1.65 of earnings per share for foreign exchange, which is $0.05 worse than previous guidance. The $1.65 impact is approximately 80% driven by transaction and 20% driven by translation.
Our guidance continues to reflect the prudent view of our business for the fourth quarter as a result of global consumer spending remaining volatile and the U.S. retail market continuing to be promotional. 
Overall, we are projecting full year revenue to grow approximately 3% on a constant currency basis. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase approximately 75 basis on a constant currency basis and to decrease approximately 80 basis points on an as reported basis.
Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 8% on a constant currency basis with operating margins to increase about 50 basis points, excluding a negative impact of 160 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned to increase about 110 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 220 basis points of FX. 
Our Heritage businesses is planned to have a revenue decrease of 9% due mostly to our exiting of the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to decrease about 30 basis points.
The fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at $1.13 to $1.18 and includes $0.23 of estimated negative impact for foreign exchange. The fourth quarter will include an increase of $25 million versus the prior year in brand marketing as well as investments associated with the recent Calvin Klein creative leadership changes.
The $25 million increase includes a shift of $5 million of marketing from the third quarter into the fourth quarter versus our previous guidance. Our full year marketing spend remains flat to the previous guidance. Revenue in the fourth quarter is projected to increase 1% on a constant currency basis, negatively impacting revenue in the fourth quarter, is a 2% reduction resulting from our transaction to form a joint venture in Mexico, which primarily impacts our Calvin Klein business, and licensing our Tommy Hilfiger North American's wholesale business to G-III.
Calvin Klein revenues are planned at 3% constant currency decrease. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at a 5% constant currency increase while Heritage revenues are planned to decrease 3%.
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

We really weren't positioned out to fill the fixtures in as we came out of holiday season into that January period. So there was -- from a regular price point of view, there was a significant amount of department store fill. And there was also, in the off-price channel, a significant amount of fixture fill going on there to service that channel as well as the demand for the product continue to improve. That happens once. And now, unfortunately, we're up against that as we move forward. That's the biggest issue we're dealing with. That's been factored in from the beginning of the year. I guess, now as we move into the fourth quarter, it gets more highlighted. I don't think, in any way, it puts any limit on us as we go forward into 2017. I think our growth, financially, will continue to be very strong. And I think there'll be some carryover of that into the first quarter of 2017, but I don't believe it'll have any significant impact on our overall annual results to Calvin.  There's just too much momentum going on with the brand and too much push forward of goods that I just feel that we'll just overcome that."

We think that's a big opportunity for '17 and, more importantly, for '18. So I think taking those kinds of ins and outs at, there's no reason that we shouldn't be growing Calvin and Tommy in that mid-single-digit range overall to high-single digits on a constant currency basis.

So I'm pretty optimistic about the future. But again, we're going to have to deal with where this is all heading.

We've moved that into November and December at $5 million. And clearly, that's had a positive impact on trends as well in North America. So the biggest beneficiary has been our domestic stores. But also, we've seen an improvement in our international tourist stores. And if you think about where the trends had been for the first 2 weeks in November for Calvin now to be flat, we had a very strong pre-Black Friday, post-Black Friday business, both in Calvin and Tommy compared to trends.

And I think it could be -- again, that would be really healthy margins as we go forward. And the women's opportunity, given the Calvin DNA, is even -- is significantly larger for us in Europe as we go forward. And listen, it's early in the -- with Raf Simons joining us. But Raf has been really an amazing women's designer. I think he's going to have a significant influence on Calvin overall.

And then the second modeling question was just as we look at of the gross margin into 2017, it seems like that should exit the year with pretty strong momentum, given one of us have taken on a product margin basis to get to what you delivered in third quarter and what you're guiding to in fourth quarter. Knowing that FX rolls off here, it should get stronger. I mean, that should really enter '17 from a fairly strong position as well. Am I right there?"

Mike, I guess, I would agree with you. Just in concept, I'm not going to go into specificity. But if you think about whenever you decide that the -- to project next year sales kind of growth, I think second half sales growth will be stronger than first half sales growth, mainly in the Calvin Klein North America business because of a lot of the fixture fill and new programs that went into effect this year that are anniversary-ing. But that big pop-in, particularly on those EDI core-based programs are significant and are big moneymakers for us as we go forward. I think in the first half of the year, the opportunity is greater from a gross margin point of view for the reasons you pointed out, is that not only us, but I think everyone will come out of fourth quarter in a much cleaner inventory position, just given the fact that we went into the third -- we're going into the fourth quarter with 6% less inventories and projecting overall sales growth for the business. So I think that will bode well for margins as we go forward and some of the coursing benefits that we're seeing in the first half of the year. So I think margin continues to be -- will continue to improve. And I think that will be more of a first half story, where I think sales will be more of a, a little bit more of a second half story next year when you're thinking about modeling."

But are there some areas that come on to the microscope as you guys start doing your midrange planning here? Specifically like how do you look at the U.S. store fleet? It's been a while now that they've been under pressure. It looks like the drivers that caused that pressure a few years are starting to flare up again.

On -- with the 2 big brands, Calvin and Tommy, we have no stores that our money loses in the fleet that are not marketing vehicles, like our flagship stores in New York or Miami. So absent those stores, which are critical for the brand perception, our retail businesses continue to be one of our most profitable businesses. So the challenge we're facing is -- as you rightly point out, is the business that was so strong in '13 and '14 has been under pressure, but that pressure is still double-digit EBIT margins on a fully allocated basis for our 2 big brands as we go forward. So very enhancing from a profitability point of view. I think you also rightly point out that we are starting to really lap a lot of the pressures that we saw from the U.S. dollar strengthening, where particularly, the euro and the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, being down anywhere from 15% to 30% and really having to deal with that in '14 and '15, that was really prudent. We're expecting that to subside as we go into the fourth quarter. And I think that's part of some of the improvements we're seeing in late November, early December. I'd like some more time to see that to see where we're going. And the dollar pressure so far that we've seen happening in the business is not nearly to the levels we saw before. So that needs to all work itself out. And to be honest, Mike, some of this is just so new, so recent. I mean, this -- when I was on the fourth quarter call, the euro was $1.13. And today, it's $1.6. So down 6%, 7%. It's all of a month old, so 1.5 months old. So we really have got to get our arms around a little bit more understanding what the impact of that might be as we move forward."

But I really think a bigger part of the SG&A movement is mix of business. Our European and our China and all of our international businesses come with higher overall SG&A expenses, probably to the tune of 1,000 basis points, but also come with higher gross margins for those businesses. And then, overall, when you blend it together, probably 100 basis points higher operating margins put together. So as our international business is Calvin, Tommy are growing substantially faster.

The high -- if you're a luxury brand, I think you're feeling pressure in that market. And I think China, the Hong Kong market, the surrounding areas, has been under more pressure. We -- both for Calvin and Tommy, we tend to see the net premium space. And we're benefiting from that. Tommy has had an earlier stage of development, and Calvin's been in China for a longer period of time. So Calvin -- Tommy, we believe, has significant opportunity. It's -- today, it's much more of a men's sportswear business. And we believe that there's a significant women's and denim opportunity in China for the Tommy brand. So I think we're going to continue to just see growth with the existing businesses that are in China. For Calvin, the brand is arguably one of the strongest brands in China with amazing consumer recognition and ability, and we're really taking the brand to places where it hasn't been before. It's really been a jeans, underwear play. Accessory is now becoming more and more meaningful. Sportswear, as a future opportunity, will become more and more meaningful as we go forward. And I think the women's opportunity there continues to be a significant opportunity for us. Lastly, we seem to be getting some real momentum in our performance athleisure business that we're running directly throughout Asia and in China in particular. And the trends that we've seen here in the states with that category has been -- I'll say, it's clearly maturing here. But in China, it's probably 3 or 4 years behind that trend. And that, it's just starting to get more and more explosive as a category. And I think we're well-positioned to capture that, a significant portion of that market as it happens as a fashion brand that really plays well there. So we're excited about what that might mean. So I hope that gives you enough color on China. Accessories, overall, I've always talked about it. Calvin is a lifestyle brand. It's not Kate Spade, and it's not Coach or Michael Kors that's really an accessory-driven business. So relatively speaking, we have a small accessory business, but it's growing very fast. And as you know, the accessory business carries a much higher gross margin and operating margin when it's done right. So the opportunity is there for the Calvin Klein brand. I don't think it's -- we're not going to become this big, huge accessory play globally, but we think it could continue to be a significant growth vehicle for us, given that on a relative basis, it's still a very small business."

So that's a huge opportunity at 100% gross margin rates as a royalty business, healthy royalty rate. And we're planning that business at sales minimums. So if they outperform, which they expect to, that's upside for us in second half of '17, moving into '18.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. Joining me on the call is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; and Ken Duane, who runs our North America wholesale businesses. 
Overall, our performance year-to-date and through the third quarter continues to exceed our expectations and demonstrates our ability to deliver against the 2016 plan despite the ongoing macro environment. Overall, we had a terrific quarter with revenues increasing 5% on a constant-currency basis, while EPS grew approximately 15% on a constant-currency basis. 
The momentum across our Calvin and Tommy Hilfiger international businesses continued during the quarter. Our Europe and China businesses continue to be our healthiest markets along with our North America wholesale business.
The strength has been across all channels of distribution: wholesale, retail and our digital channels. Speaking of digital, for Q3, we continue to generate revenue growth in excess of 20%, and this channel continues to be our fastest-growing distribution channel. The one challenging part of our business continued to be our U.S. retail businesses in the third quarter. We did not see an improvement in comp stores sales trends from first-half trends. Specifically, international tourist traffic and spending continued to weigh on our U.S. retail business. However, as we move into the last 2 weeks of November, we have seen a significant improvement in comp store sales across all of our U.S. retail businesses. 
Let me move on to our brands. Speaking about the Tommy Hilfiger brand, we have previously discussed with you Gigi Hadid as our global ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger women's, representing apparel, footwear, accessories and fragrance, and the reaction and brand awareness that she has helped to bring to our brand over the last few months has been terrific. This initiative reflects the brand's strategic commitment to expand our women's businesses globally.
We believe that we have a significant growth opportunity in women's, and we are encouraged by the improvements and positive momentum we are seeing globally in this fall holiday season. Financially speaking, overall revenues for Tommy increased 6% on a constant-currency basis, and EBIT was up about 12% on a constant-currency basis. 
Our revenues were driven by outstanding -- by the outstanding performance of our international business, which generate 18% constant-currency sales growth in the quarter. 
The Tommy Europe business performance was incredible. And we continue to -- it continues to highlight the strength of the brand in our largest region, and highlights the market share gains the brand continues to achieve. We continue to see very healthy performance in all major European markets in the third quarter, demonstrated by a 10% comp store sales increase in Europe for our retail business. This strong performance has continued into November along with very strong margins.
Again, we are pleased with the strong wholesale performance that we are seeing as our holiday -- as our fall holiday season to-date is up about 6%. Looking out spring, the 2017 season, which starts to shift in the fourth quarter, our spring order book is running up 8% versus the prior year, which is ahead of our previous guidance of about 7%. 
Moving to Asia. Our Tommy Asia business continues to perform well, led by our recently acquired China business as that business will be on track to be accretive to this year's earnings despite the increased marketing dollars we have put into the China market to support the long-term growth of the brand going forward.
Moving to our North America business. Tommy North America continues to see a really strong men's wholesale business, which has continued to outperform our competitors, not only in the third quarter but throughout the entire year. We have now handed off the women's business to G-III and expect to see strong growth going forward from them as our licensee. 
Shifting to retail. As I mentioned, in the third quarter, we continue to see challenging sales trends with our comps down 11% in our U.S. stores. This trend continued into the first week -- 2 weeks of November. However, we did see a significant improvement in comps in the last 2 weeks of November with overall fourth quarter comps to-date down mid-single digits.
This strong selling, which is being driven by higher AURs, coupled with our health inventory position, has the potential to generate higher-than-planned gross margins in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Calvin Klein. Overall, we continue to see great momentum within the Calvin Klein brand and our business more broadly. The brand continues to drive relevancy with strong digital advertising campaigns and by enhancing and diversifying our distribution of the brand to a number of key specialty stores in the U.S. and Europe. Over the last quarter, we continue to see our awareness levels and willingness to purchase metrics, continue to improve in all major markets. 
As an update on some product initiatives, generally speaking, our sculpted jean launch for fall has been well-received across all markets, where we have seen strong sell-throughs, higher AURs and better overall margins. Our fall launch in tailored bras was seductive comfort with lace, where we took our best-selling seductive comfort silhouette and added lace and have seen a great reception to-date around the globe. We have also expanded our size scale offering in the U.S. to exclude -- to include extended sizes up to size 40DDD. These additional size bands of 36 to 40 have the potential to represent 25% to 30% of our total U.S. bra business. This represents a significant market share opportunity for us going forward. 
For men, we introduced our Liquid Stretch product, which provided the utmost comfort in a great new innovative stretch fabric and takes advantage of the active trend that is happening in the market. 
From a financial perspective, revenues for Calvin increased 10% on a constant-currency basis, and EBIT was up 9% on a constant-currency basis. Our revenues were driven by strong top line growth out of Europe, China and North America wholesale across all classifications with continued strong gross margin performance.
Calvin Klein Europe's performance continues to show incredible improvement year-over-year, and I am quite pleased with the progress of the business and where we are headed. The wholesale business continued its strong performance with fall holiday 2016 sales up high teens. This momentum is accelerating as we move into 2017 as our spring order book now is running up over 20%.
Our European retail business continues to gain momentum with third quarter comps running up mid-teens, and this sales trends has continued into the fourth quarter. The strength of the European business is coming from all major markets and across all product categories with an acceleration in both jeans and the underwear categories. And we have also seen strong growth in some of our new product categories, particularly accessories.
Our Calvin Klein Asia business also continues to perform well with China outperforming all other markets. We continue to see strength across jeans, underwear, accessories and our newer performance athleisure business within Asia. 
Moving to North America. Our Calvin Klein North American business continued to see healthy growth across our wholesale channels in line with our plans, which reflected lower open-to-buy dollars from retailers versus the previous year. I'm pleased to report that we continue to see strength across all categories from our dress shirt business to sportswear, jeans, and certainly our underwear business, led by continued momentum in our women's intimates business.
Shifting to retail. As I commented on our Tommy Hilfiger North America retail results, we did not experience any improvement across our U.S. retail business at Calvin with overall comps down about 5% for the third quarter. This trend continued into the first 2 weeks of November. However, we have seen a significant improvement in comp store sales during the last 2 weeks of the month with fourth quarter comps to-date flat for last year.
Finally, our Heritage business. Revenues were down 8%, driven by the ongoing impact of our rationalization initiatives announced in 2015, including the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed products within dress furnishings. 
Our Heritage businesses continued to track positively against our full year 2016 financial plan with operating margins improving 90 basis points for the quarter, driven by improved wholesale performance and continued strength in our Van Heusen retail business with third quarter comps up 6%. Specifically, we continue to see solid performance across all of our Heritage businesses with the exception of our neckwear business, which has been soft for the entire year.
Looking at our outlook for the year, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the year while taking into account the impact that the strengthening U.S. dollar will have on our reported results. We are being prudent in planning the fourth quarter holiday season, which we expect will be -- remain highly competitive. We also believe that geopolitical uncertainty has intensified post the U.S. elections, which will drive macroeconomic volatility. Given this backdrop, we believe it is prudent to be conservative with our financial projections for the fourth quarter as we move out. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike to quantify our third quarter earnings and our outlook."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Third quarter revenues were up 4% versus our guidance of up 3%. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter. Cal",754,"Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. 
Third quarter revenues were up 4% versus our guidance of up 3%. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter. Calvin Klein revenues were up 10% on a constant-currency basis, ahead of guidance and driven by all regions. Calvin Klein International comps were particularly strong with a comp store increase of 7%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 6% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter, driven by strong performance in Europe, as our Europe comp store sales were up 10% and the addition of our China business as well. 
Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger U.S. wholesale businesses performed well in the quarter and exceeded plan. However, our U.S. retail businesses for these brands remain under pressure due to continued declines in our stores located in international tourist destinations. 
Heritage revenues were down 8% primarily due to the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business. 
EPS for the quarter was better than the top end of our guidance by $0.20. The beat was driven by a strong Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger performance as well as favorable taxes and interest for approximately $0.15 and a timing shift in marketing spend into the fourth quarter from the third quarter of $0.05. 
Our inventories for the quarter were very clean at the end of the third -- at the end of the quarter and were down 6% versus the prior year
We have increased our EPS guidance by $0.15 at the top end of our previous range and $0.20 at the low end of our previous range before a $0.05 negative impact from FX. For the full year 2016, we are increasing our non-GAAP earnings per share estimate to $6.70 to $6.75. If we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.65, we have earnings per share growth of 18% to 19% over the prior year.
As I mentioned, for the full year 2016, we're anticipating based on current exchange rates that will be impacted negatively by about $1.65 of earnings per share for foreign exchange, which is $0.05 worse than previous guidance. The $1.65 impact is approximately 80% driven by transaction and 20% driven by translation.
Our guidance continues to reflect the prudent view of our business for the fourth quarter as a result of global consumer spending remaining volatile and the U.S. retail market continuing to be promotional. 
Overall, we are projecting full year revenue to grow approximately 3% on a constant-currency basis. Overall operating margins are expected to increase approximately 75 basis -- on a constant-currency basis and to decrease approximately 80 basis points on an as-reported basis.
Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 8% on a constant-currency basis with operating margins to increase about 50 basis points, excluding a negative impact of 160 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 5% on a constant-currency basis with operating margins planned to increase about 110 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 220 basis points of FX. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 9% due mostly to our exiting of the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to decrease about 30 basis points.
The fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at $1.13 to $1.18 and includes $0.23 of estimated negative impact for foreign exchange. The fourth quarter will include an increase of $25 million versus the prior year in brand marketing as well as investments associated with the recent Calvin Klein creative leadership changes.
The $25 million increase includes a shift of $5 million of marketing from the third quarter into the fourth quarter versus our previous guidance. Our full year marketing spend remains flat to the previous guidance. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter is projected to increase 1% on a constant-currency basis. Negatively impacting revenue in the fourth quarter is a 2% reduction resulting from our transaction to form a joint venture in Mexico, which primarily impacts our Calvin Klein business, and licensing our Tommy Hilfiger North American's wholesale business to G-III.
Calvin Klein revenues are planned at 3% constant-currency decrease. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at a 5% constant-currency increase while Heritage revenues are planned to decrease 3%.
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

So there was -- from a regular price point of view, there was a significant amount of department store fill. And there was also, in the off-price channel, a significant amount of fixture fill going on there to service that channel as well as the demand for the product continue to improve. That happens once. And now, unfortunately, we're up against that as we move forward. That's the biggest issue we're dealing with. That's been factored in from the beginning of the year. I guess, now as we move into the fourth quarter, it gets more highlighted. I don't think, in any way, it puts any limit on us as we go forward into 2017. I think our growth, internationally, will continue to be very strong. And I think there'll be some carryover of that into the first quarter of 2017, but I don't believe it'll have any significant impact on our overall annual results for Calvin.

So I think taking those kinds of ins and outs at, there's no reason that we shouldn't be growing Calvin and Tommy in that mid-single-digit range overall to high single digits on a constant-currency basis. And our Heritage businesses, like always, we manage those business from a profitability and cash flow point of view. Those will be flattish to kind of low single-digit kind of growth, will move with North America retail. I think we've talked about 4% to 6% mid-single-digit growth overall for PVH on a constant-currency basis. We see no reason why that should change."

So I'm pretty optimistic about the future. But again, we're going to have to deal with where this is all heading.

And I think that impacted business to a degree. And it was part of the rationale that we said, let's move -- let's hold some of our marketing dollars in the third quarter and use them when we think the consumer will actually be shopping. We've moved that into November and December, that $5 million. And clearly, that's had a positive impact on trends as well in North America. So the biggest beneficiary has been our domestic stores. But also, we've seen an improvement in our international tourist stores. And if you think about where the trends had been for the first 2 weeks of November for Calvin now to be flat, we had a very strong pre-Black Friday, post-Black Friday business, both in Calvin and Tommy compared to trends. And the best part is, I think we've been really good at managing inventories and how we've really focused on that area, and we're really seeing it flow through on the gross margin line even more so than on sales line. So I think we're really well positioned in the fourth quarter. I'm really optimistic about our businesses."

But if you think about whenever you decide that the -- to project next year sales kind of growth, I think second half sales growth will be stronger than first half sales growth, mainly in the Calvin Klein North America business because of a lot of the fixture fill and new programs that went into effect this year that are anniversary-ing. But that big pop in, particularly on those EDI core-based programs were -- are significant and are big moneymakers for us as we go forward. I think in the first half of the year, the opportunity is greater from a gross margin point of view for the reasons you pointed out is that not only us, but I think everyone will come out of fourth quarter in a much cleaner inventory position just given the fact that we went into the third -- we're going into the fourth quarter with 6% less inventories and projecting overall sales growth for the business. So I think that will bode well for margins as we go forward and some of the coursing benefits that we're seeing in the first half of the year.

So absent those stores, which are critical for the brand perception, our retail businesses continue to be one of our most profitable businesses. So the challenge we're facing is -- as you rightly point out, is the business that was so strong in '13 and '14 has been under pressure, but that pressure is still double-digit EBIT margins on a fully allocated basis for our 2 big brands as we go forward. So very enhancing from a profitability point of view. I think you also rightly point out that we are starting to really lap a lot of the pressures that we saw from the U.S. dollar strengthening, where, particularly, the euro and the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, being down anywhere from 15% to 30% and really having to deal with that in '14 and '15, that was really prudent [ph]. We're expecting that to subside as we go into the fourth quarter. And I think that's part of some of the improvement we're seeing in late November, early December. I'd like some more time to see that to see where we're going. And the dollar pressure so far that we've seen happening in the business is not nearly to the levels we saw before. So that needs to all work itself out. And to be honest, Mike, some of this is just so recent. I mean, this -- when I was on the fourth quarter call, the euro was $1.13. And today, it's $1.06, so down 6%, 7%. It's all of a month old, so 1.5 months old.

It is opened doors and has expanded the brand's reach at the highest channels of distribution. That has to be good for every business as we move forward, bringing that credibility to the brand in the collection area. And the expertise that come with the team that Raf has brought in to enhance, particularly the women's business, and the opportunity there is significant. Now he's been here, I guess, now it's 3 months. His first show is February 10. We're all excited about it. The buzz has been amazing, the retailers' commitments from Bonnie's and Saks and Neiman's to the line and the ability for them to obtain the line has been great. And I think that halo effect has to be significant. Coupled with that, as he develops more innovative product, the ability to take that, diffuse that line down to our bridge and the inspiration that I'll give to our bridge businesses as well as our white label businesses in North America and in Europe, I think, also can be a significant opportunity. But we have to deliver against all that. So right know, it's great words. The momentum feels fantastic. But in fairness, Raf hasn't shown anything yet to the market. And I think as he has said to me, ""People talk too much before they deliver against what they've committed to."" And let me deliver, and then we can talk about what it'll mean.

The high -- if you're a luxury brand, I think you're feeling pressure in that market. And I think China, that Hong Kong market, the surrounding areas, has been under more pressure. We -- both for Calvin and Tommy, we tend to see the net premium space. And we're benefiting from that. Tommy is at an earlier stage of development, and Calvin's been in China for a longer period of time. So Calvin -- Tommy, we believe, has significant opportunity. It's -- today, it's much more of a men's sportswear business. And we believe that there's a significant women's and denim opportunity in China for the Tommy brand. So I think we're going to continue to just see growth with the existing businesses that are in China. For Calvin, the brand is arguably one of the strongest brands in China with amazing consumer recognition and ability, and we're really taking the brand to places where it hasn't been before. It's really been a jeans, underwear play. Accessory is now becoming more and more meaningful. Sportswear, as a future opportunity, will become more and more meaningful as we go forward. And I think the women's opportunity there continues to be a significant opportunity for us. Lastly, we seem to be getting some real momentum in our performance athleisure business that we're running directly throughout Asia and in China, in particular. And the trends that we've seen here in the states with that category has been -- I'll say, it's clearly maturing here. But in China, it's probably 3 or 4 years behind that trend in that it's just starting to get more and more explosive as a category. And I think we're well positioned to capture that -- a significant portion of that market as it happens as a fashion brand that really plays well there. So we're excited about what that might mean. So I hope that gives you enough color on China. Accessories, overall, I've always talked about it. Calvin is a lifestyle brand. It's not Kate Spade, and it's not COACH or MICHAEL KORS that's really an accessory-driven business. So relatively speaking, we have a small accessory business, but it's growing very fast. And as you know, the accessory business carries a much higher gross margin and operating margin when it's done right. So the opportunity is there for the Calvin Klein brand. I don't think it's -- we're not going to become this big, huge accessory play globally, but we think it could continue to be a significant growth vehicle for us, given that, on a relative basis, it's still a very small business."

So that's a huge opportunity at 100% gross margin rates as a royalty business, healthy royalty rate. And we're planning that business at sales minimums.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. Joining me on the call is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; and Ken Duane, who runs our North America wholesale businesses. 
Overall, our performance year-to-date and through the third quarter continues to exceed our expectations and demonstrates our ability to deliver against the 2016 plan despite the ongoing macro environment. Overall, we had a terrific quarter with revenues increasing 5% on a constant-currency basis, while EPS grew approximately 15% on a constant-currency basis. 
The momentum across our Calvin and Tommy Hilfiger international businesses continued during the quarter. Our Europe and China businesses continue to be our healthiest markets along with our North America wholesale business.
The strength has been across all channels of distribution: wholesale, retail and our digital channels. Speaking of digital, for Q3, we continue to generate revenue growth in excess of 20%, and this channel continues to be our fastest-growing distribution channel. The one challenging part of our business continued to be our U.S. retail businesses in the third quarter. We did not see an improvement in comp stores sales trends from first-half trends. Specifically, international tourist traffic and spending continued to weigh on our U.S. retail business. However, as we move into the last 2 weeks of November, we have seen a significant improvement in comp store sales across all of our U.S. retail businesses. 
Let me move on to our brands. Speaking about the Tommy Hilfiger brand, we have previously discussed with you Gigi Hadid as our global ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger women's, representing apparel, footwear, accessories and fragrance, and the reaction and brand awareness that she has helped to bring to our brand over the last few months has been terrific. This initiative reflects the brand's strategic commitment to expand our women's businesses globally.
We believe that we have a significant growth opportunity in women's, and we are encouraged by the improvements and positive momentum we are seeing globally in this fall holiday season. Financially speaking, overall revenues for Tommy increased 6% on a constant-currency basis, and EBIT was up about 12% on a constant-currency basis. 
Our revenues were driven by outstanding -- by the outstanding performance of our international business, which generate 18% constant-currency sales growth in the quarter. 
The Tommy Europe business performance was incredible. And we continue to -- it continues to highlight the strength of the brand in our largest region, and highlights the market share gains the brand continues to achieve. We continue to see very healthy performance in all major European markets in the third quarter, demonstrated by a 10% comp store sales increase in Europe for our retail business. This strong performance has continued into November along with very strong margins.
Again, we are pleased with the strong wholesale performance that we are seeing as our holiday -- as our fall holiday season to date is up about 6%. Looking out spring, the 2017 season, which starts to shift in the fourth quarter, our spring order book is running up 8% versus the prior year, which is ahead of our previous guidance of about 7%. 
Moving to Asia. Our Tommy Asia business continues to perform well, led by our recently acquired China business as that business will be on track to be accretive to this year's earnings despite the increased marketing dollars we have put into the China market to support the long-term growth of the brand going forward.
Moving to our North America business. Tommy North America continues to see a really strong men's wholesale business, which has continued to outperform our competitors, not only in the third quarter but throughout the entire year. We have now handed off the women's business to G-III and expect to see strong growth going forward from them as our licensee. 
Shifting to retail. As I mentioned, in the third quarter, we continue to see challenging sales trends with our comps down 11% in our U.S. stores. This trend continued into the first week -- 2 weeks of November. However, we did see a significant improvement in comps in the last 2 weeks of November with overall fourth quarter comps to-date down mid-single digits.
This strong selling, which is being driven by higher AURs, coupled with our health inventory position, has the potential to generate higher-than-planned gross margins in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Calvin Klein. Overall, we continue to see great momentum within the Calvin Klein brand and our business more broadly. The brand continues to drive relevancy with strong digital advertising campaigns and by enhancing and diversifying our distribution of the brand to a number of key specialty stores in the U.S. and Europe. Over the last quarter, we continue to see our awareness levels and willingness to purchase metrics, continue to improve in all major markets. 
As an update on some product initiatives, generally speaking, our sculpted jean launch for fall has been well-received across all markets, where we have seen strong sell-throughs, higher AURs and better overall margins. Our fall launch in tailored bras was seductive comfort with lace, where we took our best-selling seductive comfort silhouette and added lace and have seen a great reception to-date around the globe. We have also expanded our size scale offering in the U.S. to exclude -- to include extended sizes up to size 40DDD. These additional size bands of 36 to 40 have the potential to represent 25% to 30% of our total U.S. bra business. This represents a significant market share opportunity for us going forward. 
For men, we introduced our Liquid Stretch product, which provided the utmost comfort in a great new innovative stretch fabric and takes advantage of the active trend that is happening in the market. 
From a financial perspective, revenues for Calvin increased 10% on a constant-currency basis, and EBIT was up 9% on a constant-currency basis. Our revenues were driven by strong top line growth out of Europe, China and North America wholesale across all classifications with continued strong gross margin performance.
Calvin Klein Europe's performance continues to show incredible improvement year-over-year, and I am quite pleased with the progress of the business and where we are headed. The wholesale business continued its strong performance with fall holiday 2016 sales up high teens. This momentum is accelerating as we move into 2017 as our spring order book now is running up over 20%.
Our European retail business continues to gain momentum with third quarter comps running up mid-teens, and this sales trends has continued into the fourth quarter. The strength of the European business is coming from all major markets and across all product categories with an acceleration in both jeans and the underwear categories. And we have also seen strong growth in some of our new product categories, particularly accessories.
Our Calvin Klein Asia business also continues to perform well with China outperforming all other markets. We continue to see strength across jeans, underwear, accessories and our newer performance athleisure business within Asia. 
Moving to North America. Our Calvin Klein North American business continued to see healthy growth across our wholesale channels in line with our plans, which reflected lower open-to-buy dollars from retailers versus the previous year. I'm pleased to report that we continue to see strength across all categories from our dress shirt business to sportswear, jeans, and certainly our underwear business, led by continued momentum in our women's intimates business.
Shifting to retail. As I commented on our Tommy Hilfiger North America retail results, we did not experience any improvement across our U.S. retail business at Calvin with overall comps down about 5% for the third quarter. This trend continued into the first 2 weeks of November. However, we have seen a significant improvement in comp store sales during the last 2 weeks of the month with fourth quarter comps to-date flat for last year.
Finally, our Heritage business. Revenues were down 8%, driven by the ongoing impact of our rationalization initiatives announced in 2015, including the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed products within dress furnishings. 
Our Heritage businesses continued to track positively against our full year 2016 financial plan with operating margins improving 90 basis points for the quarter, driven by improved wholesale performance and continued strength in our Van Heusen retail business with third quarter comps up 6%. Specifically, we continue to see solid performance across all of our Heritage businesses with the exception of our neckwear business, which has been soft for the entire year.
Looking at our outlook for the year, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the year while taking into account the impact that the strengthening U.S. dollar will have on our reported results. We are being prudent in planning the fourth quarter holiday season, which we expect will be -- remain highly competitive. We also believe that geopolitical uncertainty has intensified post the U.S. elections, which will drive macroeconomic volatility. Given this backdrop, we believe it is prudent to be conservative with our financial projections for the fourth quarter as we move out. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike to quantify our third quarter earnings and our outlook."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Third quarter revenues were up 4% versus our guidance of up 3%. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter. Cal",754,"Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. 
Third quarter revenues were up 4% versus our guidance of up 3%. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter. Calvin Klein revenues were up 10% on a constant-currency basis, ahead of guidance and driven by all regions. Calvin Klein International comps were particularly strong with a comp store increase of 7%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 6% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter, driven by strong performance in Europe, as our Europe comp store sales were up 10% and the addition of our China business as well. 
Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger U.S. wholesale businesses performed well in the quarter and exceeded plan. However, our U.S. retail businesses for these brands remain under pressure due to continued declines in our stores located in international tourist destinations. 
Heritage revenues were down 8% primarily due to the exit of the IZOD retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business. 
EPS for the quarter was better than the top end of our guidance by $0.20. The beat was driven by a strong Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger performance as well as favorable taxes and interest for approximately $0.15 and a timing shift in marketing spend into the fourth quarter from the third quarter of $0.05. 
Our inventories for the quarter were very clean at the end of the third -- at the end of the quarter and were down 6% versus the prior year
We have increased our EPS guidance by $0.15 at the top end of our previous range and $0.20 at the low end of our previous range before a $0.05 negative impact from FX. For the full year 2016, we are increasing our non-GAAP earnings per share estimate to $6.70 to $6.75. If we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.65, we have earnings per share growth of 18% to 19% over the prior year.
As I mentioned, for the full year 2016, we're anticipating based on current exchange rates that will be impacted negatively by about $1.65 of earnings per share for foreign exchange, which is $0.05 worse than previous guidance. The $1.65 impact is approximately 80% driven by transaction and 20% driven by translation.
Our guidance continues to reflect the prudent view of our business for the fourth quarter as a result of global consumer spending remaining volatile and the U.S. retail market continuing to be promotional. 
Overall, we are projecting full year revenue to grow approximately 3% on a constant-currency basis. Overall operating margins are expected to increase approximately 75 basis -- on a constant-currency basis and to decrease approximately 80 basis points on an as-reported basis.
Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 8% on a constant-currency basis with operating margins to increase about 50 basis points, excluding a negative impact of 160 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 5% on a constant-currency basis with operating margins planned to increase about 110 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 220 basis points of FX. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 9% due mostly to our exiting of the IZOD retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to decrease about 30 basis points.
The fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at $1.13 to $1.18 and includes $0.23 of estimated negative impact for foreign exchange. The fourth quarter will include an increase of $25 million versus the prior year in brand marketing as well as investments associated with the recent Calvin Klein creative leadership changes.
The $25 million increase includes a shift of $5 million of marketing from the third quarter into the fourth quarter versus our previous guidance. Our full year marketing spend remains flat to the previous guidance. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter is projected to increase 1% on a constant-currency basis. Negatively impacting revenue in the fourth quarter is a 2% reduction resulting from our transaction to form a joint venture in Mexico, which primarily impacts our Calvin Klein business, and licensing our Tommy Hilfiger North American's wholesale business to G-III.

So there was -- from a regular price point of view, there was a significant amount of department store fill. And there was also, in the off-price channel, a significant amount of fixture fill going on there to service that channel as well as the demand for the product continue to improve. That happens once. And now, unfortunately, we're up against that as we move forward. That's the biggest issue we're dealing with. That's been factored in from the beginning of the year. I guess, now as we move into the fourth quarter, it gets more highlighted. I don't think, in any way, it puts any limit on us as we go forward into 2017. I think our growth, internationally, will continue to be very strong. And I think there'll be some carryover of that into the first quarter of 2017, but I don't believe it'll have any significant impact on our overall annual results for Calvin.

And I think that impacted business to a degree. And it was part of the rationale that we said, let's move -- let's hold some of our marketing dollars in the third quarter and use them when we think the consumer will actually be shopping. We've moved that into November and December, that $5 million. And clearly, that's had a positive impact on trends as well in North America. So the biggest beneficiary has been our domestic stores. But also, we've seen an improvement in our international tourist stores. And if you think about where the trends had been for the first 2 weeks of November for Calvin now to be flat, we had a very strong pre-Black Friday, post-Black Friday business, both in Calvin and Tommy compared to trends. And the best part is, I think we've been really good at managing inventories and how we've really focused on that area, and we're really seeing it flow through on the gross margin line even more so than on sales line.

But if you think about whenever you decide that the -- to project next year sales kind of growth, I think second half sales growth will be stronger than first half sales growth, mainly in the Calvin Klein North America business because of a lot of the fixture fill and new programs that went into effect this year that are anniversary-ing. But that big pop in, particularly on those EDI core-based programs were -- are significant and are big moneymakers for us as we go forward. I think in the first half of the year, the opportunity is greater from a gross margin point of view for the reasons you pointed out is that not only us, but I think everyone will come out of fourth quarter in a much cleaner inventory position just given the fact that we went into the third -- we're going into the fourth quarter with 6% less inventories and projecting overall sales growth for the business. So I think that will bode well for margins as we go forward and some of the coursing benefits that we're seeing in the first half of the year.

So absent those stores, which are critical for the brand perception, our retail businesses continue to be one of our most profitable businesses. So the challenge we're facing is -- as you rightly point out, is the business that was so strong in '13 and '14 has been under pressure, but that pressure is still double-digit EBIT margins on a fully allocated basis for our 2 big brands as we go forward. So very enhancing from a profitability point of view. I think you also rightly point out that we are starting to really lap a lot of the pressures that we saw from the U.S. dollar strengthening, where, particularly, the euro and the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, being down anywhere from 15% to 30% and really having to deal with that in '14 and '15, that was really prudent [ph]. We're expecting that to subside as we go into the fourth quarter. And I think that's part of some of the improvement we're seeing in late November, early December. I'd like some more time to see that to see where we're going. And the dollar pressure so far that we've seen happening in the business is not nearly to the levels we saw before. So that needs to all work itself out. And to be honest, Mike, some of this is just so recent. I mean, this -- when I was on the fourth quarter call, the euro was $1.13. And today, it's $1.06, so down 6%, 7%. It's all of a month old, so 1.5 months old.

But our U.K. business post-Brexit has never been stronger. And I think that's a reflection of the fact that the euro strengthened against the British pound. Obviously, the dollar strengthened as well. And I think people are just, viewing that, this is a great place to shop and really get value for their dollars or their euros. And that business has just been off the charts strong. So I think as much as we're seeing negative impact in the U.S. on our own retail stores, the flip side of that is we've really benefited in our European stores overall."

And there might be -- and in the first half, there'll be some additional spend on top of that as we anniversary this spend. And we also have a full-year impact of the creative direction that's going on -- the change in creative direction that's going on in Calvin Klein. But I really think a bigger part of the SG&A movement is mix of business. Our European and our China and all of our international businesses come with higher overall SG&A expenses, probably to the tune of 1,000 basis points but also come with higher gross margins for those businesses. And then, overall, when you blend it together, probably 100 basis points higher operating margins put together. So as our international business is Calvin, Tommy are growing substantially faster than our North American domestic business. That makes a business -- and SG&A growth is going to continue. And I think you just have to keep your eye on a constant-currency basis on operating margins overall. So that's a significant piece of what's happening."

It is opened doors and has expanded the brand's reach at the highest channels of distribution. That has to be good for every business as we move forward, bringing that credibility to the brand in the collection area.

Now he's been here, I guess, now it's 3 months. His first show is February 10. We're all excited about it. The buzz has been amazing, the retailers' commitments from Bonnie's and Saks and Neiman's to the line and the ability for them to obtain the line has been great. And I think that halo effect has to be significant. Coupled with that, as he develops more innovative product, the ability to take that, diffuse that line down to our bridge and the inspiration that I'll give to our bridge businesses as well as our white label businesses in North America and in Europe, I think, also can be a significant opportunity. But we have to deliver against all that. So right know, it's great words. The momentum feels fantastic. But in fairness, Raf hasn't shown anything yet to the market.

The high -- if you're a luxury brand, I think you're feeling pressure in that market. And I think China, that Hong Kong market, the surrounding areas, has been under more pressure. We -- both for Calvin and Tommy, we tend to see the net premium space. And we're benefiting from that. Tommy is at an earlier stage of development, and Calvin's been in China for a longer period of time. So Calvin -- Tommy, we believe, has significant opportunity. It's -- today, it's much more of a men's sportswear business. And we believe that there's a significant women's and denim opportunity in China for the Tommy brand. So I think we're going to continue to just see growth with the existing businesses that are in China. For Calvin, the brand is arguably one of the strongest brands in China with amazing consumer recognition and ability, and we're really taking the brand to places where it hasn't been before. It's really been a jeans, underwear play. Accessory is now becoming more and more meaningful. Sportswear, as a future opportunity, will become more and more meaningful as we go forward. And I think the women's opportunity there continues to be a significant opportunity for us. Lastly, we seem to be getting some real momentum in our performance athleisure business that we're running directly throughout Asia and in China, in particular. And the trends that we've seen here in the states with that category has been -- I'll say, it's clearly maturing here. But in China, it's probably 3 or 4 years behind that trend in that it's just starting to get more and more explosive as a category. And I think we're well positioned to capture that -- a significant portion of that market as it happens as a fashion brand that really plays well there. So we're excited about what that might mean. So I hope that gives you enough color on China. Accessories, overall, I've always talked about it. Calvin is a lifestyle brand. It's not Kate Spade, and it's not COACH or MICHAEL KORS that's really an accessory-driven business. So relatively speaking, we have a small accessory business, but it's growing very fast. And as you know, the accessory business carries a much higher gross margin and operating margin when it's done right. So the opportunity is there for the Calvin Klein brand. I don't think it's -- we're not going to become this big, huge accessory play globally, but we think it could continue to be a significant growth vehicle for us, given that, on a relative basis, it's still a very small business."

So that's a huge opportunity at 100% gross margin rates as a royalty business, healthy royalty rate. And we're planning that business at sales minimums.
