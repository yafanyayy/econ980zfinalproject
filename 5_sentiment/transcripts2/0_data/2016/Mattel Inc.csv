Let me add my thanks for all of you joining us today. To get things started, I'd like to provide some perspective on the fourth quarter, and importantly, on the progress that we're making against our transform",1078,"Thanks, Martin, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me add my thanks for all of you joining us today. To get things started, I'd like to provide some perspective on the fourth quarter, and importantly, on the progress that we're making against our transformation. And following this, Richard and Kevin will provide additional details on the quarter as well as our outlook and what's ahead. And as Martin indicated, at the end, we'll leave time for your questions. 
So let me begin by saying that our fourth quarter performance and our full year results were encouraging and they reflect some significant and continuing progress from where we stand a year ago when we first began to execute against our 6 [ph] strategic priorities and our cultural transformation. Gross sales for the quarter greatly improved, and excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased by 3%. Gratifying to me, for the full year, we achieved our goal of stabilizing the business with a gross sales increase of 1% in constant currency.
Importantly, as an underpinning to this, we also succeeded in revitalizing some of our critical core brands. We executed very well at retail, as evidenced by both POS and shipping trends. Mattel's global POS was positive in the quarter, up 3%, and we ended the full year up in both North America and in international. Majority of our core brands also ended the year with positive POS, while demonstrating some very solid momentum in the fourth quarter. We're particularly pleased with Barbie POS, which despite a very competitive category, ended the year with a high note with the fourth quarter results of protecting continuing double-digit growth in North America and positive numbers in international. As expected, we also began to see overall shipping in POS trends converge with sales in POS both up by 3% in the quarter. The same held true for Barbie, up 8% and 9%, respectively. Our improved brand and commercial alignment also resulted in better retail inventories as we ended the year. So overall, we're very encouraged by our POS and shipping momentum and we continue to point the progress in North America as a good leading indicator of future performance globally. 
Now also fueling growth were our investments in emerging markets, with China sales up by 34% in the quarter in constant currency and up 43% for the year. Despite all the challenges in Russia, we saw our business grow there by 22% in 2015. 
Turning to our financials. We're also pleased with our results as many of our cost initiatives have started to kick in. We continue to manage the middle of the P&L quite well, which enabled us to offset some significant foreign exchange headwinds and provided resources to invest in growing the business. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, our gross margin for the year was 50.2%, which is in line with our long-term objective. And our adjusted SG&A was down almost $70 million versus last year. This, even as we funded an increased level of incentive compensation. Our key here was the fact that we beat our 2015 cost savings goal by about $30 million and we continue to be on track to deliver at the high end of our 2-year savings target of $250 million to $300 million. The financial discipline is also reflected in our strong balance sheet, where we exceeded our year-end cash objective, while continuing to maintain our dividend. 
So exiting 2015, as I said upfront, we're encouraged. We feel good about stabilizing the business and also about executing well on our turnaround. As we move forward and as you all know, we still face many challenges, including the impact of the loss of Disney Princess, continued declines in Monster High, some recent softness in American Girl and continued foreign exchange headwinds. But fortunately, Mattel has many strengths to work with. We also have the right strategies in place to execute well and to perform. We continue to believe that we can fill a portion of the Disney Princess gap and also offset continued softness with Monster High. Our goal remains to hold things relatively flat at the top line in constant currency in this year of transition. 
Support invest on our core brands, we exited the year with great momentum in Barbie, Fisher-Price, Hot Wheels and Thomas and we expect this to continue. We also have a number of initiatives to support Monster High in 2016 and we'll certainly be leveraging our newly-announced content partnership with American Girl Amazon Studios as another catalyst to improved performance. Initially, our Toy Box unit has a much stronger licensed entertainment late in 2016 led by Warner Bros. and the D.C. comic universe as well as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles license with MEGA Brands. And finally, we expect continued good growth from our investments in emerging markets. 
Now while we drive hard to hold the top line, we'll also continue to be very aggressive in reducing cost. Here, we expect to maintain our gross margin through ongoing improvements in our global supply chain, while at the same time, dropping more of our cost savings in SG&A for the bottom line. We'll also remain disciplined with our balance sheet as we continue to fund the turnaround and support the dividend. I said 2016 will have its challenges, particularly on the top line. But we do expect to make additional good progress on all fronts, continuing our cultural transformation, while also execute against our key priorities. As we do so, we see a clear path to restoring real growth and momentum as we move to 2017. Momentum on our core brands, expansion of our MEGA construction business, rapid emerging market expansion and a much stronger licensed entertainment slate with our multi-year program with Warner Bros, our newly-renewed Disney Car's license with its 2017 theatrical release and Toy Story 4, which is slated for 2018 all set us up very well as we look ahead. We'll expand much more on this when we see many of you on our 2016 Toy Fair in a couple of weeks. 
Let me just wrap up here by saying that clearly, I'm pleased with the progress to date, encouraged with the momentum we have going into 2016. I'm quite excited about our prospects to grow this business in 2017 and beyond. With that, let me now introduce Richard, who will go on a little more detail in our 2015 performance and our outlook for 2016. Richard?"
31197,321985855,924281,"Mattel, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Mattel, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. You can see that a remarkable transformation is well underway at Mattel, a transformation that goes far beyond our performance in fourth quarter and includes the ongoing revitalization of our core brands, the rebuilding of relationships",1939,"Thank you, Chris. You can see that a remarkable transformation is well underway at Mattel, a transformation that goes far beyond our performance in fourth quarter and includes the ongoing revitalization of our core brands, the rebuilding of relationships with strategic license partners, accelerated growth in emerging markets and a much more effective presence at retail. Today, I'll highlight some key aspects of our progress. I'll address our challenges for 2016 and share our optimistic views of our future. I'm also going to look forward to continuing this conversation in much more detail at Toy Fair in just a few weeks, where we will have much more news to share. 
On our last quarter's call, I noted that our POS continue to outpace shipping, creating a major opportunity to increase sales going forward. And we see that opportunity, thanks to a vastly improved brand management programming, a better aligned and higher performing commercial organization and new marketing, which is beginning to make strong connections with our consumers. The result was a very solid fourth quarter. Global POS increased by 3% and built momentum during the holiday season in both the domestic and international markets. We also vastly improved the alignment of global POS with shipping with fourth quarter shipping up 3%, excluding foreign exchange. In addition, as Chris noted, we saw overall shipping in constant currency as POS trends converge for a number of our core brands. Barbie global POS was up high single digits in the fourth quarter, aligned with global shipping up 8%. The brand continue to see double-digit POS performance in the U.S., which, combined with positive international POS, positions the brand for 2016 with solid momentum. Despite the very competitive North America down market in 2015, exciting new brand initiatives proved effective with consumers and sales we're up 24% in North America. Going forward, expect us to leverage these successes and build on the Barbie brand momentum. We have a growing pipeline of exciting innovations that we are confident will make the brand even more relevant and engaging in 2016. The latest example: A groundbreaking new line extension from Barbie Fashionistas that makes the brand even more reflective of the world kids see and experience today. Never has Barbie been more diverse on so many dimensions and more celebrated. Time Magazine's cover story and associated buzz last week are great examples that underscore not only how powerfully relevant the Barbie brand is, but reinforce that we are on the right track. It's this kind of brand leadership that is changing the cultural conversation in ways that only Barbie can, and we couldn't be more pleased. 
Fisher-Price showed comparable POS gains for the quarter, up high single digit and aligned with shipping. These increases were in both North America and international markets with notably strong results in the Fisher-Price core business, setting the stage for continued success in 2016. Thomas, leveraging interest in the brand's 70th [ph] anniversary, continue to grow in new markets and maintain strong momentum throughout the holiday period. We continue to make progress with Fisher-Price, providing innovative new products and solutions for today's mom, improving its messaging to once again become the industry leader in early childhood development and improving its price value proposition and global markets. 
We've called Hot Wheels our sleeping giant, and in 2015, we began to unlock more of the brand's potential. The result, one of Hot Wheels' strongest years ever with positive double-digit POS and shipping in both the quarter and for the year, strength in the core vehicle and track set business was complemented by successful execution of the brand Star Wars license, which also demonstrated the versatility of the brand to incorporate a wide range of IP. We intend to capture much more of Hot Wheels' untapped potential going forward, building it out as another exciting platform for more purposeful play. 
Now, while we had great success with most of our core brands this holiday, Monster High and American Girl, as Chris indicated, are challenging works in progress. While we work to evolve Monster High into an Evergreen property, the brand continue to struggle during the quarter. The executional challenges, excess retail inventory we faced coming into 2015, combined with increased competitive product launches, impacted shelf space and performance, While we did see some success with bold new executions, introducing new scales and form factors, they just couldn't overcome the headwinds. That said, Monster High remained a top 5 doll property globally. And with about $330 [ph] million in gross sales, consumer engagement with the brand remains strong. And while we have lots of work to do, we are determined to find opportunity with a new generation of consumers as we work' to solidify the brand's base in 2016. 
American Girl was a disappointment this holiday season. Our efforts to re-energize the foundation of the American Girl brand BeForever were successful, but our Girl of the Year and our Truly Me relaunch did not drive the expected direct and retail traffic. As we take steps to revitalize this brand, we recognize there are some price value issues that need to be addressed. We also need to improve distribution and expand consumer engagement. You could see evidence that these initiatives are underway and our recent multi-year deal with Amazon Studios to develop live action specials and episodic content based on the American Girl characters with the first special to be released this year. 
Beyond our core brands, we also saw healthy momentum from MEGA< where fourth quarter gross sales were up 11%, led by international expansion, which saw a 40% [ph] increase in gross sales in the quarter. We've repeatedly mentioned how we are transforming Mattel's culture with a focus on innovation, speed and accountability. The embrace of innovation has been particularly strong and as evidenced in both our day-to-day perspective and breakthrough new products, several of which drove valuable buzz and traffic for us in the quarter. The New York Times said, Hello Barbie is leading a new generation of AI toys, and it was certainly one of the most talked-about toys in 2015. Both Hello Barbie and the relaunched View-Master using Google virtual reality technology where well received in the market. These innovative creations also demonstrated both inside and outside Mattel, a new willingness and the ability to invent big, partnered effectively with Silicon Valley and get to market fast. In addition to building on the technology platforms in 2016, we will also begin to activate our relationship with Autodesk and you will see an exciting new statement at Toy Fair. To enhance our new perspective on innovation and technology, we have recently acquired new capabilities and brands to accelerate our competitiveness. [indiscernible] a smart technology company that recently became part of the Mattel family of companies, provides us with a new product offering and technology platform and we just closed the deal to acquire assets of Fuhu, giving us both proven technology and access to their extremely talented people. Unique technology and expertise from both of these companies will be part of our initiatives to build out digital platforms, increase our consumer engagement and develop a new generation of digital toys. 
Another area where innovation is proving transformative is our content strategy, reflected in several DVDs' successfully releases, stronger media engagement and exclusive content via Netflix and YouTube Kids. A critical step in our new focus on content was to bring a proven talent in the field to lead our consolidated content creator and distribution capabilities, which we did in the quarter. And we continue to strengthen our content pipeline and resources. In addition to the new Amazon studio partnership with American Girl, we recently signed new content deals with 9 Story to relaunched the iconic brands Barney and Friends and Angelina Ballerina. We also announced a new partnership with DHX to jointly develop and distribute Bob the Builder, Fireman Sam, Little People and Polly pocket content across multiple platforms. 
In the important area of entertainment licensing, Mattel is proud to partner with some of the most iconic licenses in the market. We did a great job executing the last holiday season of our Disney Princess license. Not surprisingly, sales were down in the quarter as Frozen POS continue to soften, but gross sales for the full year were about $415 [ph] million. As we have all known for some time, the end of this license creates significant challenges for us in 2016, but we have a number of important initiative coming online to fill this gap. A growing pipeline of Disney licenses is evidence that our relationship with Disney is strengthening. Not only can we point to the significant results generated by innovative and popular Star Wars products from Hot Wheels, we are pleased to have been awarded the license for Toy Story 4, a major new and a beloved global franchise to be released in 2018. Equally exciting was last week's announcement that we have been awarded the coveted Cars 3 license, with this major feature film scheduled for a global release in 2017. The Cars franchise is one of the most successful in Pixar history and a very successful one for us year-to-year. Our Car's license has had shelf presence since its inception in 2006 and with the potential to deliver $315 million of incremental gross sales in a movie year, we are looking forward to our best Cars years ever in 2017. 
Another long-standing partnership enjoying resurgence is Warner Bros. We are already shipping product in support of the upcoming Batman Versus Superman, Dawn of Justice movie coming in March, and we look forward to partnering with Warner Bros. and their exciting new multi-year plan to build out their D.C. license comics universe. We are already  an important part of the D.C. super hero growth launch with product launches later this year. Licensing is a strategic importance to our transformation of our business overall. And as we continue to deepen our partnership and build our entertainment licensing capabilities, you will see much more from us in this area. 
I mentioned our determination to strategically align powerful brand positioning, improve trade promotions and create more motivated marketing to drive retail performance. Retail execution is an area where we have underperformed in the past, but we had a strategic course corrections of 2015 are proving to be very effective in market. In Q4, we demonstrated a marked improvement in the effectiveness of our global retail execution with an enhanced presence during Black Friday and Cyber Monday that drove momentum throughout the holiday season. The bottom line, we grew our business with all of our top U.S. brick-and-mortar customers in Q4 by demonstrating our commitment to work with them, to deliver what they need to be successful and to end the year relatively clean at retail. We also grew our overall e-com business and will continue to build on the strong momentum and gain back shelf space, be it real or virtual in 2016. 
Like Chris, I am very pleased with the company's performance does last holiday season and proud of the progress made throughout 2015 to stabilize the business and reset Mattel's culture. And while there is much yet to do, we have already initiated plans to offset the challenges inherent in 2016. Even more importantly, our progress to date has generated strong momentum to build on, positioning us for growth and greater profitability in 2017 and beyond. I look forward to sharing our newest creations with many of you in Toy Fair in just a few weeks. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin?"
31197,321985855,924281,"Mattel, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Mattel, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone. Echoing what Chris and Richard said, I'm also very pleased with the progress we made in 2015. Despite significant challenges and through tremendous efforts across the organization, we achieved our full yea",2069,"Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone. Echoing what Chris and Richard said, I'm also very pleased with the progress we made in 2015. Despite significant challenges and through tremendous efforts across the organization, we achieved our full year financial outlook, which included a stabilization of net revenues in constant currency, gross margins of about 50%, [ph] a decline in adjusted SG&A in absolute dollars, and year-end cash of $800 million to $1 billion. We continue to be disciplined in our management of the P&L, with a large part of our success due to our cost savings efforts. For the full year, we over-delivered against our 2015 target with total gross savings of $153 million as well as nice leverage on our advertising spend in the fourth quarter. 
Today, I want to quickly highlight our 2015 performance metrics and then focus on our expectations for 2016. As a reminder, I'll be discussing our top line results in constant currency. In addition, I'll be referring to adjusted financial measures that exclude certain items related to our acquisition of MEGA as well as severance expense, unless otherwise noted, to derive better visibility into the underlying business performance as we continue to execute the turnaround. 
So as it relates to our 2015 performance, we achieved our objectives to stabilize net revenue was with full year sales of $5.7 billion, up 2% in constant currency. This included growth of 7% in the fourth quarter as we began to see the expected inflection of shipping and POS for our key core brands. However, the foreign exchange headwind was less slightly in the quarter, but was still significant, reducing net revenues by about $140 million or about $400 million for the full year. This was at the high end of our 5% to 7% outlook that we provided last quarter. 
Looking at the results regionally, Asia-Pacific remained our strongest growth market for the quarter and full year. China led the region, where increased investments are continuing to pay off in addition to solid growth in Australia. As you heard from both Chris and Richard, our North American region had a good quarter, where we made great strides in commercial execution and saw a tangible improvement in both POS and shipping. We also saw a continued strong growth in Russia, but this was offset by softness in Western Europe. As we work hard to mitigate volatility in Latin America, driven by good performances in Mexico as well as other small markets, these results were offset by a sharp declines in Brazil against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop and a more competitive toy market. 
Looking beyond the top line to our other key P&L drivers, sales adjustments were down in both nominal dollars and as a percentage of sales in the quarter. Sales adjustments for the quarter were more closely aligned with our long-term averages for the full year. We attribute much of the increase in better aligned retail promotional programs that were in place throughout the year, which contributed to strong holiday POS trends and less than expected in season discounting to drive POS. 
With respect to retail inventories, you know we entered the holiday season relatively clean around the world and are exiting in a similar position, including a roughly 10% decline in the U.S. International retail inventories were roughly flat with increases in growing markets like China and Russia, offset by declines in most mature markets. And while retail inventories are somewhat elevated in Brazil, I'm happy to note that overall international inventories are the cleanest they've been in the last 3 years. 
We also saw very strong results with our funding our future cost savings program, which exceeded our expectations for 2015. Specifically, we delivered $60 million of gross savings in the quarter and $153 million for the year. these savings was roughly split evenly between gross margin and SG&A and other. These savings were important element of delivering found that result in full year gross margins of 49.2%. While consistent with our long-term objective of about [ph] 50%, the negative impact of foreign exchange was bigger than anticipated, including roughly 200 basis points for the quarter and about 100 basis points for the full year. This was largely due to further strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble. 
Our advertising was lower in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter. As you know, we increased advertising spending throughout the year to support our core brands, which helped continued to generate a nice lift in POS and drove a stronger shipping in the holiday season. For both the quarter and the year, foreign exchange was also a factor in nominal levels of spend since international media buys were cheaper in U.S. dollars. 
SG&A was also down versus the prior year in absolute dollars on both a reported basis and adjusted basis as we aggressively reduced overhead cost, while balancing strategic investments. Similar to advertising, the stronger dollar led to favorability in nominal SG&A due to lower operational cost overseas. Decline in adjusted SG&A up $69 million for the full year is below the outlook of $80 million to $95 million we provided last quarter, which is due to higher incentive expense of $50 [ph] million versus $25 million in 2004 percent sales, and it's even stronger than we expected in the fourth quarter as POS accelerated. And given that we are paying for performance company, we rewarded our people for delivering on the turnaround in 2015 consistent with the incentive plan goals established at the beginning of the year. It's worth noting, while the $50 million of incentive compensation and the full year is higher than we expected heading into the quarter, it remains below our targeted payout level of $80 million to $90 million. 
Our tax rate for the full year was 20.4%, including discrete tax items, which was consistent with our tax rate outlook of 20% to 21% that we gave you in April. Adjusted EPS, including discrete tax items for the quarter, was $0.67 and $1.31 for the year compared to the prior year of $0.49 and $1.71, respectively. Currency had a negative impact of $0.18 per share in the quarter and $0.41 per share for the year. Similar to negative impact on sales and gross margin, this is higher than expected as the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen against key currencies in the quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the year with $893 million in cash. The strong cash generation was achieved primarily through tightly managing working capital. Not surprisingly, receivables were up, with improving sales and the fact that sales came later in the quarter, which will collect in the first quarter of 2016. And owned inventory was up slightly as we position the business for improving POS trends heading into 2016. And importantly, our current level of owned inventory is also a better quality than the last couple of years since we achieved our fourth quarter sales objective in 2015. We also continued our efforts around extending key vendor terms to match industry norms as well as emphasizing more greater overall discipline in Accounts Payable management. And we continue to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and protecting the dividend. As we've said, dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business and the Board declared a first quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
Moving to our 2016 outlook, we'll provide greater detail on the key top line the P&L drivers at Toy Fair. But based upon our 2015 results, I want to provide some context for how we see 2016 shaping up. As Chris and Richard said, we believe that we could fill a significant portion of the Disney Princess revenue gap and offset continued softness in Monster High and AG. The goal is to hold top line relatively flat in constant currency, but we do expect a more challenging first half of the year, primarily due to Disney Princess comps, with improving trends in the second half as the number of our incremental revenue initiatives like D.C. Super Hero Girls begin to accelerate. Specifically in the first quarter, we expect sales to be down slightly in constant currency and more so as reported due to forward exchange headwinds. Continued momentum in core brands and a limited slate of new product launches may not fully offset the loss of Disney Princess in the first quarter, which represents about 10% of our total gross sales in the prior period. We expect the Disney Princess headwind to moderate in the second half of the year due to the seasonality of our business. 
We also expect the continued unfavorable ForEx impact for the year. We estimate that currency will impact net revenues by approximately 2% to 4% and adjusted EPS by $0.30 to $0.40 per share. The EPS impact is primarily due to continued volatility in key currencies, particularly in Europe and our growing emerging markets like Mexico, Brazil and Russia as well as more challenging hedging economics for the euro in 2016 versus 2015. 
Consistent with our long-term objective, we expect to again be at about [ph] 50% margins for gross margins. Our cost savings initiatives and favorable commodity trends should help offset significant labor inflation, foreign exchange headwinds, mix and ongoing efforts to sharpen our price value propositions and support of the turnaround. For advertising, we're looking to move somewhat closer to the midpoint of the range on our 11% to 13% long-term objective that we achieved in 2015. And we'll also remain very disciplined on SG&A. We are targeting adjusted SG&A to be down $55 million to $65 million versus 2015 adjusted SG&A. Funding Our future cost-saving initiatives plus incremental saving opportunities will be partially offset by investments to grow the business, modest inflation and employee cost and increased incentive expense. It's worth noting that as SG&A as reported should be down even more. This is due to reduced MEGA integration and amortization expenses as well as lower incentive and restructuring expenses, which should be excluded from adjusted SG&A. 
As it relates to Funding Our Future program, having exceeded our first year objective, we continue to expect to deliver cost savings at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range by the end of 2016. We've also identified incremental cost savings opportunities in both gross margin and SG&A that we are actively pursuing. And finally, assuming no changes to current tax loss, we expect our tax rate to be around 21% for 2016 and beyond, including discrete tax items. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow outlook. We will continue to manage working capital tightly. We expect CapEx of $270 million to $280 million driven by investments in our global supply chain to support expansion of our die cast car capacity, automation and other cost-savings initiatives. And currently, we fully expect to generate the cash flow in 2016 and beyond to invest in our business and fund the dividends while targeting $800 million to $1 billion in year-end cash. That said, our Board has final decision on dividend and it with use the dividend and a quarterly basis. 
Looking beyond 2016 and into 2017, we have greater confidence that we can achieve meaningful operating leverage through a combination of continued momentum in core brands, both domestically and in key international markets, a strong revenue tailwind from the theatrical release of Cars 3 in 2017, a return to more normal levels of P&L investments in sales adjustments in advertising and line of sight into additional cost savings programs above and beyond our current programs. 
In closing, we told you last year that our challenges were grounded in execution. We believe that the results you see today reflect significant progress against those challenges as well as a solid foundation to build on going forward. And while there's more work ahead of us, we remain committed to turning around our top line, while maintaining our financial discipline. And we see a clear path to approaching our long-term operating margin objective of 15% to 20% as early as 2017. We remain firmly committed to delivering long-term value to our shareholders.

And then as it relates to margin there, I think previously, you mentioned that the Disney Princess margin that you get is approximated the accompanying operating margin. Is there a potential as you replace those dollars that the margin mix could be higher than what we've seen with Disney Princess? So it's my first question. And then any color that you can give us on Hot Wheels? How much of the growth was core Hot Wheels and how much was Star Wars related, both on POS and wholesale?"

I think I understood your first question on Disney Princess when you say what do we mean by a significant amount. I think the way to look at this is our goal is to get a top line that's relatively flat and in constant currency, which says, obviously, we expect to cover pretty much the whole thing and so cover some of the issues we have a Monster High. So that's what we're tracking to. I think what Kevin tried to set up was as a higher percentage of the mix related to Disney Princess in the first and second quarter, so it makes the challenge, obviously, a little bit harder as we enter the year. But broadly, we feel pretty good that we have the programs in place to hold the top line flat. And on the margins, we don't expect really much change in mix in this coming year. I think it's pretty much on balance with the loss of Disney and some of the other things we've got on our core brand. So I wouldn't expect an up or down either way on that one.

Both the core basic Car business and the licensed property business, of course, Star Wars being the hero for '15, were up. Clearly, significant growth from licensing business within it, but really nice, steady business within Hot Wheels core. We continue to look to leverage the POS momentum and build upon the core business, basic track sets and a variety of exciting new initiatives as well as expand the licensing portfolio. I think Star Wars really prove that we can incorporate really innovative new ways of thinking about licensing as part of the diecast platform.

31197,321985855,924320,"Mattel, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Mattel, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Martin, and good afternoon, everyone. And let me add my thanks for all of you joining us today. To get things started, I'd like to provide some perspective on the fourth quarter and, importantly, on the progress that we're making against our trans",1104,"Thanks, Martin, and good afternoon, everyone. And let me add my thanks for all of you joining us today. To get things started, I'd like to provide some perspective on the fourth quarter and, importantly, on the progress that we're making against our transformation. And following this, Richard and Kevin will provide additional details on the quarter as well as an outlook on what's ahead. And as Martin indicated, at the end, we'll leave time for your questions. 
So let me begin by saying that our fourth quarter performance and our full year results were encouraging, and they reflect some significant and continuing progress from where we stood a year ago when we first began to execute against our 6 strategic priorities and our cultural transformation. 
Gross sales for the quarter greatly improved, and excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased by 3%. And gratifying to me, for the full year, we achieved our goal of stabilizing the business with a gross sales increase of 1% in constant currency.
For the full year, we achieved our goal of stabilizing the business, the gross sales increase of 1% in constant currency. Importantly, as an underpinning to this, we also succeeded in revitalizing some of our critical core brands. We executed very well at retail, as evidenced by both POS and shipping trends. Mattel's global POS was positive in the quarter, up 3%, and we ended the full year up in both North America and in international. Majority of our core brands also ended the year with positive POS while demonstrating some very solid momentum in the fourth quarter. We're particularly pleased with Barbie POS, which, despite a very competitive category, ended the year with a high note, with the fourth quarter results reflecting continuing double-digit growth in North America and positive numbers in international.  As expected, we also began to see overall shipping in POS trends converge, with sales and POS both up by 3% in the quarter. The same held true for Barbie, up 8% and 9%, respectively. Our improved brand and commercial alignment also resulted in better retail inventories as we ended the year. 
So overall, we're very encouraged by our POS and shipping momentum, and we continue to point the progress in North America as a good leading indicator of future performance globally. 
Now also fueling growth were our investments in emerging markets, with China sales up by 34% in the quarter in constant currency and up 43% for the year. Despite all the challenges in Russia, we saw our business grow there by 22% in 2015. 
Turning to our financials. We're also pleased by our results as many of our cost initiatives have started to kick in. We continue to manage the middle of the P&L quite well, which enabled us to offset some significant foreign exchange headwinds and provided resources to invest in growing the business. 
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, our gross margin for the year was 50.2%, which is in line with our long-term objective. And our adjusted SG&A was down almost $70 million versus last year. This, even as we funded an increased level of incentive compensation. Our key here was the fact that we beat our 2015 cost savings goal by about $30 million, and we continue to be on track to deliver at the high end of our 2-year savings target of $250 million to $300 million. Our financial discipline was also reflected in our strong balance sheet, where we exceeded our year-end cash objective while continuing to maintain our dividend. 
So exiting 2015, as I said upfront, we're encouraged. We feel good about stabilizing the business and also about executing well on our turnaround. As we move forward and, as you all know, we still face many challenges, including the impact of the loss of Disney Princess, continued declines in Monster High, some recent softness in American Girl and continued foreign exchange headwinds. 
But fortunately, Mattel has many strengths to work with. We also have the right strategies in place to execute well and to perform. We continue to believe that we can fill a significant portion of the Disney Princess gap and also offset continued softness with Monster High. And our goal remains to hold things relatively flat at the top line in constant currency in this year of transition. 
Supporting this, on our core brands, we exited the year with great momentum in Barbie, Fisher-Price, Hot Wheels and Thomas, and we expect this to continue. We also have a number of initiatives to support Monster High in 2016, and we'll certainly be leveraging our newly-announced content partnership with American Girl and Amazon Studios as another catalyst to improve performance. 
Initially, our Toy Box unit has a much stronger licensed entertainment slate in 2016 led by Warner Bros. and its DC comic universe as well as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles license with MEGA Brands. And finally, we expect continued good growth from our investments in emerging markets. 
Now while we drive hard to hold the top line, we'll also continue to be very aggressive in reducing costs. And here, we expect to maintain our gross margins through ongoing improvements in our global supply chain while, at the same time, dropping more of our cost savings in SG&A for the bottom line. We'll also remain disciplined with our balance sheet, as we continue to fund the turnaround, and support the dividend. 
I said 2016 will have its challenges, particularly on the top line. But we do expect to make additional good progress on all fronts, continuing our cultural transformation, while also executing against our key priorities. As we do so, we see a clear path to restoring real growth and momentum as we move to 2017. Momentum on our core brands; expansion of our MEGA construction business; rapid emerging market expansion; and a much stronger licensed entertainment slate, with our multi-year program with Warner Bros; our newly renewed Disney Car's license, with its 2017 theatrical release; and Toy Story 4, which is slated for 2018, all set us up very well as we look ahead. We'll expand much more on this when we see many of you on our 2016 Toy Fair in a couple of weeks. 
Let me just wrap up here by saying that clearly, I'm pleased with the progress to date, encouraged with the momentum we have going into 2016. I'm quite excited about our prospects to grow this business in 2017 and beyond. 
With that, let me now introduce Richard, who will go into a little more detail on our 2015 performance and our outlook for 2016. Richard?"
31197,321985855,924320,"Mattel, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Mattel, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. You can see that a remarkable transformation is well underway at Mattel, a transformation that goes far beyond our performance in fourth quarter and includes the ongoing revitalization of our core brands, the rebuilding of relationships",1930,"Thank you, Chris. You can see that a remarkable transformation is well underway at Mattel, a transformation that goes far beyond our performance in fourth quarter and includes the ongoing revitalization of our core brands, the rebuilding of relationships with strategic license partners, accelerated growth in emerging markets and a much more effective presence at retail. 
Today, I'll highlight some key aspects of our progress. I'll address our challenges for 2016 and share our optimistic views of our future. I'm also going to look forward to continuing this conversation in much more detail at Toy Fair in just a few weeks, where we will have much more news to share. 
On last quarter's call, I noted that our POS continued to outpace shipping, creating a major opportunity to increase sales going forward, and we seized that opportunity. Thanks to a vastly improved brand-management and programming, a better aligned and higher-performing commercial organization, and new marketing, which is beginning to make strong connections with our consumers. The result was a very solid fourth quarter. 
Global POS increased by 3%, and built momentum during the holiday season in both domestic and international markets. We also vastly improved the alignment of global POS with shipping, with fourth quarter shipping up 3%, excluding foreign exchange. 
In addition, as Chris noted, we saw overall shipping in constant currency and POS trends converged for a number of our core brands. Barbie global POS was up high single digits in the fourth quarter, aligned with global shipping, up 8%. The brand continued to see double-digit POS performance in the U.S., which, combined with positive international POS, positions the brand for 2016 with solid momentum. 
Despite the very competitive North America doll market in 2015, exciting new brand initiatives proved effective with consumers, and sales were up 24% in North America. 
Going forward, expect us to leverage these successes and build on the Barbie brand momentum. We have a growing pipeline of exciting innovations that we are confident will make the brand even more relevant and engaging in 2016. The latest example: a groundbreaking new line extension from Barbie Fashionistas that makes the brand even more reflective of the world kids see and experience today. Never has Barbie been more diverse on so many dimensions and, more celebrated. 
TIME Magazine's cover story and Associated Buzz last week are great examples that underscore, not only how powerfully relevant the Barbie brand is, but reinforce that we're on the right track. It's this kind of brand leadership that is changing the cultural conversation in ways that only Barbie can, and we couldn't be more pleased. 
Fisher-Price showed comparable POS gains for the quarter, up high single digits, and aligned with shipping. These increases were in both North America and international markets, with notably strong results in the Fisher-Price core business, setting the stage for continued success in 2016. 
Thomas, leveraging interest in the brand's 70th anniversary, continued to grow in new markets and maintained strong momentum throughout the holiday period. We continue to make progress with Fisher-Price, providing innovative new products and solutions for today's mom, improving its messaging to once again become the industry leader in early childhood development and improving its price and value proposition in global markets. 
We've called Hot Wheels our sleeping giant, and in 2015, we began to unlock more of the brand's potential. The result, one of Hot Wheels' strongest years ever, with positive double-digit POS and shipping in both the quarter and for the year. Strength in the core vehicle and track set business was complemented by successful execution of the brand's Star Wars license, which also demonstrated the versatility of the brand to incorporate a wide range of IP. We intend to capture much more of Hot Wheels' untapped potential going forward, building it out as another exciting platform for more purposeful play. 
Now while we had great success with most of our core brands this holiday, Monster High and American Girl, as Chris indicated, are challenging works in progress. While we work to evolve Monster High into an evergreen property, the brand continued to struggle during the quarter. The executional challenges, excess retail inventory we faced coming into 2015, combined with increased competitive product launches, impacted shelf space and performance. While we did see some success with bold, new executions, introducing new scales and form factors, they just couldn't overcome the headwinds. 
That said, Monster High remained a top 5 doll property globally. And with about $330 million in gross sales, consumer engagement with the brand remains strong. And while we have lots of work to do, we are determined to find opportunity with the new generation of consumers as we work to solidify the brand's base in 2016. 
American Girl was a disappointment this holiday season. Our efforts to re-energize the foundation of the American Girl brand BeForever were successful, but our Girl of the Year and our Truly Me relaunch did not drive the expected direct and retail traffic. 
As we take steps to revitalize this brand, we recognize there are some price value issues that need to be addressed. We also need to improve distribution and expand consumer engagement. You could see evidence that these initiatives are underway in our recent multi-year deal with Amazon Studios to develop live action specials and episodic content based on the American Girl characters, with the first special to be released this year. 
Beyond our core brands, we also saw healthy momentum from MEGA, where fourth quarter gross sales were up 11%, led by international expansion, which saw a 40% increase in gross sales in the quarter. 
We've repeatedly mentioned how we are transforming Mattel's culture with a focus on innovation, speed and accountability. The embrace of innovation has been particularly strong, and is evidenced in both our day-to-day perspective and breakthrough new products, several of which drove valuable buzz and traffic for us in the quarter. 
The New York Times said Hello Barbie is leading a new generation of AI toys, and it was certainly one of the most talked-about toys in 2015. Both Hello Barbie and the relaunched View-Master, using Google virtual reality technology, were well received in the market. These innovative creations also demonstrated, both inside and outside Mattel, a new willingness and the ability to invent big, partner effectively with Silicon Valley and get to market fast. 
In addition to building on these technology platforms in 2016, we will also begin to activate our relationship with Autodesk, and you will see an exciting new statement at Toy Fair. 
To enhance our new perspective on innovation and technology, we have recently acquired new capabilities and brands to accelerate our competitiveness. Sproutling, a smart technology company that recently became part of the Mattel family of companies, provides us with a new product offering and technology platform. And we just closed the deal to acquire assets of Fuhu, giving us both proven technology and access to their extremely talented people. Unique technology and expertise from both of these companies will be part of our initiatives to build out digital platforms, increase our consumer engagement and develop a new generation of digital toys. 
Another area where innovation is proving transformative is our content strategy, reflected in several DVDs successfully releases, stronger media engagement and exclusive content via Netflix and YouTube Kids. A critical step in our new focus on content was to bring in a proven talent in the field to lead our consolidated content creative and distribution capabilities, which we did in the quarter. And we continued to strengthen our content pipeline and resources. 
In addition to the new Amazon Studio partnership with American Girl, we recently signed new content deals with 9 Story to relaunched the iconic brands Barney and friends and Angelina Ballerina. We also announced a new partnership with DHX to jointly develop and distribute Bob the Builder, Fireman Sam, Little People and Polly Pocket content across multiple platforms. 
In the important area of entertainment licensing, Mattel is proud to partner with some of the most iconic licenses in the market. We did a great job executing the last holiday season of our Disney Princess license. Not surprisingly, sales were down in the quarter as Frozen POS continued to soften, but gross sales for the full year were about $415 million. As we have all known for some time, the end of this license creates significant challenges for us in 2016, but we have a number of important initiative coming online to fill this gap. 
A growing pipeline of Disney licenses is evidence that our relationship with Disney is strengthening. Not only can we point to the significant results generated by innovative and popular Star Wars products from Hot Wheels, we are pleased to have been awarded the license for Toy Story 4, a major new film and a beloved global franchise, to be released in 2018.  
Equally exciting was last week's announcement that we have been awarded the coveted Cars 3 license, with this major feature film scheduled for global release in 2017. The Cars franchise is one of the most successful in Pixar history, and a very successful one for us year-to-year. Our Cars license has had shelf presence since its inception in 2006. And with the potential to deliver $315 million of incremental gross sales in a movie year, we are looking forward to our best Cars years ever in 2017. 
Another long-standing partnership, enjoying resurgence, is Warner Bros. We are already shipping product in support of the upcoming Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice movie coming in March, and we look forward to partnering with Warner Bros. in their exciting new multi-year plan to build out their DC license comics universe. We are already an important part of the DC super hero growth launch, with product launching later this year. 
Licensing is strategically important to our transformation and our business overall. And as we continue to deepen our partnerships and build our entertainment-licensing capabilities, you will see much more from us in this area. 
I've mentioned our determination to strategically align powerful brand positioning, improve trade promotions and create more motivating marketing to drive retail performance. Retail execution is an area where we have underperformed in the past, but where the strategic course corrections of 2015 are proving to be very effective in market. 
In Q4, we demonstrated a marked improvement in the effectiveness of our global retail execution, with an enhanced presence during Black Friday and Cyber Monday that drove momentum throughout the holiday season. 
The bottom line, we grew our business with all of our top U.S. brick-and-mortar customers in Q4 by demonstrating our commitment to work with them to deliver what they need to be successful and to end the year relatively clean at retail. We also grew our overall e-com business, and will continue to build on the strong momentum and gain back shelf space, be it real or virtual, in 2016. 
Like Chris, I am very pleased with the company's performance this last holiday season and proud of the progress made throughout 2015 to stabilize the business and reset Mattel's culture. And while there is much yet to do, we have already initiated plans to offset the challenges inherent in 2016. 
Even more importantly, our progress to date has generated strong momentum to build on, positioning us for growth and greater profitability in 2017 and beyond. 
I look forward to sharing our newest creations with many of you at Toy Fair in just a few weeks. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin?"
31197,321985855,924320,"Mattel, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Mattel, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone. Echoing what Chris and Richard said, I'm also very pleased with the progress we've made in 2015. Despite significant challenges and through tremendous efforts across the organization, we achieved our full",2069,"Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone. Echoing what Chris and Richard said, I'm also very pleased with the progress we've made in 2015. Despite significant challenges and through tremendous efforts across the organization, we achieved our full year financial outlook, which included a stabilization of net revenues in constant currency, gross margins of about 50%, a decline in adjusted SG&A in absolute dollars, and year-end cash of $800 million to $1 billion. 
We continue to be disciplined in our management of the P&L, with a large part of our success due to our cost savings efforts. For the full year, we over-delivered against our 2015 target, with total gross savings of $153 million as well as nice leverage on our advertising spend in the fourth quarter. 
Today, I want to quickly highlight our 2015 performance metrics and then focus on our expectations for 2016. As a reminder, I'll be discussing our top line results in constant currency. In addition, I'll be referring to adjusted financial measures that exclude certain items related to our acquisition of MEGA as well as severance expense, unless otherwise noted, to provide better visibility into the underlying business performance as we continued to execute the turnaround. 
So as it relates to our 2015 performance, we achieved our objective to stabilize net revenues, with full year sales of $5.7 billion, up 2% in constant currency. This included growth of 7% in the fourth quarter, as we began to see the expected inflection of shipping and POS for our key core brands. 
However, the foreign exchange headwind was less slightly in the quarter, but was still significant, reducing net revenues by about $140 million, or about $400 million for the full year. This was at the high end of our revised 5% to 7% outlook that we provided last quarter. 
Looking at the results regionally, Asia-Pacific remained our strongest growth market for the quarter and full year. China led the region, where increased investments are continuing to pay off, in addition to solid growth in Australia.  As you heard from both Chris and Richard, our North American region had a good quarter, where we made great strides in commercial execution and saw tangible improvement in both POS and shipping. We also saw a continued strong growth in Russia, but this was offset by softness in Western Europe. And as we work hard to mitigate volatility in Latin America, driven by good performances in Mexico as well as other small markets, these results were offset by a sharp declines in Brazil against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop and a more competitive toy market. 
Looking beyond the top line to our other key P&L drivers, sales adjustments were down in both nominal dollars and as a percentage of sales in the quarter. Sales adjustments for the quarter were more closely aligned with our long-term averages for the full year. We attribute much of the increase in better-aligned retail promotional programs that were in place throughout the year, which contributed to strong holiday POS trends and less-than-expected in-season discounting to drive POS. 
With respect to retail inventories, you know we entered the holiday season relatively clean around the world, are exiting in a similar position, including a roughly 10% decline in the U.S. International retail inventories were roughly flat, with increases in growing markets like China and Russia, offset by declines in most mature markets. And while retail inventories are somewhat elevated in Brazil, I'm happy to note that overall international inventories are the cleanest they've been in the last 3 years. 
We also saw very strong results with our funding of our future cost savings program, which exceeded our expectations for 2015. Specifically, we delivered $60 million of gross savings in the quarter and $153 million for the year. These savings was roughly split evenly between gross margin and SG&A and other. These savings were an important element of delivering an adjusted gross margin for the quarter of 50.2%, resulting in full year gross margins of 49.2%. 
While consistent with our long-term objective of about 50%, the negative impact of foreign exchange was bigger than anticipated, including roughly 200 basis points for the quarter and about 100 basis points for the full year. This was largely due to further strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble. 
Our advertising was lower in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter. As you know, we increased advertising spending throughout the year to support our core brands, which helped continue to generate a nice lift in POS and drove stronger shipping in the holiday season. 
For both the quarter and the year, foreign exchange was also a factor in lower nominal levels of spend since international media buys were cheaper in U.S. dollars. 
SG&A was also down versus the prior year in absolute dollars on both a reported basis and adjusted basis, as we aggressively reduced overhead cost while balancing strategic investments. Similar to advertising, the stronger dollar led to favorability in nominal SG&A due to lower operational cost overseas. 
Decline in adjusted SG&A of $69 million for the full year is below the outlook of $80 million to $95 million we provided last quarter, which is due to higher incentive expense of $50 million versus $25 million in 2004 [ph] since sales ended even stronger than we expected in the fourth quarter as POS accelerated. 
And given that we are a pay-for-performance company, we rewarded our people for delivering on the turnaround in 2015, consistent with the incentive plan goals established at the beginning of the year. 
It's worth noting, while the $50 million of incentive compensation in the full year is higher than we expected heading into the quarter, it remains below our targeted payout level of $80 million to $90 million. 
Our tax rate for the full year was 20.4%, including discrete tax items, which was consistent with our tax rate outlook of 20% to 21% that we gave you in April. 
Adjusted EPS, including discrete tax items for the quarter, was $0.67 and $1.31 for the year compared to the prior year of $0.49 and $1.71, respectively. 
Currency had a negative impact of $0.18 per share in the quarter and $0.41 per share for the year. Similar to the negative impact on sales and gross margin, this is higher than expected, as the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against key currencies in the quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the year with $893 million of cash. This strong cash generation was achieved primarily through tightly managing working capital. Not surprisingly, receivables were up, with improving sales and the fact that sales came later in the fourth quarter, which we'll collect in the first quarter of 2016. And owned inventory was up slightly, as we position the business for improving POS trends heading into 2016. And importantly, our current level of owned inventory is also of better quality than the last couple of years since we achieved our fourth quarter sales objectives in 2015. 
We also continued our efforts around extending key vendor terms to match industry norms as well as emphasizing more greater overall discipline in accounts payable management. 
And we continued to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and protecting the dividend. As we've said, dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business, and the board declared a first quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
Moving to our 2016 outlook, we'll provide greater detail on the key top line and P&L drivers at Toy Fair. But based upon our 2015 results, I want to provide some context for how we see 2016 shaping up. 
As Chris and Richard said, we believe that we could fill a significant portion of the Disney Princess revenue gap and offset continued softness in Monster High and AG. The goal is to hold top line relatively flat in constant currency. But we do expect a more challenging first half of the year, primarily due to Disney Princess comps, with improving trends in the second half as the number of our incremental revenue initiatives like DC Super Hero Girls begin to accelerate. 
Specifically in the first quarter, we expect sales to be down slightly in constant currency, and more so as reported, due to foreign exchange headwinds. Continued momentum in core brands and a limited slate of new product launches may not fully offset the loss of Disney Princess in the first quarter, which represents about 10% of our total gross sales in the prior period. We expect the Disney Princess headwind to moderate in the second half of the year due to the seasonality of our business. 
We also expect the continued unfavorable ForEx impact for the year. We estimate that currency will impact net revenues by approximately 2% to 4% and adjusted EPS by $0.30 to $0.40 per share. The EPS impact is primarily due to continued volatility in key currencies, particularly in Europe and our growing emerging markets like Mexico, Brazil and Russia as well as more challenging hedging economics for the euro in 2016 versus 2015. 
Consistent with our long-term objective, we expect to again be at about 50% margins for gross margins. Our cost savings initiatives and favorable commodity trends should help offset significant labor inflation, foreign exchange headwinds, mix and ongoing efforts to sharpen our price value propositions in support of the turnaround. 
For advertising, we're looking to move somewhat closer to the midpoint of the range on our 11% to 13% long-term objective that we achieved in 2015.  And we'll also remain very disciplined on SG&A. We are targeting adjusted SG&A to be down $55 million to $65 million versus 2015 adjusted SG&A. 
Funding Our Future cost-saving initiatives, plus incremental saving opportunities will be partially offset by investments to grow the business, modest inflation and employee cost and increased incentive expense. 
It's worth noting that SG&A as reported should be down even more. This is due to reduced MEGA integration and amortization expenses as well as lower incentive and restructuring expenses, which are excluded from adjusted SG&A. 
As it relates to Funding Our Future program, having exceeded our first year objective, we continue to expect to deliver cost savings at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range by the end of 2016. We have also identified incremental cost savings opportunities in both gross margin and SG&A that we are actively pursuing. 
And finally, assuming no changes to current tax loss, we expect our tax rate to be around 21% for 2016 and beyond, including discrete tax items. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow outlook. We will continue to manage working capital tightly. We expect CapEx of $270 million to $280 million, driven by investments in our global supply chain to support the expansion of our diecast car capacity, automation and other cost-savings initiatives. 
And currently, we fully expect to generate the cash flow in 2016 and beyond to invest in our business and fund the dividend while targeting $800 million to $1 billion in year-end cash. That said, our board has final decision on a dividend and it reviews the dividend on a quarterly basis. 
Looking beyond 2016 and to 2017, we have greater confidence that we can achieve meaningful operating leverage through a combination of continued momentum in core brands, both domestically and in key international markets; a strong revenue tailwind from the theatrical release of Cars 3 in 2017; a return to more normal levels of P&L investments and sales adjustments in advertising; and line of sight into additional cost savings programs above and beyond our current programs. 
In closing, we told you last year that our challenges were grounded in execution. We believe that the results you see today reflect significant progress against those challenges as well as a solid foundation to build on going forward. And while there's more work ahead of us, we remain committed to turning around our top line while maintaining our financial discipline. And we see a clear path to approaching our long-term operating margin objective of 15% to 20% as early as 2017. We remain firmly committed to delivering long-term value to our shareholders. 
And with that, we'll now open up the call for questions. Operator?"

I think I understood your first question on Disney Princess when you say what do we mean by a significant amount.

So that's what we're tracking to. I think what Kevin tried to set up was, as a higher percentage of the mix related to Disney Princess in the first and second quarter, so it makes the challenge obviously a little bit harder as we enter the year. But broadly, we feel pretty good that we have the programs in place to hold the top line flat. And on the margins, we don't expect really much change in mix in this coming year. I think it's pretty much on balance with the loss of Disney and some of the other things we've got on our core brand. So I wouldn't expect an up or down either way on that one.

Clearly, significant growth from the licensing business within it, but really nice, steady growth business within Hot Wheels core. We continue to look to leverage the POS momentum and build upon the core business, basic track sets and a variety of exciting new initiatives as well as expand the licensing portfolio.

And we're going to look to new product drivers and entertainment, Batman v Superman, Captain America, and of course, continue with Star Wars."

Look, I don't think that was really the big factor. We have felt for the last few months that we're not doing what we need to be doing to get the brand salience up, and so a combination of our content, the distribution of that content and price value. And we've allowed price value and the total value proposition to shift, and I think that hurt us in the quarter. As you know, there's been a fair amount of private label stuff out there at retail that actually competes directly with AG. So we have restructured things. As we go into '16, I think we feel a lot better about the line. We've got a lower price segment we're doing. I think Amazon with the studio launch, will help us on the content front. And we're going to be doing some interesting things on distribution to extend both our consumer reach as well as our availability. So we think this is imminently fixable. We were just a little slow off the marks this year."

Notwithstanding that, we're pretty excited about some of the new licenses that we have. I mean, clearly, the Warner Bros. relationship is become more and more important, and we've got a great new girl initiative coming out. We've got, obviously, the Batman v Superman and a trilogy of movies going forward well into 2017 and '18. The MEGA business for us, which we haven't talked a lot about, is strong and leveraging the platform itself and attracting new partners. Clearly, we're launching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles license, which is going to be a terrific sleeper for us as well on a movie year. So we know that, that's going to prove itself out. We've got some great new content partnerships that we've discussed that will both fuel core brands as well as some new that you'll hear about at Toy Fair.

So let me begin by saying that our fourth quarter performance and our full year results were encouraging, and they reflect some significant and continuing progress from where we stood a year ago when we first began to execute against our 6 strategic priorities and our cultural transformation. 
Gross sales for the quarter greatly improved, and excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased by 3%. And gratifying to me, for the full year, we achieved our goal of stabilizing the business with a gross sales increase of 1% in constant currency. Importantly, as an underpinning to this, we also succeeded in revitalizing some of our critical core brands. We executed very well at retail, as evidenced by both POS and shipping trends. Mattel's global POS was positive in the quarter, up 3%, and we ended the full year up in both North America and in international. Majority of our core brands also ended the year with positive POS while demonstrating some very solid momentum in the fourth quarter. We're particularly pleased with Barbie POS, which, despite a very competitive category, ended the year with a high note, with the fourth quarter results reflecting continuing double-digit growth in North America and positive numbers in international.  As expected, we also began to see overall shipping and POS trends converge, with sales and POS both up by 3% in the quarter. The same held true for Barbie, up 8% and 9%, respectively. Our improved brand and commercial alignment also resulted in better retail inventories as we ended the year. 
So overall, we're very encouraged by our POS and shipping momentum, and we continue to point to progress in North America as a good leading indicator of future performance globally. 
Now also fueling growth were our investments in emerging markets, with China sales up by 34% in the quarter in constant currency and up 43% for the year. Despite all the challenges in Russia, we saw our business grow there by 22% in 2015. 
Turning to our financials. We're also pleased by our results as many of our cost initiatives have started to kick in. We continue to manage the middle of the P&L quite well, which enabled us to offset some significant foreign exchange headwinds and provided resources to invest in growing the business. 
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, our gross margin for the year was 50.2%, which is in line with our long-term objective. And our adjusted SG&A was down almost $70 million versus last year. This, even as we funded an increased level of incentive compensation. Our key here was the fact that we beat our 2015 cost savings goal by about $30 million, and we continue to be on track to deliver at the high end of our 2-year savings target of $250 million to $300 million. Our financial discipline was also reflected in our strong balance sheet, where we exceeded our year-end cash objective while continuing to maintain our dividend. 
So exiting 2015, as I said upfront, we're encouraged. We feel good about stabilizing the business and also about executing well on our turnaround. As we move forward and, as you well know, we still face many challenges, including the impact of the loss of Disney Princess, continued declines in Monster High, some recent softness in American Girl and continued foreign exchange headwinds. 
But fortunately, Mattel has many strengths to work with. We also have the right strategies in place to execute well and to perform. We continue to believe that we can fill a significant portion of the Disney Princess gap and also offset continued softness with Monster High. And our goal remains to hold things relatively flat at the top line in constant currency in this year of transition. 
Supporting this, on our core brands, we exited the year with great momentum in Barbie, Fisher-Price, Hot Wheels and Thomas, and we expect this to continue. We also have a number of initiatives to support Monster High in 2016, and we'll certainly be leveraging our newly-announced content partnership with American Girl and Amazon Studios as another catalyst to improve performance. 
Additionally, our Toy Box unit has a much stronger licensed entertainment slate in 2016 led by Warner Bros. and its DC comic universe as well as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles license with MEGA Brands. And finally, we expect continued good growth from our investments in emerging markets. 
Now while we drive hard to hold the top line, we'll also continue to be very aggressive in reducing costs. And here, we expect to maintain our gross margins through ongoing improvements in our global supply chain while, at the same time, dropping more of our cost savings in SG&A for the bottom line. We'll also remain disciplined with our balance sheet, as we continue to fund the turnaround, and support the dividend. 
I said 2016 will have its challenges, particularly on the top line. But we do expect to make additional good progress on all fronts, continuing our cultural transformation, while also executing against our key priorities. As we do so, we see a clear path to restoring real growth and momentum as we move to 2017. Momentum on our core brands; expansion of our MEGA construction business; rapid emerging market expansion; and a much stronger licensed entertainment slate, with our multi-year program with Warner Bros; our newly renewed Disney Car's license, with its 2017 theatrical release; and Toy Story 4, which is slated for 2018, all set us up very well as we look ahead. We'll expand much more on this when we see many of you on our 2016 Toy Fair in a couple of weeks. 
Let me just wrap up here by saying that clearly, I'm pleased with the progress to date, encouraged with the momentum we have going into 2016. I'm quite excited about our prospects to grow this business in 2017 and beyond. 
With that, let me now introduce Richard, who will go into a little more detail on our 2015 performance and our outlook for 2016. Richard?"

You can see that a remarkable transformation is well underway at Mattel, a transformation that goes far beyond our performance in fourth quarter and includes the ongoing revitalization of our core brands, the rebuilding of relationships with strategic license partners, accelerated growth in emerging markets and a much more effective presence at retail. 
Today, I'll highlight some key aspects of our progress. I'll address our challenges for 2016 and share our optimistic views of our future. I'm also going to look forward to continuing this conversation in much more detail at Toy Fair in just a few weeks, where we will have much more news to share. 
On last quarter's call, I noted that our POS continued to outpace shipping, creating a major opportunity to increase sales going forward, and we seized that opportunity. Thanks to a vastly improved brand-management and programming, a better aligned and higher-performing commercial organization, and new marketing, which is beginning to make strong connections with our consumers. The result was a very solid fourth quarter. 
Global POS increased by 3%, and built momentum during the holiday season in both domestic and international markets. We also vastly improved the alignment of global POS with shipping, with fourth quarter shipping up 3%, excluding foreign exchange. 
In addition, as Chris noted, we saw overall shipping in constant currency and POS trends converge for a number of our core brands. Barbie global POS was up high single digits in the fourth quarter, aligned with global shipping, up 8%. The brand continued to see double-digit POS performance in the U.S., which, combined with positive international POS, positions the brand for 2016 with solid momentum. 
Despite the very competitive North America doll market in 2015, exciting new brand initiatives proved effective with consumers, and sales were up 24% in North America. 
Going forward, expect us to leverage these successes and build on the Barbie brand momentum. We have a growing pipeline of exciting innovations that we are confident will make the brand even more relevant and engaging in 2016. The latest example: a groundbreaking new line extension from Barbie Fashionistas that makes the brand even more reflective of the world kids see and experience today. Never has Barbie been more diverse on so many dimensions and, more celebrated. 
TIME Magazine's cover story and Associated Buzz last week are great examples that underscore, not only how powerfully relevant the Barbie brand is, but reinforce that we're on the right track. It's this kind of brand leadership that is changing the cultural conversation in ways that only Barbie can, and we couldn't be more pleased. 
Fisher-Price showed comparable POS gains for the quarter, up high single digits, and aligned with shipping. These increases were in both North America and international markets, with notably strong results in the Fisher-Price core business, setting the stage for continued success in 2016. 
Thomas, leveraging interest in the brand's 70th anniversary, continued to grow in new markets and maintained strong momentum throughout the holiday period. We continue to make progress with Fisher-Price, providing innovative new products and solutions for today's mom, improving its messaging to once again become the industry leader in early childhood development and improving its price and value proposition in global markets. 
We've called Hot Wheels our sleeping giant, and in 2015, we began to unlock more of the brand's potential. The result, one of Hot Wheels' strongest years ever, with positive double-digit POS and shipping in both the quarter and for the year. Strength in the core vehicle and track set business was complemented by successful execution of the brand's Star Wars license, which also demonstrated the versatility of the brand to incorporate a wide range of IP. We intend to capture much more of Hot Wheels' untapped potential going forward, building it out as another exciting platform for more purposeful play. 
Now while we had great success with most of our core brands this holiday, Monster High and American Girl, as Chris indicated, are challenging works in progress. While we work to evolve Monster High into an evergreen property, the brand continued to struggle during the quarter. The executional challenges, excess retail inventory we faced coming into 2015, combined with increased competitive product launches, impacted shelf space and performance. While we did see some success with bold, new executions, introducing new scales and form factors, they just couldn't overcome the headwinds. 
That said, Monster High remained a top 5 doll property globally. And with about $330 million in gross sales, consumer engagement with the brand remains strong. And while we have lots of work to do, we are determined to find opportunity with the new generation of consumers as we work to solidify the brand's base in 2016. 
American Girl was a disappointment this holiday season. Our efforts to re-energize the foundation of the American Girl brand BeForever were successful, but our Girl of the Year and our Truly Me relaunch did not drive the expected direct and retail traffic. 
As we take steps to revitalize this brand, we recognize there are some price value issues that need to be addressed. We also need to improve distribution and expand consumer engagement. You could see evidence that these initiatives are underway in our recent multi-year deal with Amazon Studios to develop live action specials and episodic content based on the American Girl characters, with the first special to be released this year. 
Beyond our core brands, we also saw healthy momentum from MEGA, where fourth quarter gross sales were up 11%, led by international expansion, which saw a 40% increase in gross sales in the quarter. 
We've repeatedly mentioned how we are transforming Mattel's culture with a focus on innovation, speed and accountability. The embrace of innovation has been particularly strong, and is evidenced in both our day-to-day perspective and breakthrough new products, several of which drove valuable buzz and traffic for us in the quarter. 
The New York Times said Hello Barbie is leading a new generation of AI toys, and it was certainly one of the most talked-about toys in 2015. Both Hello Barbie and the relaunched View-Master, using Google virtual reality technology, were well received in the market. These innovative creations also demonstrated, both inside and outside Mattel, a new willingness and the ability to invent big, partner effectively with Silicon Valley and get to market fast. 
In addition to building on these technology platforms in 2016, we will also begin to activate our relationship with Autodesk, and you will see an exciting new statement at Toy Fair. 
To enhance our new perspective on innovation and technology, we have recently acquired new capabilities and brands to accelerate our competitiveness. Sproutling, a smart technology company that recently became part of the Mattel family of companies, provides us with a new product offering and technology platform. And we just closed the deal to acquire assets of Fuhu, giving us both proven technology and access to their extremely talented people. Unique technology and expertise from both of these companies will be part of our initiatives to build out digital platforms, increase our consumer engagement and develop a new generation of digital toys. 
Another area where innovation is proving transformative is our content strategy, reflected in several DVDs successful releases, stronger media engagement and exclusive content via Netflix and YouTube Kids. A critical step in our new focus on content was to bring in a proven talent in the field to lead our consolidated content creative and distribution capabilities, which we did in the quarter. And we continued to strengthen our content pipeline and resources. 
In addition to the new Amazon Studio partnership with American Girl, we recently signed new content deals with 9 Story to relaunch the iconic brands Barney and friends and Angelina Ballerina. We also announced a new partnership with DHX to jointly develop and distribute Bob the Builder, Fireman Sam, Little People and Polly Pocket content across multiple platforms. 
In the important area of entertainment licensing, Mattel is proud to partner with some of the most iconic licenses in the market. We did a great job executing the last holiday season of our Disney Princess license. Not surprisingly, sales were down in the quarter as Frozen POS continued to soften, but gross sales for the full year were about $450 million. As we have all known for some time, the end of this license creates significant challenges for us in 2016, but we have a number of important initiatives coming online to fill this gap. 
A growing pipeline of Disney licenses is evidence that our relationship with Disney is strengthening. Not only can we point to the significant results generated by innovative and popular Star Wars products from Hot Wheels, we are pleased to have been awarded the license for Toy Story 4, a major new film and a beloved global franchise, to be released in 2018.  
Equally exciting was last week's announcement that we have been awarded the coveted Cars 3 license, with this major feature film scheduled for global release in 2017. The Cars franchise is one of the most successful in Pixar history, and a very successful one for us year-to-year. Our Cars license has had shelf presence since its inception in 2006. And with the potential to deliver $350 million of incremental gross sales in a movie year, we are looking forward to our best Cars years ever in 2017. 
Another long-standing partnership, enjoying resurgence, is Warner Bros. We are already shipping product in support of the upcoming Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice movie coming in March, and we look forward to partnering with Warner Bros. in their exciting new multi-year plan to build out their DC license comic’s universe. We are already an important part of the DC super hero growth launch, with product launching later this year. 
Licensing is strategically important to our transformation and our business overall. And as we continue to deepen our partnerships and build our entertainment-licensing capabilities, you will see much more from us in this area. 
I've mentioned our determination to strategically align powerful brand positioning, improve trade promotions and create more motivating marketing to drive retail performance. Retail execution is an area where we have underperformed in the past, but where the strategic course corrections of 2015 are proving to be very effective in market. 
In Q4, we demonstrated a marked improvement in the effectiveness of our global retail execution, with an enhanced presence during Black Friday and Cyber Monday that drove momentum throughout the holiday season. 
The bottom line, we grew our business with all of our top U.S. brick-and-mortar customers in Q4 by demonstrating our commitment to work with them to deliver what they need to be successful and to end the year relatively clean at retail. We also grew our overall e-com business, and will continue to build on the strong momentum and gain back shelf space, be it real or virtual, in 2016. 
Like Chris, I am very pleased with the company's performance this last holiday season and proud of the progress made throughout 2015 to stabilize the business and reset Mattel's culture. And while there is much yet to do, we have already initiated plans to offset the challenges inherent in 2016. 
Even more importantly, our progress to date has generated strong momentum to build on, positioning us for growth and greater profitability in 2017 and beyond. 
I look forward to sharing our newest creations with many of you at Toy Fair in just a few weeks. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin?"
31197,321985855,924345,"Mattel, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Mattel, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone. Echoing what Chris and Richard said, I'm also very pleased with the progress we've made in 2015. Despite significant challenges and through tremendous efforts across the organization, we achieved our full",2070,"Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone. Echoing what Chris and Richard said, I'm also very pleased with the progress we've made in 2015. Despite significant challenges and through tremendous efforts across the organization, we achieved our full year financial outlook, which included a stabilization of net revenues in constant currency, gross margins of about 50%, a decline in adjusted SG&A in absolute dollars, and year-end cash of $800 million to $1 billion. 
We continue to be disciplined in our management of the P&L, with a large part of our success due to our cost savings efforts. For the full year, we over-delivered against our 2015 target, with total gross savings of $153 million as well as nice leverage on our advertising spend in the fourth quarter. 
Today, I want to quickly highlight our 2015 performance metrics and then focus on our expectations for 2016. As a reminder, I'll be discussing our top line results in constant currency. In addition, I'll be referring to adjusted financial measures that exclude certain items related to our acquisition of MEGA as well as severance expense, unless otherwise noted, to provide better visibility into the underlying business performance as we continued to execute the turnaround. 
So as it relates to our 2015 performance, we achieved our objective to stabilize net revenues, with full year sales of $5.7 billion, up 2% in constant currency. This included growth of 7% in the fourth quarter, as we began to see the expected inflection of shipping and POS for our key core brands. 
However, the foreign exchange headwind was less slightly in the quarter, but was still significant, reducing net revenues by about $140 million, or about $400 million for the full year. This was at the high end of our revised 5% to 7% outlook that we provided last quarter. 
Looking at the results regionally, Asia-Pacific remained our strongest growth market for the quarter and full year. China led the region, where increased investments are continuing to pay off, in addition to solid growth in Australia.  As you heard from both Chris and Richard, our North American region had a good quarter, where we made great strides in commercial execution and saw tangible improvement in both POS and shipping. We also saw a continued strong growth in Russia, but this was offset by softness in Western Europe. And as we work hard to mitigate volatility in Latin America, driven by good performances in Mexico as well as other small markets, these results were offset by a sharp declines in Brazil against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop and a more competitive toy market. 
Looking beyond the top line to our other key P&L drivers, sales adjustments were down in both nominal dollars and as a percentage of sales in the quarter. Sales adjustments for the quarter were more closely aligned with our long-term averages for the full year. We attribute much of the increase in better-aligned retail promotional programs that were in place throughout the year, which contributed to strong holiday POS trends and less-than-expected in-season discounting to drive POS. 
With respect to retail inventories, you know we entered the holiday season relatively clean around the world, are exiting in a similar position, including a roughly 10% decline in the U.S. International retail inventories were roughly flat, with increases in growing markets like China and Russia, offset by declines in most mature markets. And while retail inventories are somewhat elevated in Brazil, I'm happy to note that overall international inventories are the cleanest they've been in the last 3 years. 
We also saw very strong results with our funding of our future cost savings program, which exceeded our expectations for 2015. Specifically, we delivered $60 million of gross savings in the quarter and $153 million for the year. These savings was roughly split evenly between gross margin and SG&A and other. These savings were an important element of delivering an adjusted gross margin for the quarter of 50.2%, resulting in full year gross margins of 49.2%. 
While consistent with our long-term objective of about 50%, the negative impact of foreign exchange was bigger than anticipated, including roughly 200 basis points for the quarter and about 100 basis points for the full year. This was largely due to further strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble. 
Our advertising was lower in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter. As you know, we increased advertising spending throughout the year to support our core brands, which helped continue to generate a nice lift in POS and drove stronger shipping in the holiday season. 
For both the quarter and the year, foreign exchange was also a factor in lower nominal levels of spend since international media buys were cheaper in U.S. dollars. 
SG&A was also down versus the prior year in absolute dollars on both a reported basis and adjusted basis, as we aggressively reduced overhead cost while balancing strategic investments. Similar to advertising, the stronger dollar led to favorability in nominal SG&A due to lower operational cost overseas. 
Decline in adjusted SG&A of $69 million for the full year is below the outlook of $80 million to $95 million we provided last quarter, which is due to higher incentive expense of $50 million versus $25 million in 2004 [ph] since sales ended even stronger than we expected in the fourth quarter as POS accelerated. 
And given that we are a pay-for-performance company, we rewarded our people for delivering on the turnaround in 2015, consistent with the incentive plan goals established at the beginning of the year. 
It's worth noting, while the $50 million of incentive compensation in the full year is higher than we expected heading into the quarter, it remains below our targeted payout level of $80 million to $90 million. 
Our tax rate for the full year was 20.4%, including discrete tax items, which was consistent with our tax rate outlook of 20% to 21% that we gave you in April. 
Adjusted EPS, including discrete tax items for the quarter, was $0.67 and $1.31 for the year compared to the prior year of $0.49 and $1.71, respectively. 
Currency had a negative impact of $0.18 per share in the quarter and $0.41 per share for the year. Similar to the negative impact on sales and gross margin, this is higher than expected, as the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against key currencies in the quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the year with $893 million of cash. This strong cash generation was achieved primarily through tightly managing working capital. Not surprisingly, receivables were up, with improving sales and the fact that sales came later in the fourth quarter, which we'll collect in the first quarter of 2016. And owned inventory was up slightly, as we position the business to support improving POS trends heading into 2016. And importantly, our current level of owned inventory is also of better quality than the last couple of years since we achieved our fourth quarter sales objectives in 2015. 
We also continued our efforts around extending key vendor terms to match industry norms as well as emphasizing more greater overall discipline in accounts payable management. 
And we continued to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and protecting the dividend. As we've said, dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business, and the board declared a first quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
Moving to our 2016 outlook, we'll provide greater detail on the key top line and P&L drivers at Toy Fair. But based upon our 2015 results, I want to provide some context for how we see 2016 shaping up. 
As Chris and Richard said, we believe that we could fill a significant portion of the Disney Princess revenue gap and offset continued softness in Monster High and AG. The goal is to hold top line relatively flat in constant currency. But we do expect a more challenging first half of the year, primarily due to Disney Princess comps, with improving trends in the second half as the number of our incremental revenue initiatives like DC Super Hero Girls begin to accelerate. 
Specifically in the first quarter, we expect sales to be down slightly in constant currency, and more so as reported, due to foreign exchange headwinds. Continued momentum in core brands and a limited slate of new product launches may not fully offset the loss of Disney Princess in the first quarter, which represents about 10% of our total gross sales in the prior period. We expect the Disney Princess headwind to moderate in the second half of the year due to the seasonality of our business. 
We also expect the continued unfavorable ForEx impact for the year. We estimate that currency will impact net revenues by approximately 2% to 4% and adjusted EPS by $0.30 to $0.40 per share. The EPS impact is primarily due to continued volatility in key currencies, particularly in Europe and our growing emerging markets like Mexico, Brazil and Russia as well as more challenging hedging economics for the euro in 2016 versus 2015. 
Consistent with our long-term objective, we expect to again be at about 50% margins for gross margins. Our cost savings initiatives and favorable commodity trends should help offset significant labor inflation, foreign exchange headwinds, mix and ongoing efforts to sharpen our price value propositions in support of the turnaround. 
For advertising, we're looking to move somewhat closer to the midpoint of the range on our 11% to 13% long-term objective than we achieved in 2015.  And we'll also remain very disciplined on SG&A. We are targeting adjusted SG&A to be down $55 million to $65 million versus 2015 adjusted SG&A. 
Funding Our Future cost-saving initiatives, plus incremental saving opportunities will be partially offset by investments to grow the business, modest inflation in employee cost and increased incentive expense. 
It's worth noting that SG&A as reported should be down even more. This is due to reduced MEGA integration and amortization expenses as well as lower incentive and restructuring expenses, which are excluded from adjusted SG&A. 
As it relates to Funding Our Future program, having exceeded our first year objective, we continue to expect to deliver cost savings at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range by the end of 2016. We have also identified incremental cost savings opportunities in both gross margin and SG&A that we are actively pursuing. 
And finally, assuming no changes to current tax laws, we expect our tax rate to be around 21% for 2016 and beyond, including discrete tax items. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow outlook. We will continue to manage working capital tightly. We expect CapEx of $270 million to $280 million, driven by investments in our global supply chain to support the expansion of our die cast car capacity, automation and other cost-savings initiatives. 
And currently, we fully expect to generate the cash flow in 2016 and beyond to invest in our business and fund the dividend while targeting $800 million to $1 billion in year-end cash. That said, our board has final decision on a dividend and it reviews the dividend on a quarterly basis. 
Looking beyond 2016 into 2017, we have greater confidence that we can achieve meaningful operating leverage through a combination of continued momentum in core brands, both domestically and in key international markets; a strong revenue tailwind from the theatrical release of Cars 3 in 2017; a return to more normal levels of P&L investments and sales adjustments in advertising; and line of sight into additional cost savings programs above and beyond our current programs. 
In closing, we told you last year that our challenges were grounded in execution. We believe that the results you see today reflect significant progress against those challenges as well as a solid foundation to build on going forward. And while there's more work ahead of us, we remain committed to turning around our top line while maintaining our financial discipline. And we see a clear path to approaching our long-term operating margin objective of 15% to 20% as early as 2017. We remain firmly committed to delivering long-term value to our shareholders.

So that's what we're tracking to. I think what Kevin tried to set up was, as a higher percentage of the mix related to Disney Princess in the first and second quarter, so it makes the challenge obviously a little bit harder as we enter the year. But broadly, we feel pretty good that we have the programs in place to hold the top line flat. And on the margins, we don't expect really much change in mix in this coming year. I think it's pretty much on balance with the loss of Disney and some of the other things we've got on our core brand. So I wouldn't expect an up or down either way on that one.

And we're going to look to new product drivers in entertainment, Batman v Superman, Captain America, and of course, continue with Star Wars."

And more importantly, we created a lot of goodwill for the brand, encouraging us to continue down the strategic path of diversity and choice for the brand with its most recent launch, again, as you've seen. The HALO effect of this over the whole brand is something that we are watching and watching play out pretty carefully. Retailers are very excited with the changes that they see on the line, both from a marketing perspective as well as product.

We've got, obviously, the Batman v Superman and a trilogy of movies going forward well into 2017 and '18. The MEGA business for us, which we haven't talked a lot about, is strong and leveraging the platform itself and attracting new partners. Clearly, we're launching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles license, which is going to be a terrific sleeper for us as well on a movie year. So we know that, that's going to prove itself out. We've got some great new content partnerships that we've discussed that will both fuel core brands as well as some new that you'll hear about at Toy Fair. And last, but not least, there's some really exciting programs in emerging markets, where we continue to grow, as the statistics show, but with even more fuel, if you will, to provide the right tools and the right product and the right content to help execute and grow market share in those areas.

Today, I'm going to lead things off with a brief perspective on both the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as usual, we'll open things up at the end for any questions you might have. 
So let me begin by saying that overall, we're very encouraged by the start of the year and particularly with our ability to hold the top line as we offset the loss of Disney Princess. We also made some good progress against our cost reduction goals, both in cost of goods and in SG&A. The offsetting negative, of course, continues to be significant headwinds in foreign exchange, both in translation and transaction, which depressed our gross margins in the quarter. We also recorded a $26 million charge and other income to recognize adjustments from Venezuela's currency devaluation, which I think most of you know has severely impacted most corporations with operations in that country. Putting aside foreign exchange, the net message is that we continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities, and we also remain on track to execute well and to deliver on our outlook for this year. We're certainly setting up well to restore real growth in 2017 and beyond. 
Our shipments in POS were closely aligned in this quarter, with POS positive and shipments off slightly in constant currency. We were also encouraged by solid POS trends on key core brands like Barbie, Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels and by a number of our key brands within the Toy Box. Importantly, our retail space also stabilized versus last year and shelf productivity has remained strong, which we expect will support some expansion opportunities on shelf space this fall. We'll also continue to execute well broadly across much of our customer base. And to this latter point, while North America remains a good leading indicator of our progress with positive shipping in the quarter, we're also seeing some fairly broad-based strength across most regions and, particularly, in our emerging markets. 
Now for the middle of the P&L, we also made some good progress and we do remain on track with our cost targets, the performance of which was largely massed, at least in gross margin, by the impact of currencies. And here, it's important to point out that on a constant currency basis, gross margin was actually relatively stable. Looking ahead, we expect the cost savings to accelerate through the balance of the year. We also expect the seasonal impacts from foreign exchange and from the loss of Disney Princess to begin to mitigate. And that, we're still tracking to our expectations.  
Finally, I'll note that our balance sheet remains strong. We're continuing to invest in the business and to maintain our dividend. So to summarize, we're encouraged and we remain cautiously optimistic about the way the year is setting up. It's early and we still have a lot of work ahead, but we're executing well, our entertainment drivers and most of our important brands are performing. We're expanding rapidly in key emerging markets and we're getting out the cost that we expect it to. A little help from foreign exchange would be nice as well, but we do think we have this accounted for as we move through the year. 
So what this all means is we continue to see things taking shape much as we communicated to you in February at Toy Fair. Our outlook for 2016 is largely unchanged and we're tracking well for strong performance next year. 
And with that as a set up, let me turn things over to Richard to highlight some of our topline progress and our core initiatives, and he'll be followed by Kevin, who will give you a lot more color on our performance and on our outlook. Richard?"

As Chris said, we're making progress on many fronts, with lots of positive indicators of our success, not the least of which is the attention Mattel's transformation is receiving worldwide. Consumers and the media are once again focused on our brands and our products rather than our challenges. And while much of the attention we've been receiving has revolved around key strategic priorities, we attribute our success largely to quarter after quarter of solid execution. And our first quarter execution demonstrates that we're off to a good start with consumer Takeaway and Shipping, giving us even more confidence that we can achieve our 2016 goal to hold the topline relatively flat in constant currency. 
Let's review some specifics. We were pleased to see continued positive global POS up 2% normalizing for the Easter holiday with considerable POS strength in international markets. One of the most encouraging stats this quarter is that we almost completely offset the loss of the Disney Princess license, which represented about $100 million or 10% of last year's sales. This was accomplished through great execution across the entire organization. And when the impact of Disney Princess is excluded, Mattel's positive POS performance improved significantly to the mid-single digits, with shipping up high single digits. It wasn't that long ago when we began to transform the company's culture and reset our approach to brand management with the creation of our core brand teams and the Toy Box organization. While recognizing we have more work to do, the first quarter results continues to demonstrate our conviction to fundamentally change our approach to the business. These trends also continue to validate our strategic initiatives, ongoing revitalization of our core brands, the rebuilding of our relationships with strategic license partners, accelerated growth in emerging markets and a much more effective presence at retail. 
So let's take a closer look at results. Overall, our strong holiday season led to reduced retail inventories on key brands and we were encouraged by retailer confidence in our business as they look to restock their shelves with Mattel products in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of Forex, we saw strong shipping numbers on many of our brands, including Barbie, Fisher-Price, Hot Wheels, Thomas and MEGA Brands. And we saw strong consumer and retail support for our new DC Comics executions. We continue to be pleased with Barbie's performance coming off such a strong holiday season with global POS and shipping closely aligned in the first quarter. As you know, last year, we were essentially relaunching and Barbie and saw tremendous results, particularly in the U.S. where POS was up double digits. And from that new base, we continue to see positive POS here in the U.S. And with shipping up 11%, we are also beginning to see this momentum broaden with positive Barbie POS in Europe and Asia. Now we have more work to do, but we will continue to build on the brand's resurgence in North America and the very strong response we are seeing with our Barbie marketing strategy and new breadth of product. We will also be increasing our successful marketing to moms to drive brand preference. Looking forward, expect us to build on the successes, many exciting innovations, including those you saw recently at Toy Fair. We're confident that Barbie will only become more engaging and relevant to girls and moms as we move forward toward holiday 2016. 
But remember, Mattel is not just a Barbie story. Fisher-Price results for the quarter reflect positive POS trends with very strong shipping. We were pleased to see our biggest segment, Baby, have particularly solid POS and shipping in the quarter, notably in international markets. We're seeking to accelerate that momentum as we continue to emphasize early childhood development, the most important demand driver in the category today. We've already seen a tremendous response to our new Think and Learn line with the widely-anticipated Code-a-Pillar product set to launch later this year. 
In addition, earlier this month, we're excited to formally announce the appointment of one of today's most popular designers, Jonathan Adler, as creative director for the Fisher-Price brand. You'll begin to see his influence this fall and we are hard at work leveraging his unique understanding of lifestyle aesthetics for today's families with more sophisticated Fisher-Price style, fashion and function for 2017. 
Thomas and Hot Wheels each continue to see solid POS and shipping trends, particularly in international markets. Both brands have exciting new content and products this year to support the strong momentum we're seeing on these brands. 
Now as we said in February, American Girl results will be challenging in the first half of this year as the major new initiatives to generate positive brand momentum will be coming online in the third and fourth quarters. We continue to take meaningful steps to energize this brand. And as I mentioned in our last update, there are some specific price value issues that we are addressing as well as an improved distribution and expanded consumer engagement. I'll be sharing more on these as the year progresses. 
Monster High has yet to stabilize. Despite some success with our new offerings, the decline in POS and competitive product launches have impacted its shelf space and overall performance. Consumer engagement continues to build with this brand with over 2 million subscribers on Facebook, over 800,000 monthly visits to the website and a significant growth in views on YouTube. Our focus remains on how to connect this great brand energy with more toys sales. As you know, we are effectively relaunching the brand in the second half of this year with a new look, new content, a refocus on popular core characters, more features and enhanced play value. We remain cautiously optimistic, but realistically hope to see improving POS trends in the second half of the year, which will be a leading indicator that the brand is stabilizing as we exit 2016. 
Turning now to Toy Box. We've been very encouraged by early consumer demand for our new DC Super Hero Girls line, even though some of its content just went live late in Q1. While currently an exclusive launch at target, its retail presence will go broader in June. On a related note, we are very pleased with the initial response our DC superheroes Batman v Superman product with the blockbuster film premiering the last week of the quarter. And we're excited to watch how this franchise builds as we continue to support the extensive upcoming DC movie slate. 
And lastly, I'd like to highlight the solid performance of MEGA Brands construction globally. We continue to see very strong results with MEGA's preschool executions, our own brand overlays at Monster High and American Girl as well as the initial popularity of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles product lined ahead of the June movie release. 
Overall, I am pleased with the company's performance. I'm proud of the continuing progress in resetting Mattel's culture to be more innovative, more competitive and more efficient. We have both significant opportunities and significant challenges to face this year and I'm encouraged by our execution to date and look forward to reporting more progress to you throughout the year. As Chris said, our progress to date has generated strong momentum to build on and we are increasingly well-positioned for growth and greater profitability in 2017 and beyond. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin?"

As Chris said, foreign exchange continues to negatively impact our financial results in the first quarter. Overall, our results were in line with our expectations. Specifically, we're encouraged by our top",1699,"Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris said, foreign exchange continues to negatively impact our financial results in the first quarter. Overall, our results were in line with our expectations. Specifically, we're encouraged by our top line performance as growth in our revenues of our core brands and Toy Box almost fully offset the loss of the Disney Princess license. We also made significant progress on executing our cost savings programs, which resulted in roughly flat year-over-year operating margin on a reported basis. 
Before going into detail, I want to remind everyone that unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to sales in constant currency and adjusted financial results that exclude certain items related to our acquisitions of MEGA, Fuhu and Sproutling as well as severance expense. So highlighting the topline trends, gross sales were down just 1% in constant currency or 6% as reported. This included growth in North America and Europe despite the loss of the Disney Princess license business. 
We continue to see double-digit growth in China, but our Asia-Pacific region declined modestly, primarily due to Australia. Latin America also declined as Mexico continues to deliver solid growth, but our business in Brazil has been impacted by macroeconomic weakness, pricing challenges and inventory overhang. And of course, the underlying trends looks much more favorable when we exclude Disney Princess with overall gross sales up high single digits for the quarter. This included broad-based growth across all regions except Latin America, where sales were flat. Overall, very solid topline performance on an underlying basis. These early leads are very encouraging as continued strong growth in our core brands and Toy Box revenues are the key for us to achieve our goal of relatively flat sales for the full year. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L, sales adjustments were relatively flat versus the prior year as a percentage of net sales where we continue to invest in retail promotions to drive POS and shipping for the first quarter and full year. As Chris said, our gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year in constant currency but 44.7% as reported. As we said in our 2016 outlook, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind for the full year. We expected that particularly in the first half on a gross margin rate basis due to the seasonality quarters and tougher year-over-year comparisons. And we saw this in the first quarter with around 340 of the 410 basis point decline in gross margins attributable to unfavorable foreign exchange. Almost half the negative impact from foreign exchange could be explained by less favorable euro hedging rates in 2016 versus 2015. Another driver is the fact that we're selling inventory that was produced last year at less favorable rates when the dollar significantly strengthened against key currencies. 
In the first quarter, we also saw strong trends in growth in countries with more volatile currencies like Mexico and Russia versus 2015. Looking forward, we expect this to balance out, particularly in the second half of the year with higher seasonal revenues. 
The other key driver of the decline in gross margin rate in the quarter was related to mix shift from our higher-margin dollar business given, the loss of Disney Princess to lower-margin product lines like MEGA and Fisher-Price. And finally, as it relates to our overall gross margin, what's encouraging is that our cost savings initiatives more than offset inflation while continuing to improve our price value proposition. 
Moving beyond gross margin, advertising was lower as we begin to move somewhat closer to the 12% for the full year coupled with the benefit of foreign exchange. On a positive note, adjusted SG&A was down $25 million or 7% year-over-year as cost savings and favorable foreign exchange more than offset labor-related inflation. In total, we deliver gross cost savings of $46 million in the quarter, roughly evenly split between the gross margins and SG&A. 
Finally, adjusted EPS was a negative $0.13 per share or negative $0.21 as reported. As some of you may know in February, the Venezuelan government change its official exchange rate, which reprompted a devaluation this quarter. As a result, reported EPS included a $0.06 negative impact from the remeasurement of our Bolivar denominated assets primarily cash in Venezuela, which we excluded from adjusted EPS. 
As it relates to our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with around $600 million in cash, a similar quarter-over-quarter change to where we ended the fourth quarter of 2015. This was in line with our expectations and reflects solid performance, especially when you consider the roughly $30 million cash [indiscernible] for the acquisition of Fuhu and Sproutling and roughly $20 million reduction in cash due to the Venezuelan devaluation. 
Not surprisingly, owned inventory on our balance sheet was up year-over-year as we position the business to support our new licensed entertainment launches throughout the year in addition to the continued positive POS trends in the global basis, including great momentum into launches for MEGA. 
Receivables were also up due to the later timing of the customer shipments as well as the impact of longer term for some of our emerging market customers. We did see a benefit this quarter from our efforts around extending key vendor terms to match industry norms over the last 2 years with the latest extension implemented in May of 2015. This favorability should moderate going forward based on the timing when we implemented these changes in 2015. However, we'll continue to emphasize even greater overall discipline in accounts payable management going forward as we continue to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining the dividend. As we've said, dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business. And the board declared a second quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
As we look ahead to our second quarter and full year 2016 outlook, we're targeting gross sales in the second quarter to reflect similar year-over-year trends to what we achieved in the first quarter or relatively flat on a constant currency basis. Although Disney Princess comparisons get easier, we believe there's some benefit in the first quarter from initial retail destocking of Mattel products due to low beginning inventory levels on shelf. Offsetting this is earlier results from key incremental revenue drivers, which looks promising, and this momentum should continue in the second quarter and beyond. 
As it relates to gross margin, we believe the second quarter gross margin rate will be roughly flat to the first quarter with supply chain efficiencies and cost savings partially offsetting foreign exchange headwinds. And we believe we'll continue to see year-over-year savings on adjusted SG&A in the second quarter driven by continued efficiencies in cost savings initiatives. However, the year-over-year improvement will be less than what we saw in Q1 in part due to the full quarter addition of Fuhu SG&A. As such, we expect second quarter adjusted SG&A spending to be modestly down versus the first quarter run rate in dollars.  
Finally, despite a significant first half headwinds, our full year P&L outlook for 2016 remains unchanged. I'll briefly focus on the key drivers. We're still looking to deliver relatively flat net sales in constant currency. On gross margin, we continue to target about 50% for the full year, similar to what we achieved in 2015. Specifically, there are 2 key drivers of first half headwinds that should moderate in the second half. The first is foreign exchange. Assuming current spot rates and our current hedge position, for reference, foreign exchange had roughly positive 100 basis point impact to gross margin rate in the first half of 2015 versus roughly a negative 200 basis point impact to gross margin rate in the second half. For the second half of the year, we expect the impact of foreign exchange to moderate as seasonal revenues are significantly higher in the second half. The hedge euro rate differential for the second half is closer to hedge rate for 2015. Country mix should balance out. We offset some of the foreign exchange with price increases on the fall line and easier year-over-year gross margin rate comparisons. 
The second factor is mix. As we look to the second half, we expect that the negative impact of Disney Princess mix will lessen since it's smaller relative to our overall revenues, and we should see the benefit from expected growth in our doll business, including Barbie, the global launch of DC Superheroes and strong initiatives on American Girl. And importantly, as we ramp up production in the second quarter and work towards peak production, we expect structural supply chain savings to accelerate, which will be positive gross margin for the second half. 
Lastly, we continue to target adjusted SG&A to be down $55 million to $65 million year-over-year. Our previous outlook excluded SG&A, Fuhu and Sproutling, which we have recently acquired. However, we'll look to absorb the bulk of the overhead from Fuhu and Sproutling acquisitions by aggressively pursuing additional cost savings opportunities. 
Finally, looking beyond this year of transition as Chris said, we see a path to approaching our 15% to 20% operating margin target in 2017 as we have a tailwind on top line revenues from Cars 3 movie and continued traction in China, Russia and emerging markets. Beyond the key drivers already discussed, Fuhu and Sproutling will help offset the earnings impact related to the increased SG&A in 2016, but we expect sales to ramp up in 2017 as we leverage the technology platform across the portfolio and expand our market opportunities. 
In closing, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves in this seasonally small quarter, but the turnaround continues to track to our expectations. Our global POS remains positive, which is driving further shelf space stabilization for key core brands and a shipping recovery across most of our regions when you exclude Disney Princess. If these trends continue, it should set a solid foundation for growth and improved profitability in 2017. 
We look forward to updating you on the core progress throughout the year, and we'll now open the call up to questions. Operator?"

But how we achieved in 2016 will be a little bit different than how we achieved it in our historical averages, would rely more on pricing and better mix.

Also, product and pricing had a great impact in the continuation of that trend with Fisher-Price. Generally speaking, as we sort of look ahead, we continued to leverage the momentum that we currently have especially in international markets. The strength across the baby business will continue. There is some amplified marketing as we continue with our Best Possible Start campaign that's gotten a great traction. The continued brand evolution tied to child development is really rich with content and connectivity as we've said, particularly in emerging markets like China. And even as we reenter the preschool learning category more aggressively with our Think and Learn line, the Code-a-Pillar, which I mentioned is a key item for us, is getting a lot of attention and traction. We anticipate that, that will be just one of many early childhood development items that Fisher-Price becomes well known for. Not to belabor the point of Jonathan Adler's appointment, but I think the aesthetic piece of what he'll bring to the overall brand will be important as we move and developed aligned with a bit more fashion sensibility. And, of course, as we mentioned, no content, new partnerships with 9 story, DHX all fuel that particular segment of the brand. So we're confident in our strategic path going forward and certainly, early read in suggesting that we're heading in the right direction."

But we have incremental programs around structural cost savings related to cost of goods sold as well as SG&A that will be in excess of what Funding Our Future is. So as we look at the cadence of the year, the inventory that we're selling in the first quarter we produced last year. As I said on the call earlier, that as we ramp up our seasonal production in the second quarter and get peak production in the third quarter, we should see more flow-through from these structural savings in the second half of the year. And that will help us, as I said, to improve our year-over-year gross margins in the second half of the year along with better mix and less impact of foreign exchange in the second half of the year."

And when you digest it at least dissect international markets, there's develop ---ed developing markets, there's developed markets and there's a variety of different things that going to the play of the brand. But overall, what we're seeing now is the up getting traction on POS with Barbie. Asia also getting traction on POS Barbie. Latin America is still catching up. We have some work to do in Latin America. But overall, we're seeing great connectivity. Frankly, the successful campaign that we ran this year, the You Can Be Anything campaign that was slightly acclaimed didn't get executed throughout international, so that's still new in some cases and rolling out as we speak. Some of the new product that we launched year in the U.S. is also executed later in certain markets. Our DVD calendar in terms of distribution and marketing is also slightly different in international markets, so I think overall, I would take a look at the Domino of the business being North America at the lead indicator of where the brand should be going and could be going. And so far, the indications here are very good and the tail and the context of international is catching up."

Today, I'm going to lead things off with a brief perspective on both the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as usual, we'll open things up at the end for any questions you might have. 
So let me begin by saying that, overall, we're very encouraged by the start of the year and particularly with our ability to hold the top line as we offset the loss of Disney Princess. We also made some good progress against our cost reduction goals, both in the cost of goods and in SG&A. The offsetting negative, of course, continues to be significant headwinds in foreign exchange, both in translation and transaction, which depressed our gross margins in the quarter. 
We also recorded a $26 million charge in other income to recognize adjustments from Venezuela's currency devaluation, which I think most of you know has severely impacted most corporations with operations in that country. But putting aside foreign exchange, the net message is that we continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities and we also remain on track to execute well and to deliver on our outlook for this year. And we're certainly setting up well to restore real growth in 2017 and beyond. 
And our shipments and POS were closely aligned in this quarter, with POS positive and shipments off slightly in constant currency. We are also encouraged by solid POS trends on key core brands like Barbie, Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels and by a number of our key brands within the Toy Box. Importantly, our retail space also stabilized versus last year, and shelf productivity has remained strong, which we expect will support some expansion opportunities on shelf space this fall. 
We also continued to execute well broadly across much of our customer base. And to this latter point, while North America remains a good leading indicator of our progress, with positive shipping in the quarter, we're also seeing some fairly broad-based strength across most regions and particularly in our emerging markets. 
Now as for the middle of the P&L, we also made some good progress and we do remain on track with our cost targets, the performance of which was largely massed, at least in gross margin, by the impact of currencies. And here, it's important to point out that on a constant currency basis, gross margin was actually relatively stable. 
Now looking ahead, we expect the cost savings to accelerate through the balance of the year and we also expect the seasonal impacts from foreign exchange and from the loss of Disney Princess to begin to mitigate, and that, we're still tracking to our expectations. And finally, I'd note that our balance sheet remains strong and we're continuing to invest in the business and to maintain our dividend. 
So to summarize, we're encouraged and we remain cautiously optimistic about the way the year is setting up. It's early and we still have a lot of work ahead, but we're executing well, our entertainment drivers and most of our important brands are performing. We're expanding rapidly in key emerging markets. And we're getting out the cost that we expected to. A little help from foreign exchange would be nice as well, but we do think we have this accounted for as we move through the year. 
So what this all means is that we continue to see things taking shape much as we communicated to you in February at Toy Fair. Our outlook for 2016 is largely unchanged, and we're tracking well for strong performance next year. 
And with that as a setup, let me turn things over to Richard to highlight some of our top line progress and our core initiatives, and he'll be followed by Kevin, who will give you a lot more color on our performance and on our outlook. Richard?"

As Chris said, we're making progress on many fronts, with lots of positive indicators of our success, not the least of which is the attention Mattel's transformation is receiving worldwide. Consumers and the media are once again focused on our brands and our products rather than our challenges. And while much of the attention we've been receiving has revolved around key strategic priorities, we attribute our success largely to quarter after quarter of solid execution. And our first quarter execution demonstrates that we're off to a good start with consumer takeaway and shipping, giving us even more confidence that we can achieve our 2016 goal to hold the top line relatively flat in constant currency. 
Let's review some specifics. We were pleased to see continued positive global POS up 2%, normalizing for the Easter holiday, with considerable POS strength in international markets. One of the most encouraging stats this quarter is that we almost completely offset the loss of the Disney Princess license, which represented about $100 million or 10% of last year's sales. This was accomplished through great execution across the entire organization. And when the impact of Disney Princess is excluded, Mattel's positive POS performance improved significantly to the mid-single digits, with shipping up high single digits. It wasn't that long ago that we began to transform the company's culture and reset our approach to brand management with the creation of our core brand teams and the Toy Box organization. While recognizing we have more work to do, the first quarter results continues to demonstrate our conviction to fundamentally change our approach to the business. These trends also continue to validate our strategic initiatives, ongoing revitalization of our core brands, the rebuilding of relationships with strategic license partners, accelerated growth in emerging markets and a much more effective presence at retail. 
So let's take a closer look at results. Overall, our strong holiday season led to reduced retail inventories on key brands and we were encouraged by retailer confidence in our business as they look to restock their shelves with Mattel products in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of Forex, we saw strong shipping numbers on many of our brands, including Barbie, Fisher-Price, Hot Wheels, Thomas and MEGA Brands. And we saw strong consumer and retail support for our new DC Comics executions. We continue to be pleased with Barbie's performance coming off such a strong holiday season, with global POS and shipping closely aligned in the first quarter. 
As you know, last year, we were essentially relaunching Barbie and saw tremendous results, particularly in the U.S., where POS was up double digits. And from that new base, we continue to see positive POS here in the U.S., and with shipping up 11%, we are also beginning to see this momentum broaden, with positive Barbie POS in Europe and Asia. Now we have more work to do, but we will continue to build on the brand's resurgence in North America and the very strong response we are seeing with our Barbie marketing strategy and new breadth of product. We will also be increasing our successful marketing to moms to drive brand preference. Looking forward, expect us to build on these successes, with many exciting innovations, including those you saw recently at Toy Fair. We're confident that Barbie will only become more engaging and relevant to girls and moms as we move forward toward holiday 2016. 
But remember, Mattel is not just a Barbie story. Fisher-Price results for the quarter reflect positive POS trends with very strong shipping. We were pleased to see our biggest segment, Baby, have particularly solid POS and shipping in the quarter, notably in international markets. We're seeking to accelerate this momentum as we continue to emphasize early childhood development, the most important demand driver in the category today. We've already seen a tremendous response to our new Think & Learn lines, with the widely anticipated Code-a-Pillar product set to launch later this year. 
In addition, earlier this month, we were excited to formally announce the appointment of one of today's most popular designers, Jonathan Adler, as Creative Director for the Fisher-Price brand. You'll begin to see his influence this fall, and we are hard at work leveraging his unique understanding of lifestyle aesthetics for today's families with more sophisticated Fisher-Price style, fashion and function for 2017. 
Thomas and Hot Wheels each continue to see solid POS and shipping trends, particularly in the international markets. Both brands have exciting new content and products this year to support the strong momentum we're seeing on these brands. 
Now as we said in February, American Girl results will be challenging in the first half of this year as the major new initiatives to generate positive brand momentum will be coming online in the third and fourth quarters. We continue to take meaningful steps to energize this brand. And as I mentioned in our last update, there are some specific price value issues that we are addressing as well as improved distribution and expanded consumer engagement. I'll be sharing more on these as the year progresses. 
Monster High has yet to stabilize. Despite some success with our new offerings, the decline in POS and competitive product launches have impacted its shelf space and overall performance. Consumer engagement continues to build with this brand with over 2 million subscribers on Facebook, over 800,000 monthly visits to the website and significant growth in views on YouTube. Our focus remains on how to connect this great brand energy with more toy sales. As you know, we are effectively relaunching the brand in the second half of this year with a new look, new content, a refocus on popular core characters, more features and enhanced play value. We remain cautiously optimistic but realistically hope to see improving POS trends in the second half of the year, which will be a leading indicator that the brand is stabilizing as we exit 2016. 
Turning now to Toy Box. We've been very encouraged by early consumer demand for our new DC Super Hero Girls line, even though some of its content just went live late in Q1. While currently an exclusive launch at Target, its retail presence will go broader in June. On a related note, we are very pleased with the initial response to our DC Super Heroes Batman v Superman product, with the blockbuster film premiering the last week of the quarter. And we're excited to watch how this franchise builds as we continue to support the extensive upcoming DC movie slate. 
And lastly, I'd like to highlight the solid performance of MEGA Brands construction globally. We continue to see very strong results with MEGA's preschool executions, our own brand overlays of Monster High and American Girl as well as the initial popularity of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle product line ahead of the June movie release. 
Overall, I am pleased with the company's performance. I'm proud of the continuing progress on resetting Mattel's culture to be more innovative, more competitive and more efficient. We have both significant opportunities and significant challenges to face this year, and I'm encouraged by our execution to date and look forward to reporting more progress to you throughout the year. As Chris said, our progress to date has generated strong momentum to build on, and we are increasingly well positioned for growth and greater profitability in 2017 and beyond. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin?"

Specifically, we're encouraged by our top",1712,"Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris said, foreign exchange continues to negatively impact our financial results in the first quarter. Overall, our results were in line with our expectations. Specifically, we're encouraged by our top line performance as growth in our revenues of our core brands and Toy Box almost fully offset the loss of the Disney Princess license. We also made significant progress on executing our cost savings programs, which resulted in roughly flat year-over-year operating margin on a reported basis. 
Before going into detail, I want to remind everyone that unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to sales in constant currency and adjusted financial results that exclude certain items related to our acquisitions of MEGA, Fuhu and Sproutling as well as severance expense. 
So highlighting the top line trends, gross sales were down just 1% in constant currency or 6% as reported. This included growth in North America and Europe despite the loss of the Disney Princess license business. 
We continue to see double-digit growth in China, but our Asia Pacific region declined modestly, primarily due to Australia. Latin America also declined as Mexico continues to deliver solid growth, but our business in Brazil has been impacted by microeconomic weakness, pricing challenges and inventory overhang. And of course, the underlying trends looks much more favorable when we exclude Disney Princess, with overall gross sales up high single digits for the quarter. This included broad-based growth across all regions except Latin America, where sales were flat. Overall, a very solid top line performance on an underlying basis. These early reads are very encouraging as continued strong growth in our core brands and Toy Box revenues are the key for us to achieve our goal of relatively flat sales for the full year. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L, sales adjustments were relatively flat versus the prior year as a percentage of net sales, where we continue to invest in retail promotions to drive POS and shipping for the first quarter and full year. As Chris said, our gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year in constant currency but 44.7% as reported. As we said in our 2016 outlook, we expect foreign exchange would be a headwind for the full year. We expected that particularly in the first half on a gross margin rate basis due to the seasonally smaller quarters and tougher year-over-year comparisons. And we saw this in the first quarter with around 340 of the 410 basis point decline in gross margins attributable to unfavorable foreign exchange. Almost half the negative impact from foreign exchange could be explained by less favorable euro hedging rates in 2016 versus 2015. Another driver is the fact that we're selling inventory that was produced last year at less favorable rates when the dollar significantly strengthened against key currencies. 
In the first quarter, we also saw strong trends in growth in countries with more volatile currencies, like Mexico and Russia, versus 2015. Looking forward, we expect this to balance out, particularly in the second half of the year, with higher seasonal revenues. 
The other key driver of the decline in gross margin rate in the quarter was related to a mix shift from our higher-margin dollar business, given the loss of Disney Princess, to lower-margin product lines like MEGA and Fisher-Price. And finally, as it relates to our overall gross margin, what's encouraging is that our cost savings initiatives more than offset inflation while continuing to improve our price value propositions. 
Moving beyond gross margin, advertising was lower as we begin to move somewhat closer to the 12% for the full year, coupled with the benefit of foreign exchange. On a positive note, adjusted SG&A was down $25 million or 7% year-over-year as cost savings and favorable foreign exchange more than offset labor-related inflation. In total, we delivered gross cost savings of $46 million in the quarter, roughly evenly split between gross margin and SG&A. 
Finally, adjusted EPS was a negative $0.13 per share or negative $0.21 as reported. As some of you may know in February, the Venezuelan government changed its official exchange rate, which reprompted a devaluation this quarter. As a result, reported EPS included a $0.06 negative impact from the remeasurement of our bolivar-denominated assets, primarily cash in Venezuela, which we excluded from adjusted EPS. 
As it relates to our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with around $600 million in cash, a similar quarter-over-quarter change to where we ended the fourth quarter of 2015. This was in line with our expectation and reflects solid performance, especially when you consider the roughly $30 million cash outright for the acquisition of Fuhu and Sproutling and roughly $20 million reduction in cash due to the Venezuelan devaluation. 
Not surprisingly, owned inventory on our balance sheet was up year-over-year as we position the business to support our new licensed entertainment launches throughout the year, in addition to the continued positive POS trends on a global basis, including great momentum and new launches for MEGA. 
Receivables were also up due to later timing of the customer shipments as well as the impact of longer terms for some of our emerging market customers. We did see a benefit this quarter from our efforts around extending key vendor terms to match industry norms over the last 2 years, with the latest extension implemented in May of 2015. This favorability should moderate going forward based on the timing when we implemented these changes in 2015. However, we'll continue to emphasize even greater overall discipline in accounts payable management going forward as we continue to reward our shareholders by our deploying capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining the dividend. As we have said, dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business. And the board declared a second quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
As we look ahead to our second quarter and full year 2016 outlook, we're targeting gross sales in the second quarter to reflect similar year-over-year trends to what we achieved in the first quarter or relatively flat on a constant currency basis. Although Disney Princess comparisons get easier, we believe there's some benefit in the first quarter from initial retail restocking of Mattel products due to low beginning inventory levels on shelf. Offsetting this is earlier results from key incremental revenue drivers, which look promising, and this momentum should continue in the second quarter and beyond. 
As it relates to gross margin, we believe the second quarter gross margin rate will be roughly flat to the first quarter, with supply chain efficiencies and cost savings partially offsetting foreign exchange headwinds. And we believe we'll continue to see year-over-year savings on adjusted SG&A in the second quarter, driven by continued efficiencies in cost savings initiatives. However, the year-over-year improvement will be less than what we saw in Q1, in part due to the full quarter addition of Fuhu SG&A. As such, we expect second quarter adjusted SG&A spending to be modestly down versus the first quarter run rate in dollars.  
Finally, despite the significant first half headwinds, our full year P&L outlook for 2016 remains unchanged. I'll briefly focus on the key drivers. We're still looking to deliver relatively flat net sales in constant currency. On gross margin, we continue to target about 50% for the full year, similar to what we achieved in 2015. Specifically, there are 2 key drivers of first half headwinds that should moderate in the second half. The first is foreign exchange. Assuming current spot rates and our current hedge position, for reference, foreign exchange had roughly a positive 100 basis points impact to gross margin rate in the first half of 2015 versus roughly a negative 200 basis point impact to gross margin rate in the second half. For the second half of the year, we expect that the impact of foreign exchange will moderate as seasonal revenues are significantly higher in the second half. The hedged euro rate differential for the second half is closer to the hedge rate for 2015. Country mix should balance out. We offset some of the foreign exchange with price increases on the fall line and easier year-over-year gross margin rate comparisons. 
The second factor is mix. As we look to the second half, we expect that the negative impact of Disney Princess mix will lessen since it is smaller relative to our overall revenues, and we should see the benefit from expected growth in our doll business, including Barbie, the global launch of DC Super Heroes and strong initiatives on American Girl. And importantly, as we ramp up production in the second quarter and work towards peak production, we expect structural supply chain savings to accelerate, which will be positive gross margin for the second half. 
Lastly, we continue to target adjusted SG&A to be down $55 million to $65 million year-over-year. Our previous outlook, excluded SG&A from Fuhu and Sproutling, which we had recently acquired. However, we'll look to absorb the bulk of the overhead from Fuhu and Sproutling acquisitions by aggressively pursuing additional cost savings opportunities. 
Finally, looking beyond this year of transition, as Chris said, we see a path to approaching our 15% to 20% operating margin target in 2017 as we have a tailwind on top line revenues from the Cars 3 movie and continued traction in China, Russia and emerging markets. Beyond the key drivers we've already discussed, Fuhu and Sproutling will help offset the earnings impact related to their increased SG&A in 2016, but we expect sales to ramp up in 2017 as we leverage their technology platform across our portfolio and expand our market opportunities. 
In closing, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves in a seasonally small quarter, but the turnaround continues to track to our expectations. Our global POS remains positive, which is driving further shelf space stabilization for key core brands and a shipping recovery across most of our regions when you exclude Disney Princess. If these trends continue, it should set a solid foundation for growth and improved profitability in 2017. 
We look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year, and we'll now open the call up to questions. Operator?"

As we look at the second half of the year, we're going to really achieve it through acceleration of cost of goods sold, through supply-chain structural changes, which don't impact our price value propositions. So it's going to be more about accelerating cost savings and structural supply chain in the second half of the year."

UNO continues to grow and is a legacy brand in our portfolio, and the team there is doing an incredible job of keeping that brand relevant in driving units. MEGA continues to be outstanding for us overall, had a great quarter internationally, specifically, as well as the U.S., and we continue to get traction both in the preschool segment as well as leveraging our owned properties, American Girl, Monster High. And of course, as we anticipate the launch of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movie, we think that we're going to have a great hit there. Brands like Minecraft also continue to be really terrific, and the team is doing an excellent job maintaining the relevance of that brand. And brands like Dinotrux, with our partnership with DreamWorks. Blaze also, with Nickelodeon, is doing terrific. There's a lot of great brands within Toy Box that are continuing to be nurtured and developed and are frankly chipping away at our GAAP but ultimately driving some great growth in their own right. As we continue to develop the strategic partnership profile, not only will we do a continued job of driving our existing, but we continue to seek new relationships as well as renew existing relationships. So going forward, Cars, of course, 3, which we've talked about, and lining up even 2018 with Toy Story and others, will be revealed shortly."

I think, as I mentioned, across the board, particularly in international, we were really pleased with the Fisher-Price brand overall.

So we were really pleased with the response that we -- our child development messaging certainly has been having. And also, product and pricing has played a great impact in the continuation of the trend with Fisher-Price. Generally speaking, as we sort of look ahead, we continue to leverage the momentum that we currently have, especially in international markets. The strength across the Baby business will continue. There is some amplified marketing as we continue with our Best Possible Start campaign that's gotten great traction. The continued brand evolution tied to child development is really rich with content and connectivity, as we've said, particularly in emerging markets like China. And even as we reenter the preschool learning category more aggressively with our Think & Learn line, the Code-a-Pillar, which I mentioned, is a key item for us, is getting a lot of attention and traction. We anticipate that, that will be just one of many early childhood development items that Fisher-Price becomes well known for. Not to belabor the point of Jonathan Adler's appointment, but I think the aesthetic piece of what he'll bring to the overall brand will be important as we move and develop the line with a bit more fashion sensibility. And of course, as we mentioned, new content, new partnerships with 9 Story, DHX, all fuel that particular segment of the brand. So we're confident in our strategic path going forward, and certainly, early reads are suggesting we're on the -- we're heading in the right direction."

Today, I'm going to lead things off with a brief perspective on both the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as usual, we'll open things up at the end for any questions you might have. 
So let me begin by saying that, overall, we're very encouraged by the start of the year, and particularly with our ability to hold the top line as we offset the loss of Disney Princess. We also made some good progress against our cost reduction goals, both in the cost of goods and in SG&A. The offsetting negative, of course, continues to be significant headwinds in foreign exchange, both in translation and transaction, which depressed our gross margins in the quarter. 
We also recorded a $26 million charge in other income to recognize adjustments from Venezuela's currency devaluation, which I think most of you know has severely impacted most corporations with operations in that country. But putting aside foreign exchange, the net message is that we continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities and we also remain on track to execute well and to deliver on our outlook for this year. And we're certainly setting up well to restore real growth in 2017 and beyond. 
And our shipments and POS were closely aligned in this quarter, with POS positive and shipments off slightly in constant currency. We are also encouraged by solid POS trends on key core brands like Barbie, Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels and by a number of our key brands within the Toy Box. Importantly, our retail space also stabilized versus last year, and shelf productivity has remained strong, which we expect will support some expansion opportunities on shelf space this fall. 
We also continued to execute well broadly across much of our customer base. And to this latter point, while North America remains a good leading indicator of our progress with positive shipping in the quarter, we're also seeing some fairly broad-based strength across most regions, and particularly in our emerging markets. 
Now as for the middle of the P&L, we also made some good progress and we do remain on track with our cost targets, the performance of which was largely masked, at least in gross margin, by the impact of currencies. And here, it's important to point out that on a constant currency basis, gross margin was actually relatively stable. 
Now looking ahead, we expect the cost savings to accelerate through the balance of the year and we also expect the seasonal impacts from foreign exchange and from the loss of Disney Princess to begin to mitigate, and that we're still tracking to our expectations. And finally, I'd note that our balance sheet remains strong and we're continuing to invest in the business and to maintain our dividend. 
So to summarize, we're encouraged and we remain cautiously optimistic about the way the year is setting up. It's early and we still have a lot of work ahead, but we're executing well, our entertainment drivers and most of our important brands are performing. We're expanding rapidly in key emerging markets. And we're getting out the cost that we expected to. A little help from foreign exchange would be nice as well, but we do think we have this accounted for as we move through the year. 
So what this all means is that we continue to see things taking shape much as we communicated to you in February at Toy Fair. Our outlook for 2016 is largely unchanged, and we're tracking well for strong performance next year. 
And with that as a setup, let me turn things over to Richard to highlight some of our top line progress and our core initiatives, and he'll be followed by Kevin, who will give you a lot more color on our performance and on our outlook. Richard?"

As Chris said, we're making progress on many fronts, with lots of positive indicators of our success, not the least of which is the attention Mattel's transformation is receiving worldwide. Consumers and the media are once again focused",1247,"Thank you, Chris. As Chris said, we're making progress on many fronts, with lots of positive indicators of our success, not the least of which is the attention Mattel's transformation is receiving worldwide. Consumers and the media are once again focused on our brands and our products rather than our challenges. And while much of the attention we've been receiving has revolved around key strategic priorities, we attribute our success largely to quarter after quarter of solid execution. And our first quarter execution demonstrates that we're off to a good start with consumer takeaway and shipping, giving us even more confidence that we can achieve our 2016 goal to hold the top line relatively flat in constant currency. 
Let's review some specifics. We were pleased to see continued positive global POS up 2%, normalizing for the Easter holiday, with considerable POS strength in international markets. One of the most encouraging stats this quarter is that we almost completely offset the loss of the Disney Princess license, which represented about $100 million or 10% of last year's sales. This was accomplished through great execution across the entire organization. And when the impact of Disney Princess is excluded, Mattel's positive POS performance improved significantly to the mid-single digits, with shipping up high single digits. It wasn't that long ago that we began to transform the company's culture and reset our approach to brand management with the creation of our core brand teams and the Toy Box organization. While recognizing we have more work to do, the first quarter results continues to demonstrate our conviction to fundamentally change our approach to the business. These trends also continue to validate our strategic initiatives, ongoing revitalization of our core brands, the rebuilding of relationships with strategic license partners, accelerated growth in emerging markets and a much more effective presence at retail. 
So let's take a closer look at results. Overall, our strong holiday season led to reduced retail inventories on key brands, and we were encouraged by retailer confidence in our business as they look to restock their shelves with Mattel products in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of Forex, we saw strong shipping numbers on many of our brands, including Barbie, Fisher-Price, Hot Wheels, Thomas and MEGA Brands. And we saw strong consumer and retail support for our new DC Comics executions. We continue to be pleased with Barbie's performance coming off such a strong holiday season, with global POS and shipping closely aligned in the first quarter. 
As you know, last year, we were essentially relaunching Barbie and saw tremendous results, particularly in the U.S., where POS was up double digits. And from that new base, we continue to see positive POS here in the U.S., and with shipping up 11%, we are also beginning to see this momentum broaden, with positive Barbie POS in Europe and Asia. Now we have more work to do, but we will continue to build on the brand's resurgence in North America and the very strong response we are seeing with our Barbie marketing strategy and new breadth of product. We will also be increasing our successful marketing to moms to drive brand preference. Looking forward, expect us to build on these successes with many exciting innovations, including those you saw recently at Toy Fair. We're confident that Barbie will only become more engaging and relevant to girls and moms as we move forward toward holiday 2016. 
But remember, Mattel is not just a Barbie story. Fisher-Price results for the quarter reflect positive POS trends with very strong shipping. We were pleased to see our biggest segment, Baby, have particularly solid POS and shipping in the quarter, notably in international markets. We're seeking to accelerate this momentum as we continue to emphasize early childhood development, the most important demand driver in the category today. We've already seen a tremendous response to our new Think & Learn lines, with the widely anticipated Code-a-Pillar product set to launch later this year. 
In addition, earlier this month, we were excited to formally announce the appointment of one of today's most popular designers, Jonathan Adler, as Creative Director for the Fisher-Price brand. You'll begin to see his influence this fall, and we are hard at work leveraging his unique understanding of lifestyle aesthetics for today's families with more sophisticated Fisher-Price style, fashion and function for 2017. 
Thomas and Hot Wheels each continue to see solid POS and shipping trends, particularly in the international markets. Both brands have exciting new content and products this year to support the strong momentum we're seeing on these brands. 
Now as we said in February, American Girl results will be challenging in the first half of this year as the major new initiatives to generate positive brand momentum will be coming online in the third and fourth quarters. We continue to take meaningful steps to energize this brand. And as I mentioned in our last update, there are some specific price/value issues that we are addressing as well as improved distribution and expanded consumer engagement. I'll be sharing more on these as the year progresses. 
Monster High has yet to stabilize. Despite some success with our new offerings, the decline in POS and competitive product launches have impacted its shelf space and overall performance. Consumer engagement continues to build with this brand with over 2 million subscribers on Facebook, over 800,000 monthly visits to the website and significant growth in views on YouTube. Our focus remains on how to connect this great brand energy with more toy sales. As you know, we are effectively relaunching the brand in the second half of this year with a new look, new content, a refocus on popular core characters, more features and enhanced play value. We remain cautiously optimistic, but realistically hope to see improving POS trends in the second half of the year, which will be a leading indicator that the brand is stabilizing as we exit 2016. 
Turning now to Toy Box. We've been very encouraged by early consumer demand for our new DC Super Hero Girls line, even though some of its content just went live late in Q1. While currently an exclusive launch at Target, its retail presence will go broader in June. On a related note, we are very pleased with the initial response to our DC Super Heroes Batman v Superman product, with the blockbuster film premiering the last week of the quarter. And we're excited to watch how this franchise builds as we continue to support the extensive upcoming DC movie slate. 
And lastly, I'd like to highlight the solid performance of MEGA Brands construction globally. We continue to see very strong results with MEGA's preschool executions, our own brand overlays of Monster High and American Girl as well as the initial popularity of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle product line ahead of the June movie release. 
Overall, I am pleased with the company's performance. I'm proud of the continuing progress on resetting Mattel's culture to be more innovative, more competitive and more efficient. We have both significant opportunities and significant challenges to face this year, and I'm encouraged by our execution to date and look forward to reporting more progress to you throughout the year. As Chris said, our progress to date has generated strong momentum to build on, and we are increasingly well positioned for growth and greater profitability in 2017 and beyond. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin?"

As Chris said, foreign exchange continues to negatively impact our financial results in the first quarter. Overall, our results were in line with our expectations. Specifically, we're encouraged by our top",1710,"Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris said, foreign exchange continues to negatively impact our financial results in the first quarter. Overall, our results were in line with our expectations. Specifically, we're encouraged by our top line performance as growth in our revenues of our core brands and Toy Box almost fully offset the loss of the Disney Princess license. We also made significant progress on executing our cost savings programs, which resulted in roughly flat year-over-year operating margin on a reported basis. 
Before going into detail, I want to remind everyone that unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to sales in constant currency and adjusted financial results that exclude certain items related to our acquisitions of MEGA, Fuhu and Sproutling as well as severance expense. 
So highlighting the top line trends, gross sales were down just 1% in constant currency or 6% as reported. This included growth in North America and Europe despite the loss of the Disney Princess license business. 
We continue to see double-digit growth in China, but our Asia Pacific region declined modestly, primarily due to Australia. Latin America also declined as Mexico continues to deliver solid growth, but our business in Brazil has been impacted by microeconomic weakness, pricing challenges and inventory overhang. And of course, the underlying trends look much more favorable when we exclude Disney Princess, with overall gross sales up high single digits for the quarter. This included broad-based growth across all regions except Latin America, where sales were flat. Overall, a very solid top line performance on an underlying basis. These early reads are very encouraging as continued strong growth in our core brands and Toy Box revenues are the key for us to achieve our goal of relatively flat sales for the full year. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L, sales adjustments were relatively flat versus the prior year as a percentage of net sales, where we continue to invest in retail promotions to drive POS and shipping for the first quarter and full year. As Chris said, our gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year in constant currency but 44.7% as reported. As we said in our 2016 outlook, we expect foreign exchange would be a headwind for the full year. We expected that particularly in the first half on a gross margin rate basis due to the seasonally smaller quarters and tougher year-over-year comparisons. And we saw this in the first quarter with around 340 of the 410 basis point decline in gross margins attributable to unfavorable foreign exchange. Almost half the negative impact from foreign exchange could be explained by less favorable euro hedging rates in 2016 versus 2015. Another driver is the fact that we're selling inventory that was produced last year at less favorable rates, when the dollar significantly strengthened against key currencies. 
In the first quarter, we also saw strong trends in growth in countries with more volatile currencies, like Mexico and Russia, versus 2015. Looking forward, we expect this to balance out, particularly in the second half of the year, with higher seasonal revenues. 
The other key driver of the decline in gross margin rate in the quarter was related to a mix shift from our higher-margin doll business, given the loss of Disney Princess, to lower-margin product lines like MEGA and Fisher-Price. And finally, as it relates to our overall gross margin, what's encouraging is that our cost savings initiatives more than offset inflation while continuing to improve our price/value propositions. 
Moving beyond gross margin, advertising was lower as we begin to move somewhat closer to the 12% for the full year, coupled with the benefit of foreign exchange. On a positive note, adjusted SG&A was down $25 million or 7% year-over-year, as cost savings and favorable foreign exchange more than offset labor-related inflation. In total, we delivered gross cost savings of $46 million in the quarter, roughly evenly split between gross margin and SG&A. 
Finally, adjusted EPS was a negative $0.13 per share or negative $0.21 as reported. As some of you may know, in February, the Venezuelan government changed its official exchange rate, which reprompted a devaluation this quarter. As a result, reported EPS included a $0.06 negative impact from the remeasurement of our bolivar-denominated assets, primarily cash in Venezuela, which we excluded from adjusted EPS. 
As it relates to our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with around $600 million in cash, a similar quarter-over-quarter change to where we ended the fourth quarter of 2015. This was in line with our expectation and reflects solid performance, especially when you consider the roughly $30 million cash outlay for the acquisition of Fuhu and Sproutling and roughly $20 million reduction in cash due to the Venezuelan devaluation. 
Not surprisingly, owned inventory on our balance sheet was up year-over-year as we position the business to support our new licensed entertainment launches throughout the year, in addition to the continued positive POS trends on a global basis, including great momentum and new launches for MEGA. 
Receivables were also up due to later timing of the customer shipments as well as the impact of longer terms for some of our emerging market customers. We did see a benefit this quarter from our efforts around extending key vendor terms to match industry norms over the last 2 years, with the latest extension implemented in May of 2015. This favorability should moderate going forward based on the timing when we implemented these changes in 2015. However, we'll continue to emphasize even greater overall discipline in accounts payable management going forward as we continue to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining the dividend. As we have said, dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business. And the board declared a second quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
As we look ahead to our second quarter and full year 2016 outlook, we're targeting gross sales in the second quarter to reflect similar year-over-year trends to what we achieved in the first quarter or relatively flat on a constant currency basis. Although Disney Princess comparisons get easier, we believe there's some benefit in the first quarter from initial retail restocking of Mattel products due to low beginning inventory levels on shelf. Offsetting this is early results from key incremental revenue drivers, which look promising, and this momentum should continue in the second quarter and beyond. 
As it relates to gross margin, we believe the second quarter gross margin rate will be roughly flat to the first quarter, with supply chain efficiencies and cost savings partially offsetting foreign exchange headwinds. And we believe we'll continue to see year-over-year savings on adjusted SG&A in the second quarter, driven by continued efficiencies in cost savings initiatives. However, the year-over-year improvement will be less than what we saw in Q1, in part due to the full quarter addition of Fuhu SG&A. As such, we expect second quarter adjusted SG&A spending to be modestly down versus the first quarter run rate in dollars.  
Finally, despite the significant first half headwinds, our full year P&L outlook for 2016 remains unchanged. I'll briefly focus on the key drivers. We're still looking to deliver relatively flat net sales in constant currency. On gross margin, we continue to target about 50% for the full year, similar to what we achieved in 2015. Specifically, there are 2 key drivers of first half headwinds that should moderate in the second half. The first is foreign exchange. Assuming current spot rates and our current hedge position, for reference, foreign exchange had roughly a positive 100 basis points impact to gross margin rate in the first half of 2015 versus roughly a negative 200 basis point impact to gross margin rate in the second half. For the second half of the year, we expect that the impact of foreign exchange will moderate as seasonal revenues are significantly higher in the second half, the hedged euro rate differential for the second half is closer to the hedge rate for 2015, country mix should balance out, we offset some of the foreign exchange with price increases on the fall line, and easier year-over-year gross margin rate comparisons. 
The second factor is mix. As we look to the second half, we expect that the negative impact of Disney Princess mix will lessen since it is smaller relative to our overall revenues, and we should see the benefit from expected growth in our doll business, including Barbie, the global launch of DC Super Heroes and strong initiatives on American Girl. And importantly, as we ramp up production in the second quarter and work towards peak production, we expect structural supply chain savings to accelerate, which will be positive gross margin for the second half. 
Lastly, we continue to target adjusted SG&A to be down $55 million to $65 million year-over-year. Our previous outlook, excluded SG&A from Fuhu and Sproutling, which we had recently acquired. However, we'll look to absorb the bulk of the overhead from Fuhu and Sproutling acquisitions by aggressively pursuing additional cost savings opportunities. 
Finally, looking beyond this year of transition, as Chris said, we see a path to approaching our 15% to 20% operating margin target in 2017 as we have a tailwind on top line revenues from the Cars 3 movie and continued traction in China, Russia and emerging markets. Beyond the key drivers we've already discussed, Fuhu and Sproutling will help offset the earnings impact related to the increased SG&A in 2016, but we expect sales to ramp up in 2017 as we leverage their technology platform across our portfolio and expand our market opportunities. 
In closing, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves in a seasonally small quarter, but the turnaround continues to track to our expectations. Our global POS remains positive, which is driving further shelf space stabilization for key core brands and a shipping recovery across most of our regions when you exclude Disney Princess. If these trends continue, it should set a solid foundation for growth and improved profitability in 2017.

But how we achieve it in 2016 will be a little bit different than how we achieved it in our historical averages, which would rely more on pricing and better mix. As we look at the second half of the year, we're going to really achieve it through acceleration of cost of goods sold through supply-chain structural changes, which don't impact our price/value propositions. So it's going to be more about accelerating cost savings on structural supply chain in the second half of the year."

And even as we reenter the preschool learning category more aggressively with our Think & Learn line, the Code-a-Pillar, which I mentioned, is a key item for us, is getting a lot of attention and traction. We anticipate that, that will be just one of many early childhood development items that Fisher-Price becomes well known for. Not to belabor the point of Jonathan Adler's appointment, but I think the aesthetic piece of what he'll bring to the overall brand will be important as we move and develop the line with a bit more fashion sensibility. And of course, as we mentioned, new content, new partnerships with 9 Story, DHX, all fuel that particular segment of the brand. So we're confident in our strategic path going forward, and certainly, early reads are suggesting we're on the -- we're heading in the right direction."

But overall, what we're seeing now is Europe getting traction on POS with Barbie. Asia also getting traction on POS Barbie. Latin America is still catching up. We have some work to do in Latin America. But overall, we're seeing great connectivity. Frankly, the successful campaign that we ran here, the You Can Be Anything campaign that was wildly acclaimed, didn't get executed throughout international, so that's still new in some cases and rolling out as we speak. Some of the new product that we launched here in the U.S. is also being executed later in certain markets. Our DVD calendar in terms of distribution and marketing is also slightly different in international markets.

Today, I'm going to lead things off with a brief perspective on the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as usual, as Martin indicated, we'll open things up at the end for any questions that you might have. 
So let me begin by saying that overall, we're very encouraged by the quarter, which reflected some continuing progress in our turnaround, and importantly, kept us on track to deliver in our challenging 2016 topline objectives. We also made good progress against our cost reduction goals, both in cost of goods and in SG&A. Now, as you know, our biggest executional challenge this year is to offset the loss of Disney Princess, and despite continuing foreign exchange headwinds, our Q2 and first half results showed that we've made great strides in this area. We continue to see positive and improving trends globally in our consumer takeaway and our shipping is aligning with this favorable trend. Encouragingly, we're also seeing some very solid performance in some of our key core brands with a strong uptick in Barbie and continuing strength in the Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels. We're also getting some excellent traction in our Toy Box with our gains and entertainment properties and with MEGA Brands. Now supporting these favorable trends, our focus on strengthening our brands with more effective positioning, advertising and more competitive pricing and our rapid push in emerging markets is proving successful. We're also executing well and we're doing so broadly across much of our customer base. In addition, we're quite gratified by the continued strengthening of our licensing partnerships, exemplified by our recent announcements with universal on Fast and Furious and the Jurassic World franchise, both of which will give us some excellent opportunities to accelerate growth in 2017 and beyond. 
Now as for the middle of the P&L, we also made good progress this quarter and we do remain on track to deliver on our cost targets. Our work to streamline and prioritize SG&A spending is progressing well.  We're also capturing some significant supply chain efficiencies and cost savings. Now the offsets, of course, continue to be negative foreign exchange and unfavorable shifts in our brand mix, which are pressuring our gross margins. And we'd expect these factors to remain a challenge as we navigate through the balance of that year. Kevin is going to provide some more perspective in both of these subjects shortly. 
So to sum up the quarter, it's a very good progress and on many fronts, and particularly against the difficult backdrop and some strong external headwinds. Looking ahead, the picture for the year is largely the same as what we've previously outlined, with perhaps a few moderate puts and takes and our momentum is setting up extremely well for the future. We expect the year-to-date positive trends in POS and shipping to continue, and we expect to see improving flow-through on many of our cost savings initiatives. We also expect foreign exchange impacts will begin to moderate somewhat. Offset partially, of course, by mix, which will remain a challenge. So overall, our strategies are gaining traction and are helping us to drive the topline, to rightsize our cost structure and to fund investments in brand building, commercial excellence and emerging market expansion.  We're also managing our balance sheet well, and we're continuing to fund our dividend. 
So in summary, I have remained optimistic about the year. But with the bulk of the year still in front of us, I do want to urge a little bit of caution as we still have a lot of work to do. With that as a setup, let me turn things over to Richard, who's going to highlight some of our topline progress and our core initiatives. Richard?"
31197,369882619,1008839,"Mattel, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Mattel, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. So as Chris mentioned, this year, we have both the challenge of overcoming a significant revenue gap and the opportunity to position Mattel for growth in 2017. The Q2 results and the effectiveness of our execution throughout the first ha",1310,"Thank you, Chris. So as Chris mentioned, this year, we have both the challenge of overcoming a significant revenue gap and the opportunity to position Mattel for growth in 2017. The Q2 results and the effectiveness of our execution throughout the first half of the year are demonstrating our ability to do both. Excluding the year-over-year impact of Disney Princess, global POS is up mid-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date with solid results across the majority of our brands, and comparable sales in constant currency are up high-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date. We have almost completely offset the year-to-date Disney Princesses shortfall, reflecting strength across a number of brands, licenses and geographies. This performance is significant in many ways, indicative of our ability and potential to further build momentum into the second half of the year. 
So let me briefly touch on some specifics, starting with our core brands. We are pleased with Barbie's resurgence with global sales in constant currency up 24% in the quarter and up 11% year-to-date. This is the result of a return to the fundamentals that make this brand continuously relevant, including a clear and motivating positioning that is inspiring to girls worldwide, very effective execution throughout the organization and growing momentum fueled by increasing cultural significance. Consumer confidence in the brand is increasing. This is evidenced by continued enthusiasm for the new Fashionista line; the I-can-be-content marketing; the success of our new younger girl segment, Dreamtopia; stronger brand equity scores; and a sharp uptick in pop-culture references to Barbie. Retailer confidence is also up, demonstrated by increased shelf space. And licensor confidence is building as we renewed our Barbie content distribution agreement with Universal in the quarter. The entire Mattel organization took on the challenge to reset the story brand and has made tremendous strides in a very short period of time. And with the Barbie team now set up and running, we are obviously gaining traction. In the back half of the year, you'll see us to build on Barbie's success across the board as well as deepen the brand's connection with moms worldwide. 
Fisher-Price, with the renewed emphasis on early childhood development, continues to grow with global sales in constant currency up 6% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date. Brand progress is largely the result of a concerted effort to build strong valuable relationships with parents worldwide rooted in great product and motivated brand values. We're building on the momentum of the largest Fisher-Price segment, Baby, by engaging with mom in innovative and meaningful ways in the digital space. The brand's very successful Film By You campaign will be enhanced by our new gold medal moments initiative in the fall. In product, we continue to emphasize innovation, creating developmentally forward ideas like our hit Code-a-Pillar for Avast and growing segment of parents who are eager to expose stem learning early on. We're building fresh momentum in our Fisher-Price Friends line driven in part by new Nickelodeon licenses. 
Hot Wheels. Hot Wheels POS and shipping trends continue to be very strong with global POS up double digits year-to-date and sales in constant currency up 9% year-to-date. We expect to build on this in the second half of this year with new and exciting products, some of which we're previewing this week at Comicon. And while we continue to build a strong component of the business with our DC Comic, Marvel and Star Wars license, the success of our basic car in play sets should more than offset challenging comps going into the fall. 
Thomas POS also continues to be strong with global POS also up double digits in the quarter and year-to-date. Brand strength, particularly in key emerging markets, should continue as we introduce 12 new characters later this year. This impressive new lineup of culturally diverse characters is the most significant evolution in the brand in quite some time and will create excitement, global relevance, enhanced collectibility and numerous other opportunities for the brand. 
Monster High, as you know, has persistent challenges. Nevertheless, Monster High remains the number two doll brand worldwide and a brand with strong consumer engagement. We're seeing some success with new product offerings and scales that are expanding play patterns. Shelf space challenges unfortunately offsetting new gains, but we're working hard to capture those bases. We're looking to reboot the spread in the second half with new and her team at our product offerings that emphasize the core characters and the origin story. 
With American Girl, we have strategic plans in place to rejuvenate the brand and achieve its full potential. With these plans focused on the second half, we've not been surprised by the brand's year-to-date performance, where reduced promotions and a shift in spending to the second half negatively impacted sales as we expected better returns on the spending in the second half. The first of these new major American Girl brand initiatives is our recent introduction of Wellie Wishers. We are encouraged with the results so far. While Wellie Wishers provides an opportunity to expand the American Girl experience to a younger girl, we remain committed to older girls and will launch our latest historical character, Melody, this August. We look forward to a lot more news regarding American Girl and will be coming out this quarter and next, and we're excited about the strategies in place to provide new ways for girls and their families to engage with the brand. 
Now moving on to Toy Box. Licensing is demonstrating continued strength, particularly our Warner Bros. partnership, which will benefit from this week's release of Batman vs Superman DVD as well as expanded distribution of our successful DC Super Hero Girls line. As Chris mentioned, Mattel is now a key licensing partner with NBC Universal for their Fast & Furious and Jurassic World franchises, which will begin to roll out next year. These are exciting wins for us and we believe that this is the only the beginning of a much better partnership with Universal going forward. 
A major focus of our Toy Box capability is developing innovative and insightful category expertise to accelerate brand growth and we are thrilled to with the growth Toy Box is driving for our construction brand, MEGA, as it gains the scale globally. MEGA sales in constant currency are up 22% in the quarter and up 42% year-to-date. MEGA has proven to be a strategic driver of organic growth, expanding play patterns for many of our brands, notably Monster High and American Girl, and we will continue to mine the great potential in MEGA going forward. Invention and brand creation are our other key priorities at Toy Box and these are areas emphasized in the last year. Our latest invention is a new brand called Might Mini Mixie Q's,  a highly differentiated execution into the growing mini collective figure market that demonstrates our new speed-to-market capability and expertise in girl play. We're pleased with the strong early reads and I look forward to updating you on future calls. 
Now as we move towards the more significant part of the year, I'm encouraged with our progress in growing traction for our brands and our significant wins in licensed partnerships. Significant challenges remain, but we are meeting these head on while we create major new opportunities for growth. We said our success this year will largely be a function of Mattel's ability to overcome a unique and significant revenue gap. We're increasingly confident that we have the momentum to do just that, given the alignment of a very talented organization and the continued strong performance of key core brands, Toy Box and emerging markets. We will continue to look to stabilize our business this year and create a solid foundation for growth in 2017 and beyond. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin?"

As Chris and Richard said, despite the impact of foreign exchange, we continue to execute well on our topline and we made significant progress in our cost savings programs, which helped offset some of the Forex headwinds in the middle of the P&L. As a result, our overall performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter and the first half. Before going into some of the details, I'd like to remind everyone that unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to gross sales in constant currency in order to provide better visibility into the underlying topline trends. And in order to provide more transparency into the fundamentals of the business, I will also reference some adjusted financial results that exclude certain nonrecurring items related to the acquisitions of MEGA, Fuhu and Sproutling as well as severance related to business transformation and cost savings initiatives. As always, reconciliation to GAAP numbers are provided in our press release and the slide deck. 
I also want to take a moment to discuss the impact of Brit exit on our business. Since it occurred so late in the quarter, Brexit had a minimal impact on Q2 results. And assuming the continued uncertainty doesn't further impact financial markets or the consumer economic outlook, Brexit will only have a modest impact on our full year results. Based upon current trends, we believe the negative impact of foreign exchange will be roughly $0.02 to $0.05 of EPS for the year related to Brexit. 
Now moving to the highlights on some topline trends. Gross sales were down 1% in the quarter in constant currency and down 4% as reported. On a year-to-date basis, gross sales were 1% down in constant currency and down 5% as reported. Gross sales were up in North America and Asia-Pacific, with Latin America down 7% and Europe down slightly at 2%.  Finally, on a year-to-date basis, we continue to see strong growth in key emerging markets like China and Russia. And as Richard mentioned, the underlying trends look even more favorable when we exclude Disney Princess and we remain quite confident that we'll achieve our full year goal of relatively flat net sales in constant currency. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L. While we continue to invest in retail promotions and work more closely with the retail consumers in support of our ongoing turnaround efforts, sales adjustments were 9.1% in the quarter versus 9.8% in the prior period. Year-to-date sales adjustments were 9.3% versus 9.7% as we continue to see positive POS trends in our core brands and Toy Box. Our reported gross margin in the second quarter were 45.3% with Forex once again the major driver of the decline. If the year-over-year impact of foreign exchange is excluded, our gross margin rate was relatively flat to Q2 2015. 
The other key driver decline gross margin rate in the quarter was mix, with a strong growth and profitable in lower-margin brands like MEGA and Fisher-Price and a shift away from our higher-margin tel business. Overall, the negative impact of foreign exchange and mix was partially offset by our cost savings initiatives and the strategic pricing of our 2016 product line. 
Moving beyond gross margin, advertising was lower as we continue to move closer to 12% for the full year coupled with the benefit from foreign exchange. We also remain disciplined in SG&A with adjusted SG&A being down by approximately $17 million or 5% in the quarter and down by $43 million or 6% year-to-date. These results were due in part to cost saving initiatives, which more than offset expected wage inflation. As described in the slide deck in the company's earnings release, please note that we now include MEGA acquisition-related amortization expenses in our adjusted SG&A numbers. Importantly, we're still on track to deliver at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range for our 2-year funding-the-future cost savings program. We delivered approximately $31 million in gross savings in Q2 and $77 million year-to-date. Finally, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was a negative $0.02 per share or negative $0.06 per share as reported. 
As it relates to our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the first half of the year with $318 million of cash. This was in line with our expectations and reflects solid performance as we continue to tightly manage working capital. Not surprisingly, owned inventory and balance sheet was up year-over-year as we position the business to deliver in the second half.  Finally, we continue to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining the dividend. As we've said, dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business, and the board declared a third quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
As many of you know, we have some debt coming due this year. Given current rates, we plan to refinance the $300 million of senior unsecured debt that is maturing in November of 2016. So overall, our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect to end the year with cash of $800 million to $1 billion. 
One final note regarding foreign exchange. Given the significant volatility in the foreign exchange rates over the past 18 months, we recently conducted a thorough review of our approach to quantify the impact at each element of our P&L. As a result of these efforts, we reclassified some forecasted foreign exchange benefits that were previously embedded in product costs. Importantly, this reclassification does not change our total gross margin expectations for the year or Funding Our Future cost savings targets. However, it does result in a moderately lower Forex impact on margins and earnings. For the full year, we now expect the negative impact of foreign exchange and net sales will be to 2% to 4%, and EPS will be at the low end of our original $0.30 to $0.40 per share outlook when you include the impact of the recent events like Brit exit. 
Looking forward to summarizing our current 2016 outlook, we're still targeting relatively flat net sales in constant currency for the year. Similar to last year, we expect second half sales to be more weighted to Q4 due to the timing of our promotional efforts and our marketing spend, the timing of new product and distribution initiatives and how retailers are likely to tightly manage the inventory leading up to the holiday season. And as Chris mentioned, while we expect the negative impact of currency to be less in the back half of the year, we see additional challenges, primarily mix, continuing. While these challenges were partially offset by strategic pricing, supply chain efficiencies and cost savings initiatives, we recognize we'll likely come up a bit short our 2016 gross margin outlook. At this point, we believe gross margins for the full year will be around 48.5% with Forex headwinds and mix driving the majority of the decline. However, with additional sales volume, improved mix and more cost savings dropped in the bottom line, we expect gross margins will improve sequentially in the second half of the year. That means the second half gross margin is about [ph] 50%, which is roughly equivalent to what we achieved in the second half of 2015. More specifically, for the third quarter, we expect a step up in margin versus the second quarter to be similar to our historical averages of around 300 basis points, driven by the seasonal scale of our revenues relative to the second quarter, less headwind from foreign exchange, slightly better mix and incremental supply in the chain and other cost savings initiatives. We expect the fourth quarter gross margin to be in line with our historical averages. The expected improvement over Q3 will be driven by Girls Properties', gaining momentum, less impact of Disney Princess and we get incremental flow-through from our supply chain and other cost savings initiatives. Finally, it's important to mention that our long-term objective remains to achieve about [ph] 50% gross margins in the future. 
Shifting to SG&A. While the impact of including MEGA amortization adjusted SG&A increases the 2015 SG&A base to $1.465 billion, we continue to target adjusted SG&A to be down $55 million to $65 million versus last year's $1.448 billion adjusted SG&A baseline. The year-over-year impact of adding the MEGA amortization back into adjusted SG&A is $9 million. This target reflects the full absorption overhead related to Q1 acquisition of Fuhu, [ph] Boohoo and Sproutling, where we are aggressively pursuing cost savings opportunities across the company to absorb the bulk of overhead from those acquisitions. This change in the treatment of MEGA amortization does not impact reported SG&A. 
Finally, looking beyond this year of transition. In addition to the ongoing brand momentum and new initiatives that Richard covered, we expect 2017 to benefit as we will leverage Fuhu and Sproutling technology and platforms across our portfolio and expand our market opportunities. We also have a tailwind on the topline revenues from Cars 3 movie and continued traction in China, Russia and other emerging markets. Further, we have a strong revenue pipeline for growth in 2018 with our entertainment lineup of Toy Story 4 and Jurassic World. As we previously stated, we continue to see the ability to approach a more normal operating margins in 2017 and beyond. 
Overall, we view the second quarter results positively and continue to focus on the turnaround in setting up the business for sales and profit growth in 2017 and beyond. We look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year.

There could always be a surprise here or there. This year, I think really in particular, the Shopkins brands has been very successful and continues to be a trend, particularly in the small doll category that is capturing girls' attention. Clearly, we're competing now with the Disney Princess franchise. But in particular, I would say the strength of the Barbie brand in its renewed positioning, the additional marketing and merchandising and execution that we've done to get that brand to be more culturally relevant has seen a resurgence, and we're feeling confident with our plans on that brand in particular. As I mentioned, of course, Monster High, we have a lot of programs in place in the back half. It still remains, as I mentioned again, the second-largest fashion doll business in the world. I continue to be bullish on the brand as intellectual property as engagement remains consistent and, in fact, increasing as we get more pronounced in digital apps and storytelling, our websites and entertainment continuing to attract girls. And last but not least, we're really pleased with My Mini Mixie Q’s as an early start going after, if you will, the small doll collectible space. That is obviously a trend in the market. So overall, feeling confident of our positioning in the portfolio.

That said, we expect to see incremental sequential improvement in gross margin in the second half. As I said in my prepared remarks that to achieve that, we need a 50% gross margin for the balance of the year. That's consistent with what we delivered in 2015. And you look at what's going to drive it, I think sequentially, in the third quarter,  we're going to see a step up consistent with our historical averages of about 300 basis points. And the biggest driver to that is really the scale of our business, the third quarter is twice the size in general of the first quarter. -- I mean, first and second quarter separately. And then I think, also as we talked about and Chris mentioned, we see less of a headwind in Forex. We see mix getting slightly better in the third quarter, and then also we see the cost savings flow through in the third quarter that we achieved in manufacturing in the second quarter because it's about 1-quarter lag in production in the time we sell it and also, our other cost savings initiatives that impact gross margins. And then in the fourth quarter, we see it getting back to the historical levels and the biggest driver of that incrementally is better mix as a result of -- as Richard just said, we see in the holiday season our doll portfolio performing better, Barbie, DC, Super Heroes and American Girl, and that's going to be the biggest driver to increase sequentially gross margins in the fourth quarter. Along the [indiscernible], we'll see more flow-through of supply chain savings and other cost savings initiatives around the company."

At the same time that we are losing some of the shelf space, we are also seeing some traction in a concentrated effort on the core characters. Our new mini collectibles are obviously gaining traction as I mentioned and there's some other products in there that is giving us great encouragement to believe that actually, as the brand resets itself with new product offerings, that POS will be commensurate.

To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Our discussion and our slide presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures such as gross sales, adjusted selling and administrative expense, adjusted operating income, adjusted earnings and loss per share and constant currency. Our earnings release also includes non-GAAP financial measures. The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release and slide presentation, and both documents are available on the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information, and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2015 annual report on Form 10-K, our 2016 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, in other filings we make with the SEC from time to time as well as in our other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.

I'd like to thank you all for joining us. Today, I'm going to lead things off with a brief perspective on the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. An",650,"Great. Thanks, Martin, and welcome, everyone. I'd like to thank you all for joining us. Today, I'm going to lead things off with a brief perspective on the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as usual, as Martin indicated, we'll open things up at the end for any questions that you might have.
So let me begin by saying that overall we're very encouraged by the quarter, which reflected some continuing progress on our turnaround, and importantly, kept us on track to deliver on our challenging 2016 top line objectives. We also made good progress against our cost reduction goals, both in cost of goods and in SG&A. Now as you know, our biggest executional challenge this year is to offset the loss of Disney Princess, and despite continuing foreign exchange headwinds, our Q2 and first half results show that we've made great strides in this area. We continue to see positive and improving trends globally in our consumer takeaway and our shipping is aligning with this favorable trend. Encouragingly, we're also seeing some very solid performance in some of our key core brands, with a strong uptick in Barbie and continuing strength in Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels. We're also getting some excellent traction in our Toy Box with our games and entertainment properties and with MEGA Brands. Now supporting these favorable trends, our focus on strengthening our brands with more effective positioning, advertising and more competitive pricing and our rapid push in emerging markets is proving successful. We're also executing well and we're doing so broadly across much of our customer base. In addition, we're quite gratified by the continued strengthening of our licensing partnerships, exemplified by our recent announcements with Universal on Fast & Furious and the Jurassic World franchise, both of which will give us some excellent opportunities to accelerate growth in 2017 and beyond.
Now as for the middle of the P&L, we also made good progress this quarter, and we do remain on track to deliver on our cost targets. Our work to streamline and prioritize SG&A spending is progressing well.  We're also capturing some significant supply chain efficiencies and cost savings. Now the offsets, of course, continue to be negative foreign exchange and unfavorable shifts in our brand mix, which are pressuring our gross margins. And we'd expect these factors to remain a challenge as we navigate through the balance of the year. Kevin is going to provide some more perspective on both of these subjects shortly.
So to sum up the quarter, it's a very good progress and on many fronts, and particularly against the difficult backdrop and some strong external headwinds. Looking ahead, the picture for the year is largely the same as what we previously outlined, with perhaps a few moderate puts and takes and our momentum is setting up extremely well for the future. We expect the year-to-date positive trends in POS and shipping to continue, and we expect to see improving flow-through on many of our cost savings initiatives. We also expect foreign exchange impacts will begin to moderate somewhat, offset partially, of course, by mix, which will remain a challenge. So overall, our strategies are gaining traction and are helping us to drive the top line, to rightsize our cost structure and to fund investments in brand building, commercial excellence and emerging market expansion. We're also managing our balance sheet well, and we're continuing to fund our dividend.
So in summary, I have remained optimistic about the year. But with the bulk of the year still in front of us, I do want to urge a little bit of caution as we still have a lot of work to do.
With that as a setup, let me turn things over to Richard, who's going to highlight some of our top line progress and our core initiatives. Richard?"
31197,369882619,1008954,"Mattel, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Mattel, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. So as Chris mentioned, this year, we have both the challenge of overcoming a significant revenue gap and the opportunity to position Mattel for growth in 2017.

So as Chris mentioned, this year, we have both the challenge of overcoming a significant revenue gap and the opportunity to position Mattel for growth in 2017. The Q2 results and the effectiveness of our execution throughout the first half of the year are demonstrating our ability to do both. Excluding the year-over-year impact of Disney Princess, global POS is up mid-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date with solid results across the majority of our brands, and comparable sales in constant currency are up high-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date. We have almost completely offset the year-to-date Disney Princess shortfall, reflecting strength across a number of brands, licenses and geographies. This performance is significant in many ways, indicative of our ability and potential to further build momentum into the second half of the year.
So let me briefly touch on some specifics, starting with our core brands. We are pleased with Barbie's resurgence with global sales in constant currency up 24% in the quarter and up 11% year-to-date. This is the result of a return to the fundamentals that make this brand continuously relevant, including a clear and motivating positioning that is inspiring to girls worldwide, very effective execution throughout the organization and growing momentum fueled by increasing cultural significance. Consumer confidence in the brand is increasing. This is evidenced by continued enthusiasm for the new Fashionista line; the I can be content marketing; the success of our new younger girl segment, Dreamtopia; stronger brand equity scores; and a sharp uptick in pop-culture references to Barbie. Retailer confidence is also up, demonstrated by increased shelf space. And licensor confidence is building as we renewed our Barbie content distribution agreement with Universal in the quarter. The entire Mattel organization took on the challenge to reset this storied brand and has made tremendous strides in a very short period of time. And with the Barbie team now set up and running, we are obviously gaining traction. In the back half of the year, you'll see us build on Barbie's success across the board as well as deepen the brand's connection with moms worldwide.
Fisher-Price, with the renewed emphasis on early childhood development, continues to grow with global sales in constant currency up 6% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date. Brand progress is largely the result of a concerted effort to build strong valuable relationships with parents worldwide rooted in great product and motivated brand values. We're building on the momentum of the largest Fisher-Price segment, baby, by engaging with moms in innovative and meaningful ways in the digital space. The brand's very successful Film by You campaign will be enhanced by our new Gold Medal Moments initiative in the fall. In product, we continue to emphasize innovation, creating developmentally forward ideas like our hit Code-a-Pillar for a vast and growing segment of parents who are eager to expose STEM learning early on. We're building fresh momentum in our Fisher-Price Friends line driven in part by new Nickelodeon licenses.
Hot Wheels. Hot Wheels POS and shipping trends continue to be very strong with global POS up double digits year-to-date and sales in constant currency up 9% year-to-date. We expect to build on this in the second half of the year with new and exciting products, some of which we're previewing this week at Comic-Con. And while we continue to build a strong component of the business with our DC Comic, Marvel and Star Wars license, the success of our basic car and play sets should more than offset challenging comps going into the fall.
Thomas POS also continues to be strong with global POS also up double digits in the quarter and year-to-date. Brand strength, particularly in key emerging markets, should continue as we introduce 12 new characters later this year. This impressive new lineup of culturally diverse characters is the most significant evolution of the brand in quite some time and will create excitement, global relevance, enhanced collectibility and numerous other opportunities for the brand.
Monster High, as you know, has persistent challenges. Nevertheless, Monster High remains the #2 doll brand worldwide and a brand with strong consumer engagement. We're seeing some success with new product offerings and scales that are expanding play patterns. Shelf space challenges unfortunately offsetting new gains, but we're working hard to capture those facings. We're looking to reboot this brand in the second half with new entertainment and product offerings that emphasize the core characters and the origin story.
With American Girl, we have strategic plans in place to rejuvenate the brand and achieve its full potential. With these plans focused on the second half, we've not been surprised by the brand's year-to-date performance, where reduced promotions and a shift in spending to the second half negatively impacted sales as we expect a better return on the spending in the second half. The first of these new major American Girl brand initiatives is our recent introduction of Wellie Wishers. We are encouraged with the results so far. While Wellie Wishers provides an opportunity to expand the American Girl experience to a younger girl, we remain committed to older girls and will launch our latest historical character, Melody, this August. Look forward to a lot more news regarding American Girl and will be coming out this quarter and next, and we're excited about the strategies in place to provide new ways for girls and their families to engage with the brand.
Now moving on to Toy Box. Licensing is demonstrating continued strength, particularly our Warner Bros. partnership, which will benefit from this week's release of Batman v Superman DVD as well as expanded distribution of our successful DC Super Hero Girl line. As Chris mentioned, Mattel is now a key licensing partner with NBCUniversal for their Fast & Furious and Jurassic World franchises, which will begin to roll out next year. These are exciting wins for us and we believe that this is only the beginning of a much bigger partnership with Universal going forward.
A major focus of our Toy Box capability is developing innovative and insightful category expertise to accelerate brand growth, and we are thrilled with the growth Toy Box is driving for our construction brand MEGA as it gains scale globally. MEGA sales in constant currency are up 22% in the quarter and up 42% year-to-date. MEGA has proven to be a strategic driver of organic growth, expanding play patterns for many of our brands, notably Monster High and American Girl, and we will continue to mine the great potential in MEGA going forward. Invention and brand creation are our other key priorities at Toy Box and these are areas emphasized in the last year. Our latest invention is a new brand called My Mini Mixie Q's, a highly differentiated execution into the growing mini collector figure market that demonstrates our new speed-to-market capability and our expertise in girl play. We're pleased with the strong early reads and I look forward to updating you on future calls.
Now as we move toward the most significant part of the year, I'm encouraged with our progress, the growing traction for our brands and our significant wins in license partnerships. Significant challenges remain, but we are meeting these head-on while we create major new opportunities for growth. We said our success this year will largely be a function of Mattel's ability to overcome a unique and significant revenue gap. We're increasingly confident that we have the momentum to do just that given the alignment of a very talented organization and the continued strong performance of key core brands, Toy Box and emerging markets. We will continue to look to stabilize our business this year and create the solid foundation for growth in 2017 and beyond.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin?"
31197,369882619,1008954,"Mattel, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Mattel, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris and Richard said, despite the impact of foreign exchange, we continue to execute well on our top line, and we made significant progress in our cost savings programs which help offset some of the F",1619,"Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris and Richard said, despite the impact of foreign exchange, we continue to execute well on our top line, and we made significant progress in our cost savings programs which help offset some of the ForEx headwinds in the middle of the P&L. As a result, our overall performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter and the first half. Before going into some of the details, I'd like to remind everyone that unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to gross sales in constant currency in order to provide better visibility into the underlying top line trends. And in order to provide more transparency into the fundamentals of the business, I will also reference some adjusted financial results that exclude certain nonrecurring items related to the acquisitions of MEGA, Fuhu and Sproutling as well as severance related to business transformation and cost savings initiatives. As always, reconciliation to GAAP numbers are provided in our press release and the slide deck.
Also want to take a moment to discuss the impact of Brit exit on our business. Since it occurred so late in the quarter, Brexit had a minimal impact on Q2 results. And assuming the continued uncertainty doesn't further impact financial markets or the consumer economic outlook, Brexit will only have a modest impact on our full year results. Based upon current trends, we believe the negative impact from foreign exchange will be roughly $0.02 to $0.05 of EPS for the year related to Brexit.
Now moving to the highlights and top line trends. Gross sales were down 1% in the quarter in constant currency and down 4% as reported. On a year-to-date basis, gross sales were 1% down in constant currency and down 5% as reported. Gross sales were up in North America and Asia-Pacific, with Latin America down 7% and Europe down slightly at 2%. Finally, on a year-to-date basis, we continue to see strong growth in key emerging markets like China and Russia. And as Richard mentioned, the underlying trends look even more favorable when we exclude Disney Princess, and we remain quite confident that we'll achieve our full year goal of relatively flat net sales in constant currency.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. While we continue to invest in retail promotions and work more closely with the retail consumers in support of our ongoing turnaround efforts, sales adjustments were 9.1% in the quarter versus 9.8% in the prior period. Year-to-date sales adjustments were 9.3% versus 9.7% as we continue to see positive POS trends in our core brands and Toy Box. Our reported gross margin in the second quarter were 45.3%, with ForEx once again the major driver of the decline. If the year-over-year impact of foreign exchange is excluded, our gross margin rate was relatively flat to Q2 2015.
The other key driver of decline in gross margin rate in the quarter was mix, with strong growth and profitable at lower-margin brands like MEGA and Fisher-Price and a shift away from our higher-margin doll business. Overall, the negative impact of foreign exchange and mix was partially offset by our cost savings initiatives and the strategic pricing of our 2016 product line.
Moving beyond gross margin, advertising was lower as we continue to move closer to 12% for the full year coupled with the benefit from foreign exchange. We also remain disciplined in SG&A, with adjusted SG&A being down by approximately $17 million or 5% in the quarter and down by $43 million or 6% year-to-date. These results were due in part to cost saving initiatives which more than offset expected wage inflation. As described in the slide deck and the company's earnings release, please note that we now include MEGA acquisition-related amortization expenses in our adjusted SG&A numbers. Importantly, we're still on track to deliver at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range for our 2-year funding the future cost savings program. We delivered approximately $31 million of gross savings in Q2 and $77 million year-to-date. Finally, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was a negative $0.02 per share or negative $0.06 per share as reported.
As it relates to our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the first half of the year with $318 million of cash. This was in line with our expectations and reflects solid performance as we continue to tightly manage working capital. Not surprisingly, owned inventory on balance sheet was up year-over-year as we position the business to deliver in the second half. Finally, we continue to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining the dividend. As we've said, dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business, and the board declared a third quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the third quarter of 2015.
As many of you know, we have some debt coming due this year. Given current rates, we plan to refinance the $300 million of senior unsecured debt that is maturing in November of 2016. So overall, our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect to end the year with cash of $800 million to $1 billion.
One final note regarding foreign exchange. Given the significant volatility in foreign exchange rates over the past 18 months, we recently conducted a thorough review of our approach to quantifying their impact at each element of our P&L. As a result of these efforts, we reclassified some forecasted foreign exchange benefits that were previously embedded in product cost. Importantly, this reclassification does not change our total gross margin expectations for the year or our Funding Our Future cost savings targets. However, it does result in a moderately lower ForEx impact on margins and earnings. For the full year, we now expect the negative impact of foreign exchange in net sales would be to 2% to 4%, and EPS will be at the low end of our original $0.30 to $0.40 per share outlook when you include the impact of recent events like Brit exit.
Looking forward and summarizing our current 2016 outlook, we're still targeting relatively flat net sales in constant currency for the year. Similar to last year, we expect second half sales to be more weighted to Q4 due to the timing of our promotional efforts and our marketing spend, the timing of new product and distribution initiatives and how retailers are likely to tightly manage the inventory leading up to the holiday season.
And as Chris mentioned, while we expect the negative impact of currency to be less in the back half of the year, we see additional challenges, primarily mix, continuing. While these challenges will partially offset by strategic pricing, supply chain efficiencies and cost savings initiatives, we recognize we'll likely come up a bit short to our 2016 gross margin outlook. At this point, we believe gross margins for the full year will be around 48.5%, with ForEx headwinds and mix driving the majority of the decline. However, with additional sales volume, improved mix and more cost savings dropped in the bottom line, we expect gross margins will improve sequentially in the second half of the year. That means the second half gross margin about 50%, which is roughly equivalent to what we achieved in the second half of 2015. More specifically, for the third quarter, we expect a step up in margin versus the second quarter to be similar to our historical averages of around 300 basis points, driven by the seasonal scale of our revenues relative to the second quarter, less headwind from foreign exchange, slightly better mix and incremental supply chain and other cost savings initiatives. We expect the fourth quarter gross margin to be in line with our historical averages. The expected improvement over Q3 will be driven by our girls' properties gaining momentum, less impact of Disney Princess, and we get incremental flow-through from our supply chain and other cost savings initiatives. Finally, it's important to mention that our long-term objective remains to achieve about 50% gross margins in the future.
Shifting to SG&A. While the impact of including MEGA amortization to adjusted SG&A increases the 2015 SG&A base to $1.465 billion, we continue to target adjusted SG&A to be down $55 million to $65 million versus last year's $1.448 billion adjusted SG&A baseline. The year-over-year impact of adding the MEGA amortization back into adjusted SG&A is $9 million. This target reflects the full absorption of overhead related to the Q1 acquisition of Fuhu and Sproutling, where we are aggressively pursuing cost savings opportunities across the company to absorb the bulk of overhead from those acquisitions. This change in the treatment of MEGA amortization does not impact reported SG&A.
Finally, looking beyond this year of transition. In addition to the ongoing brand momentum and new initiatives that Richard covered, we expect 2017 to benefit as we leverage Fuhu and Sproutling technology platforms across our portfolio and expand our market opportunities. We also have a tailwind on the top line revenues from Cars 3 movie and continued traction in China, Russia and other emerging markets. Further, we have a strong revenue pipeline for growth in 2018 with our entertainment lineup of Toy Story 4 and Jurassic World. As we previously stated, we continue to see an ability to approach more normal operating margins in 2017 and beyond.
Overall, we view the second quarter results positively and continue to focus on the turnaround and setting up the business for sales and profit growth in 2017 and beyond. We look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the rest of the year.

This year, I think really in particular that the Shopkins brand has been very successful. It continues to be a trend, particularly in the small doll category that is capturing girls' attention. Clearly, we're competing now with the Disney Princess franchise. But in particular, I would say the strength of the Barbie brand and its renewed positioning, the additional marketing and merchandising and execution that we've done to get that brand to be more culturally relevant has seen a resurgence, and we're feeling confident with our plans on that brand in particular. As I mentioned, of course, Monster High, we have a lot of programs in place in the back half. It still remains, as I mentioned again, the second-largest fashion doll business in the world. I continue to be bullish on the brand as intellectual property as engagement remains consistent and in fact, increasing as we get more pronounced in digital apps and storytelling, our websites and entertainment continue to attract girls. And last but not least, we're really pleased with My Mini Mixie Q's as an early start going after, if you will, the small doll collectible space. That is obviously a trend in the market.

But at this point, we believe that mix will be a bit more challenging to the full year. That said, we expect to see incremental sequential improvement in gross margin in the second half. As I said in my prepared remarks that to achieve that, we need a 50% gross margin for the balance of the year. That's consistent with what we delivered in 2015. And you look at what's going to drive it, I think sequentially, in the third quarter, we're going to see a step up consistent with our historical averages of about 300 basis points. And the biggest driver to that is really the scale of our business. The third quarter is twice the size in general of the first quarter. -- I mean, first and second quarter separately. And then I think also as we talked about and Chris mentioned, we see less of a headwind in ForEx. We see mix getting slightly better in the third quarter. And then also we see the cost savings flow through in the third quarter that we achieved in manufacturing in the second quarter because it's about 1 lag -- 1-quarter lag in production in the time we sell it and also our other cost savings initiatives that impact gross margins. And then in the fourth quarter, we see getting back to the historical levels. And the biggest driver of that incrementally is better mix as a result of -- as Richard just said, we see in the holiday season our doll portfolio performing better, Barbie, DC Super Heroes and American Girl, and that's going to be the biggest driver to increase sequentially gross margins in the fourth quarter.

In addition to that, in the fourth quarter, particularly during the holiday period, a lot of the space increments are out-of-aisle placement.

In addition to that, which we kind of classify more as the fashion segment of our business, as you know, we introduced a new segment to the younger girl called Dreamtopia, which has a lineup of both doll and accessory along with content and various other forms of IP extensions that has resonated incredibly well. In fact, the younger girl segment of our business is growing exponentially much faster than we had anticipated. We're really pleased with Dreamtopia's connectivity.

Thanks, Martin, and welcome, everyone. I'd like to thank you all for joining us. Today, I'm going to lead things off with a brief perspective on the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as usual, as Martin indicated, we'll open things up at the end for any questions that you might have.
So let me begin by saying that overall we're very encouraged by the quarter, which reflected some continuing progress on our turnaround, and importantly, kept us on track to deliver on our challenging 2016 top line objectives. We also made good progress against our cost reduction goals, both in cost of goods and in SG&A. Now as you know, our biggest executional challenge this year is to offset the loss of Disney Princess, and despite continuing foreign exchange headwinds, our Q2 and first half results show that we've made great strides in this area. We continue to see positive and improving trends globally in our consumer takeaway and our shipping is aligning with this favorable trend. Encouragingly, we're also seeing some very solid performance in some of our key core brands, with a strong uptick in Barbie and continuing strength in Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels. We're also getting some excellent traction in our Toy Box with our games and entertainment properties and with MEGA Brands. Now supporting these favorable trends, our focus on strengthening our brands with more effective positionings, advertising and more competitive pricing and our rapid push in emerging markets is proving successful. We're also executing well and we're doing so broadly across much of our customer base. In addition, we're quite gratified by the continued strengthening of our licensing partnerships, exemplified by our recent announcements with Universal on Fast & Furious and the Jurassic World franchise, both of which will give us some excellent opportunities to accelerate growth in 2017 and beyond.
Now as for the middle of the P&L, we also made good progress this quarter, and we do remain on track to deliver on our cost targets. Our work to streamline and prioritize SG&A spending is progressing well. We're also capturing some significant supply chain efficiencies and cost savings. Now the offsets, of course, continue to be negative foreign exchange and unfavorable shifts in our brand mix, which are pressuring our gross margins. And we'd expect these factors to remain a challenge as we navigate through the balance of the year. Kevin is going to provide some more perspective on both of these subjects shortly.
So to sum up the quarter, it's a very good progress and on many fronts, and particularly against the difficult backdrop and some strong external headwinds. Looking ahead, the picture for the year is largely the same as what we’ve previously outlined, with perhaps a few moderate puts and takes and our momentum is setting up extremely well for the future. We expect the year-to-date positive trends in POS and shipping to continue, and we expect to see improving flow-through on many of our cost savings initiatives. We also expect foreign exchange impacts will begin to moderate somewhat, offset partially, of course, by mix, which will remain a challenge. So overall, our strategies are gaining traction and are helping us to drive the top line, to rightsize our cost structure and to fund investments in brand building, commercial excellence and emerging market expansion. We're also managing our balance sheet well, and we're continuing to fund our dividend.
So in summary, I have remained optimistic about the year. But with the bulk of the year still in front of us, I do want to urge a little bit of caution as we still have a lot of work to do.
With that as a setup, let me turn things over to Richard, who's going to highlight some of our top line progress and our core initiatives. Richard?"
31197,369882619,1008972,"Mattel, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Mattel, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. So as Chris mentioned, this year, we have both the challenge of overcoming a significant revenue gap and the opportunity to position Mattel for growth in 2017. The Q2 results and the effectiveness of our execution throughout the first ha",1305,"Thank you, Chris. So as Chris mentioned, this year, we have both the challenge of overcoming a significant revenue gap and the opportunity to position Mattel for growth in 2017. The Q2 results and the effectiveness of our execution throughout the first half of the year are demonstrating our ability to do both. Excluding the year-over-year impact of Disney Princess, global POS is up mid-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date with solid results across the majority of our brands, and comparable sales in constant currency are up high-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date. We have almost completely offset the year-to-date Disney Princess shortfall, reflecting strength across a number of brands, licenses and geographies. This performance is significant in many ways, indicative of our ability and potential to further build momentum into the second half of the year.
So let me briefly touch on some specifics, starting with our core brands. We are pleased with Barbie's resurgence with global sales in constant currency up 24% in the quarter and up 11% year-to-date. This is the result of a return to the fundamentals that make this brand continuously relevant, including a clear and motivating positioning that is inspiring to girls worldwide, very effective execution throughout the organization and growing momentum fueled by increasing cultural significance. Consumer confidence in the brand is increasing. This is evidenced by continued enthusiasm for the new Fashionista line; the I Can Be content marketing; the success of our new younger girl segment, Dreamtopia; stronger brand equity scores; and a sharp uptick in pop-culture references to Barbie. Retailer confidence is also up, demonstrated by increased shelf space. And licensor confidence is building as we renewed our Barbie content distribution agreement with Universal in the quarter. The entire Mattel organization took on the challenge to reset this storied brand and has made tremendous strides in a very short period of time. And with the Barbie team now set up and running, we are obviously gaining traction. In the back half of the year, you'll see us build on Barbie's success across the board as well as deepen the brand's connection with moms worldwide.
Fisher-Price, with the renewed emphasis on early childhood development, continues to grow with global sales in constant currency up 6% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date. Brand progress is largely the result of a concerted effort to build strong valuable relationships with parents worldwide rooted in great product and motivated brand values. We're building on the momentum of the largest Fisher-Price segment, Baby, by engaging with moms in innovative and meaningful ways in the digital space. The brand's very successful Film by You campaign will be enhanced by our new Gold Medal Moments initiative in the fall. In product, we continue to emphasize innovation, creating developmentally forward ideas like our hit Code-a-Pillar for a vast and growing segment of parents who are eager to expose STEM learning early on. We're building fresh momentum in our Fisher-Price Friends line driven in part by new Nickelodeon licenses.
Hot Wheels. Hot Wheels POS and shipping trends continue to be very strong with global POS up double digits year-to-date and sales in constant currency up 9% year-to-date. We expect to build on this in the second half of the year with new and exciting products, some of which we're previewing this week at Comic-Con. And while we continue to build a strong component of the business with our DC Comic, Marvel and Star Wars license, the success of our basic car and play sets should more than offset challenging comps going into the fall.
Thomas POS also continues to be strong with global POS also up double digits in the quarter and year-to-date. Brand strength, particularly in key emerging markets, should continue as we introduce 12 new characters later this year. This impressive new lineup of culturally diverse characters is the most significant evolution of the brand in quite some time and will create excitement, global relevance, enhanced collectibility and numerous other opportunities for the brand.
Monster High, as you know, has persistent challenges. Nevertheless, Monster High remains the #2 doll brand worldwide and a brand with strong consumer engagement. We're seeing some success with new product offerings and scales that are expanding play patterns. Shelf space challenges unfortunately offsetting new gains, but we're working hard to capture those basins. We're looking to reboot this brand in the second half with new entertainment and product offerings that emphasize the core characters and the origin story.
With American Girl, we have strategic plans in place to rejuvenate the brand and achieve its full potential. With these plans focused on the second half, we've not been surprised by the brand's year-to-date performance, where reduced promotions and a shift in spending to the second half negatively impacted sales as we expect a better return on the spending in the second half. The first of these new major American Girl brand initiatives is our recent introduction of Wellie Wishers. We are encouraged with the results so far. While Wellie Wishers provides an opportunity to expand the American Girl experience to a younger girl, we remain committed to older girls and will launch our latest historical character, Melody, this August, look forward to a lot more news regarding American Girl and will be coming out this quarter and next, and we're excited about the strategies in place to provide new ways for girls and their families to engage with the brand.
Now moving on to Toy Box. Licensing is demonstrating continued strength, particularly our Warner Bros. partnership, which will benefit from this week's release of Batman v Superman DVD as well as expanded distribution of our successful DC Super Hero Girl line. As Chris mentioned, Mattel is now a key licensing partner with NBCUniversal for their Fast & Furious and Jurassic World franchises, which will begin to roll out next year. These are exciting wins for us and we believe that this is only the beginning of a much bigger partnership with Universal going forward.
A major focus of our Toy Box capability is developing innovative and insightful category expertise to accelerate brand growth, and we are thrilled with the growth Toy Box is driving for our construction brand MEGA as it gains scale globally. MEGA sales in constant currency are up 22% in the quarter and up 42% year-to-date. MEGA has proven to be a strategic driver of organic growth, expanding play patterns for many of our brands, notably Monster High and American Girl, and we will continue to mine the great potential in MEGA going forward. Invention and brand creation are our other key priorities at Toy Box and these are areas emphasized in the last year. Our latest invention is a new brand called My Mini Mixie Q's, a highly differentiated execution into the growing mini collector figure market that demonstrates our new speed-to-market capability and our expertise in girl play. We're pleased with the strong early reads and I look forward to updating you on future calls.
Now as we move toward the most significant part of the year, I'm encouraged with our progress, the growing traction for our brands and our significant wins in license partnerships. Significant challenges remain, but we are meeting these head-on while we create major new opportunities for growth. We said our success this year will largely be a function of Mattel's ability to overcome a unique and significant revenue gap. We're increasingly confident that we have the momentum to do just that given the alignment of a very talented organization and the continued strong performance of key core brands, Toy Box and emerging markets. We will continue to look to stabilize our business this year and create the solid foundation for growth in 2017 and beyond.

As Chris and Richard said, despite the impact of foreign exchange, we continue to execute well on our top line, and we made significant progress in our cost savings programs, which help offset some of the",1620,"Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris and Richard said, despite the impact of foreign exchange, we continue to execute well on our top line, and we made significant progress in our cost savings programs, which help offset some of the ForEx headwinds in the middle of the P&L. As a result, our overall performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter and the first half. Before going into some of the details, I'd like to remind everyone that unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to gross sales in constant currency in order to provide better visibility into the underlying top line trends. And in order to provide more transparency into the fundamentals of the business, I will also reference some adjusted financial results that exclude certain nonrecurring items related to the acquisitions of MEGA, Fuhu and Sproutling as well as severance related to business transformation and cost savings initiatives. As always, reconciliation to GAAP numbers are provided in our press release and the slide deck.
Also want to take a moment to discuss the impact of Brit exit on our business. Since it occurred so late in the quarter, Brexit had a minimal impact on Q2 results. And assuming the continued uncertainty doesn't further impact financial markets or the consumer economic outlook, Brexit will only have a modest impact on our full year results. Based upon current trends, we believe the negative impact from foreign exchange will be roughly $0.02 to $0.05 of EPS for the year related to Brexit.
Now moving to the highlights and top line trends. Gross sales were down 1% in the quarter in constant currency and down 4% as reported. On a year-to-date basis, gross sales were 1% down in constant currency and down 5% as reported. Gross sales were up in North America and Asia-Pacific, with Latin America down 7% and Europe down slightly at 2%. Finally, on a year-to-date basis, we continue to see strong growth in key emerging markets like China and Russia. And as Richard mentioned, the underlying trends look even more favorable when we exclude Disney Princess, and we remain quite confident that we'll achieve our full year goal of relatively flat net sales in constant currency.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. While we continue to invest in retail promotions and work more closely with the retail consumers in support of our ongoing turnaround efforts, sales adjustments were 9.1% in the quarter versus 9.8% in the prior period. Year-to-date sales adjustments were 9.3% versus 9.7% as we continue to see positive POS trends in our core brands and Toy Box. Our reported gross margin in the second quarter were 45.3%, with ForEx once again the major driver of the decline. If the year-over-year impact of foreign exchange is excluded, our gross margin rate was relatively flat to Q2 2015.
The other key driver of decline in gross margin rate in the quarter was mix, with a strong growth in profitable at lower-margin brands like MEGA and Fisher-Price and a shift away from our higher-margin doll business. Overall, the negative impact of foreign exchange and mix was partially offset by our cost savings initiatives and the strategic pricing of our 2016 product line.
Moving beyond gross margin, advertising was lower as we continue to move closer to 12% for the full year coupled with the benefit from foreign exchange. We also remain disciplined in SG&A, with adjusted SG&A being down by approximately $17 million or 5% in the quarter and down by $43 million or 6% year-to-date. These results were due in part to cost saving initiatives which more than offset expected wage inflation. As described in the slide deck in the company's earnings release, please note that we now include MEGA acquisition-related amortization expenses in our adjusted SG&A numbers. Importantly, we're still on track to deliver at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range for our 2-year funding the future cost savings program. We delivered approximately $31 million of gross savings in Q2 and $77 million year-to-date. Finally, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was a negative $0.02 per share or negative $0.06 per share as reported.
As it relates to our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the first half of the year with $318 million of cash. This was in line with our expectations and reflects solid performance as we continue to tightly manage working capital. Not surprisingly, owned inventory on balance sheet was up year-over-year as we position the business to deliver in the second half. Finally, we continue to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining the dividend. As we've said, dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business, and the board declared a third quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the third quarter of 2015.
As many of you know, we have some debt coming due this year. Given current rates, we plan to refinance the $300 million of senior unsecured debt that is maturing in November of 2016. So overall, our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect to end the year with cash of $800 million to $1 billion.
One final note regarding foreign exchange. Given the significant volatility in foreign exchange rates over the past 18 months, we recently conducted a thorough review of our approach to quantifying their impact at each element of our P&L. As a result of these efforts, we reclassified some forecasted foreign exchange benefits that were previously embedded in product cost. Importantly, this reclassification does not change our total gross margin expectations for the year or our Funding Our Future cost savings targets. However, it does result in a moderately lower ForEx impact on margins and earnings. For the full year, we now expect the negative impact of foreign exchange in net sales would be to 2% to 4%, and EPS will be at the low end of our original $0.30 to $0.40 per share outlook when you include the impact of recent events like Brit exit.
Looking forward and summarizing our current 2016 outlook, we're still targeting relatively flat net sales in constant currency for the year. Similar to last year, we expect second half sales to be more weighted to Q4 due to the timing of our promotional efforts and our marketing spend, the timing of new product and distribution initiatives and how retailers are likely to tightly manage the inventory leading up to the holiday season.
And as Chris mentioned, while we expect the negative impact of currency to be less in the back half of the year, we see additional challenges, primarily mix, continuing. While these challenges will partially offset by strategic pricing, supply chain efficiencies and cost savings initiatives, we recognize we'll likely come up a bit short to our 2016 gross margin outlook. At this point, we believe gross margins for the full year will be around 48.5%, with ForEx headwinds and mix driving the majority of the decline. However, with additional sales volume, improved mix and more cost savings dropped in the bottom line, we expect gross margins will improve sequentially in the second half of the year. That means the second half gross margin about 50%, which is roughly equivalent to what we achieved in the second half of 2015. More specifically, for the third quarter, we expect a step up in margin versus the second quarter to be similar to our historical averages of around 300 basis points, driven by the seasonal scale of our revenues relative to the second quarter, less headwind from foreign exchange, slightly better mix and incremental supply chain and other cost savings initiatives. We expect the fourth quarter gross margin to be in line with our historical averages. The expected improvement over Q3 will be driven by our girls' properties gaining momentum, less impact of Disney Princess and we get incremental flow-through from our supply chain and other cost savings initiatives. Finally, it's important to mention that our long-term objective remains to achieve about 50% gross margins in the future.
Shifting to SG&A. While the impact of including MEGA amortization to adjusted SG&A increases the 2015 SG&A base to $1.465 billion, we continue to target adjusted SG&A to be down $55 million to $65 million versus last year's $1.448 billion adjusted SG&A baseline. The year-over-year impact of adding the MEGA amortization back into adjusted SG&A is $9 million. This target reflects the full absorption of overhead related to the Q1 acquisition of Fuhu and Sproutling, where we are aggressively pursuing cost savings opportunities across the company to absorb the bulk of overhead from those acquisitions. This change in the treatment of MEGA amortization does not impact reported SG&A.
Finally, looking beyond this year of transition. In addition to the ongoing brand momentum and new initiatives that Richard covered, we expect 2017 to benefit as we leverage Fuhu and Sproutling technology platforms across our portfolio and expand our market opportunities. We also have a tailwind on the top line revenues from Cars 3 movie and continued traction in China, Russia and other emerging markets. Further, we have a strong revenue pipeline for growth in 2018 with our entertainment lineup of Toy Story 4 and Jurassic World. As we previously stated, we continue to see an ability to approach more normal operating margins in 2017 and beyond.
Overall, we view the second quarter results positively and continue to focus on the turnaround and setting up the business for sales and profit growth in 2017 and beyond. We look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the rest of the year.

This year, I think really in particular that the Shopkins brand has been very successful. It continues to be a trend, particularly in the small doll category that is capturing girls' attention. Clearly, we're competing now with the Disney Princess franchise. But in particular, I would say the strength of the Barbie brand and its renewed positioning, the additional marketing and merchandising and execution that we've done to get that brand to be more culturally relevant has seen a resurgence, and we're feeling confident with our plans on that brand in particular. As I mentioned, of course, Monster High, we have a lot of programs in place in the back half. It still remains, as I mentioned again, the second-largest fashion doll business in the world. I continue to be bullish on the brand as intellectual property as engagement remains consistent and in fact, increasing as we get more pronounced in digital apps and storytelling, our websites and entertainment continue to attract girls. And last but not least, we're really pleased with My Mini Mixie Q's as an early start going after, if you will, the small doll collectible space. That is obviously a trend in the market. So overall, feeling confident of our positioning in the portfolio. And as we continue to extend the DC Super Hero Girls line out to the mass markets, we think that we've got a great lineup for the back half."

But at this point, we believe that mix will be a bit more challenging to the full year. That said, we expect to see incremental sequential improvement in gross margin in the second half. As I said in my prepared remarks that to achieve that, we need a 50% gross margin for the balance of the year. That's consistent with what we delivered in 2015. And you look at what's going to drive it, I think sequentially, in the third quarter, we're going to see a step up consistent with our historical averages of about 300 basis points. And the biggest driver to that is really the scale of our business. The third quarter is twice the size in general of the first quarter -- I mean, first and second quarter separately. And then I think also as we talked about and Chris mentioned, we see less of a headwind in ForEx. We see mix getting slightly better in the third quarter. And then also we see the cost savings flow through in the third quarter that we achieved in manufacturing in the second quarter because it's about 1 lag -- 1-quarter lag in production in the time we sell it and also our other cost savings initiatives that impact gross margins. And then in the fourth quarter, we see getting back to the historical levels. And the biggest driver of that incrementally is better mix as a result of -- as Richard just said, we see in the holiday season our doll portfolio performing better, Barbie, DC Super Heroes and American Girl, and that's going to be the biggest driver to increase sequentially gross margins in the fourth quarter. Along -- again, we'll see more flow-through of supply chain savings and other cost savings initiatives around the company."

At the same time that we are losing some shelf space, we are also seeing some traction in a concentrated effort on the core characters. Our new mini collectibles are obviously gaining traction, as I mentioned, and there's some other products in there that is giving us great encouragement to believe that actually, as the brand resets itself with new product offerings, that POS will be commensurate.

Thanks, Martin, and welcome, everyone. I'd like to thank you all for joining us. Today, I'm going to lead things off with a brief perspective on the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as usual, as Martin indicated, we'll open things up at the end for any questions that you might have.
So let me begin by saying that overall we're very encouraged by the quarter, which reflected some continuing progress on our turnaround, and importantly, kept us on track to deliver on our challenging 2016 top line objectives. We also made good progress against our cost reduction goals, both in cost of goods and in SG&A. Now as you know, our biggest executional challenge this year is to offset the loss of Disney Princess, and despite continuing foreign exchange headwinds, our Q2 and first half results show that we've made great strides in this area. We continue to see positive and improving trends globally in our consumer takeaway and our shipping is aligning with this favorable trend. Encouragingly, we're also seeing some very solid performance in some of our key core brands, with a strong uptick in Barbie and continuing strength in Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels. We're also getting some excellent traction in our Toy Box with our games and entertainment properties and with MEGA Brands. Now supporting these favorable trends, our focus on strengthening our brands with more effective positionings, advertising and more competitive pricing and our rapid push in emerging markets is proving successful. We're also executing well and we're doing so broadly across much of our customer base. In addition, we're quite gratified by the continued strengthening of our licensing partnerships, exemplified by our recent announcements with Universal on Fast & Furious and the Jurassic World franchise, both of which will give us some excellent opportunities to accelerate growth in 2017 and beyond.
Now as for the middle of the P&L, we also made good progress this quarter, and we do remain on track to deliver on our cost targets. Our work to streamline and prioritize SG&A spending is progressing well. We're also capturing some significant supply chain efficiencies and cost savings. Now the offsets, of course, continue to be negative foreign exchange and unfavorable shifts in our brand mix, which are pressuring our gross margins. And we'd expect these factors to remain a challenge as we navigate through the balance of the year. Kevin is going to provide some more perspective on both of these subjects shortly.
So to sum up the quarter, it's a very good progress and on many fronts, and particularly against the difficult backdrop and some strong external headwinds. Looking ahead, the picture for the year is largely the same as what we’ve previously outlined, with perhaps a few moderate puts and takes and our momentum is setting up extremely well for the future. We expect the year-to-date positive trends in POS and shipping to continue, and we expect to see improving flow-through on many of our cost savings initiatives. We also expect foreign exchange impacts will begin to moderate somewhat, offset partially, of course, by mix, which will remain a challenge. So overall, our strategies are gaining traction and are helping us to drive the top line, to rightsize our cost structure and to fund investments in brand building, commercial excellence and emerging market expansion. We're also managing our balance sheet well, and we're continuing to fund our dividend.
So in summary, I have remained optimistic about the year. But with the bulk of the year still in front of us, I do want to urge a little bit of caution as we still have a lot of work to do.
With that as a setup, let me turn things over to Richard, who's going to highlight some of our top line progress and our core initiatives. Richard?"
31197,369882619,1009787,"Mattel, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Mattel, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. So as Chris mentioned, this year, we have both the challenge of overcoming a significant revenue gap and the opportunity to position Mattel for growth in 2017.

So as Chris mentioned, this year, we have both the challenge of overcoming a significant revenue gap and the opportunity to position Mattel for growth in 2017. The Q2 results and the effectiveness of our execution throughout the first half of the year are demonstrating our ability to do both. Excluding the year-over-year impact of Disney Princess, global POS is up mid-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date with solid results across the majority of our brands, and comparable sales in constant currency are up high-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date. We have almost completely offset the year-to-date Disney Princess shortfall, reflecting strength across a number of brands, licenses and geographies. This performance is significant in many ways, indicative of our ability and potential to further build momentum into the second half of the year.
So let me briefly touch on some specifics, starting with our core brands. We are pleased with Barbie's resurgence with global sales in constant currency up 24% in the quarter and up 11% year-to-date. This is the result of a return to the fundamentals that make this brand continuously relevant, including a clear and motivating positioning that is inspiring to girls worldwide, very effective execution throughout the organization and growing momentum fueled by increasing cultural significance. Consumer confidence in the brand is increasing. This is evidenced by continued enthusiasm for the new Fashionista line; the I Can Be content marketing; the success of our new younger girl segment, Dreamtopia; stronger brand equity scores; and a sharp uptick in pop-culture references to Barbie. Retailer confidence is also up, demonstrated by increased shelf space. And licensor confidence is building as we renewed our Barbie content distribution agreement with Universal in the quarter. The entire Mattel organization took on the challenge to reset this storied brand and has made tremendous strides in a very short period of time. And with the Barbie team now set up and running, we are obviously gaining traction. In the back half of the year, you'll see us build on Barbie's success across the board as well as deepen the brand's connection with moms worldwide.
Fisher-Price, with the renewed emphasis on early childhood development, continues to grow with global sales in constant currency up 6% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date. Brand progress is largely the result of a concerted effort to build strong valuable relationships with parents worldwide rooted in great product and motivated brand values. We're building on the momentum of the largest Fisher-Price segment, Baby, by engaging with moms in innovative and meaningful ways in the digital space. The brand's very successful Film by You campaign will be enhanced by our new Gold Medal Moments initiative in the fall. In product, we continue to emphasize innovation, creating developmentally forward ideas like our hit Code-a-Pillar for a vast and growing segment of parents who are eager to expose STEM learning early on. We're building fresh momentum in our Fisher-Price Friends line driven in part by new Nickelodeon licenses.
Hot Wheels. Hot Wheels POS and shipping trends continue to be very strong with global POS up double digits year-to-date and sales in constant currency up 9% year-to-date. We expect to build on this in the second half of the year with new and exciting products, some of which we're previewing this week at Comic-Con. And while we continue to build a strong component of the business with our DC Comic, Marvel and Star Wars license, the success of our basic car and play sets should more than offset challenging comps going into the fall.
Thomas POS also continues to be strong with global POS also up double digits in the quarter and year-to-date. Brand strength, particularly in key emerging markets, should continue as we introduce 12 new characters later this year. This impressive new lineup of culturally diverse characters is the most significant evolution of the brand in quite some time and will create excitement, global relevance, enhanced collectibility and numerous other opportunities for the brand.
Monster High, as you know, has persistent challenges. Nevertheless, Monster High remains the #2 doll brand worldwide and a brand with strong consumer engagement. We're seeing some success with new product offerings and scales that are expanding play patterns. Shelf space challenges unfortunately offsetting new gains, but we're working hard to capture those basins. We're looking to reboot this brand in the second half with new entertainment and product offerings that emphasize the core characters and the origin story.
With American Girl, we have strategic plans in place to rejuvenate the brand and achieve its full potential. With these plans focused on the second half, we've not been surprised by the brand's year-to-date performance, where reduced promotions and a shift in spending to the second half negatively impacted sales as we expect a better return on the spending in the second half. The first of these new major American Girl brand initiatives is our recent introduction of Wellie Wishers. We are encouraged with the results so far. While Wellie Wishers provides an opportunity to expand the American Girl experience to a younger girl, we remain committed to older girls and will launch our latest historical character, Melody, this August, look forward to a lot more news regarding American Girl and will be coming out this quarter and next, and we're excited about the strategies in place to provide new ways for girls and their families to engage with the brand.
Now moving on to Toy Box. Licensing is demonstrating continued strength, particularly our Warner Bros. partnership, which will benefit from this week's release of Batman v Superman DVD as well as expanded distribution of our successful DC Super Hero Girl line. As Chris mentioned, Mattel is now a key licensing partner with NBCUniversal for their Fast & Furious and Jurassic World franchises, which will begin to roll out next year. These are exciting wins for us and we believe that this is only the beginning of a much bigger partnership with Universal going forward.
A major focus of our Toy Box capability is developing innovative and insightful category expertise to accelerate brand growth, and we are thrilled with the growth Toy Box is driving for our construction brand MEGA as it gains scale globally. MEGA sales in constant currency are up 22% in the quarter and up 42% year-to-date. MEGA has proven to be a strategic driver of organic growth, expanding play patterns for many of our brands, notably Monster High and American Girl, and we will continue to mine the great potential in MEGA going forward. Invention and brand creation are our other key priorities at Toy Box and these are areas emphasized in the last year. Our latest invention is a new brand called My Mini Mixie Q's, a highly differentiated execution into the growing mini collector figure market that demonstrates our new speed-to-market capability and our expertise in girl play. We're pleased with the strong early reads and I look forward to updating you on future calls.
Now as we move toward the most significant part of the year, I'm encouraged with our progress, the growing traction for our brands and our significant wins in license partnerships. Significant challenges remain, but we are meeting these head-on while we create major new opportunities for growth. We said our success this year will largely be a function of Mattel's ability to overcome a unique and significant revenue gap. We're increasingly confident that we have the momentum to do just that given the alignment of a very talented organization and the continued strong performance of key core brands, Toy Box and emerging markets. We will continue to look to stabilize our business this year and create the solid foundation for growth in 2017 and beyond.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin?"
31197,369882619,1009787,"Mattel, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Mattel, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone.

As Chris and Richard said, despite the impact of foreign exchange, we continue to execute well on our top line, and we made significant progress in our cost savings programs, which help offset some of the ForEx headwinds in the middle of the P&L. As a result, our overall performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter and the first half. Before going into some of the details, I'd like to remind everyone that unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to gross sales in constant currency in order to provide better visibility into the underlying top line trends. And in order to provide more transparency into the fundamentals of the business, I will also reference some adjusted financial results that exclude certain nonrecurring items related to the acquisitions of MEGA, Fuhu and Sproutling as well as severance related to business transformation and cost savings initiatives. As always, reconciliation to GAAP numbers are provided in our press release and the slide deck.
Also want to take a moment to discuss the impact of Brit exit on our business. Since it occurred so late in the quarter, Brexit had a minimal impact on Q2 results. And assuming the continued uncertainty doesn't further impact financial markets or the consumer economic outlook, Brexit will only have a modest impact on our full year results. Based upon current trends, we believe the negative impact from foreign exchange will be roughly $0.02 to $0.05 of EPS for the year related to Brexit.
Now moving to the highlights and top line trends. Gross sales were down 1% in the quarter in constant currency and down 4% as reported. On a year-to-date basis, gross sales were 1% down in constant currency and down 5% as reported. Gross sales were up in North America and Asia-Pacific, with Latin America down 7% and Europe down slightly at 2%. Finally, on a year-to-date basis, we continue to see strong growth in key emerging markets like China and Russia. And as Richard mentioned, the underlying trends look even more favorable when we exclude Disney Princess, and we remain quite confident that we'll achieve our full year goal of relatively flat net sales in constant currency.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. While we continue to invest in retail promotions and work more closely with the retail consumers in support of our ongoing turnaround efforts, sales adjustments were 9.1% in the quarter versus 9.8% in the prior period. Year-to-date sales adjustments were 9.3% versus 9.7% as we continue to see positive POS trends in our core brands and Toy Box. Our reported gross margin in the second quarter were 45.3%, with ForEx once again the major driver of the decline. If the year-over-year impact of foreign exchange is excluded, our gross margin rate was relatively flat to Q2 2015.
The other key driver of decline in gross margin rate in the quarter was mix, with a strong growth and profitable at lower-margin brands like MEGA and Fisher-Price and a shift away from our higher-margin doll business. Overall, the negative impact of foreign exchange and mix was partially offset by our cost savings initiatives and the strategic pricing of our 2016 product line.
Moving beyond gross margin, advertising was lower as we continue to move closer to 12% for the full year coupled with the benefit from foreign exchange. We also remain disciplined in SG&A, with adjusted SG&A being down by approximately $17 million or 5% in the quarter and down by $43 million or 6% year-to-date. These results were due in part to cost saving initiatives which more than offset expected wage inflation. As described in the slide deck and the company's earnings release, please note that we now include MEGA acquisition-related amortization expenses in our adjusted SG&A numbers. Importantly, we're still on track to deliver at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range for our 2-year funding the future cost savings program. We delivered approximately $31 million of gross savings in Q2 and $77 million year-to-date. Finally, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was a negative $0.02 per share or negative $0.06 per share as reported.
As it relates to our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the first half of the year with $318 million of cash. This was in line with our expectations and reflects solid performance as we continue to tightly manage working capital. Not surprisingly, owned inventory on balance sheet was up year-over-year as we position the business to deliver in the second half. Finally, we continue to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining the dividend. As we've said, dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business, and the board declared a third quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the third quarter of 2015.
As many of you know, we have some debt coming due this year. Given current rates, we plan to refinance the $300 million of senior unsecured debt that is maturing in November of 2016. So overall, our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect to end the year with cash of $800 million to $1 billion.
One final note regarding foreign exchange. Given the significant volatility in foreign exchange rates over the past 18 months, we recently conducted a thorough review of our approach to quantifying their impact at each element of our P&L. As a result of these efforts, we reclassified some forecasted foreign exchange benefits that were previously embedded in product cost. Importantly, this reclassification does not change our total gross margin expectations for the year or our Funding Our Future cost savings targets. However, it does result in a moderately lower ForEx impact on margins and earnings. For the full year, we now expect the negative impact of foreign exchange in net sales would be to 2% to 4%, and EPS will be at the low end of our original $0.30 to $0.40 per share outlook when you include the impact of recent events like Brit exit.
Looking forward and summarizing our current 2016 outlook, we're still targeting relatively flat net sales in constant currency for the year. Similar to last year, we expect second half sales to be more weighted to Q4 due to the timing of our promotional efforts and our marketing spend, the timing of new product and distribution initiatives and how retailers are likely to tightly manage the inventory leading up to the holiday season.
And as Chris mentioned, while we expect the negative impact of currency to be less in the back half of the year, we see additional challenges, primarily mix, continuing. While these challenges will partially offset by strategic pricing, supply chain efficiencies and cost savings initiatives, we recognize we'll likely come up a bit short to our 2016 gross margin outlook. At this point, we believe gross margins for the full year will be around 48.5%, with ForEx headwinds and mix driving the majority of the decline. However, with additional sales volume, improved mix and more cost savings dropped in the bottom line, we expect gross margins will improve sequentially in the second half of the year. That means the second half gross margin about 50%, which is roughly equivalent to what we achieved in the second half of 2015. More specifically, for the third quarter, we expect a step up in margin versus the second quarter to be similar to our historical averages of around 300 basis points, driven by the seasonal scale of our revenues relative to the second quarter, less headwind from foreign exchange, slightly better mix and incremental supply chain and other cost savings initiatives. We expect the fourth quarter gross margin to be in line with our historical averages. The expected improvement over Q3 will be driven by our girls' properties gaining momentum, less impact of Disney Princess and we get incremental flow-through from our supply chain and other cost savings initiatives. Finally, it's important to mention that our long-term objective remains to achieve about 50% gross margins in the future.
Shifting to SG&A. While the impact of including MEGA amortization to adjusted SG&A increases the 2015 SG&A base to $1.465 billion, we continue to target adjusted SG&A to be down $55 million to $65 million versus last year's $1.448 billion adjusted SG&A baseline. The year-over-year impact of adding the MEGA amortization back into adjusted SG&A is $9 million. This target reflects the full absorption of overhead related to the Q1 acquisition of Fuhu and Sproutling, where we are aggressively pursuing cost savings opportunities across the company to absorb the bulk of overhead from those acquisitions. This change in the treatment of MEGA amortization does not impact reported SG&A.
Finally, looking beyond this year of transition. In addition to the ongoing brand momentum and new initiatives that Richard covered, we expect 2017 to benefit as we leverage Fuhu and Sproutling technology platforms across our portfolio and expand our market opportunities. We also have a tailwind on the top line revenues from Cars 3 movie and continued traction in China, Russia and other emerging markets. Further, we have a strong revenue pipeline for growth in 2018 with our entertainment lineup of Toy Story 4 and Jurassic World. As we previously stated, we continue to see an ability to approach more normal operating margins in 2017 and beyond.
Overall, we view the second quarter results positively and continue to focus on the turnaround and setting up the business for sales and profit growth in 2017 and beyond. We look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the rest of the year.

As I mentioned, of course, Monster High, we have a lot of programs in place in the back half. It still remains, as I mentioned again, the second-largest fashion doll business in the world. I continue to be bullish on the brand as intellectual property as engagement remains consistent and in fact, increasing as we get more pronounced in digital apps and storytelling, our websites and entertainment continue to attract girls.

But at this point, we believe that mix will be a bit more challenging to the full year. That said, we expect to see incremental sequential improvement in gross margin in the second half. As I said in my prepared remarks that to achieve that, we need a 50% gross margin for the balance of the year. That's consistent with what we delivered in 2015. And you look at what's going to drive it, I think sequentially, in the third quarter, we're going to see a step up consistent with our historical averages of about 300 basis points. And the biggest driver to that is really the scale of our business. The third quarter is twice the size in general of the first quarter -- I mean, first and second quarter separately. And then I think also as we talked about and Chris mentioned, we see less of a headwind in ForEx. We see mix getting slightly better in the third quarter. And then also we see the cost savings flow through in the third quarter that we achieved in manufacturing in the second quarter because it's about 1 lag -- 1-quarter lag in production in the time we sell it and also our other cost savings initiatives that impact gross margins. And then in the fourth quarter, we see getting back to the historical levels. And the biggest driver of that incrementally is better mix as a result of -- as Richard just said, we see in the holiday season our doll portfolio performing better, Barbie, DC Super Heroes and American Girl, and that's going to be the biggest driver to increase sequentially gross margins in the fourth quarter. Along -- again, we'll see more flow-through of supply chain savings and other cost savings initiatives around the company."

In addition to that, in the fourth quarter, particularly during the holiday period, a lot of the space increments are out-of-aisle placement.

In addition to that, which we kind of classify more as the fashion segment of our business, as you know, we introduced a new segment to the younger girl called Dreamtopia, which has a lineup of both doll and accessory along with content and various other forms of IP extensions that has resonated incredibly well. In fact, the younger girl segment of our business is growing exponentially much faster than we had anticipated. We're really pleased with Dreamtopia's connectivity.

Much of the retail decision consumers make is actually in the aisle. That being said, as you know, we took a strategic direction to edit the character assortment that we had in Monster High, which was a strategic intent. At the same time that we are losing some shelf space, we are also seeing some traction in a concentrated effort on the core characters. Our new mini collectibles are obviously gaining traction, as I mentioned, and there's some other products in there that is giving us great encouragement to believe that actually, as the brand resets itself with new product offerings, that POS will be commensurate. Again, we are putting a lot on the back half ultimately with the reboot of the content strategy, which sort of talks to the origins of the brand again. We are introducing the brand to a whole new generation of girls, frankly, which is an opportunity that we have in our business that's particularly unique. And we're pretty confident that our -- the brand is resonating with consumer engagement and connectivity. We just need to get that connectivity back to merchandising. And certainly, once we get that POS back on track, you could be sure that we will aggressively pursue commensurate space."

Thanks for joining us today. Now as usual, I will lead things off with a brief perspective on the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as Martin poi",649,"Thank you, Martin, and welcome, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. Now as usual, I will lead things off with a brief perspective on the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as Martin pointed out, we'll open things up at the end for any questions that you might have. 
All right. So let me begin by saying that in the quarter, we continued to make some very good progress across all of our strategic priorities. We were especially encouraged by the momentum of our top line, where our positive consumer takeaway is aligning nicely with shipping. This increases our confidence as we get set for the holiday season and as we look to deliver on our challenging 2016 topline objectives. 
Now also encouraging is the fact that our positive top line results were very broad based. We continue to see real strength in our core brands with Barbie, Fisher-Price, Thomas and Hot Wheels all growing. And the results also reflected a number of turnaround initiative at American Girl, including the first full quarter of Wellie Wishers; the initial set of our expand distribution strategy; and the signing of a new international licensing opportunity. We also saw some excellent traction in our Toy Box with our games and entertainment properties and with MEGA Brands. 
Our geographic performance was also broad based, and we continue to perform especially well in priority emerging markets like Russia and China, markets which are setting up extremely well for continued rapid growth. 
And finally, I'd like to highlight the effect to this of our commercial team, which is performing superbly and making some very real gains in space and merchandising and in building broader strategic partnerships with many of our key customers. 
So on balance, a lot of very good progress and performance, which is helping to drive the top line. 
Shifting to the middle of the P&L. We also made good progress this quarter, and we do remain on track to deliver on our cost targets. We've been realizing some very significant supply chain savings and efficiencies. And despite some very aggressive targets, our efforts to streamline and prioritize SG&A spending are also progressing well. 
As pointed out previously, the offsets, of course, continue to be negative foreign exchange and some unfavorable shifts in our brand mix, which have pressured our gross margins. We expect these factors will remain a challenge as we navigate through the balance of the year. Kevin is going to provide a little bit more perspective on this shortly. 
But to sum up, our third quarter results provide some very solid momentum as we enter the holiday season, and they reflect encouraging progress across many fronts. As we look ahead, the picture for the year is largely the same as what we have previously outlined. We have solid top line momentum that's being aided by great customer support and well-developed consumer programs. Additionally, foreign exchange should begin to moderate some. And we'll continue to push through cost savings to offset any mix effects. We'll also be working to achieve our aggressive SG&A cost targets. 
Overall, I'd say that our strategies continue to gain traction and are helping us to drive the top line, to rightsize our cost structure and to fund investments in brand building, commercial excellence, emerging market expansion and our dividend. 
While we always have to caution that we have a lot of work ahead, with a critical quarter to still execute, I am proud of the progress that we've been making. And I remain very optimistic about the year and our future, something we hope will shed a little bit more light on when we host our Analyst Day event early next month. 
With that, let me now turn things over to Richard to highlight some of our top line progress and our core initiatives. Richard?"
31197,401996505,1057138,"Mattel, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Mattel, Inc.","Executives","All right. Thank you, Chris. As Chris mentioned, we are pleased with the quarterly results as we build solid momentum going into the important holiday season. Our work on core brand positioning, refreshed products and marketing, renewed licensing executio",993,"All right. Thank you, Chris. As Chris mentioned, we are pleased with the quarterly results as we build solid momentum going into the important holiday season. Our work on core brand positioning, refreshed products and marketing, renewed licensing executions and surgical retail execution globally is obviously paying off. Our third quarter results clearly demonstrate significant progress on overcoming this year's revenue challenge, with worldwide gross sales essentially flat at actual and up 1% in constant currency. 
Now as you know, POS is the true barometer of a brand success with shipping ultimately aligning to it over time. And our turnaround efforts focusing on consumer demand creation and better global commercial alignment are clearly gaining traction. 
Excluding the impact of Disney Princess, global POS continues to be up mid-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date, with solid results across the majority of our brands. And gross sales, excluding Disney Princess, are aligned to POS, with sales in constant currency up low double digits for the quarter and up high single digits year-to-date. Our third quarter momentum is very broad based, reflecting continuing and, in some cases, accelerating growth across a number of brands, licenses and geographies. 
So let me briefly touch on some specifics starting with our core brands. And let's start with Barbie, which continues to exceed our expectations, with global POS up in the high teens for the quarter and gross sales in constant currency up 17%. Year-to-date, POS is up high single digits, with gross sales in constant currency up 14%, reflecting increased retailer confidence in the brand as they restock and expand Barbie's shelf space. 
Barbie is playing in an incredibly fast-moving, trend-based business, which requires us to be nimble and act like a leader, but think like a challenger. We knew going into this year that our Barbie strategies had to work almost perfectly, and so far, they have. We're seeing very broad-based performance from the new styling and sculpts in our Fashionistas line to the I Can Be segment that exemplifies the brand's positioning and to our new Dreamtopia line that is capturing the imagination of younger girls. 
Now orchestrating all of this simultaneously is quite an accomplishment, and we are particularly pleased with the significant turnaround in our international results. For the quarter, Barbie's international POS was up mid-teens, and gross sales in constant currency are up 16%. 
Fisher-Price, with its renewed emphasis on early child development, continues to grow with gross sales in constant currency up 8% for the quarter and up 7% year-to-date. Global POS remains solid with very strong POS internationally. 
We continue to build strength in our baby business especially in key international markets, and we're seeing a nice turnaround on our friends business driven by Nickelodeon. 
Hot Wheels, which is likely a concern for some of you this quarter, given the Star Wars comp, continues to do well, with gross sales in constant currency up 3% in the quarter and up 6% year-to-date. POS trends remains solid, with global POS mid-single digits in the quarter and double digits year-to-date. 
Thomas remains strong as we accelerate growth in international markets, with global gross sales in constant currency up 6% in the quarter and up 3% year-to-date. POS remains particularly strong internationally. 
And despite its impressive numbers, as it does remain a top 3 fashion doll brand globally, we continue to have our challenges with Monster High. The new DVD that essentially kicks off the reboot of the brand came out recently and is being supported by product offerings that emphasize the core characters and the origin story. We're watching the performance of this brand closely during the holiday period. And finally, American Girl, where we saw solid turnaround in the quarter. 
While we did see solid results from our recent introduction of the Wellie Wishers line and the introduction of our latest historical character Melody, the third quarter results really reflect the impact of our strategies to expand the brand's distribution. This includes the initial ship-ins to support our new exclusive store-within-a-store partnership with Toys""R""Us; our new retail execution at Kohl's; as well as a new franchise licensing agreement to expand the brand into the Middle East. 
We're very excited about all of the strategies now in place to provide new ways for girls and their families to engage with the brand and look to see continued progress in the fourth quarter. 
Briefly, moving on to the Toy Box. The key driver in the third quarter here is MEGA, with gross sales in constant currency up 6% in the quarter and up 23% year-to-date, primarily driven by continued international expansion. 
Separately, continued success with our Warner Bros. DC universe executions are evidenced by our DC Super Hero Girls results and continuing strong demand for our Batman v Superman products. And the Toy Box organization has also been busy developing and recently sharing with our retail partners a number of exciting new products that will support the strong lineup of entertainment properties coming out next year, including Wonder Woman, Justice League and additional content for DC Super Hero Girls from Warner Bros.; Universal with Fast & Furious and Minions; and, of course, Disney with Cars 3. 
The third quarter results provide a glimpse into the power and breadth of our portfolio and how this organization, when properly aligned and given the right resources, can achieve great things. 
I continue to believe that our success this year will largely be a function of Mattel's ability to overcome a unique and significant revenue gap. Yes, a number of headwinds remain, but we are meeting these head on and moving forward with a lot more confidence and purpose. We will continue to build on our progress and create major new opportunities for growth in 2017 and beyond. 
We're looking forward to continuing this discussion in a few weeks here at Analyst Day at Mattel.  And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin?"

Overall, our third quarter results met expectations, with shipping better aligned with positive POS, which positions us well to execute the fourth quarter and deliver our challenging top line objectives fo",1450,"Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, our third quarter results met expectations, with shipping better aligned with positive POS, which positions us well to execute the fourth quarter and deliver our challenging top line objectives for the year. We continue to focus on managing the P&L, leveraging sales and POS momentum and cost savings initiatives to help offset continued ForEx headwinds and short-term mix challenges. 
Before going further, I want to remind everybody that, unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to gross sales in constant currency in order to provide better visibility to the underlying top line trends. And in order to provide more transparency to the fundamentals of the business, I will also reference some adjusted financial results that include certain nonrecurring items related to the acquisition of MEGA, Fuhu and Sproutling as well as severance related to our business transformation and cost savings initiatives. As always, reconciliation to GAAP numbers are provided in our press release and the slide deck. 
So let's briefly get into some of the details. As Richard said, our third quarter top line result demonstrates significant progress. Third quarter gross sales were up 1% in constant currency and, despite a significant Disney Princess comp, essentially flat on a reported basis. On a year-to-date basis, gross sales are now flat in constant currency and down 3% as reported. 
We did see great sales acceleration in the quarter at our Asia-Pacific business. We also saw sequential improvement in our challenging Latin American business along with very strong growth in key emerging markets like China and Russia. 
And excluding Disney Princess, the underlying trends are even more compelling. Part of the revenue story is due to better commercial execution as we invest with our retail partners to turn a business around. 
Sales adjustments were 9.1% in the quarter versus 9.6% in the prior year. Our reported gross margin in the third quarter came in as expected at 48.5%. 
While ForEx represented less of a headwind than in the first half of this year, it was still the major driver of the year-on-year decline. Unfavorable mix was also a headwind as our less accretive businesses continued to grow at a nice clip. We continue to partially offset these headwinds with strategic pricing and our successful cost savings initiatives. 
Moving beyond gross margin. Much like sales adjustments, our advertising rate was lower in the quarter as we move closer to 12% for the year. And we remain disciplined at SG&A, with adjusted SG&A down approximately $5.2 million or 2% year-over-year for the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted SG&A was down by $48.3 million or 5%. 
Our continuing efforts to aggressively reduce costs, particularly in SG&A, are reflected in quarterly results and are helping to offset the additional SG&A related to our recent technology acquisitions and increased incentive accrual in the quarter, as year-to-date, we are tracking to higher incentive payout as compared to the prior year. 
Importantly, we are still on track to deliver at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range for our 2-year Funding Our Future cost savings program. We delivered approximately $31.4 million in gross savings in Q3 and $108.3 million year-to-date.  
Finally, adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $0.70 per share or $0.68 per share as reported. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the first 9 months of the year with $297 million of cash, in line with our expectations and about equal to last year as we continue to tightly manage working capital. 
As expected, we did issue $350 million of long-term debt in the quarter, which we will use to repay $300 million of long-term debt maturing in November. The additional funds will be used for general corporate purposes. The timing of the issuance is the reason why interest expense for the year will be slightly higher than last year. 
Not surprisingly, owned inventory in our balance sheet was up year-over-year as we position the business to deliver in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, we continue to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining the dividend. As expected, capital expenditures were up slightly, as we invest in incremental diecast capacity to support growth in our Hot Wheels business and labor-saving automation technologies. 
And dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business, with the board declaring a fourth quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Looking ahead, as Chris said, as we enter the fourth quarter, we don't see any significant changes to our full year 2016 outlook. We have a lot of work to do to execute the fourth quarter and our focus remains on delivering operating profit by balancing our top line and managing the middle of the P&L. 
As expected, the unfavorable impact of ForEx did lessen in the third quarter, which we believe will continue. 
And giving our third quarter result, our revenue outlook has not changed. We gained confidence with our results to date and believe we are well positioned to meet our challenging 2016 revenue objective of relatively flat net sales in constant currency. 
At the same time, we will work hard to achieve a full year gross margin of about 48.5%. This continues to be an important area of focus as we still face ForEx and mix headwinds, but we do expect to be in the range of this target. It means that we need to achieve a fourth quarter gross margin rate of around 51%, which is a challenge, but well within the ranges we have achieved in the past. 
The sequential improvement in gross margin is supported by incremental volume, improved mix from stronger trends in our girls properties, with American Girl, Barbie and DC Super Hero Girls; a smaller Disney Princess impact; and by incremental flow-through from our supply chain and other cost savings initiatives. 
Now shifting to the other lines of our P&L. We'll continue to manage both advertising and SG&A to support achieving our operating profit goals. Specifically with advertising, we expect to continue to move to the midpoint of our 11% to 13% guidance. We also expect continued progress on SG&A, likely finishing the year closer to the low end of our $55 million to $65 million savings range for adjusted SG&A. 
As a reminder, we set very aggressive targets here at the beginning of the year, including the full absorption of incremental overheads from our first quarter acquisition of Sproutling and Fuhu, which were not contemplated when we set our original savings targets; and expected higher accrual for incentive compensation, assuming we hit our performance targets. 
So a lot of tightening and cutting on the cost front as we work hard to achieve a full year adjusted SG&A of about $1.4 billion. 
As an additional note on the P&L, I also wanted to remind you of our tax rate assumptions. While the year-to-date tax rate has been positively impacted by some discrete tax items, we still expect our full year tax rate, including discrete items, to be around 21% for 2016 and beyond, assuming no changes in current tax laws. 
Our tax rate, including discrete items for the fourth quarter, is expected to be about 24%. 
And finally, we expect our fourth quarter diluted share count to be slightly above our third quarter of 344 million shares. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We expect to end the year within our targeted range of $800 million to $1 billion in cash as we will continue to tightly manage our working capital. 
Looking beyond 2016, we expect to see ongoing brand momentum, driven by the rollout of new initiatives, continuing tailwinds related our strategic investments in emerging markets, and benefits related to leveraging the technology acquisitions across our portfolio. We also have a tailwind on top line revenues from a much more robust entertainment slate, including the Cars 3 movie in 2017. And as previously stated, we remain diligent in our efforts to approach more normal operating margins of 15% to 20% in 2017 and beyond. And 2018 brings additional revenue and profit growth with tent poles like Toy Story 4 and Jurassic World in our entertainment lineup. 
I look forward to providing more details at Analyst Day in a few weeks. 
In closing, let me repeat what Chris and Richard have already said. We are very pleased with the progress reflected by our year-to-date results. And while we still have a lot of work to do, we believe we are posed to -- poised to deliver a solid holiday season and a solid year for our shareholders.

Our shelf space gains in Barbie are commensurate with our performance with POS. And with performance comes additional space, assuming you have the retail credibility and relationships to get that space. And we are quite pleased with the increments that we have in the back half and with the momentum that we have continue to have all year. We're quite confident that we'll be able to maintain this great trend with the Barbie brand. As you also recall, international was a little slow to catch up to the U.S. as we execute much of our program work in the U.S. first and we're seeing the buildup, if you will, and the election of our programming products and marketing in international that have had some terrific POS results, frankly across the world. And we anticipate that, that will also continue. We're most pleased with the 3 segments that we've been talking about. In marketing, You have Fashionista collection, which, of course, has been used scope and shape; the I Can Be segment, which, of course, is the cover your aspirational segment of the brand that we focus a lot of advertising to mom on; and as I mentioned, Dreamtopia, a new segment to capture younger girls. Not only is the POS has been approved, but also, our brand equity scores have improved significantly and, in particular, with girls of younger moms -- moms with younger girls between the ages of 2 to 5. We've seen the scores jump significantly as they've enjoyed much of a purposeful messages that exemplify the brand's positioning statement. So that's the answer to your first question. As it relates to DC Super Hero Girls, we are thrilled with the early reads and, in fact, it's shaping up to be one of the big fashion doll brands of the year. The programming in place, the content being rolled out, the additional marketing that Warner Bros. DC is working on with Mattel, ensures, if you will, the consistency of this important new girls franchise. And we believe that it will remain in top 5 brand fashion doll business for us in the future and we're really quite excited about it. In addition to that, as you know, Wonder Woman is coming out with a movie in the first half of 2017 and has already a lot of build up around that brand and implications of that entire collection. So we're quite bullish on it."

We can't necessarily guarantee that there will be cannibalization. We're studying the brand and it performance very carefully. At this point, we're pretty pleased with it and we anticipate that it will continue to get some traction.

From a licensing perspective, there's really 2 components to our licensing business. There's certainly the licensing in-business, right, which is Universal, Nickelodeon's of the world where we make a manufacture and market their toys associated with the properties. And as we reiterated that, that has been a big city should focus for us to regain related in that community. And I think it's evidenced by the recent awards, if you will, of some of those properties mentioned. So we're very very bullish around our renewed relationships in the entertainment community and then some extending to Microsoft and other forms of partnership that we're getting really pronounced in. And I would say, we're projecting significant growth over the next several years in that space. And then of course, there's licensing out business or better known as consumer products, where we over the years enjoyed some great business out of our own brands being licensed out. That business, frankly, is a little bit of a catch-up, if you will, to the core toy business. And in particular, the Barbie licensing business, which has generally been a pretty large engine for us of great revenue, margin and profit, is in catch-up mode. And as we see the brand Gateway more traction and relevance particularly on the core side, we anticipate and see the traction not too far behind on the Barbie licensing front. I will say one of the challenges, of course, we have had in consumer products has been Monster High. And that's been certainly a challenge for us as well, although there is some pretty terrific categories out there that maintain traction and continue and we're doing a lot more work in that space as well. Generally speaking again, during our times here at Mattel, if you join us,  we'll certainly have a lot more color to the consumer products business and the strategies we have moving forward."

Now as usual, I will lead things off with a brief perspective on the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as Martin pointed out, we'll open things up at the end for any questions that you might have. 
All right. So let me begin by saying that in the quarter, we continued to make some very good progress across all of our strategic priorities. We were especially encouraged by the momentum of our top line, where our positive consumer takeaway is aligning nicely with shipping. This increases our confidence as we get set for the holiday season and as we look to deliver on our challenging 2016 top line  objectives. 
Now also encouraging is the fact that our positive top line results were very broad based. We continue to see real strength in our core brands with Barbie, Fisher-Price, Thomas and Hot Wheels all growing. And the results also reflected a number of turnaround initiative at American Girl, including the first full quarter of Wellie Wishers; the initial set of our expand distribution strategy; and the signing of a new international licensing opportunity. We also saw some excellent traction in our Toy Box with our games and entertainment properties and with MEGA Brands. 
Our geographic performance was also broad based, and we continue to perform especially well in priority emerging markets like Russia and China, markets which are setting up extremely well for continued rapid growth. 
And finally, I'd like to highlight the effect to this of our commercial team, which is performing superbly and making some very real gains in space and merchandising and in building broader strategic partnerships with many of our key customers. 
So on balance, a lot of very good progress and performance, which is helping to drive the top line. 
Shifting to the middle of the P&L. We also made good progress this quarter, and we do remain on track to deliver on our cost targets. We've been realizing some very significant supply chain savings and efficiencies. And despite some very aggressive targets, our efforts to streamline and prioritize SG&A spending are also progressing well. 
As pointed out previously, the offsets, of course, continue to be negative foreign exchange and some unfavorable shifts in our brand mix, which have pressured our gross margins. We expect these factors will remain a challenge as we navigate through the balance of the year. Kevin is going to provide a little bit more perspective on this shortly. 
But to sum up, our third quarter results provide some very solid momentum as we enter the holiday season, and they reflect encouraging progress across many fronts. As we look ahead, the picture for the year is largely the same as what we have previously outlined. We have solid top line momentum that's being aided by great customer support and well-developed consumer programs. Additionally, foreign exchange should begin to moderate some. And we'll continue to push through cost savings to offset any mix effects. We'll also be working to achieve our aggressive SG&A cost targets. 
Overall, I'd say that our strategies continue to gain traction and are helping us to drive the top line, to rightsize our cost structure and to fund investments in brand building, commercial excellence, emerging market expansion and our dividend. 
While we always have to caution that we have a lot of work ahead, with a critical quarter to still execute, I am proud of the progress that we've been making. And I remain very optimistic about the year and our future, something we hope will shed a little bit more light on when we host our Analyst Day event early next month. 
With that, let me now turn things over to Richard to highlight some of our top line progress and our core initiatives. Richard?"

As Chris mentioned, we are pleased with the quarterly results as we build solid momentum going into the important holiday season. Our work on core brand positioning, refreshed products and marketing, renewed licensing executions and surgical retail execution globally is obviously paying off. Our third quarter results clearly demonstrate significant progress on overcoming this year's revenue challenge, with worldwide gross sales essentially flat at actual and up 1% in constant currency. 
Now as you know, POS is the true barometer of a brand success with shipping ultimately aligning to it over time. And our turnaround efforts focusing on consumer demand creation and better global commercial alignment are clearly gaining traction. 
Excluding the impact of Disney Princess, global POS continues to be up mid-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date, with solid results across the majority of our brands. And gross sales, excluding Disney Princess, are aligned to POS, with sales in constant currency up low double digits for the quarter and up high single digits year-to-date. Our third quarter momentum is very broad based, reflecting continuing and, in some cases, accelerating growth across a number of brands, licenses and geographies. 
So let me briefly touch on some specifics starting with our core brands. And let's start with Barbie, which continues to exceed our expectations, with global POS up in the high teens for the quarter and gross sales in constant currency up 17%. Year-to-date, POS is up high single digits, with gross sales in constant currency up 14%, reflecting increased retailer confidence in the brand as they restock and expand Barbie's shelf space. 
Barbie is playing in an incredibly fast-moving, trend-based business, which requires us to be nimble and act like a leader, but think like a challenger. We knew going into this year that our Barbie strategies had to work almost perfectly, and so far, they have. We're seeing very broad-based performance from the new styling and sculpts in our Fashionistas line to the I Can Be segment that exemplifies the brand's positioning and to our new Dreamtopia line that is capturing the imagination of younger girls. 
Now orchestrating all of this simultaneously is quite an accomplishment, and we are particularly pleased with the significant turnaround in our international results. For the quarter, Barbie's international POS was up mid-teens, and gross sales in constant currency are up 16%. 
Fisher-Price, with its renewed emphasis on early child development, continues to grow with gross sales in constant currency up 8% for the quarter and up 7% year-to-date. Global POS remains solid with very strong POS internationally. 
We continue to build strength in our baby business especially in key international markets, and we're seeing a nice turnaround on our friends business driven by Nickelodeon. 
Hot Wheels, which is likely a concern for some of you this quarter, given the Star Wars comp, continues to do well, with gross sales in constant currency up 3% in the quarter and up 6% year-to-date. POS trends remain solid, with global POS mid-single digits in the quarter and double digits year-to-date. 
Thomas remains strong as we accelerate growth in international markets, with global gross sales in constant currency up 6% in the quarter and up 3% year-to-date. POS remains particularly strong internationally. 
And despite its impressive numbers, as it does remain a top 3 fashion doll brand globally, we continue to have our challenges with Monster High. The new DVD that essentially kicks off the reboot of the brand came out recently and is being supported by product offerings that emphasize the core characters and the origin story. We're watching the performance of this brand closely during the holiday period. And finally, American Girl, where we saw solid turnaround in the quarter. 
While we did see solid results from our recent introduction of the Wellie Wishers line and the introduction of our latest historical character Melody, the third quarter results really reflect the impact of our strategies to expand the brand's distribution. This includes the initial ship-ins to support our new exclusive store-within-a-store partnership with Toys""R""Us; our new retail execution at Kohl's; as well as a new franchise licensing agreement to expand the brand into the Middle East. 
We're very excited about all of the strategies now in place to provide new ways for girls and their families to engage with the brand and look to see continued progress in the fourth quarter. 
Briefly, moving on to the Toy Box. The key driver in the third quarter here is MEGA, with gross sales in constant currency up 6% in the quarter and up 23% year-to-date, primarily driven by continued international expansion. 
Separately, continued success with our Warner Bros. DC universe executions are evidenced by our DC Super Hero Girls results and continuing strong demand for our Batman v Superman products. And the Toy Box organization has also been busy developing and recently sharing with our retail partners a number of exciting new products that will support the strong lineup of entertainment properties coming out next year, including Wonder Woman, Justice League and additional content for DC Super Hero Girls from Warner Bros.; Universal with Fast & Furious and Minions; and, of course, Disney with Cars 3. 
The third quarter results provide a glimpse into the power and breadth of our portfolio and how this organization, when properly aligned and given the right resources, can achieve great things. 
I continue to believe that our success this year will largely be a function of Mattel's ability to overcome a unique and significant revenue gap. Yes, a number of headwinds remain, but we are meeting these head on and moving forward with a lot more confidence and purpose. We will continue to build on our progress and create major new opportunities for growth in 2017 and beyond. 
We're looking forward to continuing this discussion in a few weeks here at Analyst Day at Mattel.  And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin?"

Overall, our third quarter results met expectations, with shipping better aligned with positive POS, which positions us well to execute the fourth quarter and deliver our challenging top line objectives for the year. We continue to focus on managing the P&L, leveraging sales and POS momentum and cost savings initiatives to help offset continued ForEx headwinds and short-term mix challenges. 
Before going further, I want to remind everybody that, unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to gross sales in constant currency in order to provide better visibility to the underlying top line trends. And in order to provide more transparency to the fundamentals of the business, I will also reference some adjusted financial results that include certain nonrecurring items related to the acquisition of MEGA, Fuhu and Sproutling as well as severance related to our business transformation and cost savings initiatives. As always, reconciliation to GAAP numbers are provided in our press release and the slide deck. 
So let's briefly get into some of the details. As Richard said, our third quarter top line result demonstrates significant progress. Third quarter gross sales were up 1% in constant currency and, despite a significant Disney Princess comp, essentially flat on a reported basis. On a year-to-date basis, gross sales are now flat in constant currency and down 3% as reported. 
We did see great sales acceleration in the quarter at our Asia-Pacific business. We also saw sequential improvement in our challenging Latin American business along with very strong growth in key emerging markets like China and Russia. 
And excluding Disney Princess, the underlying trends are even more compelling. Part of the revenue story is due to better commercial execution as we invest with our retail partners to turn a business around. 
Sales adjustments were 9.1% in the quarter versus 9.6% in the prior year. Our reported gross margin in the third quarter came in as expected at 48.5%. 
While ForEx represented less of a headwind than in the first half of this year, it was still the major driver of the year-on-year decline. Unfavorable mix was also a headwind as our less accretive businesses continued to grow at a nice clip. We continue to partially offset these headwinds with strategic pricing and our successful cost savings initiatives. 
Moving beyond gross margin. Much like sales adjustments, our advertising rate was lower in the quarter as we move closer to 12% for the year. And we remain disciplined at SG&A, with adjusted SG&A down approximately $5.2 million or 2% year-over-year for the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted SG&A was down by $48.3 million or 5%. 
Our continuing efforts to aggressively reduce costs, particularly in SG&A, are reflected in quarterly results and are helping to offset the additional SG&A related to our recent technology acquisitions and increased incentive accrual in the quarter, as year-to-date, we are tracking to higher incentive payout as compared to the prior year. 
Importantly, we are still on track to deliver at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range for our 2-year Funding Our Future cost savings program. We delivered approximately $31.4 million in gross savings in Q3 and $108.3 million year-to-date.  
Finally, adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $0.70 per share or $0.68 per share as reported. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the first 9 months of the year with $297 million of cash, in line with our expectations and about equal to last year as we continue to tightly manage working capital. 
As expected, we did issue $350 million of long-term debt in the quarter, which we will use to repay $300 million of long-term debt maturing in November. The additional funds will be used for general corporate purposes. The timing of the issuance is the reason why interest expense for the year will be slightly higher than last year. 
Not surprisingly, owned inventory in our balance sheet was up year-over-year as we position the business to deliver in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, we continue to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining the dividend. As expected, capital expenditures were up slightly, as we invest in incremental diecast capacity to support growth in our Hot Wheels business and labor-saving automation technologies. 
And dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business, with the board declaring a fourth quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Looking ahead, as Chris said, as we enter the fourth quarter, we don't see any significant changes to our full year 2016 outlook. We have a lot of work to do to execute the fourth quarter and our focus remains on delivering operating profit by balancing our top line and managing the middle of the P&L. 
As expected, the unfavorable impact of ForEx did lessen in the third quarter, which we believe will continue. 
And giving our third quarter result, our revenue outlook has not changed. We gained confidence with our results to date and believe we are well positioned to meet our challenging 2016 revenue objective of relatively flat net sales in constant currency. 
At the same time, we will work hard to achieve a full year gross margin of about 48.5%. This continues to be an important area of focus as we still face ForEx and mix headwinds, but we do expect to be in the range of this target. It means that we need to achieve a fourth quarter gross margin rate of around 51%, which is a challenge, but well within the ranges we have achieved in the past. 
The sequential improvement in gross margin is supported by incremental volume, improved mix from stronger trends in our girls properties, with American Girl, Barbie and DC Super Hero Girls; a smaller Disney Princess impact; and by incremental flow-through from our supply chain and other cost savings initiatives. 
Now shifting to the other lines of our P&L. We'll continue to manage both advertising and SG&A to support achieving our operating profit goals. Specifically with advertising, we expect to continue to move to the midpoint of our 11% to 13% guidance. We also expect continued progress on SG&A, likely finishing the year closer to the low end of our $55 million to $65 million savings range for adjusted SG&A. 
As a reminder, we set very aggressive targets here at the beginning of the year, including the full absorption of incremental overheads from our first quarter acquisition of Sproutling and Fuhu, which were not contemplated when we set our original savings targets; and expected higher accrual for incentive compensation, assuming we hit our performance targets. 
So a lot of tightening and cutting on the cost front as we work hard to achieve a full year adjusted SG&A of about $1.4 billion. 
As an additional note on the P&L, I also wanted to remind you of our tax rate assumptions. While the year-to-date tax rate has been positively impacted by some discrete tax items, we still expect our full year tax rate, including discrete items, to be around 21% for 2016 and beyond, assuming no changes in current tax laws. 
Our tax rate, including discrete items for the fourth quarter, is expected to be about 24%. 
And finally, we expect our fourth quarter diluted share count to be slightly above our third quarter of 344 million shares. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We expect to end the year within our targeted range of $800 million to $1 billion in cash as we will continue to tightly manage our working capital. 
Looking beyond 2016, we expect to see ongoing brand momentum, driven by the rollout of new initiatives, continuing tailwinds related our strategic investments in emerging markets, and benefits related to leveraging the technology acquisitions across our portfolio. We also have a tailwind on top line revenues from a much more robust entertainment slate, including the Cars 3 movie in 2017. And as previously stated, we remain diligent in our efforts to approach more normal operating margins of 15% to 20% in 2017 and beyond. And 2018 brings additional revenue and profit growth with tent poles like Toy Story 4 and Jurassic World in our entertainment lineup. 
I look forward to providing more details at Analyst Day in a few weeks. 
In closing, let me repeat what Chris and Richard have already said. We are very pleased with the progress reflected by our year-to-date results. And while we still have a lot of work to do, we believe we are posed to -- poised to deliver a solid holiday season and a solid year for our shareholders.

So the first question related to Barbie in sort of the back half year, our shelf space gains in Barbie are commensurate with our performance with POS. And with performance comes additional space, assuming you have the retail credibility and relation",422,"Sure. So the first question related to Barbie in sort of the back half year, our shelf space gains in Barbie are commensurate with our performance with POS. And with performance comes additional space, assuming you have the retail credibility and relationships to get that space. And we are quite pleased with the increments that we have in the back half. And with the momentum that we continued to have all year, we're quite confident that we'll be able to maintain this great trend with the Barbie brand. As you also recall, international was a little slow to catch up to the U.S. as we execute much of our program work in the U.S. first. And we're seeing the buildup, if you will, in reaction of our programming products and marketing in international that has had some terrific POS results, frankly, across the world. And we anticipate that, that will also continue. Most pleased with the 3 segments that we've been talking about and marketing. You have Fashionista collection, which, of course, has the new sculpts and shapes; the I Can Be segment, which, of course, is the career aspirational segment of the brand that we focus a lot of advertising to mom on; and as I mentioned, Dreamtopia, a new segment to capture younger girls. Not only is the POS been approved, but also, our brand equity scores have improved significantly and, in particular, with girls of younger moms -- the younger moms of younger girls between the ages of 2 to 5, we've seen the scores jump significantly as they've enjoyed much of the purposeful plain messages that exemplify the brand's positioning statement. So that's the answer to your first question. As it relates to DC Super Hero Girls, we are thrilled with the early reads. And in fact, it's shaping up to be one of the big fashion doll brands of the year. The programming in place, the content being rolled out, the additional marketing that Warner Bros. DC is working on with Mattel, ensures, if you will, the consistency of this important new girls franchise. And we believe that it will remain a top 5 brand fashion doll business for us in the future, and we're really quite excited about it. In addition to that, as you know, Wonder Woman is coming out with a movie in the first half of 2017 and there's already a lot of build up around that brand and the implications of that for the entire collection. So we're quite bullish on it."

That piece of communication rolled out in the U.S. earlier, and now, is rolling out significantly around the world.

That said, I think, when you look at increasing the dividend, I think we're really looking forward to get back into over time, which, we think we'll grow into it, that 50% to 60% dividend payout ratio, and get our yield back more in line with the best S&P 500 consumer goods companies."

So I think we're actually doing a great job on the e-commerce side, to be honest with you. And we've continued to invest, obviously, heavily with our brick-and-mortar customers on building out the business there. We're working with them on their omnichannel efforts as well.

As we've said, much of the surgical rework of the brand, in relation to price architecture, products, marketing and even in-store execution services and so forth, really should start to take hold in the back 6 weeks, 8 weeks of that year. Wellie Wishers certainly is a major new introduction on the brand at a price point, in particular, and a fresh aesthetic appealing to a younger girl. We can't necessarily guarantee that there won't be cannibalization. We're studying the brand and its performance very carefully. At this point, we're pretty pleased with it, and we anticipate that will continue to get some traction. As Chris mentioned, a lot of the marketing and new content that we're launching with American Girl is yet to be seen. In fact, this week, we've got episode for Wellie Wishers, Melody. The Girl of the Year character is going to come out the beginning of next week, I believe. At the end of November, we have Maryellen, which is also another character that Amazon is going to be featuring. So we anticipate that sort of in the next couple of months, we'll see a nice rebound, if you will, on the overall franchise. And early days on our brand extension reads, but we continue to be pretty excited and pleased, not only from a volume perspective, but frankly, exposing the brand to new audiences in new ways through these partners that have been carefully crafted strategically with the brand group and our retail partners. So we'll have a lot more to update you on the results, of course. And perhaps, when you're out here, we can give you more detail at the Analyst Day."

There's certainly the licensing-in business, right, which is Disneys, Universals, Nickelodeons of the world, where we make and manufacture and market their toys associated with their properties. And as we've reiterated, that has been a big strategic focus for us to regain relevance in that community. And I think it's evidenced by the recent awards, if you will, of some of those properties mentioned. So we're very, very bullish around our renewed relationships in the entertainment community and then some, extending to Microsoft and other forms of partnership that we're getting really pronounced in. And I would say, we're projecting significant growth over the next several years in that space. And then of course, there's the licensing-out business or better known as consumer products, where we've, over the years, enjoyed some great business out of our own brands being licensed out. That business, frankly, is a little bit of a catch up, if you will, to the core toy business. And in particular, the Barbie licensing business, which has generally been a pretty large engine for us of great revenue, margin and profit, is in catch-up mode. And as we see the brand gain more and more traction and relevance, particularly on the core side, we anticipate and see the traction not too far behind on the Barbie licensing front. I will say, one of the challenges, of course, we have had in consumer products has been Monster High, and that's been certainly a challenge for us as well. Although there is some pretty terrific categories out there that maintain traction and continuity, and we're doing a lot more work in that space as well. Generally speaking, again, during our time here at Mattel, if you join us, we'll certainly add a lot more color to the consumer products business and the strategies that we have moving forward."

Thanks for joining us today. Now as usual, I will lead things off with a brief perspective on the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as Martin poi",649,"Thank you, Martin, and welcome, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. Now as usual, I will lead things off with a brief perspective on the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as Martin pointed out, we'll open things up at the end for any questions that you might have. 
All right. So let me begin by saying that in the quarter, we continued to make some very good progress across all of our strategic priorities. We were especially encouraged by the momentum of our top line, where our positive consumer takeaway is aligning nicely with shipping. This increases our confidence as we get set for the holiday season and as we look to deliver on our challenging 2016 top line objectives. 
Now also encouraging is the fact that our positive top line results were very broad based. We continue to see real strength in our core brands with Barbie, Fisher-Price, Thomas and Hot Wheels all growing. And the results also reflected a number of turnaround initiatives at American Girl, including the first full quarter of Wellie Wishers; the initial set of our expanded distribution strategy; and the signing of a new international licensing opportunity. We also saw some excellent traction in our Toy Box with our games and entertainment properties and with MEGA Brands. 
Our geographic performance was also broad based, and we continue to perform especially well in priority emerging markets like Russia and China, markets which are setting up extremely well for continued rapid growth. 
And finally, I'd like to highlight the effectiveness of our commercial team, which is performing superbly and making some very real gains in space and merchandising and in building broader strategic partnerships with many of our key customers. 
So on balance, a lot of very good progress and performance, which is helping to drive the top line. 
Shifting to the middle of the P&L. We also made good progress this quarter, and we do remain on track to deliver on our cost targets. We've been realizing some very significant supply chain savings and efficiencies. And despite some very aggressive targets, our efforts to streamline and prioritize SG&A spending are also progressing well. 
As pointed out previously, the offsets, of course, continue to be negative foreign exchange and some unfavorable shifts in our brand mix, which have pressured our gross margins. We expect these factors will remain a challenge as we navigate through the balance of the year. Kevin is going to provide a little bit more perspective on this shortly. 
But to sum up, our third quarter results provide some very solid momentum as we enter the holiday season, and they reflect encouraging progress across many fronts. As we look ahead, the picture for the year is largely the same as what we have previously outlined. We have solid top line momentum that's being aided by great customer support and well developed consumer programs. Additionally, foreign exchange should begin to moderate some. And we'll continue to push through cost savings to offset any mix effects. We'll also be working to achieve our aggressive SG&A cost targets. 
Overall, I'd say that our strategies continue to gain traction and are helping us to drive the top line, to rightsize our cost structure and to fund investments in brand building, commercial excellence, emerging market expansion and our dividend. 
While we always have to caution that we have a lot of work ahead, with a critical quarter to still execute, I am proud of the progress that we've been making. And I remain very optimistic about the year and our future, something we hope we'll shed a little bit more light on when we host our Analyst Day event early next month. 
With that, let me now turn things over to Richard to highlight some of our top line progress and our core initiatives. Richard?"

As Chris mentioned, we are pleased with the quarterly results as we build solid momentum going into the important holiday season. Our work on core brand positioning, refreshed products and marketing, renewed licensing executio",993,"All right. Thank you, Chris. As Chris mentioned, we are pleased with the quarterly results as we build solid momentum going into the important holiday season. Our work on core brand positioning, refreshed products and marketing, renewed licensing executions and surgical retail execution globally is obviously paying off. Our third quarter results clearly demonstrate significant progress on overcoming this year's revenue challenge, with worldwide gross sales essentially flat at actual and up 1% in constant currency. 
Now as you know, POS is the true barometer of a brand's success with shipping ultimately aligning to it over time. And our turnaround efforts focusing on consumer demand creation and better global commercial alignment are clearly gaining traction. 
Excluding the impact of Disney Princess, global POS continues to be up mid-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date, with solid results across the majority of our brands. And gross sales, excluding Disney Princess, are aligned to POS, with sales in constant currency up low double digits for the quarter and up high single digits year-to-date. Our third quarter momentum is very broad based, reflecting continuing and, in some cases, accelerating growth across a number of brands, licenses and geographies. 
So let me briefly touch on some specifics starting with our core brands. And let's start with Barbie, which continues to exceed our expectations, with global POS up in the high teens for the quarter and gross sales in constant currency up 17%. Year-to-date, POS is up high single digits, with gross sales in constant currency up 14%, reflecting increased retailer confidence in the brand as they restock and expand Barbie's shelf space. 
Barbie is playing in an incredibly fast-moving, trend-based business, which requires us to be nimble and act like a leader but think like a challenger. We knew going into this year that our Barbie strategies had to work almost perfectly, and so far they have. We're seeing very broad-based performance from the new styling and sculpts in our Fashionistas line to the I Can Be segment that exemplifies the brand's positioning and to our new Dreamtopia line that is capturing the imagination of younger girls. 
Now orchestrating all of this simultaneously is quite an accomplishment, and we are particularly pleased with the significant turnaround in our international results. For the quarter, Barbie's international POS was up mid-teens, and gross sales in constant currency are up 16%. 
Fisher-Price, with its renewed emphasis on early child development, continues to grow with gross sales in constant currency up 8% for the quarter and up 7% year-to-date. Global POS remains solid with very strong POS internationally. 
We continue to build strength in our baby business, especially in key international markets, and we're seeing a nice turnaround on our Friends business driven by Nickelodeon. 
Hot Wheels, which is likely a concern for some of you this quarter given the Star Wars comp, continues to do well, with gross sales in constant currency up 3% in the quarter and up 6% year-to-date. POS trends remain solid, with global POS mid-single digits in the quarter and double digits year-to-date. 
Thomas remains strong as we accelerate growth in international markets, with global gross sales in constant currency up 6% in the quarter and up 3% year-to-date. POS remains particularly strong internationally. 
And despite its impressive numbers, as it does remain a top 3 fashion doll brand globally, we continue to have our challenges with Monster High. The new DVD that essentially kicks off the reboot of the brand came out recently and is being supported by product offerings that emphasize the core characters and the origin story. We're watching the performance of this brand closely during the holiday period. 
And finally, American Girl, where we saw solid turnaround in the quarter. 
While we did see solid results from our recent introduction of the Wellie Wishers line and the introduction of our latest historical character Melody, the third quarter results really reflect the impact of our strategies to expand the brand's distribution. This includes the initial ship-ins to support our new exclusive store-within-a-store partnership with Toys""R""Us, our new retail execution at Kohl's, as well as a new franchise licensing agreement to expand the brand into the Middle East. 
We're very excited about all of the strategies now in place to provide new ways for girls and their families to engage with the brand and look to see continued progress in the fourth quarter. 
Briefly moving on to the Toy Box. The key driver in the third quarter here is MEGA, with gross sales in constant currency up 6% in the quarter and up 23% year-to-date, primarily driven by continued international expansion. 
Separately, continued success with our Warner Bros. DC Universe executions are evidenced by our DC Super Hero Girls results and continuing strong demand for our Batman v Superman products. And the Toy Box organization has also been busy developing and recently sharing with our retail partners a number of exciting new products that will support the strong lineup of entertainment properties coming out next year, including Wonder Woman, Justice League and additional content for DC Super Hero Girls from Warner Bros.; Universal with Fast & Furious and Minions; and, of course, Disney with Cars 3. 
The third quarter results provide a glimpse into the power and breadth of our portfolio and how this organization, when properly aligned and given the right resources, can achieve great things. 
I continue to believe that our success this year will largely be a function of Mattel's ability to overcome a unique and significant revenue gap. Yes, a number of headwinds remain, but we are meeting these head on and moving forward with a lot more confidence and purpose. We will continue to build on our progress and create major new opportunities for growth in 2017 and beyond. 
I'm looking forward to continuing this discussion in a few weeks here at Analyst Day at Mattel.  And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin?"

Overall, our third quarter results met expectations, with shipping better aligned with positive POS, which positions us well to execute the fourth quarter and deliver our challenging top line objectives for the year. We continue to focus on managing the P&L, leveraging sales and POS momentum and cost savings initiatives to help offset continued ForEx headwinds and short-term mix challenges. 
Before going further, I want to remind everybody that, unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to gross sales in constant currency in order to provide better visibility to the underlying top line trends. And in order to provide more transparency to the fundamentals of the business, I will also reference some adjusted financial results that include certain nonrecurring items related to the acquisition of MEGA, Fuhu and Sproutling as well as severance related to our business transformation and cost savings initiatives. As always, reconciliation to GAAP numbers are provided in our press release and the slide deck. 
So let's briefly get into some of the details. As Richard said, our third quarter top line results demonstrate significant progress. Third quarter gross sales were up 1% in constant currency and, despite a significant Disney Princess comp, essentially flat on a reported basis. On a year-to-date basis, gross sales are now flat in constant currency and down 3% as reported. 
We did see great sales acceleration in the quarter at our Asia-Pacific business. We also saw sequential improvement in our challenging Latin American business, along with very strong growth in key emerging markets like China and Russia. 
And excluding Disney Princess, the underlying trends are even more compelling. Part of the revenue story is due to better commercial execution as we invest with our retail partners to turn the business around. 
Sales adjustments were 9.1% in the quarter versus 9.6% in the prior year. Our reported gross margin in the third quarter came in as expected at 48.5%. 
While ForEx represented less of a headwind than in the first half of the year, it was still the major driver of the year-on-year decline. Unfavorable mix was also a headwind as our less accretive businesses continue to grow at a nice clip. We continue to partially offset these headwinds with strategic pricing and our successful cost savings initiatives. 
Moving beyond gross margin. Much like sales adjustments, our advertising rate was lower in the quarter as we move closer to 12% for the year. And we remain disciplined at SG&A, with adjusted SG&A down approximately $5.2 million or 2% year-over-year for the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted SG&A was down by $48.3 million or 5%. 
Our continuing efforts to aggressively reduce costs, particularly in SG&A, are reflected in quarterly results and are helping to offset the additional SG&A related to our recent technology acquisitions and increased incentive accrual in the quarter, as year-to-date we are tracking to higher incentive payout as compared to the prior year. 
Importantly, we are still on track to deliver at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range for our 2-year Funding Our Future cost savings program. We delivered approximately $31.4 million in gross savings in Q3 and $108.3 million year-to-date.  
Finally, adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $0.70 per share or $0.68 per share as reported. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the first 9 months of the year with $297 million of cash, in line with our expectations and about equal to last year as we continued to tightly manage working capital. 
As expected, we did issue $350 million of long-term debt in the quarter, which we will use to repay $300 million of long-term debt maturing in November. The additional funds will be used for general corporate purposes. The timing of the issuance is the reason why interest expense for the year will be slightly higher than last year. 
Not surprisingly, owned inventory in our balance sheet was up year-over-year as we positioned the business to deliver in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, we continue to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining the dividend. As expected, capital expenditures were up slightly as we invest in incremental diecast capacity to support growth in our Hot Wheels business and labor-saving automation technologies. 
And dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business, with the board declaring a fourth quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Looking ahead, as Chris said, as we enter the fourth quarter, we don't see any significant changes to our full year 2016 outlook. We have a lot of work to do to execute the fourth quarter and our focus remains on delivering operating profit by balancing our top line and managing the middle of the P&L. 
As expected, the unfavorable impact of ForEx did lessen in the third quarter, which we believe will continue. 
In giving our third quarter results, our revenue outlook has not changed. We gained confidence with our results to date and believe we are well positioned to meet our challenging 2016 revenue objective of relatively flat net sales in constant currency. 
At the same time, we will work hard to achieve a full year gross margin of about 48.5%. This continues to be an important area of focus as we still face ForEx and mix headwinds, but we do expect to be in the range of this target. It means that we need to achieve a fourth quarter gross margin rate of around 51%, which is a challenge, but well within the ranges we have achieved in the past. 
The sequential improvement in gross margin is supported by incremental volume, improved mix from stronger trends in our girls properties, with American Girl, Barbie and DC Super Hero Girls; a smaller Disney Princess impact; and by incremental flow-through from our supply chain and other cost savings initiatives. 
Now shifting to the other lines of our P&L. We'll continue to manage both advertising and SG&A to support achieving our operating profit goals. Specifically with advertising, we expect to continue to move to the midpoint of our 11% to 13% guidance. We also expect continued progress on SG&A, likely finishing the year closer to the low end of our $55 million to $65 million savings range for adjusted SG&A. 
As a reminder, we set very aggressive targets here at the beginning of the year, including the full absorption of incremental overheads from our first quarter acquisition of Sproutling and Fuhu, which were not contemplated when we set our original savings targets; and expected higher accrual for incentive compensation, assuming we hit our performance targets. 
So a lot of tightening and cutting on the cost front as we work hard to achieve a full year adjusted SG&A of about $1.4 billion. 
As an additional note on the P&L, I also wanted to remind you of our tax rate assumptions. While the year-to-date tax rate has been positively impacted by some discrete tax items, we still expect our full year tax rate, including discrete items, to be around 21% for 2016 and beyond, assuming no changes in current tax laws. 
Our tax rate, including discrete items for the fourth quarter, is expected to be about 24%. 
And finally, we expect our fourth quarter diluted share count to be slightly above our third quarter of 344 million shares. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We expect to end the year within our targeted range of $800 million to $1 billion in cash as we will continue to tightly manage our working capital. 
Looking beyond 2016, we expect to see ongoing brand momentum driven by the rollout of new initiatives, continuing tailwinds related our strategic investments in emerging markets, and benefits related to leveraging the technology acquisitions across our portfolio. We also have a tailwind on top line revenues from a much more robust entertainment slate, including the Cars 3 movie in 2017. And as previously stated, we remain diligent in our efforts to approach more normal operating margins of 15% to 20% in 2017 and beyond. And 2018 brings additional revenue and profit growth with tent poles like Toy Story 4 and Jurassic World in our entertainment lineup. 
I look forward to providing more details at Analyst Day in a few weeks. 
In closing, let me repeat what Chris and Richard have already said. We are very pleased with the progress reflected by our year-to-date results. And while we still have a lot of work to do, we believe we are poised to deliver a solid holiday season and a solid year for our shareholders.

We are at this point in MIP in Cannes working through our international distribution roll-out of the show. And it will air in 2017 and the date will be announced soon. 
It also is a great opportunity for us to highlight that when we started the division called the Toy Box, we reiterated that it was about invention, creativity and the idea of sort of a free flow back to the origins of the company.

And with the momentum that we continued to have all year, we're quite confident that we'll be able to maintain this great trend with the Barbie brand. 
As you also recall, international was a little slow to catch up to the U.S. as we execute much of our program work in the U.S. first. And we're seeing the buildup, if you will, in reaction of our programming products and marketing in international that has had some terrific POS results, frankly, across the world. And we anticipate that, that will also continue. We're most pleased with the 3 segments that we've been talking about and marketing: the Fashionista collection, which, of course, has the new sculpts and shapes; the I Can Be segment, which, of course, is the career aspirational segment of the brand that we focus a lot of advertising to mom on; and as I mentioned, Dreamtopia, a new segment to capture younger girls. Not only has the POS been approved, but also our brand equity scores have improved significantly and, in particular, with girls of younger moms -- younger -- moms of younger girls. Between the ages of 2 to 5, we've seen the scores jump significantly as they've enjoyed much of the purposeful play messages that exemplify the brand's positioning statement. 
So that's the answer to your first question. 
As it relates to DC Super Hero Girls, we are thrilled with the early reads. And in fact, it's shaping up to be one of the big fashion doll brands of the year. The programming in place, the content being rolled out, the additional marketing that Warner Bros. DC is working on with Mattel ensures, if you will, the consistency of this important new girls franchise. And we believe that it will remain a top 5 brand fashion doll business for us in the future. And we're really quite excited about it. In addition to that, as you know, Wonder Woman is coming out with a movie in the first half of 2017 and there's already a lot of buildup around that brand and the implications of that for the entire collection. So we're quite bullish on it."

There's, as I mentioned, the DVD, which is the origin story. There's refreshed packaging and content that is also included this year. We recently announced a partnership with Lady Gaga.

So we'll make that determination when we get to 2017.

As we've said, much of the surgical rework of the brand in relation to price architecture, product, marketing and even in-store execution services and so forth really should start to take hold in the back 6 weeks, 8 weeks of the year. Wellie Wishers certainly is a major new introduction on the brand at a price point, in particular, and a fresh aesthetic appealing to a younger girl. We can't necessarily guarantee that there won't be cannibalization. We're studying the brand and its performance very carefully. At this point we're pretty pleased with it, and we anticipate that we'll continue to get some traction. 
As Chris mentioned, a lot of the marketing and new content that we're launching with American Girl is yet to be seen. In fact, this week we've got episodes for Wellie Wishers. Melody, the Girl of the Year character, is going to come out the beginning of next week, I believe. At the end of November, we have Maryellen, which is also another character that Amazon is going to be featuring. 
So we anticipate that sort of in the next couple months we'll see a nice rebound, if you will, on the overall franchise. And early days on our brand extension reads, but we continue to be pretty excited and pleased, not only from a volume perspective but, frankly, exposing the brand to new audiences in new ways through these partners that have been carefully crafted strategically with the brand group and our retail partners.

From a licensing perspective, there's really 2 components to our licensing business. There's certainly the licensing-in business, right, which is the Disneys, Universals, Nickelodeons of the world, where we make and manufacture and market their toys associated with their properties. And as we've reiterated, that has been a big strategic focus for us to regain relevance in that community. And I think it's evidenced by the recent awards, if you will, of some of those properties mentioned. 
So we're very, very bullish around our renewed relationships in the entertainment community and then some, extending to Microsoft and other forms of partnership that we're getting really pronounced in. And I would say we're projecting significant growth over the next several years in that space. 
And then, of course, there's the licensing-out business or better known as consumer products, where we've, over the years, enjoyed some great business out of our own brands being licensed out. That business, frankly, is a little bit of a catch-up, if you will, to the core toy business. And in particular the Barbie licensing business, which has generally been a pretty large engine for us of great revenue, margin and profit, is in catch-up mode. And as we see the brand gain more and more traction and relevance, particularly on the core side, we anticipate and see the traction not too far behind on the Barbie licensing front. 
I will say, one of the challenges, of course, we have had in consumer products has been Monster High, and that's been certainly a challenge for us as well, although there's some pretty terrific categories out there that maintain traction and continuity, and we're doing a lot more work in that space as well. Generally speaking, again, during our time here at Mattel, if you join us, we'll certainly add a lot more color to the consumer products business and the strategies that we have moving forward."

Now as usual, I will lead things off with a brief perspective on the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as Martin pointed out, we'll open things up at the end for any questions that you might have. 
All right. So let me begin by saying that in the quarter, we continued to make some very good progress across all of our strategic priorities. We were especially encouraged by the momentum of our top line, where our positive consumer takeaway is aligning nicely with shipping. This increases our confidence as we get set for the holiday season and as we look to deliver on our challenging 2016 top line objectives. 
Now also encouraging is the fact that our positive top line results were very broad based. We continue to see real strength in our core brands with Barbie, Fisher-Price, Thomas and Hot Wheels all growing. And the results also reflected a number of turnaround initiatives at American Girl, including the first full quarter of Wellie Wishers; the initial set of our expanded distribution strategy; and the signing of a new international licensing opportunity. We also saw some excellent traction in our Toy Box with our games and entertainment properties and with MEGA Brands. 
Our geographic performance was also broad based, and we continue to perform especially well in priority emerging markets like Russia and China, markets which are setting up extremely well for continued rapid growth. 
And finally, I'd like to highlight the effectiveness of our commercial team, which is performing superbly and making some very real gains in space and merchandising and in building broader strategic partnerships with many of our key customers. 
So on balance, a lot of very good progress and performance, which is helping to drive the top line. 
Shifting to the middle of the P&L. We also made good progress this quarter, and we do remain on track to deliver on our cost targets. We've been realizing some very significant supply chain savings and efficiencies. And despite some very aggressive targets, our efforts to streamline and prioritize SG&A spending are also progressing well. 
As pointed out previously, the offsets, of course, continue to be negative foreign exchange and some unfavorable shifts in our brand mix, which have pressured our gross margins. We expect these factors will remain a challenge as we navigate through the balance of the year. Kevin is going to provide a little bit more perspective on this shortly. 
But to sum up, our third quarter results provide some very solid momentum as we enter the holiday season, and they reflect encouraging progress across many fronts. As we look ahead, the picture for the year is largely the same as what we have previously outlined. We have solid top line momentum that's being aided by great customer support and well-developed consumer programs. Additionally, foreign exchange should begin to moderate some. And we'll continue to push through cost savings to offset any mix effects. We'll also be working to achieve our aggressive SG&A cost targets. 
Overall, I'd say that our strategies continue to gain traction and are helping us to drive the top line, to rightsize our cost structure and to fund investments in brand building, commercial excellence, emerging market expansion and our dividend. 
While we always have to caution that we have a lot of work ahead, with a critical quarter to still execute, I am proud of the progress that we've been making. And I remain very optimistic about the year and our future, something we hope we'll shed a little bit more light on when we host our Analyst Day event early next month. 
With that, let me now turn things over to Richard to highlight some of our top line progress and our core initiatives. Richard?"

As Chris mentioned, we are pleased with the quarterly results as we build solid momentum going into the important holiday season. Our work on core brand positioning, refreshed products and marketing, renewed licensing executions and surgical retail execution globally is obviously paying off. Our third quarter results clearly demonstrate significant progress on overcoming this year's revenue challenge, with worldwide gross sales essentially flat at actual and up 1% in constant currency. 
Now as you know, POS is the true barometer of a brand's success with shipping ultimately aligning to it over time. And our turnaround efforts focusing on consumer demand creation and better global commercial alignment are clearly gaining traction. 
Excluding the impact of Disney Princess, global POS continues to be up mid-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date, with solid results across the majority of our brands. And gross sales, excluding Disney Princess, are aligned to POS, with sales in constant currency up low double digits for the quarter and up high single digits year-to-date. Our third quarter momentum is very broad based, reflecting continuing and, in some cases, accelerating growth across a number of brands, licenses and geographies. 
So let me briefly touch on some specifics starting with our core brands. And let's start with Barbie, which continues to exceed our expectations, with global POS up in the high teens for the quarter and gross sales in constant currency up 17%. Year-to-date, POS is up high single digits, with gross sales in constant currency up 14%, reflecting increased retailer confidence in the brand as they restock and expand Barbie's shelf space. 
Barbie is playing in an incredibly fast-moving, trend-based business, which requires us to be nimble and act like a leader but think like a challenger. We knew going into this year that our Barbie strategies had to work almost perfectly, and so far, they have. We're seeing very broad-based performance from the new styling and sculpts in our Fashionistas line to the I Can Be segment that exemplifies the brand's positioning and to our new Dreamtopia line that is capturing the imagination of younger girls. 
Now orchestrating all of this simultaneously is quite an accomplishment, and we are particularly pleased with the significant turnaround in our international results. For the quarter, Barbie's international POS was up mid-teens, and gross sales in constant currency are up 16%. 
Fisher-Price, with its renewed emphasis on early child development, continues to grow with gross sales in constant currency up 8% for the quarter and up 7% year-to-date. Global POS remains solid with very strong POS internationally. 
We continue to build strength in our baby business, especially in key international markets, and we're seeing a nice turnaround on our friends business driven by Nickelodeon. 
Hot Wheels, which is likely a concern for some of you this quarter given the Star Wars comp, continues to do well, with gross sales in constant currency up 3% in the quarter and up 6% year-to-date. POS trends remain solid, with global POS mid-single digits in the quarter and double digits year-to-date. 
Thomas remains strong as we accelerate growth in international markets, with global gross sales in constant currency up 6% in the quarter and up 3% year-to-date. POS remains particularly strong internationally. 
And despite its impressive numbers, as it does remain a top 3 fashion doll brand globally, we continue to have our challenges with Monster High. The new DVD that essentially kicks off the reboot of the brand came out recently and is being supported by product offerings that emphasize the core characters and the origin story. We're watching the performance of this brand closely during the holiday period. 
And finally, American Girl, where we saw solid turnaround in the quarter. 
While we did see solid results from our recent introduction of the Wellie Wishers line and the introduction of our latest historical character Melody, the third quarter results really reflect the impact of our strategies to expand the brand's distribution. This includes the initial ship-ins to support our new exclusive store-within-a-store partnership with Toys""R""Us, our new retail execution at Kohl's as well as a new franchise licensing agreement to expand the brand into the Middle East. 
We're very excited about all of the strategies now in place to provide new ways for girls and their families to engage with the brand and look to see continued progress in the fourth quarter. 
Briefly moving on to the Toy Box. The key driver in the third quarter here is MEGA, with gross sales in constant currency up 6% in the quarter and up 23% year-to-date, primarily driven by continued international expansion. 
Separately, continued success with our Warner Bros. DC Universe executions are evidenced by our DC Super Hero Girls results and continuing strong demand for our Batman v Superman products. And the Toy Box organization has also been busy developing and recently sharing with our retail partners a number of exciting new products that will support the strong lineup of entertainment properties coming out next year, including Wonder Woman, Justice League and additional content for DC Super Hero Girls from Warner Bros.; Universal with Fast & Furious and Minions; and, of course, Disney with Cars 3. 
The third quarter results provide a glimpse into the power and breadth of our portfolio and how this organization, when properly aligned and given the right resources, can achieve great things. 
I continue to believe that our success this year will largely be a function of Mattel's ability to overcome a unique and significant revenue gap. Yes, a number of headwinds remain, but we are meeting these head on and moving forward with a lot more confidence and purpose. We will continue to build on our progress and create major new opportunities for growth in 2017 and beyond. 
I'm looking forward to continuing this discussion in a few weeks here at Analyst Day at Mattel. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin?"

Overall, our third quarter results met expectations, with shipping better aligned with positive POS, which positions us well to execute the fourth quarter and deliver our challenging top line objectives for the year. We continue to focus on managing the P&L, leveraging sales and POS momentum and cost savings initiatives to help offset continued ForEx headwinds and short-term mix challenges. 
Before going further, I want to remind everybody that, unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to gross sales in constant currency in order to provide better visibility to the underlying top line trends. And in order to provide more transparency to the fundamentals of the business, I will also reference some adjusted financial results that include certain nonrecurring items related to the acquisition of MEGA, Fuhu and Sproutling as well as severance related to our business transformation and cost savings initiatives. As always, reconciliation to GAAP numbers are provided in our press release and the slide deck. 
So let's briefly get into some of the details. As Richard said, our third quarter top line results demonstrate significant progress. Third quarter gross sales were up 1% in constant currency and, despite a significant Disney Princess comp, essentially flat on a reported basis. On a year-to-date basis, gross sales are now flat in constant currency and down 3% as reported. 
We did see great sales acceleration in the quarter at our Asia-Pacific business. We also saw sequential improvement in our challenging Latin American business, along with very strong growth in key emerging markets like China and Russia. 
And excluding Disney Princess, the underlying trends are even more compelling. Part of the revenue story is due to better commercial execution as we invest with our retail partners to turn the business around. 
Sales adjustments were 9.1% in the quarter versus 9.6% in the prior year. Our reported gross margin in the third quarter came in as expected at 48.5%. 
While ForEx represented less of a headwind than in the first half of the year, it was still the major driver of the year-on-year decline. Unfavorable mix was also a headwind as our less accretive businesses continue to grow at a nice clip. We continue to partially offset these headwinds with strategic pricing and our successful cost savings initiatives. 
Moving beyond gross margin. Much like sales adjustments, our advertising rate was lower in the quarter as we move closer to 12% for the year. And we remain disciplined at SG&A, with adjusted SG&A down approximately $5.2 million or 2% year-over-year for the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted SG&A was down by $48.3 million or 5%. 
Our continuing efforts to aggressively reduce costs, particularly in SG&A, are reflected in quarterly results and are helping to offset the additional SG&A related to our recent technology acquisitions and increased incentive accrual in the quarter, as year-to-date we are tracking to higher incentive payout as compared to the prior year. 
Importantly, we are still on track to deliver at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range for our 2-year Funding Our Future cost savings program. We delivered approximately $31.4 million in gross savings in Q3 and $108.3 million year-to-date. 
Finally, adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $0.70 per share or $0.68 per share as reported. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the first 9 months of the year with $297 million of cash, in line with our expectations and about equal to last year as we continued to tightly manage working capital. 
As expected, we did issue $350 million of long-term debt in the quarter, which we will use to repay $300 million of long-term debt maturing in November. The additional funds will be used for general corporate purposes. The timing of the issuance is the reason why interest expense for the year will be slightly higher than last year. 
Not surprisingly, owned inventory in our balance sheet was up year-over-year as we positioned the business to deliver in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, we continue to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining the dividend. As expected, capital expenditures were up slightly as we invest in incremental diecast capacity to support growth in our Hot Wheels business and labor-saving automation technologies. 
And dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business, with the board declaring a fourth quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Looking ahead, as Chris said, as we enter the fourth quarter, we don't see any significant changes to our full year 2016 outlook. We have a lot of work to do to execute the fourth quarter and our focus remains on delivering operating profit by balancing our top line and managing the middle of the P&L. 
As expected, the unfavorable impact of ForEx did lessen in the third quarter, which we believe will continue. 
In giving our third quarter results, our revenue outlook has not changed. We gained confidence with our results to date and believe we are well positioned to meet our challenging 2016 revenue objective of relatively flat net sales in constant currency. 
At the same time, we will work hard to achieve a full year gross margin of about 48.5%. This continues to be an important area of focus as we still face ForEx and mix headwinds, but we do expect to be in the range of this target. It means that we need to achieve a fourth quarter gross margin rate of around 51%, which is a challenge, but well within the ranges we have achieved in the past. 
The sequential improvement in gross margin is supported by incremental volume, improved mix from stronger trends in our girls properties, with American Girl, Barbie and DC Super Hero Girls; a smaller Disney Princess impact; and by incremental flow-through from our supply chain and other cost savings initiatives. 
Now shifting to the other lines of our P&L. We'll continue to manage both advertising and SG&A to support achieving our operating profit goals. Specifically with advertising, we expect to continue to move to the midpoint of our 11% to 13% guidance. We also expect continued progress on SG&A, likely finishing the year closer to the low end of our $55 million to $65 million savings range for adjusted SG&A. 
As a reminder, we set very aggressive targets here at the beginning of the year, including the full absorption of incremental overheads from our first quarter acquisition of Sproutling and Fuhu, which were not contemplated when we set our original savings targets; and expected higher accrual for incentive compensation, assuming we hit our performance targets. 
So a lot of tightening and cutting on the cost front as we work hard to achieve a full year adjusted SG&A of about $1.4 billion. 
As an additional note on the P&L, I also wanted to remind you of our tax rate assumptions. While the year-to-date tax rate has been positively impacted by some discrete tax items, we still expect our full year tax rate, including discrete items, to be around 21% for 2016 and beyond, assuming no changes in current tax laws. 
Our tax rate, including discrete items for the fourth quarter, is expected to be about 24%. 
And finally, we expect our fourth quarter diluted share count to be slightly above our third quarter of 344 million shares. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We expect to end the year within our targeted range of $800 million to $1 billion in cash as we will continue to tightly manage our working capital. 
Looking beyond 2016, we expect to see ongoing brand momentum, driven by the rollout of new initiatives, continuing tailwinds related our strategic investments in emerging markets, and benefits related to leveraging the technology acquisitions across our portfolio. We also have a tailwind on top line revenues from a much more robust entertainment slate, including the Cars 3 movie in 2017. And as previously stated, we remain diligent in our efforts to approach more normal operating margins of 15% to 20% in 2017 and beyond. And 2018 brings additional revenue and profit growth with tent poles like Toy Story 4 and Jurassic World in our entertainment lineup. 
I look forward to providing more details at Analyst Day in a few weeks. 
In closing, let me repeat what Chris and Richard have already said. We are very pleased with the progress reflected by our year-to-date results. And while we still have a lot of work to do, we believe we are poised to deliver a solid holiday season and a solid year for our shareholders.

We're very excited about our partnership with ABC to launch what is going to be a new toy show television reality series called The Toy Box in partnership with ABC. It will be an exploration, frankly, of the trials, tribulations and excitement around what it means to be a toy inventor and, frankly, the entertaining process that most of the world doesn't get to see of what it takes to actually bring a creative idea to market. So we're really thrilled with the idea of the concept. And certainly, the details of the show will be revealed as the show gets launched in 2017. We are at this point in MIP in Cannes working through our international distribution roll-out of the show. And it will air in 2017 and the date will be announced soon. 
It also is a great opportunity for us to highlight that when we started the division called the Toy Box, we reiterated that it was about invention, creativity and the idea of sort of a free flow back to the origins of the company. And I think the television show named Toy Box is going to do just that, and it represents a new platform for us to find great new product and ideas around the world in an entertaining new way for the consumer and the company."

So the first question related to Barbie in sort of the back half year, our shelf space gains in Barbie are commensurate with our performance with POS. And with performance comes additional space, assuming you have the retail credibility and relationships to get that space. And we are quite pleased with the increments that we have in the back half. And with the momentum that we continued to have all year, we're quite confident that we'll be able to maintain this great trend with the Barbie brand. 
As you also recall, international was a little slow to catch up to the U.S. as we execute much of our program work in the U.S. first. And we're seeing the buildup, if you will, in reaction of our programming products and marketing in international that has had some terrific POS results, frankly, across the world. And we anticipate that, that will also continue. We're most pleased with the 3 segments that we've been talking about and marketing: the Fashionista collection, which, of course, has the new sculpts and shapes; the I Can Be segment, which, of course, is the career aspirational segment of the brand that we focus a lot of advertising to mom on; and as I mentioned, Dreamtopia, a new segment to capture younger girls. Not only has the POS been approved, but also our brand equity scores have improved significantly and, in particular, with girls of younger moms -- younger -- moms of younger girls. Between the ages of 2 to 5, we've seen the scores jump significantly as they've enjoyed much of the purposeful play messages that exemplify the brand's positioning statement. 
So that's the answer to your first question. 
As it relates to DC Super Hero Girls, we are thrilled with the early reads. And in fact, it's shaping up to be one of the big fashion doll brands of the year. The programming in place, the content being rolled out, the additional marketing that Warner Bros. DC is working on with Mattel, ensures, if you will, the consistency of this important new girls franchise. And we believe that it will remain a top 5 brand fashion doll business for us in the future. And we're really quite excited about it. In addition to that, as you know, Wonder Woman is coming out with a movie in the first half of 2017 and there's already a lot of buildup around that brand and the implications of that for the entire collection. So we're quite bullish on it."

So that should exceed the amount that we have to pay the dividend. 
And then with respect to prioritizing that excess cash flow on share repurchases or other investments in the business, I think, again, we'll be looking at that at the time we generate the cash and look at what the best alternative is with regard to investing in emerging markets or investing in buying other brands or actually investing in ourselves and buying back our shares. So we'll make that determination when we get to 2017. 
That said, I think when you look at increasing the dividend, I think we're really looking to get back into, over time, which we think we'll grow into it, that 50% to 60% dividend payout ratio and get our yield back more in line with the best S&P 500 consumer goods companies."

We're -- we've hired some terrific folks in that arena. We're doing, I think, a stellar job with people like Amazon, with some of the big players in China, starting to move around with some of our omnichannel folks in Europe and places like that. So I think we're actually doing a great job on the e-commerce side, to be honest with you. And we've continued to invest, obviously, heavily with our brick-and-mortar customers on building out the business there. We're working with them on their omnichannel efforts as well.

As we've said, much of the surgical rework of the brand in relation to price architecture, product, marketing and even in-store execution services and so forth really should start to take hold in the back 6 weeks, 8 weeks of the year. Wellie Wishers certainly is a major new introduction on the brand at a price point, in particular, and a fresh aesthetic appealing to a younger girl. We can't necessarily guarantee that there won't be cannibalization. We're studying the brand and its performance very carefully. At this point we're pretty pleased with it, and we anticipate that we'll continue to get some traction. 
As Chris mentioned, a lot of the marketing and new content that we're launching with American Girl is yet to be seen. In fact, this week we've got episodes for Wellie Wishers. Melody, the Girl of the Year character, is going to come out the beginning of next week, I believe. At the end of November, we have Maryellen, which is also another character that Amazon is going to be featuring. 
So we anticipate that sort of in the next couple months we'll see a nice rebound, if you will, on the overall franchise. And early days on our brand extension reads, but we continue to be pretty excited and pleased, not only from a volume perspective but, frankly, exposing the brand to new audiences in new ways through these partners that have been carefully crafted strategically with the brand group and our retail partners. So we'll have a lot more to update you on the results, of course. And perhaps when you're out here we can give you more detail on that at Analyst Day."

From a licensing perspective, there's really 2 components to our licensing business. There's certainly the licensing-in business, right, which is the Disneys, Universals, Nickelodeons of the world, where we make and manufacture and market their toys associated with their properties. And as we've reiterated, that has been a big strategic focus for us to regain relevance in that community. And I think it's evidenced by the recent awards, if you will, of some of those properties mentioned. 
So we're very, very bullish around our renewed relationships in the entertainment community and then some, extending to Microsoft and other forms of partnership that we're getting really pronounced in. And I would say we're projecting significant growth over the next several years in that space. 
And then, of course, there's the licensing-out business or better known as consumer products, where we've, over the years, enjoyed some great business out of our own brands being licensed out. That business, frankly, is a little bit of a catch-up, if you will, to the core toy business. And in particular the Barbie licensing business, which has generally been a pretty large engine for us of great revenue, margin and profit, is in catch-up mode. And as we see the brand gain more and more traction and relevance, particularly on the core side, we anticipate and see the traction not too far behind on the Barbie licensing front. 
I will say, one of the challenges, of course, we have had in consumer products has been Monster High, and that's been certainly a challenge for us as well, although there's some pretty terrific categories out there that maintain traction and continuity, and we're doing a lot more work in that space as well. Generally speaking, again, during our time here at Mattel, if you join us, we'll certainly add a lot more color to the consumer products business and the strategies that we have moving forward."
